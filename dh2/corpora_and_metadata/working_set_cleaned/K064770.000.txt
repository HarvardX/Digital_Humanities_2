an essay toward a new theory of vision  by george berkeley m a fellow of trinity college dublin  dublin printed by aaron rhames at the back of dicks coffeehouse for jeremy pepyat bookseller in skinnerrow mdccix  to the right honorable sir john percivale bart one of her majestys most honorable privy council in the kingdom of ireland sir i could not without doing violence to my self forbear upon this occasion to give some public testimony of the great and wellgrounded esteem i have conceived for you ever since i had the honor and happiness of your acquaintance the outward advantages of fortune and the early honors with which you are adorned together with the reputation you are known to have amongst the best and most considerable men may well imprint veneration and esteem on the minds of those who behold you from a distance but these are not the chief motives that inspire me with the respect i bear you a nearer approach has given me the view of something in your person infinitely beyond the external ornaments of honor and estate i mean an intrinsic stock of virtue and good sense a true concern for religion and disinterested love of your country add to these an uncommon proficiency in the best and most useful parts of knowledge together with what in my mind is a perfection of the first rank a surpassing goodness of nature all which i have collected not from the uncertain reports of fame but from my own experience within these few months that i have the honor to be known unto you the many delightful hours i have passed in your agreeable and improving conversation have afforded me the opportunity of discovering in you many excellent qualities which at once fill me with admiration and esteem that one at those years and in those circumstances of wealth and greatness should continue proof against the charms of luxury and those criminal pleasures so fashionable and predominant in the age we live in that he should preserve a sweet and modest behavior free from that insolent and assuming air so familiar to those who are placed above the ordinary rank of men that he should manage a great fortune with that prudence and inspection and at the same time expend it with that generosity and nobleness of mind as to show himself equally remote from a sordid parsimony and a lavish inconsiderate profusion of the good things he is entrusted with this surely were admirable and praise worthy but that he should moreover by an impartial exercise of his reason and constant perusal of the sacred scriptures endeavor to attain a right notion of the principles of natural and revealed religion that he should with the concern of a true patriot have the interest of the public at heart and omit no means of informing himself what may be prejudicial or advantageous to his country in order to prevent the one and promote the other in fine that by a constant application to the most severe and useful studies by a strict observation of the rules of honor and virtue by frequent and serious reflections on the mistaken measures of the world and the true end and happiness of mankind he should in all respects qualify himself bravely to run the race that is set before him to deserve the character of great and good in this life and be ever happy hereafter this were amazing and almost incredible yet all this and more than this sir might i justly say of you did either your modesty permit or your character stand in need of it i know it might deservedly be thought a vanity in me to imagine that any thing coming from so obscure a hand as mine could add a luster to your reputation but i am withal sensible how far i advance the interest of my own by laying hold on this opportunity to make it known that i am admitted into some degree of intimacy with a person of your exquisite judgment and with that view i have ventured to make you an address of this nature which the goodness i have ever experienced in you inclines me to hope will meet with a favorable reception at your hands though i must own i have your pardon to ask for touching on what may possibly be offensive to a virtue you are possessed of in a very distinguishing degree excuse me sir if it was out of my power to mention the name of sir john percivale without paying some tribute to that extraordinary and surprising merit whereof i have so lively and affecting an idea and which i am sure cannot be exposed in too full a light for the imitation of others of late i have been agreeably employed in considering the most noble pleasant and comprehensive of all the senses the fruit of that labor shall i call it or diversion is what i now present you with in hopes it may give some entertainment to one who in the midst of business and vulgar enjoyments preserves a relish for the more refined pleasures of thought and reflection my thoughts concerning vision have led me into some notions so far out of the common road that it had been improper to address them to one of a narrow and contracted genius but you sir being master of a large and free understanding raised above the power of those prejudices that enslave the far greater part of mankind may deservedly be thought a proper patron for an attempt of this kind add to this that you are no less disposed to forgive than qualified to discern whatever faults may occur in it nor do i think you defective in any one point necessary to form an exact judgment on the most abstract and difficult things so much as in a just confidence of your own abilities and in this one instance give me leave to say you show a manifest weakness of judgment with relation to the following essay i shall only add that i beg your pardon for laying a trifle of that nature in your way at a time when you are engaged in the important affairs of the nation and desire you to think that i am with all sincerity and respect  sir your most faithful and most humble servant george berkeley  the contents sect i design ii distance of it self

magmtude and situation of objects also to consider the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch and whether there be any idea common to both senses in treating of all which it seems to me the writers of optics have proceeded on wrong principles  ii distance of it self invisible it is i think agreed by all that distance of it self and immediately cannot be seen for distance being a line directed endwise to the eye it projects only one point in the fund of the eye which point remains invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter  iii remote distance perceived rather by experience than by sense i find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of objects considerably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded on experience than of sense for example when i perceive a great number of intermediate objects such as houses fields rivers and the like which i have experienced to take up a considerable space i thence form a judgment or conclusion that the object i see beyond them is at a great distance again when an object appears faint and small which at a near distance i have experienced to make a vigorous and large appearance i instantly conclude it to be far off and this it is evident is the result of experience without which from the faintness and littleness i should not have inferred any thing concerning the distance of objects  iv near distance thought to be perceived by the angle of the optic axes but when an object is placed at so near a distance as that the interval between the eyes bears any sensible proportion to it it is the received opinion that the two optic axes the fancy that we see only with one eye at once being exploded concurring at the object do there make an angle by means of which according as it is greater or lesser the object is perceived to be nearer or farther off  v difference between this and the former manner of perceiving distance betwixt which and the foregoing manner of estimating distance there is this remarkable difference that whereas there was no apparent necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance or between great distance and a little and faint appearance yet there appears a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance and an acute angle and farther distance it does not in the least depend upon experience but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienced it that the nearer the concurrence of the optic axes the greater the angle and the remoter their concurrence is the lesser will be the angle comprehended by them  vi also by diverging rays there is another way mentioned by the optic writers whereby they will have us judge of those distances in respect of which the breadth of the pupil has any sensible bigness and that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which issuing from the visible point do fall on the pupil that point being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging rays and that remoter which is seen by less diverging rays and so on the apparent distance still increasing as the divergency of the rays decreases till at length it becomes infinite when the rays that fall on the pupil are to sense parallel and after this manner it is said we perceive distances when we look only with one eye  vii this depends not on experience in this case also it is plain we are not beholding to experience it being a certain necessary truth that the nearer the direct rays falling on the eye approach to a parallelism the farther off is the point of their intersection or the visible point from whence they flow  viii these the common accounts but not satisfactory i have here set down the common current accounts that are given of our perceiving near distances by sight which though they are unquestionably received for true by mathematicians and accordingly made use of by them in determining the apparent places of objects do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory and that for these following reasons  ix some ideas perceived by the mediation of others first it is evident that when the mind perceives any idea not immediately and of it self it must be by the means of some other idea thus for instance the passions which are in the mind of another are of themselves to me invisible i may nevertheless perceive them by sight though not immediately yet by means of the colors they produce in the countenance we do often see shame or fear in the looks of a man by perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale  x no idea which is not it self perceived can be the means of perceiving another moreover it is evident that no idea which is not it self perceived can be to me the means of perceiving any other idea if i do not perceive the redness or paleness of a mans face themselves it is impossible i should perceive by them the passions which are in his mind  xi distance perceived by means of some other idea now from sect ii it is plain that distance is in it is own nature imperceivable and yet it is perceived by sight it remains therefore that it be brought into view by means of some other idea that is it self immediately perceived in the act of vision  xii those lines and angles mentioned in optics are not themselves perceived but those lines and angles by means whereof mathematicians pretend to explain the perception of distance are themselves not at all perceived nor are they in truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics i appeal to any ones experience whether upon sight of an object he compute it is distance by the bigness of the angle made by the meeting of the two optic axes or whether he ever think of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to his pupil nay whether it be not perfectly impossible for him to perceive by sense the various angles wherewith the rays according to their greater or lesser divergence do fall on his eye every one is himself the best judge of what he perceives and what not in vain shall all the mathematicians in the world tell me that i perceive certain lines and angles which introduce into my mind the various ideas of distance so long as i my self am conscious of no such thing  xiii hence the mind does not perceive distance by lines and angles since therefore those angles and lines are not themselves perceived by sight it follows from sect x that the mind does not by them judge of the distance of objects  xiv also because they have no real existence secondly the truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to any one that considers those lines and angles have no real existence in nature being only an hypothesis framed by mathematicians and by them introduced into optics that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way  xv and because they are insufficient to explain the phenomenon the third and last reason i shall give for my rejecting that doctrine is that though we should grant the real existence of those optic angles etc and that it was possible for the mind to perceive them yet these principles would not be found sufficient to explain the phenomenon of distance as shall be shown hereafter  xvi the ideas that suggest distance are   st the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes now it being already shown that distance is suggested to the mind by the mediation of some other idea which is it self perceived in the act of seeing it remains that we enquire what idea or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we may suppose the ideas of distance are connected and by which they are introduced into the mind and first it is certain by experience that when we look at a near object with both eyes according as it approaches or recedes from us we alter the disposition of our eyes by lessening or widening the interval between the pupils this disposition or turn of the eyes is attended with a sensation which seems to me to be that which in this case brings the idea of greater or lesser distance into the mind  xvii betwixt which and distance there is no necessary connection not that their is any natural or necessary connection between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes and greater or lesser distance but because the mind has by constant experience found the different sensations corresponding to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended each with a different degree of distance in the object there has grown an habitual or customary connection between those two sorts of ideas so that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceives the different idea of distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation just as upon hearing a certain sound the idea is immediately suggested to the understanding which custom had united with it  xviii scarce room for mistake in this matter nor do i see how i can easily be mistaken in this matter i know evidently that distance is not perceived of it self that by consequence it must be perceived by means of some other idea which is immediately perceived and varies with the different degrees of distance i know also that the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes is of it self immediately perceived and various degrees thereof are connected with different distances which never fail to accompany them into my mind when i view an object distinctly with both eyes whose distance is so small that in respect of it the interval between the eyes has any considerable magnitude  xix no regard had to the angle of the optic axes i know it is a received opinion that by altering the disposition of the eyes the mind perceives whether the angle of the optic axes is made greater or lesser and that accordingly by a kind of natural geometry it judges the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther off but that this is not true i am convinced by my own experience since i am not conscious that i make any such use of the perception i have by the turn of my eyes and for me to make those judgments and draw those conclusions from it without knowing that i do so seems altogether incomprehensible  xx judgment of distance made with both eyes the result of experience from all which it plainly follows that the judgment we make of the distance of an object viewed with both eyes is entirely the result of experience if we had not constantly found certain sensations arising from the various disposition of the eyes attended with certain degrees of distance we should never make those sudden judgments from them concerning the distance of objects no more than we would pretend to judge of a mans thoughts by his pronouncing words we had never heard before  xxi  dly confusedness of appearance secondly an object placed at a certain distance from the eye to which the breadth of the pupil bears a considerable proportion being made to approach is seen more confusedly and the nearer it is brought the more confused appearance it makes and this being found constantly to be so there arises in the mind an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and distance the greater confusion still implying the lesser distance and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object  xxii this the occasion of those judgments attributed to diverging rays this confused appearance of the object does therefore seem to me to be the medium whereby the mind judges of distance in those cases wherein the most approved writers of optics will have it judge by the different divergency with which the rays flowing from the radiating point fall on the pupil no man i believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angles that the rays are supposed to form according to their various inclinations on his eye but he cannot choose seeing whether the object appear more or less confused it is therefore a manifest consequence from what has been demonstrated that instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays the mind makes use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appearance thereby to determine the apparent place of an object  xxiii objection answered nor does it avail to say there is not any necessary connection between confused vision and distance great or small for i ask any man what necessary connection he sees between the redness of a blush and shame and yet no sooner shall he behold that color to arise in the face of another but it brings into his mind the idea of that passion which has been observed to accompany it  xxiv what deceives the writers of optics in this matter what seems to have misled the writers of optics in this matter is that they imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in mathematics betwixt which and the premises it is indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary connection but it is far otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance we are not to think that brutes and children or even grown reasonable men whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration  xxv the cause why one idea may suggest another that one idea may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have been observed to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence or without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist of this there are innumerable instances of which no one can be ignorant  xxvi this applied to confusion and distance thus greater confusion having been constantly attended with nearer distance no sooner is the former idea perceived but it suggests the latter to our thoughts and if it had been the ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object were placed the more confused it should appear it is certain the very same perception that now makes us think an object approaches would then have made us to imagine it went farther off that perception abstracting from custom and experience being equally fitted to produce the idea of great distance or small distance or no distance at all  xxvii   dly the straining of the eye thirdly an object being placed at the distance above specified and brought nearer to the eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the appearances growing more confused by straining the eye in which case that sensation supplys the place of confused vision in aiding the mind to judge of the distance of the object it being esteemed so much the nearer by how much the effort or straining of the eye in order to distinct vision is greater  xxviii the occasions which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it i have here set down those sensations or ideas that seem to me to be the constant and general occasions of introducing into the mind the different ideas of near distance it is true in most cases that diverse other circumstances contribute to frame our idea of distance viz the particular number size kind etc of the things seen concerning which as well as all other the forementioned occasions which suggest distance i shall only observe they have none of them in their own nature any relation or connection with it nor is it possible they should ever signify the various degrees thereof otherwise than as by experience they have been found to be connected with them  xxix a difficult case proposed by dr barrow as repugnant to all the known theories i shall proceed upon these principles to account for a phenomenon which has hitherto strangely puzzled the writers of optics and is so far from being accounted for by any of their theories of vision that it is by their own confession plainly repugnant to them and of consequence if nothing else could be objected were alone sufficient to bring their credit in question the whole difficulty i shall lay before you in the words of the learned doctor barrow with which he concludes his optic lectures  haec sunt quae circa partem opticae praecipue mathematicam dicenda mihi suggessit meditatio circa reliquas quae  sunt adeoque saepiuscule pro certis

hactenus excogitare potui quod adblandiretur animo meo nedum plane satisfaceret vobis itaque nodum hunc utinam feliciore conatu resolvendum committo in english as follows  i have here delivered what my thoughts have suggested to me concerning that part of optics which is more properly mathematical as for the other parts of that science which being rather physical do consequently abound with plausible conjectures instead of certain principles there has in them scarce any thing occurred to my observation different from what has been already said by kepler scheinerus descartes etc and methinks i had better say nothing at all than repeat that which has been so often said by others i think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject but before i quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous dealing that i owe both to you and to truth obliges me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty which seems directly opposite to the doctrine i have been hitherto inculcating at least admits of no solution from it in short it is this before the double unequal glass or concave speculum ebf let the point a be placed at such a distance that the rays proceeding from a after refraction or reflection be brought to unite somewhere in the ax ab and suppose the point of union  i e the image of the point a as has been already set forth to be z between which and b the vertex of the glass or speculum conceive the eye to be any where placed the question now is where the point a ought to appear experience shows that it does not appear behind at the point z and it were contrary to nature that it should since all the impression which affects the sense comes from toward a but from our tenants it should seem to follow that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off so great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance for since if we exclude all anticipations and prejudices every object appears by so much the farther off by how much the rays it sends to the eye are less diverging and that object is thought to be most remote from which parallel rays proceed unto the eye reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a greater distance which is seen by converging rays moreover it may in general be asked concerning this case what it is that determines the apparent place of the point a and makes it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other times farther off to which doubt i see nothing that can be answered agreeable to the principles we have laid down except only that the point a ought always to appear extremely remote but on the contrary we are assured by experience that the point a appears variously distant according to the different situations of the eye between the points b and z and that it does almost never if at all seem farther off than it would if it were beheld by the naked eye but on the contrary it does sometimes appear much nearer nay it is even certain that by how much the rays falling on the eye do more converge by so much the nearer does the object seem to approach for the eye being placed close to the point b the object a appears nearly in it is own natural place if the point b is taken in the glass or at the same distance if in the speculum the eye being brought back to o the object seems to draw near and being come to p it beholds it still nearer and so on by little and little till at length the eye being placed somewhere suppose at q the object appearing extremely near begins to vanish into mere confusion all which does seem repugnant to our principles at least not rightly to agree with them nor is our tenent alone struck at by this experiment but likewise all others that ever came to my knowledge are every whit as much endangered by it the ancient one especially which is most commonly received and comes nearest to mine seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby that the most learned tacquet has been forced to reject that principle as false and uncertain on which alone he had built almost his whole catoptrics and consequently by taking away the foundation has himself pulled down the superstructure he had raised on it which nevertheless i do not believe he would have done had he but considered the whole matter more thoroughly and examined the difficulty to the bottom but as for me neither this nor any other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me as to make me renounce that which i know to be manifestly agreeable to reason especially when as it here falls out the difficulty is founded in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular case for in the present case something peculiar lies hid which being involved in the subtilty of nature will perhaps hardly be discovered till such time as the manner of vision is more perfectly made known concerning which i must own i have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least show of probability not to mention certainty i shall therefore leave this knot to be united by you wishing you may have better success in it than i have had  xxx this case contradicts a received principle in catoptrics the ancient and received principle which dr barrow here mentions as the main foundation of tacquets catoptrics is that every visible point seen by reflection from a speculum shall appear placed at the intersection of the reflected ray and the perpendicular of incidence which intersection in the present case happening to be behind the eye it greatly shakes the authority of that principle whereon the aforementioned author proceeds throughout his whole catoptrics in determining the apparent place of objects seen by reflection from any kind of speculum  xxxi it is shown to agree with the principles we have laid down let us now see how this phenomenon agrees with our tenants the eye the nearer it is placed to the point b in the above figures the more distinct is the appearance of the object but as it recedes to o the appearance grows more confused and at p it sees the object yet more confused and so on till the eye being brought back to z sees the object in the greatest confusion of all wherefore by sect xxi the object should seem to approach the eye gradually as it recedes from the point b viz at o it should in consequence of the principle i have laid down in the aforesaid section seem nearer than it did at b and at p nearer than at o and at q nearer than at p and so on till it quite vanishes at z which is the very matter of fact as any one that pleases may easily satisfy himself by experiment  xxxii this phenomenon illustrated this case is much the same as if we should suppose an englishman to meet a foreigner who used the same words with the english but in a direct contrary signification the englishman would not fail to make a wrong judgment of the ideas annexed to those sounds in the mind of him that used them just so in the present case the object speaks if i may so say with words that the eye is well acquainted with viz confusions of appearance but whereas heretofore the greater confusions were always wont to signify nearer distances they have in this case a direct contrary signification being connected with the greater distances whence it follows that the eye must unavoidably be mistaken since it will take the confusions in the sense it has been used to which is directly opposed to the true  xxxiii it confirms the truth of the principle whereby it is explained this phenomenon as it entirely subverts the opinion of those who will have us judge of distance by lines and angles on which supposition it is altogether inexplicable so it seems to me no small confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it is explained but in order to a more full explication of this point and to show how far the hypothesis of the minds judging by the various divergency of rays may be of use in determining the apparent place of an object it will be necessary to premise some few things which are already well known to those who have any skill in dioptrics  xxxiv vision when distinct and when confused first any radiating point is then distinctly seen when the rays proceeding from it are by the refractive power of the crystalline accurately reunited in the retina or fund of the eye but if they are reunited either before they arrive at the retina or after they have past it then there is confused vision  xxxv the different effects of parallel diverging and converging rays secondly suppose in the adjacent figures np represent an eye duly framed and retaining its natural figure in fig   the rays falling nearly parallel on the eye are by the crystalline ab refracted so as their focus or point of union f falls exactly on the retina but if fig    fig    fig    the rays fall sensibly diverging on the eye as in fig   then their focus falls beyond the retina or if the rays are made to converge by the lens qs before they come at the eye as in fig   their focus f will fall before the retina in which two last cases it is evident from the foregoing section that the appearance of the point z is confused and by how much the greater is the convergency or divergency of the rays falling on the pupil by so much the farther will the point of their reunion be from the retina either before or behind it and consequently the point z will appear by so much the more confused and this by the bye may show us the difference between confused and faint vision confused vision is when the rays proceedings from each distinct point of the object are not accurately recollected in one corresponding point on the retina but take up some space thereon so that rays from different points become mixed and confused together this is opposed to distinct vision and attends near objects faint vision is when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few rays arrive from the object to the eye this is opposed to vigorous or clear vision and attends remote objects but to return  xxxvi how converging and diverging rays come to suggest the same distance the eye or to speak truly the mind perceiving only the confusion it self without ever considering the cause from which it proceeds does constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion whether that confusion be occasioned by converging or by diverging rays it matters not whence it follows that the eye viewing the object z through the glass qs which by refraction causes the rays zq zs etc to converge should judge it to be at such a nearness at which if it were placed it would radiate on the eye with rays diverging to that degree as would produce the same confusion which is now produced by converging rays i e would cover a portion of the retina equal to dc vid fig   sup but then this must be understood to use dr barrows phrase seclusis praenotionibus and praejudiciis in case we abstract from all other circumstances of vision such as the figure size faintness etc of the visible objects all which do ordinarily concur to form our idea of distance the mind having by frequent experience observed their several sorts or degrees to be connected with various distances  xxxvii a person extreme purblind would judge aright in the forementioned case it plainly follows from what has been said that a person perfectly purblind  i e that could not see an object distinctly but when placed close to his eye would not make the same wrong judgment that others do in the forementioned case for to him greater confusions constantly suggesting greater distances he must as he recedes from the glass and the object grows more confused judge it to be at a farther distance contrary to what they do who have had the perception of the objects growing more confused connected with the idea of approach  xxxviii lines and angles why useful in optics hence also it does appear there may be good use of computation by lines and angles in optics not that the mind judges of distance immediately by them but because it judges by somewhat which is connected with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient thus the mind judging of the distance of an object by the confusedness of it is appearance and this confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked eye according as the object is seen by rays more or less diverging it follows that a man may make use of the divergency of the rays in computing the apparent distance though not for it is own sake yet on account of the confusion with which it is connected but so it is the confusion it self is entirely neglected by mathematicians as having no necessary relation with distance such as the greater or lesser angles of divergency are conceived to have and these especially for that they fall under mathematical computation are alone regarded in determining the apparent places of objects as though they were the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind makes of distance whereas in truth they should not at all be regarded in themselves or any otherwise than as they are supposed to be the cause of confused vision  xxxix the not understanding this a cause of mistake the not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing oversight for proof whereof we need go no farther than the case before us it having been observed that the most diverging rays brought into the mind the idea of nearest distance and that still as the divergency decreased the distance increased and it being thought the connection between the various degrees of divergency and distance was immediate this naturally leads one to conclude from an ill grounded analogy that converging rays shall make an object appear at an immense distance and that as the convergency increases the distance if it were possible should do so likewise that this was the cause of dr barrows mistake is evident from his own words which we have quoted whereas had the learned doctor observed that diverging and converging rays how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in producing the same effect viz confusedness of vision greater degrees whereof are produced indifferently either as the divergency or convergency of the rays increases and that it is by this effect which is the same in both that either the divergency or convergency is perceived by the eye i say had he but considered this it is certain he would have made a quite contrary judgment and rightly concluded that those rays which fall on the eye with greater degrees of convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer but it is plain it was impossible for any man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he had regard only to lines and angles and did not apprehend the true nature of vision and how far it was of mathematical consideration  xl a query proposed by mr molyneux in his dioptrics considered before we dismiss this this subject it is fit we take notice of a query relating thereto proposed by the ingenious mr molyneux in his treatise of dioptrics par   prop    sect   where speaking of the difficulty we have been explaining he has these words and so he  i e dr barrow leaves this difficulty to the solution of others which i after so great an example shall do likewise but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doctrine which we have before laid down for determining the locus objecti on account of being pressed by one difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by mortals in the mean time i propose it to the consideration of the ingenious whether the locus apparens of an object placed as in this  th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base is behind the eye to which query we may venture to answer in the negative for in the present case the rule for determining the distance of the distinct base or respective focus from the glass is this as the difference between the distance of the object and focus is to the focus or focal length so the distance of the object from the glass to the distance of the respective focus or distinct base from the glass vid molyneux dioptr par   prop   let us now suppose the object to be placed at the distance of the focal length and one half of the focal length from the glass and the eye close to the glass hence it will follow by the rule that the distance of the distinct base behind the eye is double the true distance of the object before the eye if therefore mr molyneuxs conjecture held good it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really is and in other cases at three or four times it is due distance or more but this manifestly contradicts experience the object never appearing at farthest beyond its due distance whatever therefore is built on this supposition  vid corol   prop    ibid comes to the ground along with it  xli one born blind would not at first have any idea of distance by sight from what has been premised it is a manifest consequence that a man born blind being made to see would at first have no idea of distance by sight the sun and stars the remotest objects as well as the nearer would all seem to be in his eye or rather in his mind the objects intromitted by sight would seem to him as in truth they are no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations each whereof is as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure or the most inward passions of his soul for our judging objects perceived by sight to be at any distance or without the mind is  vid sect xxviii entirely the effect of experience which one in those circumstances could not yet have attained to  xlii this not agreeable to the common principles it is indeed otherwise upon the common supposition that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic axes just as one in the dark or a blindman by the angle comprehended by two sticks one whereof he held in each hand for if this were true it would follow that one blind from his birth being made to see should stand in need of no new experience in order to perceive distance by sight but that this is false has i think been sufficiently demonstrated  xliii the proper objects of sight not without the mind nor the images of any thing without the mind and perhaps upon a strict inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their birth have grown up in a continued habit of seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side viz in thinking what they see to be at a distance from them for at this time it seems agreed on all hands by those who have had any thoughts of that matter that colors which are the proper and immediate object of sight are not without the mind but then say you by sight we have also the ideas of extension and figure and motion all which may well be thought without and at some distance from the mind though color should not in answer to this i appeal to any mans experience whether the visible extension of any object do not appear as near to him as the color of that object nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place is not the extension we see colored and is it possible for us so much as in thought to separate and abstract color from extension now where the extension is there surely is the figure and there the motion too i speak of those which are perceived by sight  xliv this more fully explained but for a fuller explication of this point and to show that the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things placed at a distance it is requisite we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what is meant in common discourse when one says that which he sees is at a distance from him suppose for example that looking at the moon i should say it were fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me let us see what moon this is spoken of it is plain it cannot be the visible moon or any thing like the visible moon or that which i see which is only a round luminous plain of about thirty visible points in diameter for in case i am carried from the place where i stand directly toward the moon it is manifest the object varies still as i go on and by the time that i am advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth i shall be so far from being near a small round luminous flat that i shall perceive nothing like it this object having long since disappeared and if i would recover it it must be by going back to the earth from whence i set out again suppose i perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of something which i doubt whether it be a man or a tree or a tower but judge it to be at the distance of about a mile it is plain i cannot mean that what i see is a mile off or that it is the image or likeness of any thing which is a mile off since that every step i take toward it the appearance alters and from being obscure small and faint grows clear large and vigorous and when i come to the miles end that which i saw first is quite lost neither do i find any thing in the likeness of it  xlv in what sense we must be understood to see distance and external things in these and the like instances the truth of the matter i find stands thus having of a long time experienced certain ideas perceivable by touch as distance tangible figure and solidity to have been connected with certain ideas of sight i do upon perceiving these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are by the wonted ordinary course of nature like to follow looking at an object i perceive a certain visible figure and color with some degree of faintness and other circumstances which from what i have formerly observed determine me to think that if i advance forward so many paces miles etc i shall be affected with such and such ideas of touch so that in truth and strictness of speech i neither see distance it self nor any thing that i take to be at a distance i say neither distance nor things placed at a distance are themselves or their ideas truly perceived by sight this i am persuaded of as to what concerns my self and i believe whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts and examine what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his understanding that after having passed a certain distance to be measured by the motion of his body which is perceivable by touch he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas but that one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense and that there is no necessary connection between visible and tangible ideas suggested by them we need go no farther than the next lookingglass or picture to be convinced note that when i speak of tangible ideas i take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understanding in which large signification it is commonly used by the moderns  xlvi distance and things placed at a distance not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear from what we have shown it is a manifest consequence that the ideas of space outness and things placed at a distance are not strictly speaking the object of sight they are no otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear sitting in my study i hear a coach drive along the streets i look through the casement and see it i walk out and enter into it thus common speech would incline one to think i heard saw and touched the same thing viz the coach it is nevertheless certain the ideas intromitted by each sense are widely different and distinct from each other but having been observed constantly to go together they are spoken of as one and the same thing by the variation of the noise i perceive the different distances of the coach and know that it approaches before i look out thus by the ear i perceive distance just after the same manner as i do by the eye  xlvii the ideas of sight more apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch than those of hearing are i do not nevertheless say i hear distance in like manner as i say that i see it the ideas perceived by hearing not being so apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch as those of sight are so likewise a man is easily convinced that bodies and external things are not properly the object of hearing but only sounds by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that body or distance is suggested to his thoughts but then one is with more difficulty brought to discern the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch though it be certain a man no more sees and feels the same thing than he hears and feels the same thing  xlviii how this comes to pass one reason of which seems to be this it is thought a great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one extension and one figure but the extension and figure of a body being let into the mind two ways and that indifferently either by sight or touch it seems to follow that we see the same extension and the same figure which we feel  xlix strictly speaking we never see and feel the same thing but if we take a close and accurate view of the matter it must be acknowledged that we never see and feel one and the same thing that which is seen is one thing and that which is felt is another if the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible figure and extension we are not to infer that one and the same thing has diverse extensions the true consequence is that the objects of sight and touch are two distinct things it may perhaps require some thought rightly to conceive this distinction and the difficulty seems not a little increased because the combination of visible ideas has constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it is connected which does of necessity arise from the use and end of language  l objects of sight twofold mediate and immediate in order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision we must bear in mind that there are two sorts of objects apprehended by the eye the one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former those of the first sort neither are nor appear to be without the mind or at any distance off they may indeed grow greater or smaller more confused or more clear or more faint but they do not cannot approach or even seem to approach or recede from us whenever we say an object is at a distance whenever we say it draws near or goes farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the touch and are not so truly perceived as suggested by the eye in like manner as thoughts by the ear  li these hard to separate in our thoughts no sooner do we hear the words of a familiar language pronounced in our ears but the ideas corresponding thereto present themselves to our minds in the very same instant the sound and the meaning enter the understanding so closely are they united that it is not in our power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also we even act in all respects as though we heard the very thoughts themselves so likewise the secondary objects or those which are only suggested by sight do often more strongly affect us and are more regarded than the proper objects of that sense along with which they enter into the mind and with which they have a far more strict and near connection than ideas have with words hence it is we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate objects of sight and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter they are as it were most closely twisted blended and incorporated together and the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time by the use of language and want of reflection however i doubt not but any one that shall attentively consider what we have already said and shall say upon this subject before we have done especially if he pursue it in his own thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice sure i am it is worth some attention to whoever would understand the true nature of vision  lii the received accounts of our perceiving magnitude by sight false i have now done with distance and proceed to show how it is that we perceive by sight the magnitude of objects it is the opinion of some that we do it by angles or by angles in conjuction with distance but neither angles nor distance being perceivable by sight and the things we see being in truth at no distance from us it follows that as we have demonstrated lines and angles not to be the medium the mind makes use of in apprehending the apparent place so neither are they the medium whereby it apprehends the apparent magnitude of objects  liii magnitude perceived as immediately as distance it is well known that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a greater angle and at a farther distance a lesser angle and by this principle we are told the mind estimates the magnitude of an object comparing the angle under which it is seen with its distance and thence infering the magnitude thereof what inclines men to this mistake beside the humor of making one see by geometry is that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest magnitude but if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former i say they do not first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude but they have as close and immediate a connection with the magnitude as with the distance and suggest magnitude as independently of distance as they do distance independently of magnitude all which will be evident to whoever considers whathas been already said and what follows  live two kinds of sensible extension neither of which is infinitely divisible it has been shown there are two sorts of objects apprehended by sight each whereof has its distinct magnitude or extension the one properly tangible i e to be perceived and measured by touch and not immediately falling under the sense of seeing the other properly and immediately visible by mediation of which the former is brought in view each of these magnitudes are greater or lesser according as they contain in them more or fewer points they being made up of points or minimums for whatever may be said of extension in abstract it is certain sensible extension is not infinitely divisible there is a minimum tangibile and a minimum visibile beyond which sense cannot perceive this every ones experience will inform him  lv the tangible magnitude of an object steady the visible not the magnitude of the object which exists without the mind and is at a distance continues always invariably the same but the visible object still changing as you approach to or recede from the tangible object it has no fixed and determinate greatness whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of any thing for instance a tree or a house we must mean the tangible magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity spoken of it now though the tangible and visible magnitude do in truth belong to two distinct objects i shall nevertheless especially since those objects are called by the same name and are observed to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech sometimes speak of them as belonging to one and the same thing  lvi by what means tangible magnitude is perceived by sight now in order to discover by what means the magnitude of tangible objects is perceived by sight i need only reflect on what passes in my own mind and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my thoughts when i look on any object and these i find to be first the magnitude or extension of the visible object which being immediately perceived by sight is connected with that other which is tangible and placed at a distance secondly the confusion or distinctness and thirdly the vigorousness or faintness of the aforesaid visible appearance caeteris paribus by how much the greater or lesser do i conclude the tangible object to be but be the idea immediately perceived by sight never so large yet if it be withal confused i judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small if it be distinct and clear i judge it greater and if it be faint i apprehend it to be yet greater what is here meant by confusion and faintness has been explained in sect xxxv  lvii this farther enlarged on moreover the judgments we make of greatness do in like manner as those of distance depend on the disposition of the eyes also on the figure number of intermediate objects and other circumstances that have been observed to attend great or small tangible magnitudes thus for instance the very same quantity of visible extension which in the figure of a tower does suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude that this is owing to the experience we have had of the usual bigness of a tower and a man no one i suppose need be told  lviii no necessary connection between confusion or faintness of appearance and small or great magnitude it is also evident that confusion faintness etc have no more a necessary connection with little or great magnitude than they have with little or great distance as they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our minds and by consequence if it were not for experience we should no more judge a faint or confused appearance to be connected with great or little magnitude than we should that it was connected with great or little distance  lix the tangible magnitude of an object more heeded than the visible and why nor will it be found that great or small visible magnitude has any necessary relation to great or small tangible magnitude so that the one may certainly and infallibly be inferred from the other but before we come to the proof of this it is fit we consider the difference there is betwixt the extension and figure which is the proper object of touch and that other which is termed visible and how the former is principally though not immediately taken notice of when we look at any object this has been before mentioned but we shall here enquire into the cause thereof we regard the objects that environ us in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or injure our own bodies and thereby produce in our minds the sensations of pleasure or pain now bodies operating on our organs by an immediate application and the hurt and advantage arising therefrom depending altogether on the tangible ang not at all on the visible qualities of any object this is a plain reason why those should be regarded by us much more than these and for this end chiefly the visive sense seems to have been bestowed on animals viz that by the perception of visible ideas which in themselves are not capable of affecting or any wise altering the frame of their bodies they may be able to foresee from the experience they have had what tangible ideas are connected with such and such visible ideas the damage or benefit which is like to ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance which foresight how necessary it is to the preservation of an animal every ones experience can inform him hence it is that when we look at an object the tangible figure and extension thereof are principally attended to whilst there is small heed taken of the visible figure and magnitude which though more immediately perceived do less sensibly affect us and are not fitted to produce any alteration in our bodies  lx an instance of this that the matter of fact is true will be evident to any one who considers that a man placed at ten foot distance is thought as great as if he were placed at the distance only of five foot which is true not with relation to the visible but tangible greatness of the object the visible magnitude being far greater at one station than it is at the other  lxi men do not measure by visible feet or inches inches feet etc are settled stated lengths whereby we measure objects and estimate their magnitude we say for example an object appears to be six inches or six foot long now that this cannot be meant of visible inchches etc is evident because a visible inch is it self no constant determinate magnitude and cannot therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of any other thing take an inch marked upon a ruler view it successively at the distance of half a foot a foot a foot and a half etc from the eye at each of which and at all the intermediate distances the inch shall have a different visible extension i e there shall be more or fewer points discerned in it now i ask which of all these various extensions is that stated determinate one that is agreed on for a common measure of other magnitudes no reason can be assigned why we should pitch on one more than another and except there be some invariable determinate extension fixed on to be marked by the word inch it is plain it can be used to little purpose and to say a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more than that it is extended without bringing any particular idea of that extension into the mind farther an inch and a foot from different distances shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times greater than the other from all which it is manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of objects by sight are altogether in reference to their tangible extension whenever we say an object is great or small of this or that determinate measure i say it must be meant of the tangible and not the visible extension which though immediately perceived is nevertheless little taken notice of  lxii no necessary conexion between visible and tangible extension now that there is no necessary connection between these two distinct extensions is evident from hence because our eyes might have been framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were less than the minimum tangibile in which case it is not impossible we might have perceived all the immediate objects of sight the very same that we do now but unto those visible appearances there would not be connected those different tangible magnitudes that are now which shows the judgments we make of the magnitude of things placed at a distance from the various greatness of the immediate objects of sight do not arise from any essential or necessary but only a customary tie which has been observed betwixt them  lxiii greater visible magnitude might signify lesser tangible magnitude moreover it is not only certain that any idea of sight might not have been connected with this or that idea of touch we now observe to accompany it but also that the greater visible magnitudes might have been connected with and introduced into our minds lesser tangible magnitudes and vice versa nay that it often is so we have daily experience that object which makes a strong and large appearance not seeming near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof is much less but more faint  lxiv the judgments we make of magnitude depend altogether on experience from which and from sect lvii and lviii it is manifest that as we do not perceive the magnitude of objects immediately by sight so neither do we perceive them by the mediation of any thing which has a necessary connection with them those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes of external objects before we touch them might possibly have suggested no such thing or they might have signified them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might as well have served to make us conclude it great those ideas being in their own nature equally fitted to bring into our minds the idea of small or great or no size at all of outward objects just as the words of any language are in their own nature indifferent to signify this or that thing or nothing at all  lxv distance and magnitude seen as shame or anger as we see distance so we see magnitude and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the looks of a man those passions are themselves invisible they are nevertheless let in by the eye along with colors and alterations of countenance which are the immediate object of vision and which signify them for no other reason than barely because they have been observed to accompany them without which experience we should no more have taken blushing for a sign of shame than of gladness  lxvi but we are prone to think otherwise and why we are nevertheless exceeding prone to imagine those things which are perceived only by the mediation of others to be themselves the immediate objects of sight or at least to have in their own nature a fitness to be suggested by them before ever they had been experienced to coexist with them from which prejudice every one perhaps will not find it easy to emanicipate himself by any the clearest convictions of reason and there are some grounds to think that if there was one only invariable and universal language in the world and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it it would be the opinion of some that the ideas in other mens minds were properly perceived by the ear or had at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds that were affixed to them all which seems to arise from want of a due application of our discerning faculty thereby to discriminate between the ideas that are in our understandings and consider them apart from each other which would preserve us from confounding those that are different and make us to see what ideas do and what do not include or imply this or that other idea  lxvii the moon seems greater in the horizon than in the meridian there is a celebrated phenomenon the solution whereof i shall attempt to give by the principles that have been laid down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects it is as follows the apparent magnitude of the moon when placed in the horizon is much greater than when it is in the meridian though the angle under which the diameter of the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in the latter moreover the horizontal moon does not constantly appear of the same bigness but at some times seems far greater than at others  lxviii the cause of this phenomenon assigned now in order to explicate the reason of the moons appearing greater than ordinary in the horizon it must be observed that the particles which compose our atmosphaere do intercept the rays of light proceeding from any object to the eye and by how much the greater is the portion of atmosphaere interjacent between the object and the eye by so much the more are the rays intercepted and by consequence the appearance of the object rendered more faint every object appearing more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it sends more or fewer rays unto the eye now between the eye and the moon when situated in the horizon there lies a far greater quantity of atmosphaere than there does when the moon is in the meridian whence it comes pass that the appearance of the horizontal moon is fainter and therefore by sect lvi it should be thought bigger in that situation than in the meridian or in any other elevation above the horizon  lxix the horizontal moon why greater at one time than another farther the air being variously impregnated sometimes more and sometimes less with vapors and exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the rays of light it follows that the appearance of the horizontal moon has not always an equal faintness and by consequence that luminary though in the very same situation is at one time judged greater than at another  lxx the account we have given proved to be true that we have here given the true account of the phenomenon of the horizontal moon will i suppose be farther evident to any one from the following considerations first it is plain that which in this case suggests the idea of greater magnitude must be something which is it self perceived for that which is unperceived cannot suggest to our perception any other thing secondly it must be something that does not constantly remain the same but is subject to some change or variation since the appearance of the horizontal moon varies being at one time greater than at another thirdly it must not lie in the external circumjacent or intermediate objects but be an affection of the very visible moon it self since by looking through a tube when all other objects are excluded from sight the appearance is as great as ever and yet fourthly it cannot be the visible figure or magnitude since that remains the same or is rather lesser by how much the moon is nearer to the horizon it remains therefore that the true cause is that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceeds from the greater paucity of rays arriving at the eye and which i term faintness since this answers all the forementioned conditions and i am not conscious of any other perception that does  lxxi and confirmed by the moons appearing greater in a mist add to this that in misty weather it is a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon is far larger than usual which greatly conspires with and strengthens our opinion neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have said if the horizontal moon should chance sometime to seem enlarged beyond its usual extent even in more serene weather for we must not only have regard to the mist which happens to be in the place where we stand we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapors and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon all which cooperating to render the appearance of the moon more faint and thereby increase it is magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually does even in the horizontal position at a time when though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the place where we stand yet the air between the eye and the moon taken all together may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed vapors and exhalations than at other times  lxxii objection answered it may be objected that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque which may intercept a great part of the rays of light should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it is viewed in the horizon to which i answer it is not faintness any how applied that suggests greater magnitude there being no necessary but only an experimental connection between those two things it follows that the faintness which enlarges the appearance must be applied in such sort and with such circumstances as have been observed to attend the vision of great magnitudes when from a distance i speak with the vulgar we behold great objects the particles of the intermediate air and vapors which are themselves unperceivable do interrupt the rays of light and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid now faintness of appearance caused in this sort has been experienced to coexist with great magnitude but when it is caused by the interposition of an opaque sensible body this circumstance alters the case so that a faint appearance this way caused does not suggest greater magnitude because it has not been experienced to coexist with it  lxxiii the way wherein faintness suggests greater magnitude illustrated faintness as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance does it in the same way that words suggest the notions to which they are annexed now it is known a word pronounced with certain circumstances or in a certain context with other words has not always the same import and signification that it has when pronounced in some other circumstances or different context of words this well considered may perhaps prevent some objections that might otherwise be made against what we have offered as the true explication of the appearance of the horizontal moon  lxxiv appearance of the horizontal moon why thought difficult to explain if we attentively consider the phenomenon before us we shall find the not discerning between the mediate and immediate objects of sight to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occurs in the explication of it the magnitude of the visible moon or that which is the proper and immediate object of vision is no greater when the moon is in the horizon than when it is in the meridian how comes it therefore to seem greater in one situation than the other what is it can put this cheat on the understanding it has no other perception of the moon than what it gets by sight and that which is seen is of the same extent i say the visible appearance has the very same or rather a lesser magnitude when the moon is viewed in the horizontal than when in the meridional position and yet it is esteemed greater in the former than in the latter herein consists the difficulty which does vanish and admit of a most easy solution if we consider that as the visible moon is not greater in the horizon than in the meridian so neither is it thought to be so it has been already shown that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely or in it self is little taken notice of the mind still carrying its view from that to some tangible ideas which have been observed to be connected with it and by that means come to be suggested by it so that when a thing is said to appear great or small or whatever estimate be made of the magnitude of any thing this is meant not of the visible but of the tangible object this duly considered it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seeming contradiction there is that the moon should appear of a different bigness the visible magnitude thereof remaining still the same for by sect lvi the very same visible extension with a different faintness shall suggest a different tangible extension when therefore the horizontal moon is said to appear greater than the meridional moon this must be understood not of a greater visible extension but of a greater tangible extension which by reason of the more than ordinary faintness of the visible appearance is suggested to the mind along with it  lxxv attempts toward the solution of it made by several but in vain many attempts have been made by learned men to account for this appearance gassendus descartes hobbs and several others have employed their thoughts on that subject but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavors have been is sufficiently shown by mr molyneux vid philos trans numb     p     where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confuted not without some surprise at the gross blunders that ingenious men have been forced into by endeavoring to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary principles of optics since the writing of which discourse there has been published in the transactions numb     p     another paper relating to the same affair by the celebrated dr wallis wherein he pretends to account for that phenomenon which though it seems not to contain any thing new or different from what had been said before by others i shall nevertheless consider in this place  lxxvi the opinion of dr wallis his opinion in short is this we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the optic angle alone but by the optic angle in conjunction with the distance hence though the angle remain the same or even becomes less yet if withal the distance seem to have been increased the object shall appear greater now one way whereby we estimate the distance of any thing is by the number and extent of the intermediate objects when therefore the moon is seen in the horizon the variety of fields houses etc together with the large prospect of the wideextended land or sea that lies between the eye and the utmost limb of the horizon suggest unto the mind the idea of greater distance and consequently magnify the appearance and this according to dr wallis is the true account of the extraordinary largeness attributed by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtended by its diameter is not one jot greater than it used to be  lxxvii it is shown to be unsatisfactory with reference to this opinion not to repeat what has been already said concerning distance i shall only observe first that if the prospect of interjacent objects be that which suggests the idea of farther distance and this idea of farther distance be the cause that brings into the mind the idea of greater magnitude it should hence follow that if one looked at the horizontal moon from behind a wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary for in that case the wall interposing cuts off all that prospect of sea and land etc which might otherwise increase the apparent distance and thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon nor will it suffice to say the memory does even then suggest all that extent of land etc which lies within the horizon which suggestion occasions a sudden judgment of sense that the moon is farther off and larger than usual for ask any man who from such a station beholding the horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual whether he have at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate objects or long tract of land that lies between his eye and the extreme edge of the horizon and whether it be that idea which is the cause of his making the aforementioned judgment he will without doubt reply in the negative and declare the horizontal moon shall appear greater than the meridional though he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it and as for the absurdity of any ideas introducing into the mind another whilst it self is not perceived this has already fallen under our observation and is too evident to need any farther enlargement on it secondly it seems impossible by this hypothesis to account for the moons appearing in the very same situation at one time greater than at another which nevertheless has been shown to be very agreeable to the principles we have laid down and receives a most easy and natural explication from them  lxxviii how lines and angles may be of use in computing apparent magnitudes this phenomenon of the horizontal moon is a clear instance of the insufficiency of lines and angles for explaining the way wherein the mind perceives and estimates the magnitude of outward objects there is nevertheless a use of computation by them in order to determine the apparent magnitude of things so far as they have a connection with and are proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which are the true and immediate occasions that suggest to the mind the apparent magnitude of things but this in general may i think be observed concerning mathematical computation in optics that it can hardly be very precise and exact since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do often depend on several circumstances which are not proportional to or capable of being defined by lines and angles  lxxix one born blind being made to see what judgment he would make of magnitude from what has been said we may safely deduce this consequence viz that a man born blind and made to see would at first opening of his eyes make a very different judgment of the magnitude of objects intromitted by them from what others do he would not consider the ideas of sight with reference to or as having any connection with the ideas of touch his view of them being entirely terminated within themselves he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible points now it being certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from view only one other visible point it follows that whatever object intercepts the view of another has an equal number of visible points with it and consequently they shall both by him be thought to have the same magnitude hence it is evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb with which he might hide a tower or hinder its being seen equal to that tower or his hand the interposition whereof might conceal the firmament from his view equal to the firmament how great an inequality soever there may in our apprehensions seem to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close connection that has grown up in our minds between the objects of sight and touch whereby the very different and distinct ideas of those two senses are so blended and confounded together as to be mistaken for one and the same thing out of which prejudice we cannot totally extricate our selves without some labor and striving of thought  lxxx the minimum visibile the same to all creatures for the better clearing up the nature of vision and setting the manner wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light i shall proceed to make some observations concerning matters relating thereto whereof the want of reflection and duly separating between tangible and visible ideas is apt to create in us mistaken and confused notions and first i shall observe that the minimum visibile is exactly equal in all beings whatsoever that are endowed with the visive faculty no exquisite formation of the eye no peculiar sharpness of sight can make it less in one creature than in another for it not being distinguishable into parts nor in any wise consisting of them it must necessarily be the same to all for suppose it otherwise and that the minimum visibile of a mite for instance be less than the minimum visibile of a man the latter therefore may by detraction of some part be made equal to the former it does therefore consist of parts which is inconsistent with the notion of a minimum visibile or point  lxxxi objection answered it will perhaps be objected that the minimum visibile of a man does really and in it self contain parts whereby it surpasses that of a mite though they are not perceivable by the man to which i answer the minimum visibile having in like manner as all other the proper and immediate objects of sight been shown not to have any existence without the mind of him who sees it it follows there cannot be any part of it that is not actually perceived and therefore visible now for any object to contain several distinct visible parts and at the same time to be a minimum visibile is a manifest contradiction  lxxxii the eye at all times perceives the same number of visible points of these visible points we see at all times an equal number it is every whit as great when our view is contracted and bounded by near objects as when it is extended to larger and remoter ones for it being impossible that one minimum visibile should obscure or keep out of sight more than one other it is a plain consequence that when my view is on all sides bounded by the walls of my study i see just as many visible points as i could in case that by the removal of the studywalls and all other obstructions i had a full prospect of the circumjacent fields mountains sea and open firmament for so long as i am shut up within the walls by their interposition every point of the external object is covered from my view but each point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from sight one only other corresponding point it follows that whilst my sight is confined to those narrow walls i see as many points or minima visibilia as i should were those walls away by looking on all the external objects whose prospect is intercepted by them whenever therefore we are said to have a greater prospect at one time than another this must be understood with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate objects of vision which as has been shown do properly belong to the touch  lxxxiii two imperfections in the visive faculty the visive faculty considered with reference to it is immediate objects may be found to labor of two defects first in respect of the extent or number of visible points that are at once perceivable by it which is narrow and limited to a certain degree it can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of minima visibilia beyond which it cannot extend it is prospect secondly our sight is defective in that its view is not only narrow but also for the most part confused of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly and the more we fix our sight on any one object by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear  lxxxiv answering to which we may conceive two perfections corresponding to these two defects of sight we may imagine as many perfections viz   st that of comprehending in one view a greater number of visible points   dly of being able to view them all equally and at once with the utmost clearness and distinction that these perfections are not actually in some intelligences of a different order and capacity from ours it is impossible for us to know  lxxxv in neither of these two ways do microscopes improve the sight in neither of these two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of sight for when we look through a microscope we neither see more visible points nor are the collateral points more distinct than when we look with the naked eye at objects placed in a due distance a microscope brings us as it were into a new world it presents us with a new scene of visible objects quite different from what we behold with the naked eye but herein consists the most remarkable difference viz that whereas the objects perceived by the eye alone have a certain connection with tangible objects whereby we are taught to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant objects to the parts of our own body which much conduces to it is preservation there is not the like connection between things tangible and those visible objects that are perceived by help of a fine microscope  lxxxvi the case of microscopical eyes considered hence it is evident that were our eyes turned into the nature of microscopes we should not be much benefited by the change we should be deprived of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by the visive faculty and have left us only the empty amusement of seeing without any other benefit arising from it but in that case it will perhaps be said our sight would be endued with a far greater sharpness and penetration than it now has but i would fain know wherein consists that sharpness which is esteemed so great an excellency of sight it is certain from what we have already shown that the minimum visibile is never greater or lesser but in all cases constantly the same and in the case of microscopical eyes i see only this difference viz that upon the ceasing of a certain observable connection betwixt the diverse perceptions of sight and touch which before enabled us to regulate our actions by the eye it would now be rendered utterly unserviceable to that purpose which whether it be a desirable perfection or no i leave it to any one to determine  lxxxvii the sight admirably adapted to the ends of seeing upon the whole my opinion is that if we consider the use and end of sight together with the present state and circumstances of our being we shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or imperfection in it or easily conceive how it could be mended with such admirable wisdom is that faculty contrived both for the pleasure and convenience of life  lxxxviii difficulty concerning erect vision having finished what i intended to say concerning the distance and magnitude of objects i come now to treat of the manner wherein the mind perceives by sight their situation among the discoveries of the last age it is reputed none of the least that the manner of vision has been more clearly explained than ever it had been before there is at this day no one ignorant that the pictures of external objects are painted on the retina or fund of the eye that we can see no thing which is not so painted and that according as the picture is more distinct or confused so also is the perception we have of the object but then in this explication of vision there occurs one mighty difficulty the objects are painted in an inverted order on the bottom of the eye the upper part of any object being painted on the lower part of the eye and the lower part of the object on the upper part of the eye and so also as to right and left since therefore the pictures are thus inverted it is demanded how it comes to pass that we see the objects erect and in their natural posture  lxxxix the common way of explaining it in answer to this difficulty we are told that the mind perceiving an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye considers this ray as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object and in like manner tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of the eye it is directed to the upper part of the object thus in the adjacent figure c the lower point of the object abc is projected on c the upper part of the eye so likewise the highest point a is projected on a the lowest part of the eye which makes the representation cba inverted but the mind considering the stroke that is made on c as coming in the straight line c c from the lower end of the object and the stroke or impulse on a as coming in the line aa from the upper end of the object is directed to make a right judgment of the situation of the object abc notwithstanding the picture of it be inverted moreover this is illustrated by conceiving a blind man who holding in his hands two sticks that cross each other does with them touch the extremities of an object placed in a perpendicular situation it is certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the object which he touches with the stick held in the undermost hand and that to be the lower part of the object which he touches with the stick in his uppermost hand this is the common explication of the erect appearance of objects which is generally received and acquiesed in being as mr molyneux tells us dioptr par   c   p     allowed by all men as satisfactory  xc the same shown to be false but how reasonable and satisfactory soever this account may be thought by others to me certainly it does not seem in any degree true did i perceive those impulses decussations and directions of the rays of light in like manner as has been set forth then indeed it would not at first view be altogether void of probability and there might be some pretense for the comparison of the blindman and his cross sticks but the case is far otherwise i know very well that i perceive no such thing and of consequence i cannot thereby make an estimate of the situation of objects moreover i appeal to any ones experience whether he be conscious to himself that he thinks on the intersection made by the radious pencils or pursue the impulses they give in right lines whenever he perceives by sight the position of any object to me it seems evident that crossing and tracing of the rays etc is never thought on by children idiots or in truth by any other save only those who have applied themselves to the study of optics and for the mind to judge of the situation of objects by those things without perceiving them or to perceive them without knowing it take which you please it is perfectly beyond my comprehension add to this that the explaining the manner of vision by the example of cross sticks and hunting for the object along the axes of the radious pencils does suppose the proper objects of sight to be perceived at a distance from us contrary to what has been demonstrated we may therefore venture to pronounce this opinion concerning the way wherein the mind perceives the erect appearance of objects to be of a piece with those other tenants of writers in optics which in the foregoing parts of this treatise we have had occasion to examine and refute  xci not distinguishing between ideas of sight and touch cause of mistake in this matter it remains therefore that we look for some other explication of this difficulty and i believe it not impossible to find one provided we examine it to the bottom and carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch which cannot be too often inculcated in treating of vision but more especially throughout the consideration of this affair we ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts for that from want of a right understanding thereof the difficulty of explaining erect vision seems chiefly to arise  xcii the case of one born blind proper to be considered but in order to disentangle our minds from whatever prejudices we may entertain with relation to the subject in hand nothing seems more apposite than the taking into our thoughts the case of one born blind and afterward when grown up made to see and though perhaps it may not be a task altogether easy and familiar to us to divest our selves entirely of the experiences received from sight so as to be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a ones we must nevertheless as far as possible endeavor to frame true conceptions of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in his mind  xciii such a one might by touch attain to have ideas of upper and lower it is certain that a man actually blind and who had continued so from his birth would by the sense of feeling attain to have ideas of upper and lower by the motion of his hand he might discern the situation of any tangible object placed within his reach that part on which he felt himself supported or toward which he perceived his body to gravitate he would term lower and the contrary to this upper and accordingly denominate whatsoever objects he touched  xciv which modes of situation he would attribute only to things tangible but then whatever judgments he makes concerning the situation of objects are confined to those only that are perceivable by touch all those things that are intangible and of a spiritual nature his thoughts and desires his passions and in general all the modifications of his soul to these he would never apply the terms upper and lower except only in a metaphorical sense he may perhaps by way of allusion speak of high or low thoughts but those terms in their proper signification would never be applied to any thing that was not conceived to exist without the mind for a man born blind and remaining in the same state could mean nothing else by the words higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body it is therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other would by him be thought higher or lower must be such as were conceived to exist without his mind in the ambient space  xcv he would not at first sight think any thing he saw high or low erect or inverted whence it plainly follows that such a one if we suppose him made to see would not at first sight think that any thing he saw was high or low erect or inverted for it has been already demonstrated in sect xli that he would not think the things he perceived by sight to be at any distance from him or without his mind the objects to which he had hitherto been used to apply the terms up and down high and low were such only as affected or were some way perceived by his touch but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch there is therefore nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms applicable to them nor would he ever think it till such time as he had observed their connection with tangible objects and the same prejudice begin to insinuate it self into his understanding which from their infancy had grown up in the understandings of other men  xcvi this illustrated by an example to set this matter in a clearer light i shall make use of an example suppose the abovementioned blind person do by his touch perceive a man to stand erect let us enquire into the manner of this by the application of his hand to the several parts of a human body he had perceived different tangible ideas which being collected into sundry complex ones have distinct names annexed to them thus one combination of a certain tangible figure bulk and consistency of parts is called the head another the hand a third the foot and so of the rest all which complex ideas could in his understanding be made up only of ideas perceivable by touch he had also by his touch obtained an idea of earth or ground toward which he perceives the parts of his body to have a natural tendency now by erect nothing more being meant than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet are nearest to the earth if the blind person by moving his hand over the parts of the man who stands before him do perceive the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest from and those that compose the feet to be nearest to that other combination of tangible ideas which he calls earth he will denominate that man erect but if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his sight and that he behold a man standing before him it is evident in that case he would neither judge the man he sees to be erect nor inverted for he never having known those terms applied to any other save tangible things or which existed in the space without him and what he sees neither being tangible nor perceived as existing without he could not know that in propriety of language they were applicable to it  xcvii by what means he would come to denominate visible objects high or low etc afterward when upon turning his head or eyes up and down to the right and left he shall observe the visible objects to change and shall also attain to know that they are called by the same names and connected with the objects perceived by touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation in the the same terms that he has been used to apply to tangible things and those that he perceives by turning up his eyes he will call upper and those that by turning down his eyes he will call lower  xcviii why he should think those objects highest which are painted on the lowest part of his eye and vice versa and this seems to me the true reason why he should think those objects uppermost that are painted on the lower part of his eye for by turning the eye up they shall be distinctly seen as likewise they that are painted on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly seen by turning the eye down and are for that reason esteemed lowest for we have shown that to the immediate objects of sight considered in themselves he would not attribute the terms high and low it must therefore be on account of some circumstances which are observed to attend them and these it is plain are the actions of turning the eye up and down which suggest a very obvious reason why the mind should denominate the objects of sight accordingly high or low and without this motion of the eye this turning it up and down in order to discern different objects doubtless erect inverse and other the like terms relating to the position of tangible objects would never have been transferred or in any degree apprehended to belong to the ideas of sight the mere act of seeing including nothing in it to that purpose whereas the different situations of the eye naturally direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of objects intromitted by it  xcix how he would perceive by sight the situation of external objects farther when he has by experience learned the connection there is between the several ideas of sight and touch he will be able by the perception he has of the situation of visible things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward tangible things corresponding to them and thus it is he shall perceive by sight the situation of external objects which do not properly fall under that sense  c our propension to think the contrary no argument against what has been said i know we are very prone to think that if just made to see we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now but we are also as prone to think that at first sight we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of objects as we do now which has been shown to be a false and groundless persuasion and for the like reasons the same censure may be past on the positive assurance that most men before they have thought sufficiently of the matter might have of their being able to determine by the eye at first view whether objects were erect or inverse  ci objection it will perhaps be objected to our opinion that a man for instance being thought erect when his feet are next the earth and inverted when his head is next the earth it does hence follow that by the mere act of vision without any experience or altering the situation of the eye we should have determined whether he were erect or inverted for both the earth it self and the limbs of the man who stands thereon being equally perceived by sight one cannot choose seeing what part of the man is nearest the earth and what part farthest from it i e whether he be erect or inverted  cii answer to which i answer the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man are entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man nor was it possible by virtue of the visive faculty alone without superadding any experience of touch or altering the position of the eye ever to have known or so much as suspected there had been any relation or connection between them hence a man at first view would not denominate any thing he saw earth or head or foot and consequently he could not tell by the mere act of vision whether the head or feet were nearest the earth nor indeed would he have thereby any thought of earth or man erect or inverse at all which will be made yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular comparison between the ideas of both senses  ciii an object could not be known at first sight by the color that which i see is only variety of light and colors that which i feel is hard or soft hot or cold rough or smooth what similitude what connection have those ideas with these or how is it possible that any one should see reason to give one and the same name to combinations of ideas so very different before ever he had experienced their coexistence we do not find there is any necessary connection betwixt this or that tangible quality and any color whatsoever and we may sometimes perceive colors where there is nothing to be felt all which does make it manifest that no man at first receiving of his sight would know there was any agreement between this or that particular object of his sight and any object of touch he had been already acquainted with the colors therefore of the head would to him no more suggest the idea of head than they would the idea of feet  civ nor by the magnitude thereof farther we have at large shown  vid sect lxiii and lxiv there is no discoverable necessary connection between any given visible magnitude and any one particular tangible magnitude but that it is entirely the result of custom and experience and depends on foreign and accidental circumstances that we can by the perception of visible extension inform our selves what may be the extension of any tangible object connected therewith hence it is certain that neither the visible magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the mind at first opening of the eyes the respective tangible magnitudes of those parts  cv nor by the figure by the foregoing section it is plain the visible figure of any part of the body has no necessary connection with the tangible figure thereof so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind for figure is the termination of magnitude whence it follows that no visible magnitude having in it is own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible figure so as of it self and in a way prior to experience it might suggest it to the understanding this will be farther evident if we consider that what seems smooth and round to the touch may to sight if viewed through a microscope seem quite otherwise  cvi in the first act of vision no tangible thing would be suggested by sight from all which laid together and duly considered we may clearly deduce this inference viz in the first act of vision no idea entering by the eye would have a perceivable connection with the ideas to which the names earth man head foot etc were annexed in the understanding of a person blind from his birth so as in any sort to introduce them into his mind or make themselves be called by the same names and reputed the same things with them as afterward they come to be  cvii difficulty proposed concerning number there does nevertheless remain one difficulty which to some perhaps may seem to press hard on our opinion and deserve not to be passed over for though it be granted that neither the color size nor figure of the visible feet have any necessary connection with the ideas that compose the tangible feet so as to bring them at first sight into my mind or make me in danger of confounding them before i had been used to and for some time experienced their connection yet thus much seems undeniable namely that the number of the visible feet being the same with that of the tangible feet i may from hence without any experience of sight reasonably conclude that they represent or are connected with the feet rather than the head i say it seems the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head so that the blind man upon first reception of the visive faculty might know which were the feet or two and which the head or one  cviii number of things visible would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible in order to get clear of this seeming difficulty we need only observe that diversity of visible objects does not necessarily infer diversity of tangible objects corresponding to them a picture painted with great variety of colors affects the touch in one uniform manner it is therefore evident that i do not by any necessary consecution independent of experience judge of the number of things tangible from the number of things visible i should not therefore at first opening my eyes conclude that because i see two i shall feel two how therefore can i before experience teaches me know that the visible legs because two are connected with the tangible legs or the visible head because one connected with the tangible head the truth on it is the things i see are so very different and heterogeneous from the things i feel that the perception of the one would never have suggested the other to my thoughts or enabled me to pass the least judgment thereon until i had experienced their connection  cix number the creature of the mind but for a fuller illustration of this matter it ought to be considered that number however some may reckon it amongst the primary qualities is nothing fixed and settled really existing in things themselves it is entirely the creature of the mind considering either a simple idea by it self or any combination of simple ideas to which it gives one name and so makes it pass for an unite according as the mind variously combines it is ideas the unite varies and as the unite so the number which is only a collection of unites does also vary we call a window one a chimney one and yet a house in which there are many windows and many chimneys has an equal right to be called one and many houses go to the making of one city in these and the like instances it is evident the unite constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of it is ideas to which it affixes names and wherein it includes more or less as best suits it is own ends and purposes whatever therefore the mind considers as one that is an unite every combination of ideas is considered as one thing by the mind and in token thereof is marked by one name now this naming and combining together of ideas is perfectly arbitrary and done by the mind in such sort as experience shows it to be most convenient without which our ideas had never been collected into such sundry distinct combinations as they now are  cx one born blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do hence it follows that a man born blind and afterward when grown up made to see would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up together under one name he would not for example make into one complex idea and thereby esteem an unite all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot for there can be no reason assigned why he should do so barely upon his seeing a man stand upright before him there crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man in company with all the other ideas of sight perceived at the same time but all these ideas offered at once to his view he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such time as by observing the motion of the parts of the man and other experiences he comes to know which are to be separated and which to be collected together  cxi the situation of any object determined with respect only to objects of the same sense from what has been premised it is plain the objects of sight and touch make if i may so say two sets of ideas which are widely different from each other to objects of either kind we indifferently attribute the terms high and low right and left and such like denoting the position or situation of things but then we must well observe that the position of any object is determined with respect only to objects of the same sense we say any object of touch is high or low according as it is more or less distant from the tangible earth and in like manner we denominate any object of sight high or low in proportion as it is more or less distant from the visible earth but to define the situation of visible things with relation to the distance they bear from any tangible thing or vice versa this were absurd and perfectly unintelligible for all visible things are equally in the mind and take up no part of the external space and consequently are equidistant from any tangible thing which exists without the mind  cxii no distance great or small between a visible and tangible thing or rather to speak truly the proper objects of sight are at no distance neither near nor far from any tangible thing for if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find that those things only are compared together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same sense for by the distance between any two points nothing more is meant than the number of intermediate points if the given points are visible the distance between them is marked out by the number of the interjacent visible points if they are tangible the distance between them is a line consisting of tangible points but if they are one tangible and the other visible the distance between them does neither consist of points perceivable by sight nor by touch i e it is utterly inconceivable this perhaps will not find an easy admission into all mens understandings however i should gladly be informed whether it be not true by any one who will be at the pains to reflect a little and apply it home to his thoughts  cxii the not observing this cause of difficulty in erect vision the not observing what has been delivered in the two last sections seems to have occasioned no small part of the difficulty that occurs in the business of erect appearances the head which is painted nearest the earth seems to be farthest from it and on the other hand the feet which are painted farthest from the earth are thought nearest to it herein lies the difficulty which vanishes if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity thus how comes it that to the eye the visible head which is nearest the tangible earth seems farthest from the earth and the visible feet which are farthest from the tangible earth seem nearest the earth the question being thus proposed who sees not the difficulty is founded on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty or rather the soul by means thereof should judge of the situation of visible objects with reference to their distance from the tangible earth whereas it is evident the tangible earth is not perceived by sight and it has been shown in the two last preceding sections that the location of visible objects is determined only by the distance they bear from one another and that it is nonsense to talk of distance far or near between a visible and tangible thing  cxiv which otherwise includes nothing unaccountable if we confine our thoughts to the proper objects of sight the whole is plain and easy the head is painted farthest from and the feet nearest to the visible earth and so they appear to be what is there strange or unaccountable in this let us suppose the pictures in the fund of the eye to be the immediate objects of sight the consequence is that things should appear in the same posture they are painted in and is it not so the head which is seen seems farthest from the earth which is seen and the feet which are seen seem nearest to the earth which is seen and just so they are painted  cxv what is meant by the pictures being inverted but say you the picture of the man is inverted and yet the appearance is erect i ask what mean you by the picture of the man or which is the same thing the visible mans being inverted you tell me it is inverted because the heels are uppermost and the head undermost explain me this you say that by the heads being undermost you mean that it is nearest to the earth and by the heels being uppermost that they are farthest from the earth i ask again what earth you mean you cannot mean the earth that is painted on the eye or the visible earth for the picture of the head is farthest from the picture of the earth and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth and accordingly the visible head is farthest from the visible earth and the visible feet nearest to it it remains therefore that you mean the tangible earth and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things contrary to what has been demonstrated in sect cxi and cxii the two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be considered apart and as though their objects had no intercourse no manner of relation to one another in point of distance or position  cxvi cause of mistake in this matter farther what greatly contributes to make us mistake in this matter is that when we think of the pictures in the fund of the eye we imagine our selves looking on the fund of anothers eye or another looking on the fund of our own eye and beholding the pictures painted thereon suppose two eyes a and b a from some distance looking on the pictures in b sees them inverted and for that reason concludes they are inverted in b but this is wrong there are projected in little on the bottom of a the images of the pictures of suppose man earth etc which are painted on b and besides these the eye b it self and the objects which environ it together with another earth are projected in a larger size on a now by the eye a these larger images are deemed the true objects and the lesser only pictures in miniature and it is with respect to those greater images that it determines the situation of the smaller images so that comparing the little man with the great earth a judges him inverted or that the feet are farthest from and the head nearest to the great earth whereas if a compare the little man with the little earth then he will appear erect i e his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest to the little earth but we must consider that b does not see two earths as a does it sees only what is represented by the little pictures in a and consequently shall judge the man erect for in truth the man in b is not inverted for there the feet are next the earth but it is the representation of it in a which is inverted for there the head of the representation of the picture of the man in b is next the earth and the feet farthest from the earth meaning the earth which is without the representation of the pictures in b for if you take the little images of the pictures in b and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they are all erect and in their natural posture  cxvii images in the eye not pictures of external objects farther there lies a mistake in our imagining that the pictures of external objects are painted on the bottom of the eye it has been shown there is no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things tangible it has likewise been demonstrated that the proper objects of sight do not exist without the mind whence it clearly follows that the pictures painted on the bottom of the eye are not the pictures of external objects let any one consult his own thoughts and then tell me what affinity what likeness there is between that certain variety and disposition of colors which constitute the visible man or picture of a man and that other combination of far different ideas sensible by touch which compose the tangible man but if this be the case how come they to be accounted pictures or images since that supposes them to copy or represent some originals or other  cxviii in what sense they are pictures to which i answer in the forementioned instance the eye a takes the little images included within the representation of the other eye b to be pictures or copies whereof the archetypes are not things existing without but the larger pictures projected on it is own fund and which by a are not thought pictures but the originals or true things themselves though if we suppose a third eye c from a due distance to behold the fund of a then indeed the things projected thereon shall to c seem pictures or images in the same sense that those projected on b do to a  cxix in this affair we must carefully distinguish between ideas of sight and touch rightly to conceive the business in hand we must carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch between the visible and tangible eye for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either is or seems to be painted again the visible eye as well as all other visible objects has been shown to exist only in the mind which perceiving its own ideas and comparing them together does call some pictures in respect of others what has been said being rightly comprehended and laid together does i think afford a full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of objects which phenomenon i must confess i do not see how it can be explained by any theories of vision hitherto made public  cxx difficult to explain by words the true theory of vision in treating of these things the use of language is apt to occasion some obscurity and confusion and create in us wrong ideas for language being accomodated to the common notions and prejudices of men it is scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth without great circumlocution impropriety and to an unwary reader seeming contradictions i do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what i have written concerning vision that he would not stick in this or that phrase or manner of expression but heartily collect my meaning from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse and laying aside the words as much as possible consider the bare notions themselves and then judge whether they are agreeable to truth and his own experience or no  cxxi the question whether there is any idea common to sight and touch stated we have shown the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas does perceive or apprehend the distance magnitude and situation of tangible objects i come now to enquire more particularly concerning the difference betwixt the ideas of sight and touch which are called by the same names and see whether there be any idea common to both senses from what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this treatise it is plain there is no one selfsame numerical extension perceived both by sight and touch but that the particular figures and extensions perceived by sight however they may be called by the same names and reputed the same things with those perceived by touch are nevertheless different and have an existence very distinct and separate from them so that the question is not now concerning the same numerical ideas but whether there be any one and the same sort or species of ideas equally perceivable to both senses or in other words whether extension figure and motion perceived by sight are not specifically distinct from extension figure and motion perceived by touch  cxxii abstract extension inquired into but before i come more particularly to discuss this matter i find it proper to take into my thoughts extension in abstract for of this there is much talk and i am apt to think that when men speak of extension as being an idea common to two senses it is with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all other tangible and visible qualities and frame thereof an abstract idea which idea they will have common both to sight and touch we are therefore to understand by extension in abstract an idea of extension v g a line or surface entirely stripped of all other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it to any particular existence it is neither black nor white nor red nor has it any color at all or any tangible quality whatsoever and consequently it is of no finite determinate magnitude for that which bounds or distinguishes one extension from another is some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree  cxxiii it is incomprehensible now i do not find that i can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my mind such an abstract idea as is here spoken of a line or surface which is neither black nor white nor blue nor yellow etc nor long nor short nor rough nor smooth nor square nor round etc is perfectly incomprehensible this i am sure of as to my self how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can tell  cxxiv abstract extension not the object of geometry i know it is commonly said that the object of geometry is abstract extension to this i cannot agree for geometry contemplates figures now figure is the termination of magnitude but we have shown that extension in abstract has no finite determinate magnitude whence it clearly follows that it can have no figure and consequently is not the object of geometry i know it is a tenent as well of the modern as the ancient philosophers that all general truths are concerning universal abstract ideas without which we are told there could be no science no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry but it were no hard matter did i think it necessary to my present purpose to show that propositions and demonstrations in geometry might be universal though they who make em never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circles  cxv the general idea of a triangle considered after reiterated efforts and pangs of thought in order to apprehend the general idea of v g a triangle i have found it altogether incomprehensible and surely if any one were able to let that idea into my mind it must be the deservedly admired author of the essay concerning human understanding he who has so far distinguished himself from the generality of writers by the clearness and significancy of what he says let us therefore see how that great man describes the general or which is the same thing the abstract idea of a triangle it must be  says he neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it is somewhat imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together essay on hum understand b iv c   s   this is the idea which he thinks needful for the enlargement of knowledge which is the subject of mathematical demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concerning triangles sure i am if this be the case it is impossible for me to attain to know even the first elements of geometry since i have not the faculty to frame in my mind such an idea as is here described that author acknowledges it does require some pains and skill to form this general idea of a triangle ibid but had he called to mind what he says in another place viz that ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the mind i e be conceived vid b iii c  0 s    ibid i say had this occurred to his thoughts it is not improbable he would have owned it above all the pains and skill he was master of to form the abovementioned idea of a triangle which is made up of manifest staring contradictions that a man of such a clear understanding who thought so much and so well and laid so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising but my wonder is lessened when i consider that the source whence this opinion of abstract figures and extension flows is the prolific womb which has brought forth innumerable errors and difficulties in all parts of philosophy and in all the sciences but this matter taken in its full extent were a subject too vast and comprehensive to be insisted on in this place i shall only observe that your metaphysicians and men of speculation seem to have faculties distinct from those of ordinary men when they talk of general or abstracted triangles and circles etc and so peremptorily declare them to be the subject of all the eternal immutable universal truths in geometry and so much for extension in abstract  cxxvi vacuum or pure space not common to sight and touch some perhaps may think pure space vacuum or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight yet if i mistake not in the foregoing parts of this essay that has been clearly demonstrated to be a mere delusion arising from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy which so closely connects the idea of distance with those of sight that we are apt to think it is it self a proper and immediate object of that sense till reason corrects the mistake  cxxvii there is no idea or kind of idea common to both senses it having been shown that there are no abstract ideas of figure and that it is impossible for us by any precision of thought to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch the question now remaining is whether the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by touch in answer to which i shall venture to lay down the following proposition viz the extension figures and motions perceived by sight are specifically distinct from the ideas of touch called by the same names nor is there any such thing as an idea or kind of idea common to both senses this proposition may without much difficulty be collected from what has been said in several places of this essay but because it seems so remote from and contrary to the received notions and settled opinion of mankind i shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the following arguments  cxxviii first argument in proof hereof first when upon perception of an idea i range it under this or that sort it is because it is perceived after the same manner or because it has a likeness or conformity with or affects me in the same way as the ideas of the sort i rank it under in short it must not be entirely new but have something in it old and already perceived by me it must i say have so much at least in common with the ideas i have before known and named as to make me give it the same name with them but it has been if i mistake not clearly made out that a man born blind would not at first reception of his sight think the things he saw were of the same nature with the objects of touch or had any thing in common with them but that they were a new set of ideas perceived in a new manner and entirely different from all he had ever perceived before so that he would not call them by the same name nor repute them to be of the same sort with any thing he had hitherto known and surely the judgment of such an unprejudiced person is more to be relied on in this case than the sentiments of the generality of men who in this as in almost every thing else suffer themselves to be guided by custom and the erroneous suggestions of prejudice rather than reason and sedate reflection  cxxix second argument secondly light and colors are allowed by all to constitute a sort or species entirely different from the ideas of touch nor will any man i presume say they can make themselves perceived by that sense but there is no other immediate object of sight besides light and colors it is therefore a direct consequence that there is no idea common to both senses  cxxx visible figure and extension not distinct ideas from color it is i know a prevailing opinion even amongst those who have thought and writ most accurately concerning our ideas and the ways whereby they enter into the understanding that something more is percievd by sight than barely light and colors with their variations the excellent mr lock terms sight the most comprehensive of all our senses conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colors which are peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion essay on hum understand b ii c   s   space or distance we have shown is no otherwise the object of sight than of hearing vid sect xlvi and as for figure and extension i leave it to any one that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he has any idea intromitted immediately and properly by sight save only light and colors or whether it be possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all color and on the other hand whether he can conceive color without visible extension for my own part i must confess i am not able to attain so great a nicety of abstraction i know very well that in a strict sense i see nothing but light and colors with their several shades and variations he who beside these does also perceive by sight ideas far different and distinct from them has that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than i can pretend to i own indeed that by the mediation of light and colors other far different ideas are suggested to my mind but then upon this score i see no reason why the sight should be thought more comprehensive than the hearing which beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense does by their mediation suggest not only space figure and motion but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words  cxxxi third argument thirdly it is i think an axiom universally received that quantities of the same kind may be added together and make one entire sum mathematicians add lines together but they do not add a line to a solid or conceive it as making one sum with a surface these three kinds of quantity being thought incapable of any such mutual addition and consequently of being compared together in the several ways of proportion are by them for that reason esteemed entirely disparate and heterogeneous now let any one try in his thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or surface so as to conceive them making one continued sum or whole he that can do this may think em homogenuous but he that cannot must by the foregoing anxiom think them heterogeneous i acknowledge my self to be of the latter sort a blue and and a red line i can conceive added together into one sum and making one continued line but to make in my thoughts one continued line of a visible and tangible line added together is i find a task far more difficult and even insurmountable by me and i leave it to the reflection and experience of every particular person to determine for himself  cxxxii confirmation drawn from mr molyneuxs problem of a sphere and a cube published by mr lock a further confirmation of our tenent may be drawn from the solution of mr molyneuxs problem published by mr lock in his essay which i shall set down as it there lies together with mr lockes opinion of it suppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and the other which is the cube and which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be made to see quaere whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answers not for though he has obtained the experience of how a globe how a cube affects his touch yet he has not yet attained the experience that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that pressed his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube i agree with this thinking gentleman whom i am proud to call my friend in his answer to this his problem and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them essay on human understand b ii c   s    cxxxiii which is falsely solved if the common supposition be true now if a square surface perceived by touch be of the same sort with a square surface perceived by sight it is certain the blind man here mentioned might know a square surface as soon as he saw it it is no more but introducing into his mind by a new inlet an idea he has been already well acquainted with since therefore he is supposed to have known by his touch that a cube is a body terminated by square surfaces and that a sphere is not terminated by square surfaces upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only in numero it follows that he might know by the unerring mark of the square surfaces which was the cube and which not whilst he only saw them we must therefore allow either that visible extension and figures are specifically distinct from tangible extension and figures or else that the solution of this problem given by those two very thoughtful and ingenious men is wrong  cxxxiv more might be said in proof of our tenent but this suffices much more might be laid together in proof of the proposition i have advanced but what has been said is if i mistake not sufficient to convince any one that shall yield a reasonable attention and as for those that will not be at the pains of a little thought no multiplication of words will ever suffice to make them understand the truth or rightly conceive my meaning  cxxxv farther reflection on the foregoing problem i cannot let go the abovementioned problem without some reflection on it it has been made evident that a man blind from his birth would not at first sight denominate any thing he saw by the names he had been used to appropriate to ideas of touch vid sect cvi cube sphere table are words he has known applied to things perceivable by touch but to things perfectly intangible he never knew them applied those words in their wonted application always marked out to his mind bodies or solid things which were perceived by the resistance they gave but there is no solidity no resistance or protrusion perceived by sight in short the ideas of sight are all new perceptions to which there be no names annexed in his mind he cannot therefore understand what is said to him concerning them and to ask of the two bodies he saw placed on the table which was the sphere which the cube were to him a question down right bantering and unintelligible nothing he sees being able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body distance or in general of any thing he had already known  cxxxvi the same thing does not affect both sight and touch it is a mistake to think the same thing affects both sight and touch if the same angle or square which is the object of touch be also the object of vision what should hinder the blind man at first sight from knowing it for though the manner wherein it affects the sight be different from that wherein it affected his touch yet there being beside this manner or circumstance which is new and unknown the angle or figure which is old and known he cannot choose but discern it  cxxxvii tho same idea of motion not common to sight and touch visible figure and extension having been demonstrated to be of a nature entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and extension it remains that we inquire concerning motion now that visible motion is not of the same sort with tangible motion seems to need no farther proof it being an evident corollary from what we have shown concerning the difference there is betwixt visible and tangible extension but for a more full and express proof hereof we need only observe that one who had not yet experienced vision would not at first sight know motion whence it clearly follows that motion perceivable by sight is of a sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch the antecedent i prove thus by touch he could not perceive any motion but what was up or down to the right or left nearer or farther from him besides these and their several varieties or complications it is impossible he should have any idea of motion he would not therefore think any thing to be motion or give the name motion to any idea which he could not range under some or other of those particular kinds thereof but from sect xcv it is plain that by the mere act of vision he could not know motion upwards or downwards to the right or left or in any other possible direction from which i conclude he would not know motion at all at first sight as for the idea of motion in abstract i shall not waste paper about it but leave it to my reader to make the best he can on it to me it is perfectly unintelligible  cxxxviii the way wherein we apprehend motion by sight easily collected from what has been said the consideration of motion may furnish a new field for inquiry but since the manner wherein the mind apprehends by sight the motion of tangible objects with the various degrees thereof may be easily collected from what has been said concerning the manner wherein that sense does suggest their various distances magnitudes and situations i shall not enlarge any farther on this subject but proceed to enquire what may be alleged with greatest appearance of reason against the proposition we have demonstrated to be true for where there is so much prejudice to be encountered a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice we must also satisfy the scruples that men may start in favor of their preconceivd notions show whence the mistake arises how it came to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the mind  cxxxix qu how visible and tangible ideas came to have the same name if not of the same kind first therefore it will be demanded how visible extension and figures come to be called by the same name with tangible extension and figures if they are not of the same kind with them it must be something more than humor or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this which has obtained in all ages and nations of the world and amongst all ranks of men the learned as well as the illiterate  cxl this accounted for without supposing them of the same kind to which i answer we can no more argue e g a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their being called by the same name than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consisting of six letters whereby it is marked are of the same species because they are both called by the same name it is customary to call written words and the things they signify by the same name for words not being regarded in their own nature or otherwise than as they are marks of things it had been superfluous and beside the design of language to have given them names distinct from those of the things marked by them the same reason holds here also visible figures are the marks of tangible figures and from sect lix it is plain that in themselves they are little regarded or upon any other score than for their connection with tangible figures which by nature they are ordained to signify and because this language of nature does not vary in different ages or nations hence it is that in all times and places visible figures are called by the same names as the respective tangible figures suggested by them and not because they are alike or of the same sort with them  cxli obj that a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle but say you surely a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle it has four angles and as many sides so also has the visible square but the visible circle has no such thing being bounded by one uniform curve without right lines or angles which makes it unfit to represent the tangible square but very fit to represent the tangible circle whence it clearly follows that visible figures are patterns of or of the same species with the respective tangible figures represented by them that they are like unto them and of their own nature fitted to represent them as being of the same sort and that they are in no respect arbitrary signs as words  cxlii ans that a visible square is fitter than a visible circle to represent a tangible square i answer it must be acknowledged the visible square is fitter than the visible circle to represent the tangible square but then it is not because it is liker or more of a species with it but because the visible square contains in it several distinct parts whereby to mark the several distinct corresponding parts of a tangible square whereas the visible circle does not the square perceived by touch has four distinct equal sides so also has it four distinct equal angles it is therefore necessary that the visible figure which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal parts corresponding to the four sides of the tangible square as likewise four other distinct and equal parts whereby to denote the four equal angles of the tangible square and accordingly we see the visible figures contain in them distinct visible parts answering to the distinct tangible parts of the figures signified or suggested by them  cxliii but it does not hence follow that a visible square is like a tangible square but it will not hence follow that any visible figure is like unto or of the same species with its corresponding tangible figure unless it be also shown that not only the number but also the kind of the parts be the same in both to illustrate this i observe that visible figures represent tangible figures much after the same manner that written words do sounds now in this respect words are not arbitrary it not being indifferent what written word stands for any sound but it is requisite that each word contain in it as many distinct characters as there are variations in the sound it stands for thus the single letter a is proper to mark one simple uniform sound and the word adultery is accommodated to represent the sound annexed to it in the formation whereof there being eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the organs of speech each of which produces a difference of sound it was fit the word representing it should consist of as many distinct characters thereby to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound and yet no body i presume will say the single letter a or the word adultery are like unto or of the same species with the respective sounds by them represented it is indeed arbitrary that in general letters of any language represent sounds at all but when that is once agreed it is not arbitrary what combination of letters shall represent this or that particular sound i leave this with the reader to pursue and apply it in his own thoughts  cxliv why we are more apt to confound visible with tangible ideas than other signs with the things signified it must be confessed that we are not so apt to confound other signs with the things signified or to think them of the same species as we are visible and tangible ideas but a little consideration will show us how this may well be without our supposing them of a like nature these signs are constant and universal this connection with tangible ideas has been learnt at our first entrance into the world and ever since almost every moment of our lives it has been occurring to our thoughts and fastening and striking deeper on our minds when we observe that signs are variable and of human institution when we remember there was a time they were not connected in our minds with those things they now so readily suggest but that their signification was learned by the slow steps of experience this preserves us from confounding them but when we find the same signs suggest the same things all over the world when we know they are not of human institution and cannot remember that we ever learned their signification but think that at first sight they would have suggested to us the same things they do now all this persuades us they are of the same species as the things respectively represented by them and that is by a natural resemblance they suggest them to our minds  cxlv several other reasons hereof assigned add to this that whenever we make a nice survey of any object successively directing the optic axis to each point thereof there are certain lines and figures described by the motion of the head or eye which being in truth perceived by feeling do nevertheless so mix themselves as it were with the ideas of sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense again the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than is usual in the other senses beside the touch sounds for example perceived at the same instant are apt to coalesce if i may so say into one sound but we can perceive at the same time great variety of visible objects very separate and distinct from each other now tangible extension being made up of several distinct coexistent parts we may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a likeness or analogy between the immediate objects of sight and touch but nothing certainly does more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close connection they have with each other we cannot open our eyes but the ideas of distance bodies and tangible figures are suggested by them so swift and sudden and unperceived is the transit from visible to tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear thinking em equally the immediate object of vision  cxlvi reluctance in rejecting any opinion no argument of its truth the prejudice which is grounded on these and whatever other causes may be assigned thereof sticks so fast on our understandings that it is impossible without obstinate striving and labor of the mind to get entirely clear of it but then the reluctance we find in rejecting any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever considers what has been already shown with regard to the prejudices we entertain concerning the distance magnitude and situation of objects prejudices so familiar to our minds so confirmed and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest demonstration  cxlvii proper objects of vision the language of nature upon the whole i think we may fairly conclude that the proper objects of vision constitute the universal language of nature whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and wellbeing of our bodies as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them it is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life and the manner wherein they signify and mark out unto us the objects which are at a distance is the same with that of languages and signs of human appointment which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or identity of nature but only by an habitual connection that experience has made us to observe between em  cxlviii in it there is much admirable and deserving our attention suppose one who had always continued blind be told by his guide that after he has advanced so many steps he shall come to the brink of a precipice or be stopped by a wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprising he cannot conceive how it is possible for mortals to frame such predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as prophesy does to others even they who are blessed with the visive faculty may though familiarity make it less observed find therein sufficient cause of admiration the wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it is adjusted to those ends and purposes for which it was apparently designed the vast extent number and variety of objects that are at once with so much ease and quickness and pleasure suggested by it all these afford subject for much and pleasing speculation and may if any thing give us some glimmering analogous praenotion of things that are placed beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of our present state  cxlix question proposed concerning the object of geometry i do not design to trouble my self much with drawing corollaries from the doctrine i have hitherto laid down if it bears the test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their thoughts in extending it farther and applying it to whatever purposes it may be subservient to only i cannot forbear making some inquiry concerning the object of geometry which the subject we have been upon does naturally lead one to we have shown there is no such idea as that of extension in abstract and that there are two kinds of sensible extension and figures which are entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other now it is natural to enquire which of these is the object of geometry  cl at first view we are apt to think visible extension the object of geometry some things there are which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension the constant use of the eyes both in the practical and speculative parts of that science does very much induce us thereto it would without doubt seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagrams he saw upon paper were not the figures or even the likeness of the figures which make the subject of the demonstration the contrary being held an unquestionable truth not only by mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic i mean who consider the nature of science certainty and demonstration it being by them assigned as one reason of the extraordinary clearness and evidence of geometry that in that science the reasonings are free from those inconveniences which attend the use of arbitrary signs the very ideas themselves being copied out and exposed to view upon paper but by the bye how well this agrees with what they likewise assert of abstract ideas being the object of geometrical demonstration i leave to be considered  cli visible extension shown not to be the object of geometry to come to a resolution in this point we need only observe what has been said in sect lix lx lxi where it is shown that visible extensions in themselves are little regarded and have no settled determinate greatness and that men measure altogether by the application of tangible extension to tangible extension all which makes it evident that visible extension and figures are not the object of geometry  clii words may as well be thought the object of geometry as visible extension it is therefore plain that visible figures are of the same use in geometry that words are and the one may as well be accounted the object of that science as the other neither of them being any otherwise concerned therein than as they represent or suggest to the mind the particular tangible figures connected with them there is indeed this difference betwixt the signification of tangible figures by visible figures and of ideas by words that whereas the latter is variable and uncertain depending altogether on the arbitrary appointment of men the former is fixed and immutably the same in all times and places a visible square for instance suggests to the mind the same tangible figure in europe that it does in america hence it is that the voice of nature which speaks to our eyes is not liable to that misinterpretation and ambiguity that languages of human contrivance are unavoidably subjected to from which may in some measure be derived that peculiar evidence and clearness of geometrical demonstrations  cliii it is proposed to enquire what progress an intelligence that could see but not feel might make in geometry though what has been said may suffice to show what ought to be determined with relation to the object of geometry i shall nevertheless for the fuller illustration thereof take into my thoughts the case of an intelligence or unbodyd spirit which is supposed to see perfectly well i e to have a clear perception of the proper and immediate objects of sight but to have no sense of touch whether there be any such being in nature or no is beside my purpose to enquire it suffices that the supposition contains no contradiction in it let us now examine what proficiency such a one may be able to make in geometry which speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the object of that science  cliv he cannot understand those parts which relate to solids and their surfaces and lines generated by their section first then it is certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea of a solid or quantity of three dimensions which follows from its not having any idea of distance we indeed are prone to think that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids which arises from our imagining that we do strictly speaking see distance and some parts of an object at a greater distance than others which has been demonstrated to be the effect of the experience we have had what ideas of touch are connected with such and such ideas attending vision but the intelligence here spoken of is supposed to have no experience of touch he would not therefore judge as we do nor have any idea of distance outness or profundity nor consequently of space or body either immediately or by suggestion whence it is plain he can have no notion of those parts of geometry which relate to the mensuration of solids and their unequal or concave surfaces and contemplate the properties of lines generated by the section of a solid the conceiving of any part whereof is beyond the reach of his faculties  clv nor even the elements of plain geometry farther he cannot comprehend the manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle the rule and compass with their use being things of which it is impossible he should have any notion nor is it an easier matter for him to conceive the placing of one plain or angle on another in order to prove their equality since that supposes some idea of distance or external space all which makes it evident our pure intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first elements of plain geometry and perhaps upon a nice enquiry it will be found he cannot even have an idea of plain figures any more than he can of solids since some idea of distance is necessary to form the idea of a geometrical plain as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it  clvi the proper objects of sight incapable of being managed as geometrical figures all that is properly perceived by the visive faculty amounts to no more than colors with their variations and different proportions of light and shade but the perpetual mutability and fleetingness of those immediate objects of sight render them incapable of being managed after the manner of geometrical figures nor is it in any degree useful that they should it is true there be diverse of em perceived at once and more of some and less of others but accurately to compute their magnitude and assign precise determinate proportions between things so variable and inconstant if we suppose it possible to be done must yet be a very trifling and insignificant labor  clvii the opinion of those who hold plain figures to be the immediate objects of sight considered i must confess it seems to be the opinion of some very ingenious men that flat or plain figures are immediate objects of sight though they acknowledge solids are not and this opinion of theirs is grounded on what is observed in painting wherein say they the ideas immediately imprinted in the mind are only of plains variously colored which by a sudden act of the judgment are changed into solids but with a little attention we shall find the plains here mentioned as the immediate objects of sight are not visible but tangible plains for when we say that pictures are plains we mean thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform but then this smoothness and uniformity or in other words this plainness of the picture is not perceived immediately by vision for it appears to the eye various and multiform  clviii plains no more the immediate objects of sight than solids from all which we may conclude that plains are no more the immediate object of sight than solids what we strictly see are not solids nor yet plains variously colored they are only diversity of colors and some of these suggest to the mind solids and others plain figures just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other so that we see plains in the same way that we see solids both being equally suggested by the immediate objects of sight which accordingly are themselves denominated plains and solids but though they are called by the same names with the things marked by them they are nevertheless of a nature entirely different as has been demonstrated  clix difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the above mentioned intelligence what has been said is if i mistake not sufficient to decide the question we proposed to examine concerning the ability of a pure spirit such as we have described to know geometry it is indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an intelligence because we cannot without great pains cleverly separate and disintangle in our thoughts the proper objects of sight from those of touch which are connected with them this indeed in a complete degree seems scarce possible to be performed which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it is for any one to hear the words of his native language which is familiar to him pronounced in his ears without understanding them though he endeavor to disunite the meaning from the sound it will nevertheless intrude into his thoughts and he shall find it extreme difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the posture of a foreigner that never learnt the language so as to be affected barely with the sounds themselves and not perceive the signification annexed to them  cxl the object of geometry its not being sufficiently understood cause of difficulty and useless labor in that science by this time i suppose it is clear that neither abstract nor visible extension makes the object of geometry the not discerning of which might perhaps have created some difficulty and useless labor in mathematics sure i am that somewhat relating thereto has occurred to my thoughts which though after the most anxious and repeated examination i am forced to think it true does nevertheless seem so far out of the common road of geometry that i know not whether it may not be thought presumption if i should make it public in an age wherein that science has received such mighty improvements by new methods great part whereof as well as of the ancient discoveries may perhaps lose their reputation and much of that ardor with which men study the abstruse and fine geometry be abated if what to me and those few to whom i have imparted it seems evidently true should really prove to be so  finis
