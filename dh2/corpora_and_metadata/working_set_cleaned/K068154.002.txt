dibdins selected songs  a collection of songs selected from the works of mr dibdin  if to be merrys to be wise to be wise is to be merry volume ii  london printed for the author and sold by him at his warehouse no     strand opposite the adelphi  preface i cannot resist the inclination this opportunity gives me of noticing how sincerely i rejoice that the tongue of malignity which has so opened against me on the subject of these songs is likely to be completely silenced  let it however be understood that for any private uneasiness the saucy slander ever gave me for any fear i entertained lest it should depreciate me in the opinion of the judicious and the worthy for any personal enmity i feel toward the miserable fools who are punished enough by the gnawings of their own rancour  for any of these or similar considerations i should have suffered the noisome snuff to linger till it became choked in its own fetid dregs but it has annoyed the public and therefore it is my duty to put on the extinguisher  the history of this business is very simple and selfevident i started in life with some popularity and therefore became an object of envy those who were galled at my success endeavored to crush me they knew they could not do so honestly and therefore they attempted it by villainy public indignation however so astonished the reptiles that they were glad to slink into their filthy lurking places for safety  from that time onward till within these three years  being connected with managers and musicshops and working for mere hire  i lived pretty free from calumny throwing off every kind of yoke however and standing upon my own foundation  at which time i pledged myself that my productions should not even in the minutest degree receive assistance from either manager author or composer  the vipers began again to rear their heads and many  to the reproach of manhood and the dishonor of human nature  are the wanton and wicked proofs that they are only scotehed not killed  this will be clearly evident if we notice that the medium through which they have attempted to emit their poison is a revival of the same slander which was originally levelled against my reputation and which only shows that they have more wickedness than cunning they fancy that could they induce a general belief that i imposed upon the world the productions of some other person as my own i should be held as a man void of faith or honor but what proper indignation must fill every heart if it could be brought home to conviction that the principles of this person of whom i am supposed to be merely the agent are detested and his memory execrated  could this be maintained it would cut two ways it would hold me up both professionally and morally as an impostor and stimulate the public not only to damn my works but my character poor shallowsighted idiots they indeed know nothing of the nature of public generosity they have never experienced that it constantly follows laudable industry that it ever encourages those endeavors which aim at conveying reasonable pleasure and useful instrucsion and that whom it protects it raises far above the reach of malice or detraction they only know fallen as they are that it is a bliss they dare not hope to enjoy because they are unworthy to possess it  having spoken of managers and musicshops it may not be improper to notice that in separating myself from public connections i am not actuated by any thing captious or capricious i have no wish to cavil at men who have made bargains with me to their advantage i cannot blame them for taking care of their interest nor do i believe they blame me for taking care of mine but on the contrary  particularly those with whom i have been most connected  wish well to my pursuits and would lend my exertions every advantage in their power nor is there any thing wonderful in this for it is a poor compliment to human integrity to suppose that it is not very natural in us to assist those from whom we have received assistance  putting out of the question the rascality of my slanderers i shall next examine whether there is anything like probability in their slander premising that i should not have condescended so far but for the only circumstance in all this business that gives me any thing like pain and it is that many men of strict honor and cordial good wishes toward me have even in my presence apparently given into something like a belief of what has been urged against me  such a leaven is there in the composition of man and so captivating is a novel opinion that i am afraid should there be any malignity in it there are very few who may not under particular circumstances suffer a momentary suspension of their integrity to indulge an absurd curiosity i declare i have had such questions asked me by even kind and worthy friends that had i not known an anxious solicitude had for an instant obscured probability and outran reflection i must for the sake of my honor have spit in their faces  nor is this language too strong in what way can the best friend make me amends for having indulgel even for a single moment a belief that i am the wretch these execrable villains would fain describe me but my only revenge on those who have been thus betrayed from their duty as men and tricked out of their charity as christians shall be to show upon how unsubstantial a foundation they have grounded their belief  to go into this examination then what is there in all we know of mr bickerstaff to give the faintest color to probability that he has written my songs and that i always have been and now am his intimate friend is it because whatever he has written and whatever i have written are of a totally different complexion does he write my sea songs because those in his thomas and sally are taken technically the absurdest nonsense that ever disgraced paper does the spirit of my poetry bear the characteristic of his because his was study and mine is intuition because he was timid and i am bold because what i write is temporary and for the moment when he was the tardiest and most tedious of all writers did he or could he write any thing but songs do i write any thing but ballads have i not uniformly rejected all assistance  nay the assistance of much better poets than he  and did he not court assistance from any body who would lend it him were not the suggestions of goldsmith kelly garrick nay even shuter and many others caught at by him with avidity  but did not these plain and selfevident facts laugh the assertion to scorn is it likely that a man as he was of the most offensive and insufferable vanity who never allowed the smallest spark of merit to his friends  no not even in the moment they were lending advantage to his productions  is it probable that such a man notwithstanding the merited obloquy a discerning and virtuous public has properly heaped on his head would not manifest in some way his title to a share in my popularity or to take it the other way what strange inconsistency or what singular atrocity has so marked my public career as to make me appear on one side such a fool and on the other such a knave as to risk being first discovered and afterward betrayed by the man of all others the most capable of such conduct  again what are the fascinating qualities in mr bickerstaff that should induce me to imitate him as a man and risk public benevolence for private infamy am i impelled by gratitude in return for his driving hard bargains with me of his taking advantage of my inexperience and rewarding me with a trifle for labors by which he got large sums of money for being continually unfaithful to his engagements or for running away in my debt am i enamoured of that insincerity for which he was remarkable and notorious  for that profligacy and immorality which characterised his opinions  for that supercilious hauteur through which he would affront his friends  or the pusillanimity which terrified him into begging their pardon the climax of this paragraph i will not stain my paper with my heart does not tell me that any single dispassionate man upon earth will accuse me of an inclination to emulate the above qualities and i flatter myself i shall not easily be suspected of preeminence in iniquity and now let my calumniaters with their usual truth and consistency assert that this is a panegyric on mr bickerstaff and that he wrote it  but this dare not now be ventured the public indignation is once more roused and woe to those who have provoked it my cause is become the cause of every honest man in the kingdom every mans honor every mans character and every mans interest is involved in it it is not now a question whether in common with hundreds of high distinction brilliant talents and unspotted honor i shall with indifference and contempt see the lie of the day levelled at me but it is a question whether as an innocent man i shall be protected by society or as a perjurer driven from it  this slander became at length so rank so shameless and was so universally diffused that in justice to myself as a man and a citizen i have appealed to the laws of my country disdaining to proceed otherwise than by indictment i have been granted a rule to show cause why an information should not be filed against the person who has thought proper to libel me and to obtain that rule i have sworn that i have not at any time seen mr bickerstaff nor had any correspondence with him since he absconded and that i know not whether he be alive or dead  the matter is therefore now brought to a most serious and solemn point my reputation is in the hands of the public and every man of virtue and honor must pronounce for me that no one but an unprincipled villain will hereafter dare to mention my name coupled with any insinuation of the nature i complain of unless he shall not only accuse me but convict me of perjury  i have written this preface at the solicitation and for the satisfaction of those many friends whose warm and kind anxiety shall be remembered by me while my heart feels that gratitude which is its sweetest and dearest sensation in the course of it i have carefully studied not to anticipate nor prejudge any thing before the court i have only given an unqualified contradiction of what has been alleged against me and maintained my position by such probable circumstances as suggested themselves this it was particularly my duty to do on bringing out these songs but i have not presumed to teach or dictate the subject is open to liberal discussion it is here at issue as well as at the kings bench and i am neither ashamed nor afraid of what may be the decision in either place  dibdins selected songs ballad in the whim of the moment i vow i thought you at first sight a moppet a baboon a fright or some hobgoblin of the night that guilty creatures waken with nose and chin like rams horns curled and brows in furrowed wrinkles furled well it is amazing in this world how one may be mistaken ii for now i see with half an eye you are not old nor made awry nor do your shambling trotters ply as if by palsy shaken youre young as ganemede and fair narcissus had not such an air well it is amazing i declare how one may be mistaken ballad once on a time to mighty jove complaints came from afar from men of unsuccessful love miscarriages in war in law the want of equity of mirth at city feasts of pathos in their poetry and of good works in priests ii so loud and clamorous were these clods that jove never

whistling hail enough the old gemman to scare one who threatened your life dashed below by a wave your own hand i saw snatch from a watery grave and you said twas well done for that still with the brave the noblest of glorys to spare ii when yard arm and yard arm long side of a foe when the blood from the scuppers rained on us below when crippled enough to be taken in tow to strike we saw

loves alarms with joyous heart and mind at ease time was when with resistless charms bacchus knew the way to please when while the merry glee went round gaily i saw each minute pass nor ever had i

went to sea with heavy heart of her i loved the scorn yet from my thoughts did never depart her image night or morn storms lourd waves rolled and lightning flew yet did i wish to live still willing

before the wind who cut and let her drive avast cried i twere now too kind to forget and to forgive iii while of these thoughts my mind was full while adverse hopes and fears like winds did this and that way pull she came to me in tears down went my colors and i swore for her alone i would live kissed her and promised over and over to forget and to forgive ballad the boatswain calls the wind is fair the anchor heaving our sweethearts leaving we to duty must repair where our stations well we know cast off halliards from the cleets stand by well clear all the sheets come my boys your

be on it driving that we the tapring yards must seek and back the foretopsail well we know a pleasing duty from aloft we faintly see those charms where often when returning with passion burning we fondly gaze those eyes that seem in parting with big tears to stream but come lest ours as fast should flow to the windlass once more go with yo heave ho iii now the ship is under weigh the breeze so willing the canvass filling the pressed triangle cracks the stay so taught to haul the sheet we know and now in trim we gaily sail the massy beam receives the gale while freed from duty to his beauty left on the lessening shore afar a fervent sigh heaves every tar to thank those tears for him that flow that from his true love he should go with yo heave ho ballad in the long odds and did you hear

ray of comfort i had not been left to brood over my sorrows alone to see cataracts falling and hear lions roar or the awful loud war on the deep is the fate poor flametta was born to deplore which she often would wish kinder and weep ii to all this assemblage of horrors enured what yet greater ills could one prove could one think for a heart which had so much endured fate should store up a torment like love it is too much i have decided and who shall relate when her and her miseries sleep the tale of flametta will sure wish her fate poor wretch had been kinder and weep ballad devoted to celia and blessed in her arms how i thrilled with delight as i ran over her charms when methought on each grace as i gazed with surprise for preeminence pleaded her mouth and her eyes like counsel this

fond sigh  and vain may eyes promise if i should deny  then while rows of pearls vermeil lips sweetly hide  on our different charms twere not hard to decide iii with ineffable sweetness while looking me through her eyes careless cried  why i can speak too  and in such charming language so made to control  that of sensible lovers it goes to the soul  mouths may fib but while eyes to the heart are the guide  twere no difficult task on our charms to decide vi transported with rapture i cried with an oath  charming eyes charming mouth i am in love with you both  to express your sweet influence no language has terms  one makes me a promise which the other confirms  your words and your looks are my joy and my pride  on your different claims then how can i decide ballad to a slight common wound it is some diminution diverting its throbbing to smile at the smart but where is the firm mind can boast such resolution in the face to wear smiles when the wounds in the heart the wandrings and errors of folly are treason and should be condemned as disloyal to love but reverence is due to the errors of reason which though they are a weakness we are forced to approve iii then pray cease to jest were my griefs superficial unconcerned like yourself sir i merry might be but such cruel jests can but prove prejudicial and though pastime to you may be mortal to me yet let me not wrong you by any rude mention or word that the fairness of candor might blot but gratefully just may alone the intention in my memory be cherished the action forgot ballad cursed be the sordid wretch of yore who from the bowels of the earth first drew crude heaps of shining ore stamped the rude mass and gave it worth ere yet distinctions and degrees in lovers wishes bore a part truly to love was then to please and heart was made the price of heart ii henceforth ye lovers nothing hope your fire is dead your ardour cold love has no influence power or scope but that which it derives from gold long may ye languish long expect vows lavish  wishes sighs employ a brittle temple to erect which gold can in an hour destroy ballad propitious gods that rule our fate whose ears are tired with idle prayers to banish ills that men create and chase imaginary cares and first they ask in rank and power a fate from every care exempt vain hope  ambition lasts its hour then dwindles into just contempt ii next

fools his guests retired the lord is but a solitary slave iii next to their memories they would erect a statue lasting fame to give  i ask but reason and expect my little pleasures while i live happy

prayer as love the feathered race the air or sportive fish the sea such as in breasts of seraphs spring when on the expanse of heaven they wing to greet that power by whom they sing such love i bear
