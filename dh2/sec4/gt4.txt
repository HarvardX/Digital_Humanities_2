part iv  a voyage to the country of the houyhnhnms


chapter i


the author sets out as captain of a ship  his men conspire against him
confine him a long time to his cabin and set him on shore in an unknown
land  he travels up into the country  the yahoos a strange sort of
animal described  the author meets two houyhnhnms

i continued at home with my wife and children about five months in a
very happy condition if i could have learned the lesson of knowing when
i was well  i left my poor wife big with child and accepted an
advantageous offer made me to be captain of the adventurer a stout
merchantman of 350 tons for i understood navigation well and being
grown weary of a surgeons employment at sea which however i could
exercise upon occasion i took a skilful young man of that calling one
robert purefoy into my ship  we set sail from portsmouth upon the 7th
day of september 1710 on the 14th we met with captain pocock of
bristol at teneriffe who was going to the bay of campechy to cut
logwood  on the 16th he was parted from us by a storm i heard since my
return that his ship foundered and none escaped but one cabin boy  he
was an honest man and a good sailor but a little too positive in his
own opinions which was the cause of his destruction as it has been with
several others for if he had followed my advice he might have been safe
at home with his family at this time as well as myself

i had several men who died in my ship of calentures so that i was forced
to get recruits out of barbadoes and the leeward islands where i
touched by the direction of the merchants who employed me which i had
soon too much cause to repent for i found afterwards that most of them
had been buccaneers  i had fifty hands onboard and my orders were that
i should trade with the indians in the southsea and make what
discoveries i could  these rogues whom i had picked up debauched my
other men and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship and secure
me which they did one morning rushing into my cabin and binding me
hand and foot threatening to throw me overboard if i offered to stir
i told them i was their prisoner and would submit  this they made me
swear to do and then they unbound me only fastening one of my legs with
a chain near my bed and placed a sentry at my door with his piece
charged who was commanded to shoot me dead if i attempted my liberty
they sent me own victuals and drink and took the government of the ship
to themselves  their design was to turn pirates and plunder the
spaniards which they could not do till they got more men  but first
they resolved to sell the goods in the ship and then go to madagascar
for recruits several among them having died since my confinement  they
sailed many weeks and traded with the indians but i knew not what
course they took being kept a close prisoner in my cabin and expecting
nothing less than to be murdered as they often threatened me

upon the 9th day of may 1711 one james welch came down to my cabin and
said he had orders from the captain to set me ashore  i expostulated
with him but in vain neither would he so much as tell me who their new
captain was  they forced me into the longboat letting me put on my
best suit of clothes which were as good as new and take a small bundle
of linen but no arms except my hanger and they were so civil as not to
search my pockets into which i conveyed what money i had with some
other little necessaries  they rowed about a league and then set me
down on a strand  i desired them to tell me what country it was  they
all swore they knew no more than myself but said that the captain
as they called him was resolved after they had sold the lading to
get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land  they
pushed off immediately advising me to make haste for fear of being
overtaken by the tide and so bade me farewell

in this desolate condition i advanced forward and soon got upon firm
ground where i sat down on a bank to rest myself and consider what i
had best do  when i was a little refreshed i went up into the country
resolving to deliver myself to the first savages i should meet and
purchase my life from them by some bracelets glass rings and other
toys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages and
whereof i had some about me  the land was divided by long rows of trees
not regularly planted but naturally growing there was great plenty of
grass and several fields of oats  i walked very circumspectly for fear
of being surprised or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind or on
either side  i fell into a beaten road where i saw many tracts of human
feet and some of cows but most of horses  at last i beheld several
animals in a field and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees
their shape was very singular and deformed which a little discomposed
me so that i lay down behind a thicket to observe them better  some of
them coming forward near the place where i lay gave me an opportunity of
distinctly marking their form  their heads and breasts were covered with
a thick hair some frizzled and others lank they had beards like goats
and a long ridge of hair down their backs and the fore parts of their
legs and feet but the rest of their bodies was bare so that i might see
their skins which were of a brown buff colour  they had no tails nor
any hair at all on their buttocks except about the anus which i
presume nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the
ground for this posture they used as well as lying down and often
stood on their hind feet  they climbed high trees as nimbly as a
squirrel for they had strong extended claws before and behind
terminating in sharp points and hooked  they would often spring and
bound and leap with prodigious agility  the females were not so large
as the males they had long lank hair on their heads but none on their
faces nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their
bodies except about the anus and pudenda  the dugs hung between their
fore feet and often reached almost to the ground as they walked  the
hair of both sexes was of several colours brown red black and yellow
upon the whole i never beheld in all my travels so disagreeable an
animal or one against which i naturally conceived so strong an
antipathy  so that thinking i had seen enough full of contempt and
aversion i got up and pursued the beaten road hoping it might direct
me to the cabin of some indian  i had not got far when i met one of
these creatures full in my way and coming up directly to me  the ugly
monster when he saw me distorted several ways every feature of his
visage and stared as at an object he had never seen before then
approaching nearer lifted up his forepaw whether out of curiosity or
mischief i could not tell but i drew my hanger and gave him a good blow
with the flat side of it for i durst not strike with the edge fearing
the inhabitants might be provoked against me if they should come to know
that i had killed or maimed any of their cattle  when the beast felt the
smart he drew back and roared so loud that a herd of at least forty
came flocking about me from the next field howling and making odious
faces but i ran to the body of a tree and leaning my back against it
kept them off by waving my hanger  several of this cursed brood getting
hold of the branches behind leaped up into the tree whence they began
to discharge their excrements on my head however i escaped pretty well
by sticking close to the stem of the tree but was almost stifled with
the filth which fell about me on every side

in the midst of this distress i observed them all to run away on a
sudden as fast as they could at which i ventured to leave the tree and
pursue the road wondering what it was that could put them into this
fright  but looking on my left hand i saw a horse walking softly in the
field which my persecutors having sooner discovered was the cause of
their flight  the horse started a little when he came near me but soon
recovering himself looked full in my face with manifest tokens of
wonder he viewed my hands and feet walking round me several times  i
would have pursued my journey but he placed himself directly in the way
yet looking with a very mild aspect never offering the least violence
we stood gazing at each other for some time at last i took the boldness
to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it using the
common style and whistle of jockeys when they are going to handle a
strange horse  but this animal seemed to receive my civilities with
disdain shook his head and bent his brows softly raising up his right
forefoot to remove my hand  then he neighed three or four times but in
so different a cadence that i almost began to think he was speaking to
himself in some language of his own

while he and i were thus employed another horse came up who applying
himself to the first in a very formal manner they gently struck each
others right hoof before neighing several times by turns and varying
the sound which seemed to be almost articulate  they went some paces
off as if it were to confer together walking side by side backward and
forward like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight but often
turning their eyes towards me as it were to watch that i might not
escape  i was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts
and concluded with myself that if the inhabitants of this country were
endued with a proportionable degree of reason they must needs be the
wisest people upon earth  this thought gave me so much comfort that i
resolved to go forward until i could discover some house or village or
meet with any of the natives leaving the two horses to discourse
together as they pleased  but the first who was a dapple gray
observing me to steal off neighed after me in so expressive a tone that
i fancied myself to understand what he meant whereupon i turned back
and came near to him to expect his farther commands but concealing my
fear as much as i could for i began to be in some pain how this
adventure might terminate and the reader will easily believe i did not
much like my present situation

the two horses came up close to me looking with great earnestness upon
my face and hands  the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right
forehoof and discomposed it so much that i was forced to adjust it
better by taking it off and settling it again whereat both he and his
companion who was a brown bay appeared to be much surprised the latter
felt the lappet of my coat and finding it to hang loose about me they
both looked with new signs of wonder  he stroked my right hand seeming
to admire the softness and colour but he squeezed it so hard between his
hoof and his pastern that i was forced to roar after which they both
touched me with all possible tenderness  they were under great
perplexity about my shoes and stockings which they felt very often
neighing to each other and using various gestures not unlike those of a
philosopher when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult
phenomenon

upon the whole the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and
rational so acute and judicious that i at last concluded they must
needs be magicians who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some
design and seeing a stranger in the way resolved to divert themselves
with him or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of a man so very
different in habit feature and complexion from those who might
probably live in so remote a climate  upon the strength of this
reasoning i ventured to address them in the following manner
gentlemen if you be conjurers as i have good cause to believe you can
understand my language therefore i make bold to let your worships know
that i am a poor distressed englishman driven by his misfortunes upon
your coast and i entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back as if
he were a real horse to some house or village where i can be relieved
in return of which favour i will make you a present of this knife and
bracelet taking them out of my pocket  the two creatures stood silent
while i spoke seeming to listen with great attention and when i had
ended they neighed frequently towards each other as if they were
engaged in serious conversation  i plainly observed that their language
expressed the passions very well and the words might with little pains
be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the chinese

i could frequently distinguish the word yahoo which was repeated by
each of them several times and although it was impossible for me to
conjecture what it meant yet while the two horses were busy in
conversation i endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue and as
soon as they were silent i boldly pronounced yahoo in a loud voice
imitating at the same time as near as i could the neighing of a horse
at which they were both visibly surprised and the gray repeated the same
word twice as if he meant to teach me the right accent wherein i spoke
after him as well as i could and found myself perceivably to improve
every time though very far from any degree of perfection  then the bay
tried me with a second word much harder to be pronounced but reducing
it to the english orthography may be spelt thus houyhnhnm  i did not
succeed in this so well as in the former but after two or three farther
trials i had better fortune and they both appeared amazed at my
capacity

after some further discourse which i then conjectured might relate to
me the two friends took their leaves with the same compliment of
striking each others hoof and the gray made me signs that i should walk
before him wherein i thought it prudent to comply till i could find a
better director  when i offered to slacken my pace he would cry hhuun
hhuun i guessed his meaning and gave him to understand as well as i
could that i was weary and not able to walk faster upon which he
would stand awhile to let me rest



chapter ii


the author conducted by a houyhnhnm to his house  the house described
the authors reception  the food of the houyhnhnms  the author in
distress for want of meat  is at last relieved  his manner of feeding
in this country

having travelled about three miles we came to a long kind of building
made of timber stuck in the ground and wattled across the roof was low
and covered with straw  i now began to be a little comforted and took
out some toys which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage
indians of america and other parts in hopes the people of the house
would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly  the horse made me a
sign to go in first it was a large room with a smooth clay floor and a
rack and manger extending the whole length on one side  there were
three nags and two mares not eating but some of them sitting down upon
their hams which i very much wondered at but wondered more to see the
rest employed in domestic business these seemed but ordinary cattle
however this confirmed my first opinion that a people who could so far
civilise brute animals must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the
world  the gray came in just after and thereby prevented any ill
treatment which the others might have given me  he neighed to them
several times in a style of authority and received answers

beyond this room there were three others reaching the length of the
house to which you passed through three doors opposite to each other
in the manner of a vista  we went through the second room towards the
third  here the gray walked in first beckoning me to attend i waited
in the second room and got ready my presents for the master and mistress
of the house they were two knives three bracelets of false pearls a
small lookingglass and a bead necklace  the horse neighed three or
four times and i waited to hear some answers in a human voice but i
heard no other returns than in the same dialect only one or two a little
shriller than his  i began to think that this house must belong to some
person of great note among them because there appeared so much ceremony
before i could gain admittance  but that a man of quality should be
served all by horses was beyond my comprehension  i feared my brain was
disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes  i roused myself and looked
about me in the room where i was left alone this was furnished like the
first only after a more elegant manner  i rubbed my eyes often but the
same objects still occurred  i pinched my arms and sides to awake
myself hoping i might be in a dream  i then absolutely concluded that
all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic
but i had no time to pursue these reflections for the gray horse came to
the door and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where i
saw a very comely mare together with a colt and foal sitting on their
haunches upon mats of straw not unartfully made and perfectly neat and
clean

the mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat and coming up close
after having nicely observed my hands and face gave me a most
contemptuous look and turning to the horse i heard the word yahoo
often repeated betwixt them the meaning of which word i could not then
comprehend although it was the first i had learned to pronounce  but i
was soon better informed to my everlasting mortification for the horse
beckoning to me with his head and repeating the hhuun hhuun as he
did upon the road which i understood was to attend him led me out into
a kind of court where was another building at some distance from the
house  here we entered and i saw three of those detestable creatures
which i first met after my landing feeding upon roots and the flesh of
some animals which i afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs and
now and then a cow dead by accident or disease  they were all tied by
the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam they held their food
between the claws of their fore feet and tore it with their teeth

the master horse ordered a sorrel nag one of his servants to untie the
largest of these animals and take him into the yard  the beast and i
were brought close together and by our countenances diligently compared
both by master and servant who thereupon repeated several times the word
yahoo  my horror and astonishment are not to be described when i
observed in this abominable animal a perfect human figure the face of
it indeed was flat and broad the nose depressed the lips large and the
mouth wide but these differences are common to all savage nations where
the lineaments of the countenance are distorted by the natives suffering
their infants to lie grovelling on the earth or by carrying them on
their backs nuzzling with their face against the mothers shoulders
the forefeet of the yahoo differed from my hands in nothing else but
the length of the nails the coarseness and brownness of the palms and
the hairiness on the backs  there was the same resemblance between our
feet with the same differences which i knew very well though the
horses did not because of my shoes and stockings the same in every part
of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour which i have already
described

the great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses was to see
the rest of my body so very different from that of a yahoo for which i
was obliged to my clothes whereof they had no conception  the sorrel
nag offered me a root which he held after their manner as we shall
describe in its proper place between his hoof and pastern i took it in
my hand and having smelt it returned it to him again as civilly as i
could  he brought out of the yahoos kennel a piece of asss flesh
but it smelt so offensively that i turned from it with loathing he then
threw it to the yahoo by whom it was greedily devoured  he afterwards
showed me a wisp of hay and a fetlock full of oats but i shook my head
to signify that neither of these were food for me  and indeed i now
apprehended that i must absolutely starve if i did not get to some of my
own species for as to those filthy yahoos although there were few
greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself yet i confess i never
saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts and the more i
came near them the more hateful they grew while i stayed in that
country  this the master horse observed by my behaviour and therefore
sent the yahoo back to his kennel  he then put his forehoof to his
mouth at which i was much surprised although he did it with ease and
with a motion that appeared perfectly natural and made other signs to
know what i would eat but i could not return him such an answer as he
was able to apprehend and if he had understood me i did not see how it
was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment  while
we were thus engaged i observed a cow passing by whereupon i pointed to
her and expressed a desire to go and milk her  this had its effect for
he led me back into the house and ordered a mareservant to open a room
where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels after a
very orderly and cleanly manner  she gave me a large bowlful of which i
drank very heartily and found myself well refreshed

about noon i saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a
sledge by four yahoos  there was in it an old steed who seemed to be
of quality he alighted with his hindfeet forward having by accident
got a hurt in his left forefoot  he came to dine with our horse who
received him with great civility  they dined in the best room and had
oats boiled in milk for the second course which the old horse ate warm
but the rest cold  their mangers were placed circular in the middle of
the room and divided into several partitions round which they sat on
their haunches upon bosses of straw  in the middle was a large rack
with angles answering to every partition of the manger so that each
horse and mare ate their own hay and their own mash of oats and milk
with much decency and regularity  the behaviour of the young colt and
foal appeared very modest and that of the master and mistress extremely
cheerful and complaisant to their guest  the gray ordered me to stand by
him and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me
as i found by the strangers often looking on me and the frequent
repetition of the word yahoo

i happened to wear my gloves which the master gray observing seemed
perplexed discovering signs of wonder what i had done to my forefeet
he put his hoof three or four times to them as if he would signify that
i should reduce them to their former shape which i presently did
pulling off both my gloves and putting them into my pocket  this
occasioned farther talk and i saw the company was pleased with my
behaviour whereof i soon found the good effects  i was ordered to speak
the few words i understood and while they were at dinner the master
taught me the names for oats milk fire water and some others which i
could readily pronounce after him having from my youth a great facility
in learning languages

when dinner was done the master horse took me aside and by signs and
words made me understand the concern he was in that i had nothing to eat
oats in their tongue are called hlunnh  this word i pronounced two or
three times for although i had refused them at first yet upon second
thoughts i considered that i could contrive to make of them a kind of
bread which might be sufficient with milk to keep me alive till i
could make my escape to some other country and to creatures of my own
species  the horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his
family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray
these i heated before the fire as well as i could and rubbed them till
the husks came off which i made a shift to winnow from the grain  i
ground and beat them between two stones then took water and made them
into a paste or cake which i toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk
it was at first a very insipid diet though common enough in many parts
of europe but grew tolerable by time and having been often reduced to
hard fare in my life this was not the first experiment i had made how
easily nature is satisfied  and i cannot but observe that i never had
one hours sickness while i stayed in this island  it is true i
sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit or bird by springs made of
yahoos hairs and i often gathered wholesome herbs which i boiled
and ate as salads with my bread and now and then for a rarity i made a
little butter and drank the whey  i was at first at a great loss for
salt but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it and i am confident
that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury and was
first introduced only as a provocative to drink except where it is
necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages or in places remote from
great markets for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man and as
to myself when i left this country it was a great while before i could
endure the taste of it in anything that i ate

this is enough to say upon the subject of my diet wherewith other
travellers fill their books as if the readers were personally concerned
whether we fare well or ill  however it was necessary to mention this
matter lest the world should think it impossible that i could find
sustenance for three years in such a country and among such inhabitants

when it grew towards evening the master horse ordered a place for me to
lodge in it was but six yards from the house and separated from the
stable of the yahoos  here i got some straw and covering myself with
my own clothes slept very sound  but i was in a short time better
accommodated as the reader shall know hereafter when i come to treat
more particularly about my way of living



chapter iii


the author studies to learn the language  the houyhnhnm his master
assists in teaching him  the language described  several houyhnhnms of
quality come out of curiosity to see the author  he gives his master a
short account of his voyage

my principal endeavour was to learn the language which my master for so
i shall henceforth call him and his children and every servant of his
house were desirous to teach me for they looked upon it as a prodigy
that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature  i
pointed to every thing and inquired the name of it which i wrote down
in my journalbook when i was alone and corrected my bad accent by
desiring those of the family to pronounce it often  in this employment
a sorrel nag one of the underservants was very ready to assist me

in speaking they pronounced through the nose and throat and their
language approaches nearest to the highdutch or german of any i know
in europe but is much more graceful and significant  the emperor
charles v made almost the same observation when he said that if he
were to speak to his horse it should be in highdutch

the curiosity and impatience of my master were so great that he spent
many hours of his leisure to instruct me  he was convinced as he
afterwards told me that i must be a yahoo but my teachableness
civility and cleanliness astonished him which were qualities
altogether opposite to those animals  he was most perplexed about my
clothes reasoning sometimes with himself whether they were a part of my
body for i never pulled them off till the family were asleep and got
them on before they waked in the morning  my master was eager to learn
whence i came how i acquired those appearances of reason which i
discovered in all my actions and to know my story from my own mouth
which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency i made in
learning and pronouncing their words and sentences  to help my memory
i formed all i learned into the english alphabet and writ the words
down with the translations  this last after some time i ventured to
do in my masters presence  it cost me much trouble to explain to him
what i was doing for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or
literature

in about ten weeks time i was able to understand most of his questions
and in three months could give him some tolerable answers  he was
extremely curious to know from what part of the country i came and how
i was taught to imitate a rational creature because the yahoos whom
he saw i exactly resembled in my head hands and face that were only
visible with some appearance of cunning and the strongest disposition
to mischief were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes  i
answered that i came over the sea from a far place with many others
of my own kind in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees
that my companions forced me to land on this coast and then left me to
shift for myself  it was with some difficulty and by the help of many
signs that i brought him to understand me  he replied that i must
needs be mistaken or that i said the thing which was not for they have
no word in their language to express lying or falsehood  he knew it was
impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea or that a parcel
of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water  he
was sure no houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel nor would trust
yahoos to manage it

the word houyhnhnm in their tongue signifies a horse and in its
etymology the perfection of nature  i told my master that i was at
a loss for expression but would improve as fast as i could and hoped
in a short time i should be able to tell him wonders  he was pleased
to direct his own mare his colt and foal and the servants of the
family to take all opportunities of instructing me and every day for
two or three hours he was at the same pains himself  several horses and
mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house upon the
report spread of a wonderful yahoo that could speak like a
houyhnhnm and seemed in his words and actions to discover some
glimmerings of reason  these delighted to converse with me they put
many questions and received such answers as i was able to return  by
all these advantages i made so great a progress that in five months
from my arrival i understood whatever was spoken and could express
myself tolerably well

the houyhnhnms who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing
and talking with me could hardly believe me to be a right yahoo
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind  they
were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin except on
my head face and hands but i discovered that secret to my master upon
an accident which happened about a fortnight before

i have already told the reader that every night when the family were
gone to bed it was my custom to strip and cover myself with my clothes
it happened one morning early that my master sent for me by the sorrel
nag who was his valet  when he came i was fast asleep my clothes
fallen off on one side and my shirt above my waist  i awaked at the
noise he made and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder
after which he went to my master and in a great fright gave him a very
confused account of what he had seen  this i presently discovered for
going as soon as i was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour he
asked me the meaning of what his servant had reported that i was not
the same thing when i slept as i appeared to be at other times that his
vale assured him some part of me was white some yellow at least not so
white and some brown

i had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress in order to distinguish
myself as much as possible from that cursed race of yahoos but now i
found it in vain to do so any longer  besides i considered that my
clothes and shoes would soon wear out which already were in a declining
condition and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of
yahoos or other brutes whereby the whole secret would be known  i
therefore told my master that in the country whence i came those of my
kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals
prepared by art as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air
both hot and cold of which as to my own person i would give him
immediate conviction if he pleased to command me only desiring his
excuse if i did not expose those parts that nature taught us to
conceal  he said my discourse was all very strange but especially
the last part for he could not understand why nature should teach us to
conceal what nature had given that neither himself nor family were
ashamed of any parts of their bodies but however i might do as i
pleased  whereupon i first unbuttoned my coat and pulled it off  i
did the same with my waistcoat  i drew off my shoes stockings and
breeches  i let my shirt down to my waist and drew up the bottom
fastening it like a girdle about my middle to hide my nakedness

my master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity
and admiration  he took up all my clothes in his pastern one piece
after another and examined them diligently he then stroked my body very
gently and looked round me several times after which he said it was
plain i must be a perfect yahoo but that i differed very much from the
rest of my species in the softness whiteness and smoothness of my skin
my want of hair in several parts of my body the shape and shortness of
my claws behind and before and my affectation of walking continually on
my two hinder feet  he desired to see no more and gave me leave to put
on my clothes again for i was shuddering with cold

i expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of
yahoo an odious animal for which i had so utter a hatred and
contempt i begged he would forbear applying that word to me and make
the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to
see me  i requested likewise that the secret of my having a false
covering to my body might be known to none but himself at least as long
as my present clothing should last for as to what the sorrel nag his
valet had observed his honour might command him to conceal it

all this my master very graciously consented to and thus the secret was
kept till my clothes began to wear out which i was forced to supply by
several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned  in the meantime
he desired i would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their
language because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and
reason than at the figure of my body whether it were covered or not
adding that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which i
promised to tell him

thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me he
brought me into all company and made them treat me with civility
because as he told them privately this would put me into good
humour and make me more diverting

every day when i waited on him beside the trouble he was at in
teaching he would ask me several questions concerning myself which i
answered as well as i could and by these means he had already received
some general ideas though very imperfect  it would be tedious to relate
the several steps by which i advanced to a more regular conversation but
the first account i gave of myself in any order and length was to this
purpose

that i came from a very far country as i already had attempted to tell
him with about fifty more of my own species that we travelled upon the
seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood and larger than his honours
house  i described the ship to him in the best terms i could and
explained by the help of my handkerchief displayed how it was driven
forward by the wind  that upon a quarrel among us i was set on shore on
this coast where i walked forward without knowing whither till he
delivered me from the persecution of those execrable yahoos  he asked
me who made the ship and how it was possible that the houyhnhnms of
my country would leave it to the management of brutes  my answer was
that i durst proceed no further in my relation unless he would give me
his word and honour that he would not be offended and then i would tell
him the wonders i had so often promised  he agreed and i went on by
assuring him that the ship was made by creatures like myself who in
all the countries i had travelled as well as in my own were the only
governing rational animals and that upon my arrival hither i was as
much astonished to see the houyhnhnms act like rational beings as he
or his friends could be in finding some marks of reason in a creature
he was pleased to call a yahoo to which i owned my resemblance in
every part but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature
i said farther that if good fortune ever restored me to my native
country to relate my travels hither as i resolved to do everybody
would believe that i said the thing that was not that i invented the
story out of my own head and with all possible respect to himself his
family and friends and under his promise of not being offended our
countrymen would hardly think it probable that a houyhnhnm should be
the presiding creature of a nation and a yahoo the brute



chapter iv


the houyhnhnms notion of truth and falsehood  the authors discourse
disapproved by his master  the author gives a more particular account of
himself and the accidents of his voyage

my master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his
countenance because doubting or not believing are so little known in
this country that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves
under such circumstances  and i remember in frequent discourses with my
master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world
having occasion to talk of lying and false representation it was with
much difficulty that he comprehended what i meant although he had
otherwise a most acute judgment  for he argued thus that the use of
speech was to make us understand one another and to receive information
of facts now if any one said the thing which was not these ends were
defeated because i cannot properly be said to understand him and i am
so far from receiving information that he leaves me worse than in
ignorance for i am led to believe a thing black when it is white and
short when it is long  and these were all the notions he had
concerning that faculty of lying so perfectly well understood and so
universally practised among human creatures

to return from this digression  when i asserted that the yahoos were
the only governing animals in my country which my master said was
altogether past his conception he desired to know whether we had
houyhnhnms among us and what was their employment  i told him we
had great numbers that in summer they grazed in the fields and in
winter were kept in houses with hay and oats where yahoo servants were
employed to rub their skins smooth comb their manes pick their feet
serve them with food and make their beds  i understand you well
said my master it is now very plain from all you have spoken that
whatever share of reason the yahoos pretend to the houyhnhnms are
your masters i heartily wish our yahoos would be so tractable  i
begged his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further
because i was very certain that the account he expected from me would be
highly displeasing  but he insisted in commanding me to let him know
the best and the worst  i told him he should be obeyed  i owned that
the houyhnhnms among us whom we called horses were the most generous
and comely animals we had that they excelled in strength and swiftness
and when they belonged to persons of quality were employed in
travelling racing or drawing chariots they were treated with much
kindness and care till they fell into diseases or became foundered in
the feet but then they were sold and used to all kind of drudgery till
they died after which their skins were stripped and sold for what they
were worth and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of
prey  but the common race of horses had not so good fortune being kept
by farmers and carriers and other mean people who put them to greater
labour and fed them worse  i described as well as i could our way of
riding the shape and use of a bridle a saddle a spur and a whip of
harness and wheels  i added that we fastened plates of a certain hard
substance called iron at the bottom of their feet to preserve their
hoofs from being broken by the stony ways on which we often travelled

my master after some expressions of great indignation wondered how we
dared to venture upon a houyhnhnms back for he was sure that the
weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest
yahoo or by lying down and rolling on his back squeeze the brute to
death  i answered that our horses were trained up from three or four
years old to the several uses we intended them for that if any of them
proved intolerably vicious they were employed for carriages that they
were severely beaten while they were young for any mischievous tricks
that the males designed for the common use of riding or draught were
generally castrated about two years after their birth to take down their
spirits and make them more tame and gentle that they were indeed
sensible of rewards and punishments but his honour would please to
consider that they had not the least tincture of reason any more than
the yahoos in this country

it put me to the pains of many circumlocutions to give my master a right
idea of what i spoke for their language does not abound in variety of
words because their wants and passions are fewer than among us  but it
is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of
the houyhnhnm race particularly after i had explained the manner and
use of castrating horses among us to hinder them from propagating their
kind and to render them more servile  he said if it were possible
there could be any country where yahoos alone were endued with reason
they certainly must be the governing animal because reason in time will
always prevail against brutal strength  but considering the frame of
our bodies and especially of mine he thought no creature of equal bulk
was so illcontrived for employing that reason in the common offices of
life whereupon he desired to know whether those among whom i lived
resembled me or the yahoos of his country  i assured him that i
was as well shaped as most of my age but the younger and the females
were much more soft and tender and the skins of the latter generally as
white as milk  he said i differed indeed from other yahoos being
much more cleanly and not altogether so deformed but in point of real
advantage he thought i differed for the worse that my nails were of no
use either to my fore or hinder feet as to my fore feet he could not
properly call them by that name for he never observed me to walk upon
them that they were too soft to bear the ground that i generally went
with them uncovered neither was the covering i sometimes wore on them of
the same shape or so strong as that on my feet behind that i could not
walk with any security for if either of my hinder feet slipped i must
inevitably fall  he then began to find fault with other parts of my
body the flatness of my face the prominence of my nose mine eyes
placed directly in front so that i could not look on either side without
turning my head that i was not able to feed myself without lifting one
of my forefeet to my mouth and therefore nature had placed those joints
to answer that necessity  he knew not what could be the use of those
several clefts and divisions in my feet behind that these were too soft
to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones without a covering made
from the skin of some other brute that my whole body wanted a fence
against heat and cold which i was forced to put on and off every day
with tediousness and trouble and lastly that he observed every animal
in this country naturally to abhor the yahoos whom the weaker avoided
and the stronger drove from them  so that supposing us to have the gift
of reason he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural
antipathy which every creature discovered against us nor consequently
how we could tame and render them serviceable  however he would as he
said debate the matter no farther because he was more desirous to know
my own story the country where i was born and the several actions and
events of my life before i came hither

i assured him how extremely desirous i was that he should be satisfied
on every point but i doubted much whether it would be possible for me
to explain myself on several subjects whereof his honour could have no
conception because i saw nothing in his country to which i could
resemble them that however i would do my best and strive to express
myself by similitudes humbly desiring his assistance when i wanted
proper words which he was pleased to promise me

i said my birth was of honest parents in an island called england
which was remote from his country as many days journey as the strongest
of his honours servants could travel in the annual course of the sun
that i was bred a surgeon whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in
the body gotten by accident or violence that my country was governed by
a female man whom we called queen that i left it to get riches whereby
i might maintain myself and family when i should return that in my
last voyage i was commander of the ship and had about fifty yahoos
under me many of which died at sea and i was forced to supply them by
others picked out from several nations that our ship was twice in danger
of being sunk the first time by a great storm and the second by
striking against a rock  here my master interposed by asking me how
i could persuade strangers out of different countries to venture with
me after the losses i had sustained and the hazards i had run  i
said they were fellows of desperate fortunes forced to fly from the
places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes  some
were undone by lawsuits others spent all they had in drinking whoring
and gaming others fled for treason many for murder theft poisoning
robbery perjury forgery coining false money for committing rapes or
sodomy for flying from their colours or deserting to the enemy and
most of them had broken prison none of these durst return to their
native countries for fear of being hanged or of starving in a jail and
therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other
places

during this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me several
times  i had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the
nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced
to fly their country  this labour took up several days conversation
before he was able to comprehend me  he was wholly at a loss to know
what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices  to clear
up which i endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and
riches of the terrible effects of lust intemperance malice and envy
all this i was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making
suppositions  after which like one whose imagination was struck with
something never seen or heard of before he would lift up his eyes with
amazement and indignation  power government war law punishment and
a thousand other things had no terms wherein that language could express
them which made the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master any
conception of what i meant  but being of an excellent understanding
much improved by contemplation and converse he at last arrived at a
competent knowledge of what human nature in our parts of the world is
capable to perform and desired i would give him some particular account
of that land which we call europe but especially of my own country



chapter v


the author at his masters command informs him of the state of england
the causes of war among the princes of europe  the author begins to
explain the english constitution

the reader may please to observe that the following extract of many
conversations i had with my master contains a summary of the most
material points which were discoursed at several times for above two
years his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction as i farther
improved in the houyhnhnm tongue  i laid before him as well as i
could the whole state of europe i discoursed of trade and manufactures
of arts and sciences and the answers i gave to all the questions he
made as they arose upon several subjects were a fund of conversation
not to be exhausted  but i shall here only set down the substance of
what passed between us concerning my own country reducing it in order as
well as i can without any regard to time or other circumstances while i
strictly adhere to truth  my only concern is that i shall hardly be
able to do justice to my masters arguments and expressions which must
needs suffer by my want of capacity as well as by a translation into our
barbarous english

in obedience therefore to his honours commands i related to him the
revolution under the prince of orange the long war with france entered
into by the said prince and renewed by his successor the present queen
wherein the greatest powers of christendom were engaged and which still
continued i computed at his request that about a million of yahoos
might have been killed in the whole progress of it and perhaps a hundred
or more cities taken and five times as many ships burnt or sunk

he asked me what were the usual causes or motives that made one country
go to war with another  i answered they were innumerable but i should
only mention a few of the chief  sometimes the ambition of princes who
never think they have land or people enough to govern sometimes the
corruption of ministers who engage their master in a war in order to
stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil
administration  difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives
for instance whether flesh be bread or bread be flesh whether the
juice of a certain berry be blood or wine whether whistling be a vice or
a virtue whether it be better to kiss a post or throw it into the fire
what is the best colour for a coat whether black white red or gray
and whether it should be long or short narrow or wide dirty or clean
with many more  neither are any wars so furious and bloody or of so
long a continuance as those occasioned by difference in opinion
especially if it be in things indifferent

sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them
shall dispossess a third of his dominions where neither of them pretend
to any right  sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the
other should quarrel with him  sometimes a war is entered upon because
the enemy is too strong and sometimes because he is too weak
sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have or have the
things which we want and we both fight till they take ours or give us
theirs  it is a very justifiable cause of a war to invade a country
after the people have been wasted by famine destroyed by pestilence or
embroiled by factions among themselves  it is justifiable to enter into
war against our nearest ally when one of his towns lies convenient for
us or a territory of land that would render our dominions round and
complete  if a prince sends forces into a nation where the people are
poor and ignorant he may lawfully put half of them to death and make
slaves of the rest in order to civilize and reduce them from their
barbarous way of living  it is a very kingly honourable and frequent
practice when one prince desires the assistance of another to secure
him against an invasion that the assistant when he has driven out the
invader should seize on the dominions himself and kill imprison or
banish the prince he came to relieve  alliance by blood or marriage
is a frequent cause of war between princes and the nearer the kindred
is the greater their disposition to quarrel poor nations are hungry
and rich nations are proud and pride and hunger will ever be at
variance  for these reasons the trade of a soldier is held the most
honourable of all others because a soldier is a yahoo hired to kill
in cold blood as many of his own species who have never offended him
as possibly he can

there is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in europe not able to make
war by themselves who hire out their troops to richer nations for so
much a day to each man of which they keep threefourths to themselves
and it is the best part of their maintenance such are those in many
northern parts of europe

what you have told me said my master upon the subject of war does
indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to
however it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger and that
nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief  for your
mouths lying flat with your faces you can hardly bite each other to any
purpose unless by consent  then as to the claws upon your feet before
and behind they are so short and tender that one of our yahoos would
drive a dozen of yours before him  and therefore in recounting the
numbers of those who have been killed in battle i cannot but think you
have said the thing which is not

i could not forbear shaking my head and smiling a little at his
ignorance  and being no stranger to the art of war i gave him a
description of cannons culverins muskets carabines pistols bullets
powder swords bayonets battles sieges retreats attacks undermines
countermines bombardments sea fights ships sunk with a thousand men
twenty thousand killed on each side dying groans limbs flying in the
air smoke noise confusion trampling to death under horses feet
flight pursuit victory fields strewed with carcases left for food to
dogs and wolves and birds of prey plundering stripping ravishing
burning and destroying  and to set forth the valour of my own dear
countrymen i assured him that i had seen them blow up a hundred
enemies at once in a siege and as many in a ship and beheld the dead
bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds to the great diversion of the
spectators

i was going on to more particulars when my master commanded me silence
he said whoever understood the nature of yahoos might easily believe
it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action i had
named if their strength and cunning equalled their malice  but as my
discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species so he found
it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger
before  he thought his ears being used to such abominable words might
by degrees admit them with less detestation that although he hated the
yahoos of this country yet he no more blamed them for their odious
qualities than he did a gnnayh a bird of prey for its cruelty or a
sharp stone for cutting his hoof  but when a creature pretending to
reason could be capable of such enormities he dreaded lest the
corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself  he
seemed therefore confident that instead of reason we were only
possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices as the
reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen
body not only larger but more distorted

he added that he had heard too much upon the subject of war both in
this and some former discourses  there was another point which a little
perplexed him at present  i had informed him that some of our crew left
their country on account of being ruined by law that i had already
explained the meaning of the word but he was at a loss how it should
come to pass that the law which was intended for every mans
preservation should be any mans ruin  therefore he desired to be
further satisfied what i meant by law and the dispensers thereof
according to the present practice in my own country because he thought
nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal as we
pretended to be in showing us what he ought to do and what to avoid

i assured his honour that the law was a science in which i had not much
conversed further than by employing advocates in vain upon some
injustices that had been done me however i would give him all the
satisfaction i was able

i said there was a society of men among us bred up from their youth in
the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose that white is
black and black is white according as they are paid  to this society
all the rest of the people are slaves  for example if my neighbour has
a mind to my cow he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow
from me  i must then hire another to defend my right it being against
all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself
now in this case i who am the right owner lie under two great
disadvantages first my lawyer being practised almost from his cradle
in defending falsehood is quite out of his element when he would be an
advocate for justice which is an unnatural office he always attempts
with great awkwardness if not with illwill  the second disadvantage
is that my lawyer must proceed with great caution or else he will be
reprimanded by the judges and abhorred by his brethren as one that
would lessen the practice of the law  and therefore i have but two
methods to preserve my cow  the first is to gain over my adversarys
lawyer with a double fee who will then betray his client by insinuating
that he hath justice on his side  the second way is for my lawyer to
make my cause appear as unjust as he can by allowing the cow to belong
to my adversary and this if it be skilfully done will certainly
bespeak the favour of the bench  now your honour is to know that these
judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property as
well as for the trial of criminals and picked out from the most
dexterous lawyers who are grown old or lazy and having been biassed all
their lives against truth and equity lie under such a fatal necessity of
favouring fraud perjury and oppression that i have known some of them
refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay rather than injure
the faculty by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office

it is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before
may legally be done again and therefore they take special care to record
all the decisions formerly made against common justice and the general
reason of mankind  these under the name of precedents they produce as
authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions and the judges never
fail of directing accordingly

in pleading they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the
cause but are loud violent and tedious in dwelling upon all
circumstances which are not to the purpose  for instance in the case
already mentioned they never desire to know what claim or title my
adversary has to my cow but whether the said cow were red or black her
horns long or short whether the field i graze her in be round or square
whether she was milked at home or abroad what diseases she is subject
to and the like after which they consult precedents adjourn the cause
from time to time and in ten twenty or thirty years come to an issue

it is likewise to be observed that this society has a peculiar cant and
jargon of their own that no other mortal can understand and wherein all
their laws are written which they take special care to multiply whereby
they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood of
right and wrong so that it will take thirty years to decide whether the
field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to a
stranger three hundred miles off

in the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state the method
is much more short and commendable the judge first sends to sound the
disposition of those in power after which he can easily hang or save a
criminal strictly preserving all due forms of law

here my master interposing said it was a pity that creatures endowed
with such prodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers by the
description i gave of them must certainly be were not rather encouraged
to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge  in answer to which
i assured his honour that in all points out of their own trade they
were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us the most
despicable in common conversation avowed enemies to all knowledge and
learning and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind
in every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession



chapter vi


a continuation of the state of england under queen anne  the character
of a first minister of state in european courts

my master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could
incite this race of lawyers to perplex disquiet and weary themselves
and engage in a confederacy of injustice merely for the sake of injuring
their fellowanimals neither could he comprehend what i meant in saying
they did it for hire  whereupon i was at much pains to describe to him
the use of money the materials it was made of and the value of the
metals that when a yahoo had got a great store of this precious
substance he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to the finest
clothing the noblest houses great tracts of land the most costly meats
and drinks and have his choice of the most beautiful females  therefore
since money alone was able to perform all these feats our yahoos
thought they could never have enough of it to spend or to save as they
found themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or
avarice that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor mans labour
and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former that
the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably by labouring every
day for small wages to make a few live plentifully

i enlarged myself much on these and many other particulars to the same
purpose but his honour was still to seek for he went upon a
supposition that all animals had a title to their share in the
productions of the earth and especially those who presided over the
rest  therefore he desired i would let him know what these costly
meats were and how any of us happened to want them  whereupon i
enumerated as many sorts as came into my head with the various methods
of dressing them which could not be done without sending vessels by sea
to every part of the world as well for liquors to drink as for sauces
and innumerable other conveniences  i assured him that this whole globe
of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better
female yahoos could get her breakfast or a cup to put it in  he said
that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its
own inhabitants  but what he chiefly wondered at was how such vast
tracts of ground as i described should be wholly without fresh water and
the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink  i
replied that england the dear place of my nativity was computed to
produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are
able to consume as well as liquors extracted from grain or pressed out
of the fruit of certain trees which made excellent drink and the same
proportion in every other convenience of life  but in order to feed the
luxury and intemperance of the males and the vanity of the females we
sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries
whence in return we brought the materials of diseases folly and vice
to spend among ourselves  hence it follows of necessity that vast
numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging
robbing stealing cheating pimping flattering suborning forswearing
forging gaming lying fawning hectoring voting scribbling
stargazing poisoning whoring canting libelling freethinking and
the like occupations every one of which terms i was at much pains to
make him understand

that wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the
want of water or other drinks but because it was a sort of liquid which
made us merry by putting us out of our senses diverted all melancholy
thoughts begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain raised our
hopes and banished our fears suspended every office of reason for a
time and deprived us of the use of our limbs till we fell into a
profound sleep although it must be confessed that we always awaked sick
and dispirited and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases
which made our lives uncomfortable and short

but beside all this the bulk of our people supported themselves by
furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to
each other  for instance when i am at home and dressed as i ought to
be i carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen the
building and furniture of my house employ as many more and five times
the number to adorn my wife

i was going on to tell him of another sort of people who get their
livelihood by attending the sick having upon some occasions informed
his honour that many of my crew had died of diseases  but here it was
with the utmost difficulty that i brought him to apprehend what i meant
he could easily conceive that a houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy a few
days before his death or by some accident might hurt a limb but that
nature who works all things to perfection should suffer any pains to
breed in our bodies he thought impossible and desired to know the
reason of so unaccountable an evil

i told him we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each
other that we ate when we were not hungry and drank without the
provocation of thirst that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors
without eating a bit which disposed us to sloth inflamed our bodies
and precipitated or prevented digestion that prostitute female yahoos
acquired a certain malady which bred rottenness in the bones of those
who fell into their embraces that this and many other diseases were
propagated from father to son so that great numbers came into the world
with complicated maladies upon them that it would be endless to give him
a catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies for they would not
be fewer than five or six hundred spread over every limb and joint—in
short every part external and intestine having diseases appropriated
to itself  to remedy which there was a sort of people bred up among us
in the profession or pretence of curing the sick  and because i had
some skill in the faculty i would in gratitude to his honour let him
know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed

their fundamental is that all diseases arise from repletion whence
they conclude that a great evacuation of the body is necessary either
through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth  their next business
is from herbs minerals gums oils shells salts juices seaweed
excrements barks of trees serpents toads frogs spiders dead mens
flesh and bones birds beasts and fishes to form a composition for
smell and taste the most abominable nauseous and detestable they can
possibly contrive which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing
and this they call a vomit or else from the same storehouse with some
other poisonous additions they command us to take in at the orifice
above or below just as the physician then happens to be disposed a
medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels which relaxing
the belly drives down all before it and this they call a purge or a
clyster  for nature as the physicians allege having intended the
superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and
liquids and the inferior posterior for ejection these artists
ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her
seat therefore to replace her in it the body must be treated in a
manner directly contrary by interchanging the use of each orifice
forcing solids and liquids in at the anus and making evacuations at the
mouth

but besides real diseases we are subject to many that are only
imaginary for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures these
have their several names and so have the drugs that are proper for them
and with these our female yahoos are always infested

one great excellency in this tribe is their skill at prognostics
wherein they seldom fail their predictions in real diseases when they
rise to any degree of malignity generally portending death which is
always in their power when recovery is not and therefore upon any
unexpected signs of amendment after they have pronounced their sentence
rather than be accused as false prophets they know how to approve their
sagacity to the world by a seasonable dose

they are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown
weary of their mates to eldest sons to great ministers of state and
often to princes

i had formerly upon occasion discoursed with my master upon the nature
of government in general and particularly of our own excellent
constitution deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world  but
having here accidentally mentioned a minister of state he commanded me
some time after to inform him what species of yahoo i particularly
meant by that appellation

i told him that a first or chief minister of state who was the person
i intended to describe was the creature wholly exempt from joy and
grief love and hatred pity and anger at least makes use of no other
passions but a violent desire of wealth power and titles that he
applies his words to all uses except to the indication of his mind that
he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it for a
lie nor a lie but with a design that you should take it for a truth
that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of
preferment and whenever he begins to praise you to others or to
yourself you are from that day forlorn  the worst mark you can receive
is a promise especially when it is confirmed with an oath after which
every wise man retires and gives over all hopes

there are three methods by which a man may rise to be chief minister
the first is by knowing how with prudence to dispose of a wife a
daughter or a sister the second by betraying or undermining his
predecessor and the third is by a furious zeal in public assemblies
against the corruptions of the court  but a wise prince would rather
choose to employ those who practise the last of these methods because
such zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will
and passions of their master  that these ministers having all
employments at their disposal preserve themselves in power by bribing
the majority of a senate or great council and at last by an expedient
called an act of indemnity whereof i described the nature to him
they secure themselves from afterreckonings and retire from the public
laden with the spoils of the nation

the palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his
own trade the pages lackeys and porters by imitating their master
become ministers of state in their several districts and learn to excel
in the three principal ingredients of insolence lying and bribery
accordingly they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the
best rank and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence arrive
through several gradations to be successors to their lord

he is usually governed by a decayed wench or favourite footman who are
the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed and may properly be
called in the last resort the governors of the kingdom

one day in discourse my master having heard me mention the nobility of
my country was pleased to make me a compliment which i could not pretend
to deserve that he was sure i must have been born of some noble family
because i far exceeded in shape colour and cleanliness all the
yahoos of his nation although i seemed to fail in strength and
agility which must be imputed to my different way of living from those
other brutes and besides i was not only endowed with the faculty of
speech but likewise with some rudiments of reason to a degree that
with all his acquaintance i passed for a prodigy

he made me observe that among the houyhnhnms the white the sorrel
and the irongray were not so exactly shaped as the bay the
dapplegray and the black nor born with equal talents of mind or a
capacity to improve them and therefore continued always in the condition
of servants without ever aspiring to match out of their own race which
in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural

i made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he
was pleased to conceive of me but assured him at the same time that my
birth was of the lower sort having been born of plain honest parents
who were just able to give me a tolerable education that nobility among
us was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it that our
young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury
that as soon as years will permit they consume their vigour and
contract odious diseases among lewd females and when their fortunes are
almost ruined they marry some woman of mean birth disagreeable person
and unsound constitution merely for the sake of money whom they hate
and despise  that the productions of such marriages are generally
scrofulous rickety or deformed children by which means the family
seldom continues above three generations unless the wife takes care to
provide a healthy father among her neighbours or domestics in order to
improve and continue the breed  that a weak diseased body a meagre
countenance and sallow complexion are the true marks of noble blood
and a healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in a man of quality
that the world concludes his real father to have been a groom or a
coachman  the imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his
body being a composition of spleen dullness ignorance caprice
sensuality and pride

without the consent of this illustrious body no law can be enacted
repealed or altered and these nobles have likewise the decision of all
our possessions without appeal 514



chapter vii


the authors great love of his native country  his masters observations
upon the constitution and administration of england as described by the
author with parallel cases and comparisons  his masters observations
upon human nature

the reader may be disposed to wonder how i could prevail on myself to
give so free a representation of my own species among a race of mortals
who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind from
that entire congruity between me and their yahoos  but i must freely
confess that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds placed in
opposite view to human corruptions had so far opened my eyes and
enlarged my understanding that i began to view the actions and passions
of man in a very different light and to think the honour of my own kind
not worth managing which besides it was impossible for me to do
before a person of so acute a judgment as my master who daily convinced
me of a thousand faults in myself whereof i had not the least perception
before and which with us would never be numbered even among human
infirmities  i had likewise learned from his example an utter
detestation of all falsehood or disguise and truth appeared so amiable
to me that i determined upon sacrificing every thing to it

let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet
a much stronger motive for the freedom i took in my representation of
things  i had not yet been a year in this country before i contracted
such a love and veneration for the inhabitants that i entered on a firm
resolution never to return to humankind but to pass the rest of my life
among these admirable houyhnhnms in the contemplation and practice of
every virtue where i could have no example or incitement to vice  but
it was decreed by fortune my perpetual enemy that so great a felicity
should not fall to my share  however it is now some comfort to reflect
that in what i said of my countrymen i extenuated their faults as much
as i durst before so strict an examiner and upon every article gave as
favourable a turn as the matter would bear  for indeed who is there
alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of
his birth

i have related the substance of several conversations i had with my
master during the greatest part of the time i had the honour to be in his
service but have indeed for brevity sake omitted much more than is
here set down

when i had answered all his questions and his curiosity seemed to be
fully satisfied he sent for me one morning early and commanded me to
sit down at some distance an honour which he had never before conferred
upon me  he said he had been very seriously considering my whole
story as far as it related both to myself and my country that he looked
upon us as a sort of animals to whose share by what accident he could
not conjecture some small pittance of reason had fallen whereof we made
no other use than by its assistance to aggravate our natural
corruptions and to acquire new ones which nature had not given us that
we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed had been
very successful in multiplying our original wants and seemed to spend
our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions
that as to myself it was manifest i had neither the strength nor
agility of a common yahoo that i walked infirmly on my hinder feet
had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence and to
remove the hair from my chin which was intended as a shelter from the
sun and the weather lastly that i could neither run with speed nor
climb trees like my brethren as he called them the yahoos in his
country

that our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our
gross defects in reason and by consequence in virtue because reason
alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature which was therefore
a character we had no pretence to challenge even from the account i had
given of my own people although he manifestly perceived that in order
to favour them i had concealed many particulars and often said the
thing which was not

he was the more confirmed in this opinion because he observed that as
i agreed in every feature of my body with other yahoos except where it
was to my real disadvantage in point of strength speed and activity
the shortness of my claws and some other particulars where nature had no
part so from the representation i had given him of our lives our
manners and our actions he found as near a resemblance in the
disposition of our minds  he said the yahoos were known to hate one
another more than they did any different species of animals and the
reason usually assigned was the odiousness of their own shapes which
all could see in the rest but not in themselves  he had therefore begun
to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies and by that invention
conceal many of our deformities from each other which would else be
hardly supportable  but he now found he had been mistaken and that the
dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause
with ours as i had described them  for if said he you throw among
five yahoos as much food as would be sufficient for fifty they will
instead of eating peaceably fall together by the ears each single one
impatient to have all to itself and therefore a servant was usually
employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad and those kept at
home were tied at a distance from each other that if a cow died of age
or accident before a houyhnhnm could secure it for his own yahoos
those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it and then
would ensue such a battle as i had described with terrible wounds made
by their claws on both sides although they seldom were able to kill one
another for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had
invented  at other times the like battles have been fought between the
yahoos of several neighbourhoods without any visible cause those of
one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next before they
are prepared  but if they find their project has miscarried they return
home and for want of enemies engage in what i call a civil war among
themselves

that in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of
several colours whereof the yahoos are violently fond and when part
of these stones is fixed in the earth as it sometimes happens they will
dig with their claws for whole days to get them out then carry them
away and hide them by heaps in their kennels but still looking round
with great caution for fear their comrades should find out their
treasure  my master said he could never discover the reason of this
unnatural appetite or how these stones could be of any use to a yahoo
but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice
which i had ascribed to mankind  that he had once by way of experiment
privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his
yahoos had buried it whereupon the sordid animal missing his
treasure by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place
there miserably howled then fell to biting and tearing the rest began
to pine away would neither eat nor sleep nor work till he ordered a
servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole and hide them
as before which when his yahoo had found he presently recovered his
spirits and good humour but took good care to remove them to a better
hiding place and has ever since been a very serviceable brute

my master further assured me which i also observed myself that in the
fields where the shining stones abound the fiercest and most frequent
battles are fought occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring
yahoos

he said it was common when two yahoos discovered such a stone in a
field and were contending which of them should be the proprietor a
third would take the advantage and carry it away from them both which
my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our
suits at law wherein i thought it for our credit not to undeceive him
since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees
among us because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside
the stone they contended for whereas our courts of equity would never
have dismissed the cause while either of them had any thing left

my master continuing his discourse said there was nothing that
rendered the yahoos more odious than their undistinguishing appetite
to devour every thing that came in their way whether herbs roots
berries the corrupted flesh of animals or all mingled together and it
was peculiar in their temper that they were fonder of what they could
get by rapine or stealth at a greater distance than much better food
provided for them at home  if their prey held out they would eat till
they were ready to burst after which nature had pointed out to them a
certain root that gave them a general evacuation

there was also another kind of root very juicy but somewhat rare and
difficult to be found which the yahoos sought for with much eagerness
and would suck it with great delight it produced in them the same
effects that wine has upon us  it would make them sometimes hug and
sometimes tear one another they would howl and grin and chatter and
reel and tumble and then fall asleep in the mud

i did indeed observe that the yahoos were the only animals in this
country subject to any diseases which however were much fewer than
horses have among us and contracted not by any illtreatment they meet
with but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute  neither
has their language any more than a general appellation for those
maladies which is borrowed from the name of the beast and called
hneayahoo or yahoos evil and the cure prescribed is a mixture of
their own dung and urine forcibly put down the yahoos throat  this i
have since often known to have been taken with success and do here
freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good as an admirable
specific against all diseases produced by repletion

as to learning government arts manufactures and the like my master
confessed he could find little or no resemblance between the yahoos
of that country and those in ours for he only meant to observe what
parity there was in our natures  he had heard indeed some curious
houyhnhnms observe that in most herds there was a sort of ruling
yahoo as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in
a park who was always more deformed in body and mischievous in
disposition than any of the rest that this leader had usually a
favourite as like himself as he could get whose employment was to lick
his masters feet and posteriors and drive the female yahoos to his
kennel for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of asss
flesh  this favourite is hated by the whole herd and therefore to
protect himself keeps always near the person of his leader  he usually
continues in office till a worse can be found but the very moment he is
discarded his successor at the head of all the yahoos in that
district young and old male and female come in a body and discharge
their excrements upon him from head to foot  but how far this might be
applicable to our courts and favourites and ministers of state my
master said i could best determine

i durst make no return to this malicious insinuation which debased human
understanding below the sagacity of a common hound who has judgment
enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack
without being ever mistaken

my master told me there were some qualities remarkable in the yahoos
which he had not observed me to mention or at least very slightly in
the accounts i had given of humankind  he said those animals like
other brutes had their females in common but in this they differed
that the she yahoo would admit the males while she was pregnant and
that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females as fiercely as
with each other both which practices were such degrees of infamous
brutality as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at

another thing he wondered at in the yahoos was their strange
disposition to nastiness and dirt whereas there appears to be a natural
love of cleanliness in all other animals  as to the two former
accusations i was glad to let them pass without any reply because i had
not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species which otherwise i
certainly had done from my own inclinations  but i could have easily
vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last
article if there had been any swine in that country as unluckily for me
there were not which although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a
yahoo cannot i humbly conceive in justice pretend to more
cleanliness and so his honour himself must have owned if he had seen
their filthy way of feeding and their custom of wallowing and sleeping
in the mud

my master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had
discovered in several yahoos and to him was wholly unaccountable  he
said a fancy would sometimes take a yahoo to retire into a corner to
lie down and howl and groan and spurn away all that came near him
although he were young and fat wanted neither food nor water nor did
the servant imagine what could possibly ail him  and the only remedy
they found was to set him to hard work after which he would infallibly
come to himself  to this i was silent out of partiality to my own kind
yet here i could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen which only
seizes on the lazy the luxurious and the rich who if they were forced
to undergo the same regimen i would undertake for the cure

his honour had further observed that a female yahoo would often stand
behind a bank or a bush to gaze on the young males passing by and then
appear and hide using many antic gestures and grimaces at which time
it was observed that she had a most offensive smell and when any of the
males advanced would slowly retire looking often back and with a
counterfeit show of fear run off into some convenient place where she
knew the male would follow her

at other times if a female stranger came among them three or four of
her own sex would get about her and stare and chatter and grin and
smell her all over and then turn off with gestures that seemed to
express contempt and disdain

perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations which he
had drawn from what he observed himself or had been told him by others
however i could not reflect without some amazement and much sorrow
that the rudiments of lewdness coquetry censure and scandal should
have place by instinct in womankind

i expected every moment that my master would accuse the yahoos of those
unnatural appetites in both sexes so common among us  but nature it
seems has not been so expert a schoolmistress and these politer
pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of
the globe



chapter viii


the author relates several particulars of the yahoos  the great
virtues of the houyhnhnms  the education and exercise of their youth
their general assembly

as i ought to have understood human nature much better than i supposed it
possible for my master to do so it was easy to apply the character he
gave of the yahoos to myself and my countrymen and i believed i could
yet make further discoveries from my own observation  i therefore often
begged his honour to let me go among the herds of yahoos in the
neighbourhood to which he always very graciously consented being
perfectly convinced that the hatred i bore these brutes would never
suffer me to be corrupted by them and his honour ordered one of his
servants a strong sorrel nag very honest and goodnatured to be my
guard without whose protection i durst not undertake such adventures
for i have already told the reader how much i was pestered by these
odious animals upon my first arrival and i afterwards failed very
narrowly three or four times of falling into their clutches when i
happened to stray at any distance without my hanger  and i have reason
to believe they had some imagination that i was of their own species
which i often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves and showing my
naked arms and breasts in their sight when my protector was with me  at
which times they would approach as near as they durst and imitate my
actions after the manner of monkeys but ever with great signs of hatred
as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild
ones when he happens to be got among them

they are prodigiously nimble from their infancy  however i once caught
a young male of three years old and endeavoured by all marks of
tenderness to make it quiet but the little imp fell a squalling and
scratching and biting with such violence that i was forced to let it
go and it was high time for a whole troop of old ones came about us at
the noise but finding the cub was safe for away it ran and my sorrel
nag being by they durst not venture near us  i observed the young
animals flesh to smell very rank and the stink was somewhat between a
weasel and a fox but much more disagreeable  i forgot another
circumstance and perhaps i might have the readers pardon if it were
wholly omitted that while i held the odious vermin in my hands it
voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my
clothes but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by where i
washed myself as clean as i could although i durst not come into my
masters presence until i were sufficiently aired

by what i could discover the yahoos appear to be the most unteachable
of all animals their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or
carry burdens  yet i am of opinion this defect arises chiefly from a
perverse restive disposition for they are cunning malicious
treacherous and revengeful  they are strong and hardy but of a
cowardly spirit and by consequence insolent abject and cruel  it is
observed that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and
mischievous than the rest whom yet they much exceed in strength and
activity

the houyhnhnms keep the yahoos for present use in huts not far from
the house but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields where they dig
up roots eat several kinds of herbs and search about for carrion or
sometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs a sort of wild rat which they
greedily devour  nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their
nails on the side of a rising ground wherein they lie by themselves
only the kennels of the females are larger sufficient to hold two or
three cubs

they swim from their infancy like frogs and are able to continue long
under water where they often take fish which the females carry home to
their young  and upon this occasion i hope the reader will pardon my
relating an odd adventure

being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag and the weather
exceeding hot i entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near
he consented and i immediately stripped myself stark naked and went
down softly into the stream  it happened that a young female yahoo
standing behind a bank saw the whole proceeding and inflamed by desire
as the nag and i conjectured came running with all speed and leaped
into the water within five yards of the place where i bathed  i was
never in my life so terribly frightened  the nag was grazing at some
distance not suspecting any harm  she embraced me after a most fulsome
manner  i roared as loud as i could and the nag came galloping towards
me whereupon she quitted her grasp with the utmost reluctancy and
leaped upon the opposite bank where she stood gazing and howling all the
time i was putting on my clothes

this was a matter of diversion to my master and his family as well as of
mortification to myself  for now i could no longer deny that i was a
real yahoo in every limb and feature since the females had a natural
propensity to me as one of their own species  neither was the hair of
this brute of a red colour which might have been some excuse for an
appetite a little irregular but black as a sloe and her countenance
did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind
for i think she could not be above eleven years old

having lived three years in this country the reader i suppose will
expect that i should like other travellers give him some account of the
manners and customs of its inhabitants which it was indeed my principal
study to learn

as these noble houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with a general
disposition to all virtues and have no conceptions or ideas of what is
evil in a rational creature so their grand maxim is to cultivate
reason and to be wholly governed by it  neither is reason among them a
point problematical as with us where men can argue with plausibility on
both sides of the question but strikes you with immediate conviction as
it must needs do where it is not mingled obscured or discoloured by
passion and interest  i remember it was with extreme difficulty that i
could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion or
how a point could be disputable because reason taught us to affirm or
deny only where we are certain and beyond our knowledge we cannot do
either  so that controversies wranglings disputes and positiveness
in false or dubious propositions are evils unknown among the
houyhnhnms  in the like manner when i used to explain to him our
several systems of natural philosophy he would laugh that a creature
pretending to reason should value itself upon the knowledge of other
peoples conjectures and in things where that knowledge if it were
certain could be of no use  wherein he agreed entirely with the
sentiments of socrates as plato delivers them which i mention as the
highest honour i can do that prince of philosophers  i have often since
reflected what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of
europe and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned
world

friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the
houyhnhnms and these not confined to particular objects but universal
to the whole race for a stranger from the remotest part is equally
treated with the nearest neighbour and wherever he goes looks upon
himself as at home  they preserve decency and civility in the highest
degrees but are altogether ignorant of ceremony  they have no fondness
for their colts or foals but the care they take in educating them
proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason  and i observed my master
to show the same affection to his neighbours issue that he had for his
own  they will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole
species and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons where
there is a superior degree of virtue

when the matron houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex they no
longer accompany with their consorts except they lose one of their issue
by some casualty which very seldom happens but in such a case they meet
again or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past
bearing some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts and then
go together again until the mother is pregnant  this caution is
necessary to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers
but the race of inferior houyhnhnms bred up to be servants is not so
strictly limited upon this article these are allowed to produce three of
each sex to be domestics in the noble families

in their marriages they are exactly careful to choose such colours as
will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed  strength is chiefly
valued in the male and comeliness in the female not upon the account of
love but to preserve the race from degenerating for where a female
happens to excel in strength a consort is chosen with regard to
comeliness

courtship love presents jointures settlements have no place in their
thoughts or terms whereby to express them in their language  the young
couple meet and are joined merely because it is the determination of
their parents and friends it is what they see done every day and they
look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being  but
the violation of marriage or any other unchastity was never heard of
and the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual
benevolence that they bear to all others of the same species who come in
their way without jealousy fondness quarrelling or discontent

in educating the youth of both sexes their method is admirable and
highly deserves our imitation  these are not suffered to taste a grain
of oats except upon certain days till eighteen years old nor milk but
very rarely and in summer they graze two hours in the morning and as
many in the evening which their parents likewise observe but the
servants are not allowed above half that time and a great part of their
grass is brought home which they eat at the most convenient hours when
they can be best spared from work

temperance industry exercise and cleanliness are the lessons equally
enjoined to the young ones of both sexes and my master thought it
monstrous in us to give the females a different kind of education from
the males except in some articles of domestic management whereby as he
truly observed one half of our natives were good for nothing but
bringing children into the world and to trust the care of our children
to such useless animals he said was yet a greater instance of
brutality

but the houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength speed and
hardiness by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills
and over hard stony grounds and when they are all in a sweat they are
ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river  four times a
year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in
running and leaping and other feats of strength and agility where the
victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise  on this festival
the servants drive a herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay and
oats and milk for a repast to the houyhnhnms after which these
brutes are immediately driven back again for fear of being noisome to
the assembly

every fourth year at the vernal equinox there is a representative
council of the whole nation which meets in a plain about twenty miles
from our house and continues about five or six days  here they inquire
into the state and condition of the several districts whether they
abound or be deficient in hay or oats or cows or yahoos and wherever
there is any want which is but seldom it is immediately supplied by
unanimous consent and contribution  here likewise the regulation of
children is settled as for instance if a houyhnhnm has two males he
changes one of them with another that has two females and when a child
has been lost by any casualty where the mother is past breeding it is
determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the
loss



chapter ix


a grand debate at the general assembly of the houyhnhnms and how it
was determined  the learning of the houyhnhnms  their buildings
their manner of burials  the defectiveness of their language

one of these grand assemblies was held in my time about three months
before my departure whither my master went as the representative of our
district  in this council was resumed their old debate and indeed the
only debate that ever happened in their country whereof my master after
his return give me a very particular account

the question to be debated was whether the yahoos should be
exterminated from the face of the earth  one of the members for the
affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight
alleging that as the yahoos were the most filthy noisome and
deformed animals which nature ever produced so they were the most
restive and indocible mischievous and malicious they would privately
suck the teats of the houyhnhnms cows kill and devour their cats
trample down their oats and grass if they were not continually watched
and commit a thousand other extravagancies  he took notice of a general
tradition that yahoos had not been always in their country but that
many ages ago two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain
whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime or
from the ooze and froth of the sea was never known that these yahoos
engendered and their brood in a short time grew so numerous as to
overrun and infest the whole nation that the houyhnhnms to get rid of
this evil made a general hunting and at last enclosed the whole herd
and destroying the elder every houyhnhnm kept two young ones in a
kennel and brought them to such a degree of tameness as an animal so
savage by nature can be capable of acquiring using them for draught and
carriage that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition and that
those creatures could not be yinhniamshy or aborigines of the land
because of the violent hatred the houyhnhnms as well as all other
animals bore them which although their evil disposition sufficiently
deserved could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been
aborigines or else they would have long since been rooted out that
the inhabitants taking a fancy to use the service of the yahoos had
very imprudently neglected to cultivate the breed of asses which are a
comely animal easily kept more tame and orderly without any offensive
smell strong enough for labour although they yield to the other in
agility of body and if their braying be no agreeable sound it is far
preferable to the horrible howlings of the yahoos

several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose when my
master proposed an expedient to the assembly whereof he had indeed
borrowed the hint from me  he approved of the tradition mentioned by
the honourable member who spoke before and affirmed that the two
yahoos said to be seen first among them had been driven thither over
the sea that coming to land and being forsaken by their companions
they retired to the mountains and degenerating by degrees became in
process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the
country whence these two originals came  the reason of this assertion
was that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful yahoo
meaning myself which most of them had heard of and many of them had
seen  he then related to them how he first found me that my body was
all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other
animals that i spoke in a language of my own and had thoroughly learned
theirs that i had related to him the accidents which brought me thither
that when he saw me without my covering i was an exact yahoo in every
part only of a whiter colour less hairy and with shorter claws  he
added how i had endeavoured to persuade him that in my own and other
countries the yahoos acted as the governing rational animal and held
the houyhnhnms in servitude that he observed in me all the qualities
of a yahoo only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason
which however was in a degree as far inferior to the houyhnhnm race
as the yahoos of their country were to me that among other things i
mentioned a custom we had of castrating houyhnhnms when they were
young in order to render them tame that the operation was easy and
safe that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes as industry is
taught by the ant and building by the swallow for so i translate the
word lyhannh although it be a much larger fowl that this invention
might be practised upon the younger yahoos here which besides
rendering them tractable and fitter for use would in an age put an end
to the whole species without destroying life that in the mean time the
houyhnhnms should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses which
as they are in all respects more valuable brutes so they have this
advantage to be fit for service at five years old which the others are
not till twelve

this was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of what
passed in the grand council  but he was pleased to conceal one
particular which related personally to myself whereof i soon felt the
unhappy effect as the reader will know in its proper place and whence i
date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life

the houyhnhnms have no letters and consequently their knowledge is all
traditional  but there happening few events of any moment among a people
so well united naturally disposed to every virtue wholly governed by
reason and cut off from all commerce with other nations the historical
part is easily preserved without burdening their memories  i have
already observed that they are subject to no diseases and therefore can
have no need of physicians  however they have excellent medicines
composed of herbs to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or
frog of the foot by sharp stones as well as other maims and hurts in
the several parts of the body

they calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon but use no
subdivisions into weeks  they are well enough acquainted with the
motions of those two luminaries and understand the nature of eclipses
and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy

in poetry they must be allowed to excel all other mortals wherein the
justness of their similes and the minuteness as well as exactness of
their descriptions are indeed inimitable  their verses abound very much
in both of these and usually contain either some exalted notions of
friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in
races and other bodily exercises  their buildings although very rude
and simple are not inconvenient but well contrived to defend them from
all injuries of cold and heat  they have a kind of tree which at forty
years old loosens in the root and falls with the first storm it grows
very straight and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone for the
houyhnhnms know not the use of iron they stick them erect in the
ground about ten inches asunder and then weave in oat straw or
sometimes wattles between them  the roof is made after the same manner
and so are the doors

the houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the hoof of
their forefoot as we do our hands and this with greater dexterity than
i could at first imagine  i have seen a white mare of our family thread
a needle which i lent her on purpose with that joint  they milk their
cows reap their oats and do all the work which requires hands in the
same manner  they have a kind of hard flints which by grinding against
other stones they form into instruments that serve instead of wedges
axes and hammers  with tools made of these flints they likewise cut
their hay and reap their oats which there grow naturally in several
fields the yahoos draw home the sheaves in carriages and the servants
tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain which is kept in
stores  they make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels and bake
the former in the sun

if they can avoid casualties they die only of old age and are buried in
the obscurest places that can be found their friends and relations
expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure nor does the dying
person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world any more
than if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his
neighbours  i remember my master having once made an appointment with a
friend and his family to come to his house upon some affair of
importance on the day fixed the mistress and her two children came very
late she made two excuses first for her husband who as she said
happened that very morning to shnuwnh  the word is strongly expressive
in their language but not easily rendered into english it signifies
to retire to his first mother  her excuse for not coming sooner was
that her husband dying late in the morning she was a good while
consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be
laid and i observed she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as
the rest  she died about three months after

they live generally to seventy or seventyfive years very seldom to
fourscore  some weeks before their death they feel a gradual decay but
without pain  during this time they are much visited by their friends
because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction
however about ten days before their death which they seldom fail in
computing they return the visits that have been made them by those who
are nearest in the neighbourhood being carried in a convenient sledge
drawn by yahoos which vehicle they use not only upon this occasion
but when they grow old upon long journeys or when they are lamed by any
accident and therefore when the dying houyhnhnms return those visits
they take a solemn leave of their friends as if they were going to some
remote part of the country where they designed to pass the rest of their
lives

i know not whether it may be worth observing that the houyhnhnms have
no word in their language to express any thing that is evil except what
they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the yahoos  thus
they denote the folly of a servant an omission of a child a stone that
cuts their feet a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather and the
like by adding to each the epithet of yahoo  for instance hhnm
yahoo whnaholm yahoo ynlhmndwihlma yahoo and an illcontrived
house ynholmhnmrohlnw yahoo

i could with great pleasure enlarge further upon the manners and
virtues of this excellent people but intending in a short time to
publish a volume by itself expressly upon that subject i refer the
reader thither and in the mean time proceed to relate my own sad
catastrophe



chapter x


the authors economy and happy life among the houyhnhnms  his great
improvement in virtue by conversing with them  their conversations  the
author has notice given him by his master that he must depart from the
country  he falls into a swoon for grief but submits  he contrives and
finishes a canoe by the help of a fellowservant and puts to sea at a
venture

i had settled my little economy to my own hearts content  my master had
ordered a room to be made for me after their manner about six yards
from the house the sides and floors of which i plastered with clay and
covered with rushmats of my own contriving  i had beaten hemp which
there grows wild and made of it a sort of ticking this i filled with
the feathers of several birds i had taken with springes made of yahoos
hairs and were excellent food  i had worked two chairs with my knife
the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part  when
my clothes were worn to rags i made myself others with the skins of
rabbits and of a certain beautiful animal about the same size called
nnuhnoh the skin of which is covered with a fine down  of these i
also made very tolerable stockings  i soled my shoes with wood which i
cut from a tree and fitted to the upperleather and when this was worn
out i supplied it with the skins of yahoos dried in the sun  i often
got honey out of hollow trees which i mingled with water or ate with my
bread  no man could more verify the truth of these two maxims that
nature is very easily satisfied and that necessity is the mother of
invention  i enjoyed perfect health of body and tranquillity of mind
i did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend nor the injuries
of a secret or open enemy  i had no occasion of bribing flattering or
pimping to procure the favour of any great man or of his minion i
wanted no fence against fraud or oppression here was neither physician
to destroy my body nor lawyer to ruin my fortune no informer to watch
my words and actions or forge accusations against me for hire here were
no gibers censurers backbiters pickpockets highwaymen housebreakers
attorneys bawds buffoons gamesters politicians wits splenetics
tedious talkers controvertists ravishers murderers robbers
virtuosos no leaders or followers of party and faction no encouragers
to vice by seducement or examples no dungeon axes gibbets
whippingposts or pillories no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics no
pride vanity or affectation no fops bullies drunkards strolling
whores or poxes no ranting lewd expensive wives no stupid proud
pedants no importunate overbearing quarrelsome noisy roaring empty
conceited swearing companions no scoundrels raised from the dust upon
the merit of their vices or nobility thrown into it on account of their
virtues no lords fiddlers judges or dancingmasters

i had the favour of being admitted to several houyhnhnms who came to
visit or dine with my master where his honour graciously suffered me to
wait in the room and listen to their discourse  both he and his company
would often descend to ask me questions and receive my answers  i had
also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others
i never presumed to speak except in answer to a question and then i did
it with inward regret because it was a loss of so much time for
improving myself but i was infinitely delighted with the station of an
humble auditor in such conversations where nothing passed but what was
useful expressed in the fewest and most significant words where as i
have already said the greatest decency was observed without the least
degree of ceremony where no person spoke without being pleased himself
and pleasing his companions where there was no interruption
tediousness heat or difference of sentiments  they have a notion that
when people are met together a short silence does much improve
conversation this i found to be true for during those little
intermissions of talk new ideas would arise in their minds which very
much enlivened the discourse  their subjects are generally on
friendship and benevolence on order and economy sometimes upon the
visible operations of nature or ancient traditions upon the bounds and
limits of virtue upon the unerring rules of reason or upon some
determinations to be taken at the next great assembly and often upon the
various excellences of poetry  i may add without vanity that my
presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse because it
afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of
me and my country upon which they were all pleased to descant in a
manner not very advantageous to humankind and for that reason i shall
not repeat what they said only i may be allowed to observe that his
honour to my great admiration appeared to understand the nature of
yahoos much better than myself  he went through all our vices and
follies and discovered many which i had never mentioned to him by only
supposing what qualities a yahoo of their country with a small
proportion of reason might be capable of exerting and concluded with
too much probability how vile as well as miserable such a creature
must be

i freely confess that all the little knowledge i have of any value was
acquired by the lectures i received from my master and from hearing the
discourses of him and his friends to which i should be prouder to
listen than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in europe  i
admired the strength comeliness and speed of the inhabitants and such
a constellation of virtues in such amiable persons produced in me the
highest veneration  at first indeed i did not feel that natural awe
which the yahoos and all other animals bear toward them but it grew
upon me by decrees much sooner than i imagined and was mingled with a
respectful love and gratitude that they would condescend to distinguish
me from the rest of my species

when i thought of my family my friends my countrymen or the human race
in general i considered them as they really were yahoos in shape and
disposition perhaps a little more civilized and qualified with the gift
of speech but making no other use of reason than to improve and
multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the
share that nature allotted them  when i happened to behold the
reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain i turned away my face in
horror and detestation of myself and could better endure the sight of a
common yahoo than of my own person  by conversing with the
houyhnhnms and looking upon them with delight i fell to imitate their
gait and gesture which is now grown into a habit and my friends often
tell me in a blunt way that i trot like a horse which however i
take for a great compliment  neither shall i disown that in speaking i
am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the houyhnhnms and hear
myself ridiculed on that account without the least mortification

in the midst of all this happiness and when i looked upon myself to be
fully settled for life my master sent for me one morning a little
earlier than his usual hour  i observed by his countenance that he was
in some perplexity and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak
after a short silence he told me he did not know how i would take what
he was going to say that in the last general assembly when the affair
of the yahoos was entered upon the representatives had taken offence
at his keeping a yahoo meaning myself in his family more like a
houyhnhnm than a brute animal that he was known frequently to converse
with me as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company
that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature or a thing
ever heard of before among them the assembly did therefore exhort him
either to employ me like the rest of my species or command me to swim
back to the place whence i came that the first of these expedients was
utterly rejected by all the houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at his
house or their own for they alleged that because i had some rudiments
of reason added to the natural pravity of those animals it was to be
feared i might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous
parts of the country and bring them in troops by night to destroy the
houyhnhnms cattle as being naturally of the ravenous kind and averse
from labour

my master added that he was daily pressed by the houyhnhnms of the
neighbourhood to have the assemblys exhortation executed which he could
not put off much longer  he doubted it would be impossible for me to
swim to another country and therefore wished i would contrive some sort
of vehicle resembling those i had described to him that might carry me
on the sea in which work i should have the assistance of his own
servants as well as those of his neighbours  he concluded that for
his own part he could have been content to keep me in his service as
long as i lived because he found i had cured myself of some bad habits
and dispositions by endeavouring as far as my inferior nature was
capable to imitate the houyhnhnms

i should here observe to the reader that a decree of the general
assembly in this country is expressed by the word hnhloayn which
signifies an exhortation as near as i can render it for they have no
conception how a rational creature can be compelled but only advised or
exhorted because no person can disobey reason without giving up his
claim to be a rational creature

i was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my masters discourse
and being unable to support the agonies i was under i fell into a swoon
at his feet  when i came to myself he told me that he concluded i had
been dead for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of
nature  i answered in a faint voice that death would have been too
great a happiness that although i could not blame the assemblys
exhortation or the urgency of his friends yet in my weak and corrupt
judgment i thought it might consist with reason to have been less
rigorous that i could not swim a league and probably the nearest land
to theirs might be distant above a hundred that many materials
necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off were wholly wanting
in this country which however i would attempt in obedience and
gratitude to his honour although i concluded the thing to be impossible
and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction that
the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils
for supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure how
could i think with temper of passing my days among yahoos and
relapsing into my old corruptions for want of examples to lead and keep
me within the paths of virtue that i knew too well upon what solid
reasons all the determinations of the wise houyhnhnms were founded not
to be shaken by arguments of mine a miserable yahoo and therefore
after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants
assistance in making a vessel and desiring a reasonable time for so
difficult a work i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretched
being and if ever i returned to england was not without hopes of being
useful to my own species by celebrating the praises of the renowned
houyhnhnms and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind

my master in a few words made me a very gracious reply allowed me the
space of two months to finish my boat and ordered the sorrel nag my
fellowservant for so at this distance i may presume to call him to
follow my instruction because i told my master that his help would be
sufficient and i knew he had a tenderness for me

in his company my first business was to go to that part of the coast
where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore  i got upon a
height and looking on every side into the sea fancied i saw a small
island toward the northeast  i took out my pocket glass and could then
clearly distinguish it above five leagues off as i computed but it
appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud for as he had no
conception of any country beside his own so he could not be as expert in
distinguishing remote objects at sea as we who so much converse in that
element

after i had discovered this island i considered no further but resolved
it should if possible be the first place of my banishment leaving the
consequence to fortune

i returned home and consulting with the sorrel nag we went into a copse
at some distance where i with my knife and he with a sharp flint
fastened very artificially after their manner to a wooden handle cut
down several oak wattles about the thickness of a walkingstaff and
some larger pieces  but i shall not trouble the reader with a particular
description of my own mechanics let it suffice to say that in six weeks
time with the help of the sorrel nag who performed the parts that
required most labour i finished a sort of indian canoe but much larger
covering it with the skins of yahoos well stitched together with
hempen threads of my own making  my sail was likewise composed of the
skins of the same animal but i made use of the youngest i could get the
older being too tough and thick and i likewise provided myself with four
paddles  i laid in a stock of boiled flesh of rabbits and fowls and
took with me two vessels one filled with milk and the other with water

i tried my canoe in a large pond near my masters house and then
corrected in it what was amiss stopping all the chinks with yahoos
tallow till i found it staunch and able to bear me and my freight and
when it was as complete as i could possibly make it i had it drawn on a
carriage very gently by yahoos to the seaside under the conduct of
the sorrel nag and another servant

when all was ready and the day came for my departure i took leave of my
master and lady and the whole family my eyes flowing with tears and my
heart quite sunk with grief  but his honour out of curiosity and
perhaps if i may speak without vanity partly out of kindness was
determined to see me in my canoe and got several of his neighbouring
friends to accompany him  i was forced to wait above an hour for the
tide and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the
island to which i intended to steer my course i took a second leave of
my master but as i was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof he
did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth  i am not ignorant how
much i have been censured for mentioning this last particular
detractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious a
person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a
creature so inferior as i  neither have i forgotten how apt some
travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received
but if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and
courteous disposition of the houyhnhnms they would soon change their
opinion

i paid my respects to the rest of the houyhnhnms in his honours
company then getting into my canoe i pushed off from shore



chapter xi


the authors dangerous voyage  he arrives at new holland hoping to
settle there  is wounded with an arrow by one of the natives  is seized
and carried by force into a portuguese ship  the great civilities of the
captain  the author arrives at england

i began this desperate voyage on february 15 1714–15 at nine oclock in
the morning  the wind was very favourable however i made use at first
only of my paddles but considering i should soon be weary and that the
wind might chop about i ventured to set up my little sail and thus
with the help of the tide i went at the rate of a league and a half an
hour as near as i could guess  my master and his friends continued on
the shore till i was almost out of sight and i often heard the sorrel
nag who always loved me crying out hnuy illa nyha majah yahoo
take care of thyself gentle yahoo

my design was if possible to discover some small island uninhabited
yet sufficient by my labour to furnish me with the necessaries of life
which i would have thought a greater happiness than to be first minister
in the politest court of europe so horrible was the idea i conceived of
returning to live in the society and under the government of yahoos
for in such a solitude as i desired i could at least enjoy my own
thoughts and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable
houyhnhnms without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and
corruptions of my own species

the reader may remember what i related when my crew conspired against
me and confined me to my cabin how i continued there several weeks
without knowing what course we took and when i was put ashore in the
longboat how the sailors told me with oaths whether true or false
that they knew not in what part of the world we were  however i did
then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the cape of good
hope or about 45 degrees southern latitude as i gathered from some
general words i overheard among them being i supposed to the southeast
in their intended voyage to madagascar  and although this were little
better than conjecture yet i resolved to steer my course eastward
hoping to reach the southwest coast of new holland and perhaps some
such island as i desired lying westward of it  the wind was full west
and by six in the evening i computed i had gone eastward at least
eighteen leagues when i spied a very small island about half a league
off which i soon reached  it was nothing but a rock with one creek
naturally arched by the force of tempests  here i put in my canoe and
climbing a part of the rock i could plainly discover land to the east
extending from south to north  i lay all night in my canoe and
repeating my voyage early in the morning i arrived in seven hours to the
southeast point of new holland  this confirmed me in the opinion i have
long entertained that the maps and charts place this country at least
three degrees more to the east than it really is which thought i
communicated many years ago to my worthy friend mr herman moll and
gave him my reasons for it although he has rather chosen to follow other
authors

i saw no inhabitants in the place where i landed and being unarmed i
was afraid of venturing far into the country  i found some shellfish on
the shore and ate them raw not daring to kindle a fire for fear of
being discovered by the natives  i continued three days feeding on
oysters and limpets to save my own provisions and i fortunately found a
brook of excellent water which gave me great relief

on the fourth day venturing out early a little too far i saw twenty or
thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me  they
were stark naked men women and children round a fire as i could
discover by the smoke  one of them spied me and gave notice to the
rest five of them advanced toward me leaving the women and children at
the fire  i made what haste i could to the shore and getting into my
canoe shoved off the savages observing me retreat ran after me and
before i could get far enough into the sea discharged an arrow which
wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee i shall carry the mark
to my grave  i apprehended the arrow might be poisoned and paddling out
of the reach of their darts being a calm day i made a shift to suck
the wound and dress it as well as i could

i was at a loss what to do for i durst not return to the same
landingplace but stood to the north and was forced to paddle for the
wind though very gentle was against me blowing northwest  as i was
looking about for a secure landingplace i saw a sail to the
northnortheast which appearing every minute more visible i was in
some doubt whether i should wait for them or not but at last my
detestation of the yahoo race prevailed and turning my canoe i sailed
and paddled together to the south and got into the same creek whence i
set out in the morning choosing rather to trust myself among these
barbarians than live with european yahoos  i drew up my canoe as
close as i could to the shore and hid myself behind a stone by the
little brook which as i have already said was excellent water

the ship came within half a league of this creek and sent her long boat
with vessels to take in fresh water for the place it seems was very
well known but i did not observe it till the boat was almost on shore
and it was too late to seek another hidingplace  the seamen at their
landing observed my canoe and rummaging it all over easily conjectured
that the owner could not be far off  four of them well armed searched
every cranny and lurkinghole till at last they found me flat on my face
behind the stone  they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth
dress my coat made of skins my woodensoled shoes and my furred
stockings whence however they concluded i was not a native of the
place who all go naked  one of the seamen in portuguese bid me rise
and asked who i was  i understood that language very well and getting
upon my feet said i was a poor yahoo banished from the houyhnhnms
and desired they would please to let me depart  they admired to hear me
answer them in their own tongue and saw by my complexion i must be a
european but were at a loss to know what i meant by yahoos and
houyhnhnms and at the same time fell alaughing at my strange tone in
speaking which resembled the neighing of a horse  i trembled all the
while betwixt fear and hatred  i again desired leave to depart and was
gently moving to my canoe but they laid hold of me desiring to know
what country i was of whence i came with many other questions  i
told them i was born in england whence i came about five years ago and
then their country and ours were at peace  i therefore hoped they would
not treat me as an enemy since i meant them no harm but was a poor
yahoo seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his
unfortunate life

when they began to talk i thought i never heard or saw any thing more
unnatural for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should
speak in england or a yahoo in houyhnhnmland  the honest portuguese
were equally amazed at my strange dress and the odd manner of delivering
my words which however they understood very well  they spoke to me
with great humanity and said they were sure the captain would carry me
gratis to lisbon whence i might return to my own country that two of
the seamen would go back to the ship inform the captain of what they had
seen and receive his orders in the mean time unless i would give my
solemn oath not to fly they would secure me by force  i thought it
best to comply with their proposal  they were very curious to know my
story but i gave them very little satisfaction and they all conjectured
that my misfortunes had impaired my reason  in two hours the boat which
went laden with vessels of water returned with the captains command to
fetch me on board  i fell on my knees to preserve my liberty but all
was in vain and the men having tied me with cords heaved me into the
boat whence i was taken into the ship and thence into the captains
cabin

his name was pedro de mendez he was a very courteous and generous
person  he entreated me to give some account of myself and desired to
know what i would eat or drink said i should be used as well as
himself and spoke so many obliging things that i wondered to find such
civilities from a yahoo  however i remained silent and sullen i was
ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men  at last i desired
something to eat out of my own canoe but he ordered me a chicken and
some excellent wine and then directed that i should be put to bed in a
very clean cabin  i would not undress myself but lay on the
bedclothes and in half an hour stole out when i thought the crew was
at dinner and getting to the side of the ship was going to leap into
the sea and swim for my life rather than continue among yahoos  but
one of the seamen prevented me and having informed the captain i was
chained to my cabin

after dinner don pedro came to me and desired to know my reason for so
desperate an attempt assured me he only meant to do me all the service
he was able and spoke so very movingly that at last i descended to
treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason  i gave
him a very short relation of my voyage of the conspiracy against me by
my own men of the country where they set me on shore and of my five
years residence there  all which he looked upon as if it were a dream or
a vision whereat i took great offence for i had quite forgot the
faculty of lying so peculiar to yahoos in all countries where they
preside and consequently their disposition of suspecting truth in
others of their own species  i asked him whether it were the custom in
his country to say the thing which was not  i assured him i had
almost forgot what he meant by falsehood and if i had lived a thousand
years in houyhnhnmland i should never have heard a lie from the
meanest servant that i was altogether indifferent whether he believed me
or not but however in return for his favours i would give so much
allowance to the corruption of his nature as to answer any objection he
would please to make and then he might easily discover the truth

the captain a wise man after many endeavours to catch me tripping in
some part of my story at last began to have a better opinion of my
veracity  but he added that since i professed so inviolable an
attachment to truth i must give him my word and honour to bear him
company in this voyage without attempting any thing against my life or
else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at lisbon  i gave
him the promise he required but at the same time protested that i
would suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live among
yahoos

our voyage passed without any considerable accident  in gratitude to the
captain i sometimes sat with him at his earnest request and strove to
conceal my antipathy against human kind although it often broke out
which he suffered to pass without observation  but the greatest part of
the day i confined myself to my cabin to avoid seeing any of the crew
the captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress
and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had  this i would not
be prevailed on to accept abhorring to cover myself with any thing that
had been on the back of a yahoo  i only desired he would lend me two
clean shirts which having been washed since he wore them i believed
would not so much defile me  these i changed every second day and
washed them myself

we arrived at lisbon nov 5 1715  at our landing the captain forced
me to cover myself with his cloak to prevent the rabble from crowding
about me  i was conveyed to his own house and at my earnest request he
led me up to the highest room backwards  i conjured him to conceal from
all persons what i had told him of the houyhnhnms because the least
hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me but
probably put me in danger of being imprisoned or burnt by the
inquisition  the captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly
made but i would not suffer the tailor to take my measure however don
pedro being almost of my size they fitted me well enough  he accoutred
me with other necessaries all new which i aired for twentyfour hours
before i would use them

the captain had no wife nor above three servants none of which were
suffered to attend at meals and his whole deportment was so obliging
added to very good human understanding that i really began to tolerate
his company  he gained so far upon me that i ventured to look out of
the back window  by degrees i was brought into another room whence i
peeped into the street but drew my head back in a fright  in a weeks
time he seduced me down to the door  i found my terror gradually
lessened but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase  i was at last
bold enough to walk the street in his company but kept my nose well
stopped with rue or sometimes with tobacco

in ten days don pedro to whom i had given some account of my domestic
affairs put it upon me as a matter of honour and conscience that i
ought to return to my native country and live at home with my wife and
children  he told me there was an english ship in the port just ready
to sail and he would furnish me with all things necessary  it would be
tedious to repeat his arguments and my contradictions  he said it was
altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as i desired to live
in but i might command in my own house and pass my time in a manner as
recluse as i pleased

i complied at last finding i could not do better  i left lisbon the
24th day of november in an english merchantman but who was the master i
never inquired  don pedro accompanied me to the ship and lent me twenty
pounds  he took kind leave of me and embraced me at parting which i
bore as well as i could  during this last voyage i had no commerce with
the master or any of his men but pretending i was sick kept close in
my cabin  on the fifth of december 1715 we cast anchor in the downs
about nine in the morning and at three in the afternoon i got safe to my
house at rotherhith 546

my wife and family received me with great surprise and joy because they
concluded me certainly dead but i must freely confess the sight of them
filled me only with hatred disgust and contempt and the more by
reflecting on the near alliance i had to them  for although since my
unfortunate exile from the houyhnhnm country i had compelled myself to
tolerate the sight of yahoos and to converse with don pedro de mendez
yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues
and ideas of those exalted houyhnhnms  and when i began to consider
that by copulating with one of the yahoo species i had become a parent
of more it struck me with the utmost shame confusion and horror

as soon as i entered the house my wife took me in her arms and kissed
me at which having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for
so many years i fell into a swoon for almost an hour  at the time i am
writing it is five years since my last return to england  during the
first year i could not endure my wife or children in my presence the
very smell of them was intolerable much less could i suffer them to eat
in the same room  to this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread
or drink out of the same cup neither was i ever able to let one of them
take me by the hand  the first money i laid out was to buy two young
stonehorses which i keep in a good stable and next to them the groom
is my greatest favourite for i feel my spirits revived by the smell he
contracts in the stable  my horses understand me tolerably well i
converse with them at least four hours every day  they are strangers to
bridle or saddle they live in great amity with me and friendship to each
other



chapter xii


the authors veracity  his design in publishing this work  his censure
of those travellers who swerve from the truth  the author clears himself
from any sinister ends in writing  an objection answered  the method of
planting colonies  his native country commended  the right of the crown
to those countries described by the author is justified  the difficulty
of conquering them  the author takes his last leave of the reader
proposes his manner of living for the future gives good advice and
concludes

thus gentle reader i have given thee a faithful history of my travels
for sixteen years and above seven months wherein i have not been so
studious of ornament as of truth  i could perhaps like others have
astonished thee with strange improbable tales but i rather chose to
relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style because my
principal design was to inform and not to amuse thee

it is easy for us who travel into remote countries which are seldom
visited by englishmen or other europeans to form descriptions of
wonderful animals both at sea and land  whereas a travellers chief aim
should be to make men wiser and better and to improve their minds by the
bad as well as good example of what they deliver concerning foreign
places

i could heartily wish a law was enacted that every traveller before he
were permitted to publish his voyages should be obliged to make oath
before the lord high chancellor that all he intended to print was
absolutely true to the best of his knowledge for then the world would no
longer be deceived as it usually is while some writers to make their
works pass the better upon the public impose the grossest falsities on
the unwary reader  i have perused several books of travels with great
delight in my younger days but having since gone over most parts of the
globe and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own
observation it has given me a great disgust against this part of
reading and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so
impudently abused  therefore since my acquaintance were pleased to
think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country i
imposed on myself as a maxim never to be swerved from that i would
strictly adhere to truth neither indeed can i be ever under the least
temptation to vary from it while i retain in my mind the lectures and
example of my noble master and the other illustrious houyhnhnms of whom
i had so long the honour to be an humble hearer

    —nec si miserum fortuna sinonem
    finxit vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget

i know very well how little reputation is to be got by writings which
require neither genius nor learning nor indeed any other talent except
a good memory or an exact journal  i know likewise that writers of
travels like dictionarymakers are sunk into oblivion by the weight and
bulk of those who come last and therefore lie uppermost  and it is
highly probable that such travellers who shall hereafter visit the
countries described in this work of mine may by detecting my errors if
there be any and adding many new discoveries of their own justle me
out of vogue and stand in my place making the world forget that ever i
was an author  this indeed would be too great a mortification if i
wrote for fame but as my sole intention was the public good i cannot be
altogether disappointed  for who can read of the virtues i have
mentioned in the glorious houyhnhnms without being ashamed of his own
vices when he considers himself as the reasoning governing animal of
his country  i shall say nothing of those remote nations where yahoos
preside among which the least corrupted are the brobdingnagians whose
wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to
observe  but i forbear descanting further and rather leave the
judicious reader to his own remarks and application

i am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with
no censurers for what objections can be made against a writer who
relates only plain facts that happened in such distant countries where
we have not the least interest with respect either to trade or
negotiations  i have carefully avoided every fault with which common
writers of travels are often too justly charged  besides i meddle not
the least with any party but write without passion prejudice or
illwill against any man or number of men whatsoever  i write for the
noblest end to inform and instruct mankind over whom i may without
breach of modesty pretend to some superiority from the advantages i
received by conversing so long among the most accomplished houyhnhnms
i write without any view to profit or praise  i never suffer a word to
pass that may look like reflection or possibly give the least offence
even to those who are most ready to take it  so that i hope i may with
justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless against whom the
tribes of answerers considerers observers reflectors detectors
remarkers will never be able to find matter for exercising their
talents

i confess it was whispered to me that i was bound in duty as a
subject of england to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state
at my first coming over because whatever lands are discovered by a
subject belong to the crown  but i doubt whether our conquests in the
countries i treat of would be as easy as those of ferdinando cortez over
the naked americans  the lilliputians i think are hardly worth the
charge of a fleet and army to reduce them and i question whether it
might be prudent or safe to attempt the brobdingnagians or whether an
english army would be much at their ease with the flying island over
their heads  the houyhnhnms indeed appear not to be so well prepared
for war a science to which they are perfect strangers and especially
against missive weapons  however supposing myself to be a minister of
state i could never give my advice for invading them  their prudence
unanimity unacquaintedness with fear and their love of their country
would amply supply all defects in the military art  imagine twenty
thousand of them breaking into the midst of an european army confounding
the ranks overturning the carriages battering the warriors faces into
mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs for they would well
deserve the character given to augustus recalcitrat undique tutus
but instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation i
rather wish they were in a capacity or disposition to send a sufficient
number of their inhabitants for civilizing europe by teaching us the
first principles of honour justice truth temperance public spirit
fortitude chastity friendship benevolence and fidelity  the names of
all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages and are
to be met with in modern as well as ancient authors which i am able to
assert from my own small reading

but i had another reason which made me less forward to enlarge his
majestys dominions by my discoveries  to say the truth i had conceived
a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon
those occasions  for instance a crew of pirates are driven by a storm
they know not whither at length a boy discovers land from the topmast
they go on shore to rob and plunder they see a harmless people are
entertained with kindness they give the country a new name they take
formal possession of it for their king they set up a rotten plank or a
stone for a memorial they murder two or three dozen of the natives
bring away a couple more by force for a sample return home and get
their pardon  here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by
divine right  ships are sent with the first opportunity the natives
driven out or destroyed their princes tortured to discover their gold a
free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust the earth reeking
with the blood of its inhabitants and this execrable crew of butchers
employed in so pious an expedition is a modern colony sent to convert
and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people

but this description i confess does by no means affect the british
nation who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom care
and justice in planting colonies their liberal endowments for the
advancement of religion and learning their choice of devout and able
pastors to propagate christianity their caution in stocking their
provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the
mother kingdom their strict regard to the distribution of justice in
supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with
officers of the greatest abilities utter strangers to corruption and
to crown all by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors who
have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they
preside and the honour of the king their master

but as those countries which i have described do not appear to have any
desire of being conquered and enslaved murdered or driven out by
colonies nor abound either in gold silver sugar or tobacco i did
humbly conceive they were by no means proper objects of our zeal our
valour or our interest  however if those whom it more concerns think
fit to be of another opinion i am ready to depose when i shall be
lawfully called that no european did ever visit those countries before
me  i mean if the inhabitants ought to be believed unless a dispute
may arise concerning the two yahoos said to have been seen many years
ago upon a mountain in houyhnhnmland

but as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereigns name it
never came once into my thoughts and if it had yet as my affairs then
stood i should perhaps in point of prudence and selfpreservation have
put it off to a better opportunity

having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against
me as a traveller i here take a final leave of all my courteous readers
and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at redriff
to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which i learned among the
houyhnhnms to instruct the yahoos of my own family is far as i
shall find them docible animals to behold my figure often in a glass
and thus if possible habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of
a human creature to lament the brutality to houyhnhnms in my own
country but always treat their persons with respect for the sake of my
noble master his family his friends and the whole houyhnhnm race
whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments
however their intellectuals came to degenerate

i began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me at the
farthest end of a long table and to answer but with the utmost brevity
the few questions i asked her  yet the smell of a yahoo continuing
very offensive i always keep my nose well stopped with rue lavender or
tobacco leaves  and although it be hard for a man late in life to
remove old habits i am not altogether out of hopes in some time to
suffer a neighbour yahoo in my company without the apprehensions i am
yet under of his teeth or his claws

my reconcilement to the yahoo kind in general might not be so
difficult if they would be content with those vices and follies only
which nature has entitled them to  i am not in the least provoked at the
sight of a lawyer a pickpocket a colonel a fool a lord a gamester a
politician a whoremonger a physician an evidence a suborner an
attorney a traitor or the like this is all according to the due course
of things but when i behold a lump of deformity and diseases both in
body and mind smitten with pride it immediately breaks all the measures
of my patience neither shall i be ever able to comprehend how such an
animal and such a vice could tally together  the wise and virtuous
houyhnhnms who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational
creature have no name for this vice in their language which has no
terms to express any thing that is evil except those whereby they
describe the detestable qualities of their yahoos among which they
were not able to distinguish this of pride for want of thoroughly
understanding human nature as it shows itself in other countries where
that animal presides  but i who had more experience could plainly
observe some rudiments of it among the wild yahoos

but the houyhnhnms who live under the government of reason are no
more proud of the good qualities they possess than i should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm which no man in his wits would boast of
although he must be miserable without them  i dwell the longer upon this
subject from the desire i have to make the society of an english yahoo
by any means not insupportable and therefore i here entreat those who
have any tincture of this absurd vice that they will not presume to come
in my sight
