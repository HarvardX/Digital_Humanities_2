Admiral Hosier's GHOST.
I.
AS, near Porto-Bello lying,
On the gently swelling Flood,
At Midnight, with Streamers flying,
Our triumphant Navy rode,
There, while Vernon sat, all glorious
From the Spaniards late Defeat,
And his Crew, with Shouts victorious
Drank Success to Englands Fleet,
II.
On a sudden, shrilly Sounding,
Heideous Yells and Shrieks were heard;
Then, each Heart with Fears confounding,
A sad Troop of Ghosts appeared;
All in dreary Hammocks shrouded,
Which for winding Sheets they wore;
And with Looks by Sorrow clouded,
Frowning on that hostile Shore.
III.
On them gleam'd the Moon's wan Luster,
When the Shade of Hosier brave,
His Pale Band was seen to muster,
Rising from their watery Grave:
Over the glimmering Wave he hy'd him,
Where the Burford reared her Sail,
With three thousand Ghosts beside him,
And in Groans did Vernon hail.
IV.
"Heed, oh heed! my fatal Story,
"I am Hosier's injured Ghost;
"You who now have purchased Glory
"At this Place where I was lost;
"Though in Porto Bello's ruin
"You now triumph, free from Fears,
"Yet to hear of my undoing,
"You will mix your Joys with Tears.
V.
"See yon mournful Specter sweeping,
"Ghastly, over this hated Wave,
"Whose wan Checks are Stained with Weeping;
"These were English Captains brave;
"And these Numbers pale and horrid,
"Were my Sailors once so bold,
"Lo, each hangs his drooping Forehead,
"While his dismal Fate is told.
VI.
"I, by twenty Sail attended,
"Did this Spanish Town affright,
"Nothing then its Wealth defended
"But my Orders not to fight;
"Oh that, with my Wrath complying,
"I had cast them in the Main,
"Then, no more unactive lying,
"I had low'red the Pride of Spain.
VII.
"For resistance I could fear none,
"But with twenty Ships had done,
"What thou, brave and happy Vernon,
"Did atchieve with Six alone*
"Then the Bastimento's never
"Had our foul Dishonor seen,
"Nor the Sea the sad Receiver
"Of these gallant Men had been.
VIII.
"Thus, like thee, proud Spain dismaying,
"And her Galleons leading home,
"Though condemned for disobeying,
"I had not a Traitors Doom.
"To have fallen, my Country Crying,
"He has played an English Part,
"Had been better far than Dying,
"Of a grieved and broken Heart.
IX.
"Unrepining at thy Glory,
"Thy successful Arms we hail,
"But remember our sad Story,
"When to Britain back you sail!
"All your Country's Foes subduing,
"When your Patriot Friends you see,
"Think on Vengeance for my ruin,
"And for England shamed in me.
FINIS.
