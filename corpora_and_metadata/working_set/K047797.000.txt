ADVERTISEMENT.
THE promiscuous collection of questions proposed in the Arithmetic, was
intended for the exercise of pupils after they had gone through the several
rules of the book, and has been found very useful to them, by accustoming them
to think, and to strike out methods of solution unassisted by other helps. But
many gentlemen having expressed a desire to have a publication of the solutions
of those questions at full length, that they might have the satisfaction to
compare their own solutions with those of the Author, and thereby the
opportunity of choosing which they like best, he has herein complied with their
request.

These solutions are published apart from the work itself, that the teacher may
avail himself of them, and yet keep them from the sight of his pupils if he so
chooses, each learner having only the book of arithmetic for the purposes
therein mentioned.

The solutions are all delivered in what have been judged to be the best forms.
Sometimes two methods are given, where they seemed necessary. In such of them
as contain any proportions, or rule-of-three statings, the fourth term is
generally put down in the form of a vulgar fraction, placing the product of the
second and third terms, as numerator, to be divided by the first as a
denominator; the fraction is then abbreviated as much as it can be, before the
multiplication and division are performed; by which means generally these two
operations are entirely saved, or at least much shortened and facilitated, by
bringing them to such small numbers as can be easily multiplied and divided
mentally, and the answer thence discovered without any other intermediate
figures or operations to be written down. So that there is never occasion for
more writing than appears in the operations as here printed, where it will be
found that, to avoid the long form of division, the large divisors are
separated into their component parts, and the divisions performed separately by
them, which are always done by writing down only the quotients. But where the
numbers are so large as to make long divisions, or multiplications,
unavoidable, those operations are always placed down at the bottom of the
solution, that so none of the necessary part of the writing in the full
solution, might be omitted.

SOLUTION.
First ^ the sum of S, T, and V's.

Therefore 1 - 6/8=2/8=W's share, which is the same as that of S. Also their
respective shares are proportional to the numerators of the fractions, viz. to
the numbers 2, 3, 1, 2, the sum of which is 8. Then as 8 120l. 14s. or as 1
15l. 1s. 9d. 2 30l. 3s. 6d.=S's share 3 45 5 3=T's 1 15 1 9=V's 2 30 3 6=W's
their sum is 120.14.0=the sum given.

years, and the discount of the same sum, at the same rate, and for the same
time?

-- Ans. 27l. 3 1/33s.

SOLUTION.
First 4 x 8=32 is the interest of 100l. for the 8 years.

Then ^ the disc. of 500.

And ^ the interest of 350.

Therefore ^ the difference required.

QUESTION 43.

in dealing, to have cleared 20 per cent. Then how much under their just value
were they sold? -- Ans. 28l. 1s. 8 20/83d.

SOLUTION.
First 100 + 20=120, and 100 - 17=83, their difference is 120 - 83=37; also 60
guineas=63l. Then ^. the answer.
^

QUESTION 46.
If, by selling goods at 27d. per lb. I gain cent. per cent. what do I clear
per cent. by selling for 9 guineas per cwt? Ans. 50 per cent.

SOLUTION.
At 27d. per lb. it is per cwt. 27 x 112d.=9 x 28s.

And 9 guineas=9 x 21s.

Therefore ^ the amount of 100 at the latter price.

Consequently 150 - 100=50=the gain per cent.

And theref. 8/7 x 8/7 = 64/49 = 1 15/49 = the sq. of the numb.

QUESTION 53.
A person dying, left his wife with child, and making his will, ordered that if
she went with a son, of his estate should belong to him, and the remainder to
his mother; and if she went with a daughter, he appointed the mother and the
girl the remainder: but it happened that she was delivered both of a son and
daughter; by which she lost in equity 2400l. more than if it had been only a
girl: What would have been her dowry had she had only a son? -- Ans. 2100l.

SOLUTION.
Since the son's share is to the mother's, as 2 to 1, and the mother's to the
daughter's, as 2 to 1; therefore their three shares are respectively as the
numbers 4, 2, and 1, the sum of which is 7. Consequently their real shares are
4/7, 2/7, and 1/7.

Now ^.

Theref. ^ the answ.

QUESTION 54.
Three persons purchase together a ship, toward the payment of which A advanced

of the vessel had C? -- Ans. A 90 10/31l. B 116 4/31l. C 31/63 part.

SOLUTION.
First 1 - 2/9 - 2/7 = 1 - 14/63 - 18/63 = 1 - 32/63 = 31/63 = C's part.

Consequently as 31 200 ^ paid by A, ^ paid by B.


QUESTION 55.
A and B clear by an adventure at sea, 60 guineas, with which they agree to buy
a horse and chaise, of which they were to have the use, in proportion to the
sums adventured, which was found to be A 9 to B 8; they cleared 45 per cent.
What money then did each send abroad?

-- Ans. A 74l. 2s. 4 4/17d. and B 65l. 17s. 7 13/17d.

SOLUTION.
First ^ the sum of the adventures.

Therefore as 8 + 9 = 17 140 ^ ^


^

QUESTION 56.
In an article of trade, A gains 18s. 3d. and his adventure was 40s. more than
B's, whose share of profit is but 12s. What are the particulars of their stock?

-- Ans. A 5l. 16s. 9d. and B 3l. 16s. 9d.

SOLUTION.
The difference of the adventures being 40s. and the difference of the gains =
18s. 3d. - 12s. = 6s. 3d. = 6s. = 25/4.

Therefore as 25/4 40, or as 25 160, or as 5 32 ^ ^


QUESTION 57.
Three persons entered joint trade, to which A contributed 240l. and B 210l.
they clear 120l. of which 30l. belongs of right to C. Required that person's
stock, and the several gains of the other two?

-- Ans. C's stock 150l. A gained 48l. and B 42l.

SOLUTION.
First 120 - 30=90=the sum of the gains of A and B.

And 240 + 210=450=the sum of their stocks.

Therefore, as 450 90, or as 5 1 240 240/5=48=A's gain, 210 210/5=42=B's gain.


Also, as 90 450, or as 1 5 30 150=C's stock.

QUESTION 58.
A and B in partnership equally divide the gain; A's money, which was 96l. 12s.
lay for 15 months, and B's for no more than 6: What was the adventure of the
latter? -- Ans. 241l. 10s.

SOLUTION.
Since the two shares of the gain are equal, by the rule of Double-Fellowship
it appears that the two products are equal which are made by multiplying each
stock by its time, and consequently that the stocks are inversely or
reciprocally as the times. Hence

As 6 15, or as 2 5 96l. 12s. 48l. 6s. x 5=241l. 10s.=the sum adventured by B.

QUESTION 59.
Put out 420l. to interest, and in 6 years time there was sound to be due 556l.
10s. What was the rate of interest? -- Ans. 5 per cent.

SOLUTION.
First 556 - 420=136=the interest of 420 for 6 yrs. Theref. 136 / 6=273 /
13=21=its interest for 1 yr. Then as 420 21, or as 20 1 100 5. Therefore the
rate of interest was 5 per cent.

QUESTION 60.
A clears 12l. in 6 months, B 15l. in 5 months, and C, whose stock was 40l.
c^^^s 21l. in 9 months: What was the whole stock? -- Ans. 125 5/7l.

SOLUTION.
As 21 360=40 x 9, or as 7 120 ^ the prod. of A's stock and time, ^ the prod.
of B's stock and time,


Then ^ A's stock, ^ B's stock.


Lastly 240/7 + 360/7 + 40 = 600/7 + 40 = 85 5/7 + 40 = 125 5/7 = the sum of
all their stocks, as required.

QUESTION 61.
A had 12 pipes of wine, which he parted with to B at 4 per cent. profit, who
sold them to C for 40l. 12s. advantage; C made them over to D for 605l. 10s.
and cleared thereby 6 per cent. How much a gallon did this wine cost A? -- Ans.
6s. 8 6640/11077d.

SOLUTION.
The 12 pipes cost D 605l. 10s.

Therefore as 106 100, or as ^ the sum they cost C.

Consequently ^ the sum they cost B.

Hence as ^ the sum the 12 pipes cost A.

The 12th part of this is 468720/11077 = the price of 1 pipe or 126 gallons.

Divide now the numerator by 126, or by its component parts 2, 9, and 7; and
lastly divide by the denominator, for the answer, thus: ^

QUESTION 62.
A, of Amsterdam, orders B of London to remit to C of Paris, at 52d. ster. a
crown, and to draw on D, of Antwerp, for the value, at 34s. slem. a l. ster.
but as soon as B received the commission, the exchange was on Paris at 53d. a
crown: Pray at what rate of exchange ought B to draw on D, to execute his
orders, and be no loser?

-- Ans. 34s. 2 5/53d.

SOLUTION.
As ^ the answer required.

^

QUESTION 63.
A, with intention to clear 20 guineas, on a bargain with B, rates hops at 15d.
a lb. which cost him 10d. B, apprized of that, sets down malt, which cost 20s.
a quarter, at an adequate price: For how much malt did they contract? -- Ans.
49 qrs.

SOLUTION.
As ^ the gain per quarter.

Then, as ^ the number of quarters required.

QUESTION 64.
A and B venturing equal sums of money, clear by joint trade 180l. By
agreement, A was to have 8 per cent. because he spent time in the execution of
the project, and B was to have only 5: What was allotted to A for his trouble?
-- Ans. 41l. 10s. 9 3/13d.

SOLUTION.
As ^. the answer required.

QUESTION 65.
Laid out in a lot of muslin 500l. upon examination of which, 3 parts in 9
proved damaged, so that I could make but 5s. a yard of the same; and by so
doing find I lost 50l. by it. At what rate per ell am I to part with the
undamaged muslin in order to gain 50l. upon the whole?

-- Ans. 11s. 7 2/7d.

SOLUTION.
In order to gain 50l. by the whole, he must gain 100l. by the undamaged part,
because he lost 50l. by the part which was damaged.

Now the part damaged was, and the rest; also the whole cost 500l.; the of
which is 166, and the of it is 333. Consequently the damaged part was sold for
166 - 50 or 116; and the sound part must be sold for 433=333 + 100.

But the damaged part sold at 5s. per yard, therefore as 5s. or l. 116l. 1 yd.
116 x 4=466 yards, the quantity which was damaged. And the double of it, or 933
yards was the undamaged part, which must sell for 433l. Therefore as 933 1 433
433 / 933 = (by multiplying the terms both by 3) 1300/2800=13/28l. the price
per yard.

And consequently, as ^ the price per ell required.

OTHERWISE.

Since the sound part is the double of the part damaged, and the former must
gain a sum just the double of that which was lost by the latter, it is evident
that it must be sold at a rate as much above the prime cost, as the other was
below it.

Now the loss on part was 50l. at which rate the whole 500 would have brought
only 350; therefore as 350 500, or as 7 10 5s. 50/7=7 1/7s. the prime cost per
yard.

Hence 7 1/7 - 5=2 1/7=the loss per yard on the damaged part, and 7 1/7 + 2
1/7=9 2/7s. the price per yard of the sound part.

Lastly, as 4 5 9 2/7 9 2/7 x 5/4=65/7 x 5/4=325/28s. the price per ell, the
same as before.

QUESTION 66.
A, at Paris, draws on B in London, 1400 crowns, at 56d. ster. a crown, for the
value of which B draws again on A at 57d. sterling. a crown, besides reckoning
commission per cent. Did A gain or lose by this transaction, and what? -- Ans.
He gained 17 13/19 crowns.

SOLUTION.
First, 1400 x 56=78400 pence, the value of A's draft on B.

Then as 100 100, or as 200 201 78400 392 x 201d.=the sum that B must draw for
at 57d. per crown.

Therefore as ^ crowns which B must draw for.

Consequently 1400 - 1382 6/19=17 13/19 crowns is A's gain.

^

QUESTION 67.
A, B, and C are in company; A put in his share of the stock for 6 months, and
laid claim to of the profits; B put in his for 9 months; C advanced 500l. for 8
months, and required on the balance of the gain: Required the stock of the
other two adventurers?

-- Ans. A 185l. 3s. 8 4/9d. and B 172l. 16s. 9 13/27d.

SOLUTION.
First + =5/30 + 18/30=23/30 the sum of the shares of the gain of A and C.

Conseq. 1 - 23/30=7/30=the share of B. And the gains of A, B, C are
respectively proportional to the numbers 5, 7, 18.

But the gains are as the products of the stocks and times, and the product of
C's stock and time is 4000=500 x 8. Therefore as 18 4000 or as 9 2000 5
10000/9=the prod. of A's stock and time, 7 14000/9=the prod. of B's stock and
time,


These being divided by their respective times, which are 6 and 9 months, we
have ^=A's stock, ^=B's stock.


QUESTION 68.
A young hare starts 40 yards before a greyhound, and is not perceived by him
till she has been up 40 seconds; she scuds away at the rate of 10 miles an
hour, and the dog, on view, makes after her at the rate of 18: How long will
the course hold, and what ground will be run over, beginning with the
out-setting of the dog?

-- Ans. 60 5/22 sec. and 530 yards run.

SOLUTION.
First 60 x 60=3600=the number of seconds in an hour. And 1760 yards are a
mile. Therefore as 3600 40, or as 90 1 1760 x 10 1760/9=the yards run by the
hare before the dog starts. Consequently ^ the distance of the hare before the
dog when he starts, and which therefore he must run more than she in order to
overtake her.

But in 1 hour or 3600 seconds, the dog runs 8 miles or 8 x 1760 yards more
than the hare. Therefore, as ^ seconds, the time of the dog's running.

And consequently as ^. the whole space run by the dog.

QUESTION 69.
If A leave Exeter at 8 o'clock on Monday morning for London, and ride at the
rate of 3 miles an hour without intermission; and B set out from London for
Exeter at 4 the same evening, and ride 4 miles an hour constantly: Supposing
the distance between the two cities be 130 miles, whereabout on the road shall
they meet?

-- Ans. 69 3/7 miles from Exeter.

SOLUTION.
From 8 o'clock till 4 o'clock, are 8 hours. Therefore 8 x 3=24 are the miles
rode by A before B sets out from London. And consequently 130 - 24=106 are the
miles to travel between them after that.

Hence, as 7=3 + 4 3 106 318/7=45 3/7 miles more traveled by A at the meeting.

Consequently 24 + 45 3/7=69 3/7 miles from Exeter is the place of their
meeting.

QUESTION 70.
A reservoir for water has two cocks to supply it; by the first alone it may be
filled in 40 minutes, by the second in 50 min. and it has a discharging cock,
by which it may, when full, be emptied in 25 min. Now, supposing that these 3
cocks are all left open, and that the water comes in; in what time, supposing
the influx and efflux of the water to be always alike, would the cistern be
filled? -- Ans. 3 hrs. 20 min.

SOLUTION.
The rates of running are reciprocally as the times of filling. Therefore the
rate of increase of the influx over the efflux, is as ^, which rate of increase
is also reciprocally as the time of filling.

Therefore the whole time of filling, is 200/1 minutes, or 3 hours 20
minutes=the answer required.

QUESTION 71.
A sets out of London for Lincoln, at the very same time that B at Lincoln sets
forward for London, distant 100 miles: After 7 hours they meet on the road, and
it then appeared that A had road 1 miles an hour more than B. At what rate an
hour did each of them travel?

-- Ans. A 7 25/28, and B 6 11/28 miles.

SOLUTION.
First, 7 x 1=10 miles which A travels more than B.

Hence ^ traveled by A, And ^ traveled by B.
Then dividing each distance by 7, the time of traveling, we have 55 / 7 = 7
25/28 = A's rate of traveling, 44 / 7 = 6 11/28 = B's rate of traveling.


QUESTION 72.
A and B truck; A has 12 cwt. of Farnham hops, at 2l. 16s. a cwt. but in barter
insists on 3l. B has wine worth 5s. a gal. which he raises in proportion to A's
demand. On the balance A received but a hhd. of wine: What had he in ready
money? -- Ans. 20l. 12s. 6d.

SOLUTION.
First, 12 x 3=37l.=37l. 10s. is the amount of the hops.

But as ^ the barter price per gallon of the wine. Therefore ^ is the value of
the hogshead of wine.

Consequently the difference, or 37l. 10s. - 16l. 17s. 6d.=20l. 12s. 6d. is the
sum given in money.

QUESTION 73.
A, of Amsterdam, owes to B, of Paris, 3000 guilders of current specie, which
he is to remit to him, by order, the exchange 91d. Flem. de banco a crown, the
agio 4 per cent. but when this was to be negotiated, the exchange was down at
90d. a crown, and the agio 5 per cent. What did B get by this turn of affairs?

-- Ans. 5 live. 12 sol. 8 584/1183 den.

SOLUTION.
First, 3000 guilders=3000 x 40=120000 pence, currency.

And as 104 100 120000 12000000/104=1500000/13 d. banco.

Then as ^ crowns, the amount at the first exchange.

Again, as 105 100, or as 21 20 1200000 800000/7d. banco.

Then as 90 800000/7 1 cr.=80000/63 crowns, the amount by the latter exchange.

The difference, or ^ is the sum gained by B.

^

FINIS.
ERRATUM.
In the note to the equation of payments, (in the Arithmetic) containing
Malcolm's rule, the remark concerning a greater number of payments than two,
should be omitted, as that method of equating for 3 or more payments, will not
give the answer strictly true. But in all such cases, to obtain the just
answer, Malcolm's General Principle of Solution ought to be used, viz. making
the interests of the sums that are kept till after they are due, equal to the
discounts of those which are paid before they are due. The resolution of the
resulting equation will indeed require some knowledge in Algebra; but for
ordinary purposes, the rule in common use will bring out answers sufficiently
near the truth.
