SONGS, CHORUSES: etc. IN THE GLORIOUS FIRST OF JUNE.
GLEE.
MARY, SUSAN, BOY, and COUNTRYMEN, ADIEU to the village delights
Which lately my fancy enjoyed,
No longer the country invites,
To me all its pleasures are void.
Adieu to the health-breathing hill,
Thou can not my comfort restore,
For ever adieu my dear Will,
My Henry, alas! is no more.

SONG. --
BOY. When it is night, and the mid watch is come,
And chilling mists hang over the darkened main,
Then sailors think of their far-distant home,
And of those friends they never may see again;
But when the fight's begun,
Each serving at his gun,
Should any thought of them come over our mind;
We think that should the day be won;
How 'twill cheer
Their hearts to hear
That their old companion he was one.
Or, my lad, if you a mistress kind,
Have left on shore; some pretty girl and true,
Who many a night does listen to the wind,
And sighs to think how it may fare with you,
O! when the fight's begun
Each serving at his gun,
Should any thought of her come over your mind;
Think only should the day be won:
How 'twill cheer
Her heart to hear
That her own true sailor he was one.

SONG. --
SUSAN. Oh, stay, my love, my William, dear,
Ah! whither art thou flying?
Nor think thou of my parents here,
Nor heed'st thy Susan sighing;
Thy country's cause and honor call,
Are words that but deceive thee,
Thou see my tears, how fast they fall,
Thou must not, William, leave me.
Who Will over them watch, if thus we part,
In sickness or in sorrow,
In some cold shed, with breaking heart,
Where will thy comfort borrow?
Neglected left, no William nigh,
To cheer, protect, relieve them;
I, helpless, thrown aside to die,
Thou must not, William, leave them.
Ah me! and think a summers flown,
Perhaps we part for ever;
The fondest hearts that ever were known,
Unpitying death will sever!
Then why ever waste or throw away?
('Twill pass too soon, believe me)
Our day of love, our little day,
Thou must not, William, leave me.

SONG. --
SPLICEM. When in war on the occean, we meet the proud foe,
With ardour for conquest our bosoms do glow,
Should they see on our vessels Old England's flag wave,
It Is worthy of Britons, who conquer to save.
Their tri-colour'd ensigns we view from afar,
With three cheers they are welcomed by each British tar;
Whilst the Genius of Britain still bids us advance,
Our great guns in thunder hurls defiance to France.
But mark our last broadside; she sinks, down she goes;
Quickly man all your boats, they no longer are foes,
To snatch a brave fellow from a watery grave,
Is worthy a Briton, who conquers to save.
Happy land, thou have now in defense of thy rights,
Brave HOW, who the man and the hero unites;
The friend to the wretched, the boast of the brave,
He lives still to conquer and conquers to save.

QUINTETTO.
SPLICEM, COUNTRYMEN, MARY, and SUSAN. The eventful hour is near at hand,
That must my destiny command:
Ah! could I purchase fortune's smile,
Whole years of fortune pain and toil
I Would yield to her capricious power,
And bribe her for that single hour.

SONG.
TOM OAKUM, Over the vast surface of the deep
Britain shall still her empire keep;
Her heav'n-descended charter long,
The favorite theme of glory's song,
Shall still proclaim the blessed decree,
That Britons ever shall be free.
"Though hostile bands in fierce array,
"Dare to dispute her sovereign sway;
"Though savage fury, nursed in gore,
"Boast to despoil her silver shore;
"Heaven still supports her best decree,
"That Britons ever will be free.
"'It Was thus with HOW, illustrious name!
"Still adding to a life of fame,
"Through Gallia's proud Armada broke --
"And Albion's wrath in thunder spoke,
"While Victory sanction'd the degree --
"That Britons ever shall be free.
Hail happy Britain, favored isle,
Where freedom, arts, and commerce shine;
Long may thy George in glory prove,
The transports of a nation's love;
Long reign to guard the blessed decree.
That Britons ever shall be free.

DUET. --
MARY and SUSAN. Our hearts with joy expanding,
Your voice our fate commanding,
Most grateful thanks demanding
Accept the tribute due:
Whatever good befalling,
We still shall think of you;
Adieu --
Whatever good befalling,
Our gratitude recalling,
We still shall think of you.

ACT II.
SONG.
MARGARETTA. Never, never, when you 've won us
Can we trust in faithless man?
For our constant love you shun us
And we are dup'd do all we can.
Soon the passion you pretended,
Like a magic charm is ended,
While we are grieving, sobbing, crying;
You're to others kneeling, sighing,
Wheedling, vowing, weeping, dying,
To betray wherever you can
Never, never, etc.
Silly maidens, here take warning,
Vows of love, with prudence scorning.
Never, never, etc.

DIALOGUE DUET. MARGARETTA and SUSAN.
Marg. Of lover's you will have plenty,
Be married ere you're twenty,
The youth whom most you favor
Is gone hence a far;
An honest farmer wooes you,
A lawyer too pursues you;
But ah! your heart's enslaver
Is a British Tar.
His country's cause espousing,
The trump of glory rousing
His valor's best emotion,
He Will a conq'ror prove.
But ah! the fatal story!
The heart which pants for glory.
Inconstant as the ocean.

Susan. And is he false in love?

Marg. This morning I espied you,
By magic art descried you,
The sailor's gift receiving,
It was a purse of gold.

Susan. I Will pay it where it is owing
A keepsake too bestowing,
My kindred's wants relieving.

Marg. Your gratitude thus raising
His noble bounty praising,
Your heart so fond believing.

Susan. Is to my William true

Marg. The traitor's love disdaining
That keepsake, why retaining,

Both. In trust this pledge receiving,
Is Margaretta's due.

SONG.
BEN. Our line was formed, the French lay too,
One sigh I gave to Poll on shore,
Too cold I thought our last adieu,
Our parting kisses seemed too few!
If we should meet no more.
But love avast! my heart is oak!
Howe's daring signal floats on high,
I see through roaring cannon's smoke
Their awful line subdued and broke,
They strike! -- they sink! -- they fly!
CHORUS.
Now (danger past) w'll drink and joke
Sing "Rule Britannia! hearts of oak!"
And toast before each martial tune,
How and the Glorious first of June.
Farewell, to every sea delight,
The cruize with eager watchful days,
The skillful chase by glimering night:
The well worked ship, the gallant fight:
The loved commander's praise:
Yet Polly's love and constancy,
With prattling babes, more joy shall bring,
Proud when my boys shall first at sea.
Follow great How and victory,
And serve our noble King.
CHORUS.
Then, etc.
