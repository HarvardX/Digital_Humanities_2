Pretty SALLY's Garland. OR, Johnny's Kind Courtship. In Two PARTS.


OF all the Girls that are so smart,
There Is none like pretty Sally,
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our Alley.
There is no Lady in the Land
Is half so sweet as Sally.
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our Alley.
Her Father he makes Cabbage-Nets,
And through the Steets does cry them.
Her Mother she sells Laces long
To those that please to buy them.
But sure such Folks could never beget
So sweet a Girl as Sally,
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our alley.
When she is by, I leave my Work,
I love her so sincerely.
My master comes like any Turk,
And bangs me most severely.
But let him bang his Belly-full,
I Will bear it all for Sally.
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our Alley.
Of all the Days that are in the Week,
I dearly love but one Day.
And that is the Day that comes betwixt
The Saturday and Monday.
For then I Am dressed all in my Best,
To walk abroad with Sally.
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our Alley.
My Master carries me to church,
And often am I blamed,
Because I leave him in the lurch,
As soon as Text is named.
I leave the church in Sermon-time,
And slink away to Sally,
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our Alley.
When Christmas comes about again,
Oh! then I shall have money;
I Will hoard it up, and box it all,
And give it to my Honey.
I wish it were Ten Thousand Pounds,
I Would give it all to Sally,
She is the Darling of my Heart,
And she lives in our Alley.
My Master and the Neighbors all
Make Game of me and Sally,
And but for her I Would better be
A slave, and row a Galley.
But when my seven long Years are out,
Oh! then I Will marry Sally.
Oh I then we'll wed, and then we'll bed,
But not in our Alley.
Pretty Sally's Answer.
OF all the Lads in London Town,
There Is none I love like Johnny.
He walks so stately over the Ground,
I like him for my Honey.
And none but him I ever will wed,
As my Name is Sally:
And I will dress me in my Best,
In spite of all our Alley.
Because that Nan and Sue did say,
That live in our Alley,
Unto Bess Franklin, do but see,
Look there goes pretty Sally.
But let them know, though they say so,
That I have Store of Money.
And can an Hundred Pounds bestow
On John, my dearest Honey.
It Is true my Father deals in Nets,
My Mother in long Laces.
But what of that, if Johnny's pleased,
'Twon't hinder our embraces.
For Johnny he does often swear,
He dearly loves his Sally.
And for the Neighbors I don't care,
We will live in our Alley.
It Is true, when Johnny comes along,
And I by chance do meet him,
His Master comes out with a Stick,
And sorely he does beat him,
Yet Johnny shall be made Amends,
When his Time's out, by Sally,
In spite of all the Rogues and Whores
That live in our Alley.
There is one Day in every Week
That Johnny does come to me.
And then I own I am well pleased,
When he does kiss and woo me.
Then in the Fields we walk and talk,
He calls me dearest Sally,
I love him, and I Will have him too,
In spite of all our Alley.
His Cheeks are of a Crimson Red,
Black Eyebrows he does carry.
His Temper is so sweet and good,
My Johnny I will marry.
Though all our Neigbours spite us sore,
Because Johnny loves his Sally.
But I love Johnny more and more.
And a Fig for all our Alley.
Old Woman grumble, and the Maids
Are all in Love with Johnny
Their Guts to Fiddle-strings may fret,
For he will not leave his Honey.
At Midsummer his Time is out,
Then Hand-in-Hand will Sally
Unto the Parson with him go,
In spite of all our Alley.
