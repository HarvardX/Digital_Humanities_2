ADVERTISEMENT.
THE Drama of the BLACKAMOOR WASHED WHITE, was originally designed for a Comedy
of two acts; -- but from the omission of a character of an extraordinary
length, agreeable to the judicious opinion of Mr. Garrick, it has been hastily
converted, since its first reception for the stage, into the COMIC OPERA, which
now awaits the judgment of a candid, English audience.

AIRS, BALLADS, etc.
ACT I.
AIR I.
MR. PARSONS. LOOK ye here!
Ay and there!
Oh, my ruin now is clear,
For I Have track'd him above, and below:
Hopes are vain; --
See its plain
Where he doubles back again,
Like a frisky jack-hare in the snow!

AIR II.
MR. PARSONS. When a woman's brain teems
With such strange wanton dreams,
And she tosses, and turns in her bed,
It Is at least ten to one
But the husband's undone,
Since the birth is designed for his head.
Mercy what have we here? --
I am pregnant I fear,
My disorder no medicine can cure!
I feel such a shooting,
I Am surely cornuting,
Oh, the labor how shall I endure!

AIR III.
MRS. BRADSHAW. Though lords and ladies shine
In finer clothes than mine,
I have none of their cares for to flout me;
I envy not their pelf,
I Am a duchess in myself,
With my cocks, and my hens all about me.

AIR IV.
MR. DAVIES. Love and woman in unison play: --
To keep courtship's sky bright, and clear,
Ma'm's as gentle as May,
Bills, and coos all the day,
Though discord is close in the rear! --
So Love's catering, saucy, sly, pickle,
The poison conceals of his dart,
For first with the feather he will tickle,
And then -- strike the barb to your heart!

AIR V.
MR. VERNON. The stream that environed her cot
All the charms of my deity knew;
How often has its course been forgot,
While it paused -- her dear image to woo?
Believe me, the fond silver tide
Knew from whence it derived the fair prize,
For, silently swelling with pride,
It reflected her -- back to the skies.

VI. BALLAD.
MR. KING. I.
When first I came hither to sarvice,
I thought I would learn how to woo,
So at Lammas I courted Doll Jarvise,
Oh, there was the devil to do!
Tho'f at first my poor heart she denoy'd it,
She made it as sick as a dog,
And like a Jack Lantern decoyed it
With her eyes, -- over briar and bog.
II.
Odsooks, but the tit beat me hollow,
She run me so soon off my wind,
For the more little Jerry did follow,
She left him the further behind;
But one moon-shiny night made me happy,
For home in a tiff did I jog,
And left Doll for to find a new sappy,
To dance over briar and bog.

AIR VII.
MRS. WRIGHTEN. How weak the maid, who is led astray
By state, by wealth, or fashion?
Whose heart can never own their sway,
For love's a generous passion!
Where shall the self-made captive find
A joy, that is worth the knowing?
But from two hearts by love conjoined,
What endless transports flowing!

VIII. BALLAD.
MR. KING. I.
Must a Christian man's son born and bred up,
By a Negar be flung in disgrace, --
Be ashamed for to hold his poor head up,
'Ca'se as how he has got a white face?
-- No, never mind, little Jerry,
Let your honest heart be merry;
British boys will still be right,
Till they prove that black is white!
II.
M'hap the nabob, that brought the poor creature
From his father, and mother, and all,
Is himself of a blackamoor nature,
Dark within as the tribe of Bengal.
-- So never mind it, little Jerry,
Let your honest heart be merry;
British boys will still be right,
Till they prove that black is white!

AIRS, BALLADS, etc.
ACT II.
These stanzas, (the only air originally intended for the piece), were written
to the very celebrated Gramachrie, long before it was known, that the author of
the Duenna intended to make use of it in his favorite opera.
AIR IX.
MR. VERNON. WHEN JULIA sled, her constant swain
(How could she slight him so?)
I sought her steps over every plain,
Oppressed with love, and woe:
I hung my lyre upon a tree,
And cried with aching heart,
Ye Gods! how cruel your decree!
Must I, and Julia part?
In vain I searched the beechen grove,
'Till night had veiled the skies,
Ah where shone then those stars of love,
The rays from Julia's eyes?
The woodland caught the mournful strain
That wrung my aching heart;
The live-long night I cried in vain,
Must I, and JULIA part?

AIR X.
MR. VERNON. The schoolboy thus in highest glee
A like disaster meets,
Who thinks to rob each active be
Of all their treasured sweets:
For instinct the design explores,
The nest is all on wing,
So that instead of honey'd stores,
The thief receives -- a sting!

AIR XI.
MRS. WRIGHTEN. For the fresh blooming spring nature sighs,
When Winter that monster appears,
Whose jealousy veils the bright skies,
Lest they melt the cold locks round his ears.
Though he pours hail and snow,
And his blasts wildly blow,
Not a subject his fury shall gain:
Not a bud shall ever shoot,
Nor a blossom bear fruit;
Not a sun shine to cheer
His sad frost-bitten year, --
Till the tyrant forego his fell reign!

AIR XII.
MRS. WRIGHTEN. No, you're not an earthly creature,
But death's shadow in disguise!
See him stamped on every feature!
What a pair of rolling eyes!
Don't come nigh me,
Let me fly thee,
Or I faint -- I fall -- I die!
See death yonder! --
Now I wonder,
Who outruns, the ghost, -- or I?

AIR XIII.
MR. VERNON. I.
Was ever such a splenetic elf?
What a whimsical figure of fun!
Who baits the fool's trap for himself,
And then cries aloud he is undone.
Sure of folly's whole brood he is the first,
Never was such an antic,
Capricious!
Suspicious!
Ever jealous or frantic,
I shall laugh at his tricks till I burst!
2.
Long as ever by these megrums possessed,
What repose shall his bosom once find?
It Is an ocean that never can rest,
Convulsed with the storms of his mind: --
Was ever such a splenetic elf, etc.
[Da Capo.
FINALE.
DUET. MR. DAVIES and MRS. WRIGHTEN.
Happy morn of love and joy!
What shall Wedlock's bliss annoy?
Hence afar Suspicion's flown,
Hymen mark the day thy own.

MR. VERNON. Here my fault'ring tongue first wooed thee!

MRS. SIDDONS. Here my ravished eyes first viewed thee!

BOTH. Mark our love, ye nymphs and swains:

MRS. SIDDONS. Here 'twas plighted!

MR. VERNON. Here requited!

MR. DAVIS and MRS. WRIGHTEN. Tell it echo through the plains:

CHORUS.
Happy morn of love and joy!
What shall WEDLOCK'S bliss annoy?
Hence afar SUSPICION'S flown,
HYMEN, mark the day thy own!

END.
