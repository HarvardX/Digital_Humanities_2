MOTHER, DAUGHTER, FRIENDS and NEIGHBORS, RUSTICS.
CHORUS of INVISIBLE SPIRITS.

TO JOHN BEARD, Esquire.
SIR,
ANY Writer of an Oratorio, an entire Stranger to your private Worth, might,
with the utmost Propriety, dedicate such a Work to YOU, as a grateful Tribute
to that high Reputation, which You acquired, and maintained, for a Succession
of Years, in this Species of Entertainment. A Stranger, I say, might do this;
but a Friend leaves that Reputation to speak for itself in the Memory of all
true Judges, and Admirers of the Sacred Drama. You are therefore desired to
accept this Attempt, merely as a Testimony of continual Esteem and Affection,
from

Your very sincere Friend, and obedient Servant, THOMAS HULL.

THE PRODIGAL SON.
PART FIRST.
FATHER, MOTHER, E. SON, DAUGHTER, and CHORUS of NEIGHBORS. CHORUS. WHAT dear
Delights the Duties bring,
Wherein thus daily we engage!
From filial Love what Comforts spring,
To warm the Hearts of shivering Age!

AIR. E. BRO. Great GOD, while suppliant thus we bend,
Thy kind, thy gracious Hearing lend
To this our fervent Prayer!
O! may our Sire's remaining Day
Enjoy a Calm, a soft Decay,
His Eve serenely fair!

DAUG. But if Disease, with venomed Dart,
Or Sorrow, wound the reverend Heart
Of those who gave us Breath;
Let us, their destined Anguish share,
Prevent or dry each painful Tear,
And smooth the Bed of Death.

CHORUS repeated. What dear Delights the Duties bring,
Wherein thus daily we engage!
From filial Love what Comforts spring,
To warm the Hearts of shivering Age!

RECITATIVE. FATH. It Is true, my pious Children; in my Breast
I feel the kindly Glow. If Love like yours
Could furnish every Joy that Life required,
I should be amply blessed. Beloved Consort!
Improver dear of every Happiness,
And Light'ner of each Care, begin the Song:
Requite we, far as feeble Age permits,
Their grateful Strain, which each revolving Day,
Due as it smiles, attests. Begin, my Comfort.

AIR and DUETT. MOTH. New Blessings, new Life ye impart,
So often as this Tribute is given;
The Prayer of the dutiful Heart,
Like Incense, arises to Heaven.

FATH. For this through your mortal Estate
In Peace shall ye walk, Hand in Hand;
And your Joys shall be many and great,
And your Days shall be long in the Land.

RECITATIVE. FATH. But say, my Children, where is the second Prop
Of my declining Age? Why joins not he
Your Orisons, and claims his wonted Blessing?

MOTH. Why joins he not indeed?

E.SON. My honored Father,
High on the Mountain's Summit, that o'er-hangs
The swelling Flood, and of the distant Plains
(Teeming with Wealth) commands an ample View,
I left him gazing on the wide Expanse,
And Joy enlarged his Eye.

MOTH. Ah! see thou not,
Lord of my Life and Love, ever since thy Hand,
(Profusely kind!) on his ill-judg'd Request,
Allotted him a Portion of thy Wealth,
A verse to these our Duties and Delights,
Our wonted social Converse, wide he strays,
Shunning thine Eye, thy Counsel -- much I fear him.

FATH. Vex not thy tranquil Mind with fancied Terrors.
By young Ambition led, and warm Desires,
Error awhile may warp his ductile Heart;
But stubborn Vice, or black Ingratitude --
My Son, sure, knows them not
AIR. To yonder Summit stretch thine Eye,
That young, aspiring Elm espy,
The Victim of each angry Sky,
To every Blast a Prey!
As weak, defenseless, and oppressed,
By stormy Passions sore distressed,
My pliant Boy may sink depressed
In Life's uncertain Day.
Like that too easily inclined
To change with every shifting Wind,
Till rooting Time mature his Mind,
And Reason's Shoots appear;
Then all the Virtues bloom apace,
Then, comely in his ripened Grace,
He stands, the Glory of the Chase,
Majestically fair!

RECITATIVE. MOTH. Oh! may it so betide! -- behold, he seeks thee --
Not such, I ween, the Countenance he wore,
Ere dowried with thy Bounty.

The PRODIGAL approaches, with Companions. PROD. Father, hail! --
Thy Hand has given me Wealth, I thank thee for it;
But more remains to grant -- thy free Consent
To taste the Pleasures, distant Climes afford:
This unbestow'd, the first is valueless,
And thou may take it back.

MOTH. Too true my Fears!
Base and ungrateful, is it not enough
Thou have withdrawn from his indulgent Love,
With jealous Hand, thy Share of worldly Wealth?
Must thou invade the Quiet of his Mind,
That dearest Treasure of his Age? Alas!
Yon spacious Robe, behold, how slight a Covering
For the Hugeness of his Grief!
AIR. With deep Indents his reverend Face
Time's Hand has furrowed over --
Can thou, perverse, and void of Grace,
Endure to wound him more?
His Sorrows, see! too big to speak,
Swell the pent Heart, and bid it break.

CHORUS. His Sorrows, see! etc.

RECITATIVE. MOTH. Why alters not thine Eye? Shame, Shame beset thee,
Thou Stranger-Lad!

FATH. Fond Advocate, forbear! --
I am myself again -- My Son, behold me!
I have not long to live -- and can thou leave me?
Plead not these falling Tears? for thee, my Child,
More than myself, such Sorrows flow.

PROD. Why seeks
My Father to retard my rising Hopes?
Can I, by staying here, recall thy Youth,
Or add a Moment more when Fate demands thee?
For Duty's Cares, and Watchings, thou have here
More Children, whom domestic Life allures,
And cool Desires engage: Me ardent Passions
And wild Extravagance of Soul inflame.
AIR. Within one narrow Bound confined,
In one poor Path to move,
Is Torture to the spacious Mind,
That through a World would rove;
Rapid as Air, my active Soul,
Would dart, impatient of Control,
From Clime to Clime, from Pole to Pole;
Each Sweet would taste, each Joy attain,
Through all Creation's wide Domain.

RECITATIVE. FATH. I grieve, my Son, to say, thy youthful Fancy
Leads thee far wide from Happiness; from Joys,
That Reason would inspire and give -- yet go --
And may thy Hopes be gratified! though much
I fear thy Disappointment.

SIST. Oh, my Brother,
With inattentive Ear, and rocky Heart,
Mock not this kind Advice;
AIR. In vain alas! from Shore to Shore
In search of Bliss we roam,
And strange Delights abroad explore,
Our best reside at home;
Within the just and-pious Heart
Our truest Joys we find,
Which calm and sweet Repose impart,
And leave no Sting behind.

MOTH. The poisoned Cup
Of Riot and Excess, Youth's surest Bane,
Too early has he tasted. -- Hence! begone,
Thou, and thy loose Companions! vex no more
The decent Quiet of our sober Roof,
Or thy fond Father's Heart.

PROD. I wanted not
This Taunt to urge me; when I next behold
My Mother's Face, perchance with less Displeasure
She may receive me.

E. SON. Stay return, my Brother!
Behold our failing Sire, who long has flourished,
Like the tall Cedar on aspiring LEBANON,
With all his growing Saplings branching round!
Oh! view him now! -- by Time and Grief impaired,
'Reft of his Strength, he bends with every Breeze.

MOTH. No longer waste your unavailing Suit
On that obdurate Wretch, who scouls Contempt
On these your kind Persuasions. To yon Sage
Turn your Attention; Lo, his trembling Limbs,
His swimming Eyes! Ah, catch him, e're he fall,
Ye, pious Pair, and to the Couch convey
Your reverend Charge. It Is well-Hear me, thou, senseless
Of every Good, thy GOD has show'rd upon thee,
Hear me this once, and tremble! --
Think, not to bear away thy Crimes unpunished --
Oh! no -- peculiar Plagues are kept in Store
For disobedient Children.

PROD. to 1st. COM. Why is thine Eye thus fixed? Can the weak Breath
Of an incensed Woman thus transform thee
A Monument of Wonder? Rouse! awake!
And join our wonted Gladness -- let the Voice
Of Music start him from this gloomy Dream,
Then lead him forth to Realms of varied Bliss,
And, as we pass, let every Hill and Dale
Repeat the jocund Notes.
SONG and CHORUS. Wake to Music, Mirth, and Love!
Let us all the Transports prove,
Wine and Beauty can inspire;
Wine exalts our amorous Fire.

CHORUS. Wake to Music etc.

PROD. Welcome the capacious Bowl,
Welcome to my thirsty Sowl!
Speed the copious Draught around,
Care and Thought alike be drowned!

CHORUS. Welcome the capacious, etc.

PROD. Welcome, welcome Woman's Charms,
Welcome to my ardent Arms,
Welcome Charms that raise Desire,
Welcome Wine that feeds the Fire!

CHORUS. Welcome, Welcome, etc.

END of the FIRST PART.
PART SECOND.
CHORUS of NEIGHBORS. CHORUS. ARISE, great GOD, with Vengeance rise,
The black unnat'ral Wretch confound,
Who dares thy great Behests despise,
Who dares a Parent's Bosom wound!

MOTHER advances. RECITATIVE. MOTH. No more, my Friends -- Heaven, in its own
due Time,
Will sentence and chastise. From the sick Bed,
And pious Task arose, my Mind is calm,
And harbors no Resentment. All my Thoughts
Are on this Suff'rer turned. While thus I sue,
That Nature's great Restorer may allay
His sore Inquietudes, his bitter Pangs,
With your good Wishes aid the suppliant Strain,
Oh! aid, and wast it to the eternal Throne!

AIR. MOTH. Grant, holy Lord, that dewy Sleep
May shed its balmy Comforts over him!
In gentle Dreams his Senses steep,
And place ideal Joys before him,
That his waking Thoughts may be
Full of Hope, and full of thee!

PRODIGAL and COMPANIONS. PROD. Why this Suspense? Why should a Moment's Pause
Pall the rich Pleasures of our glowing Hearts?
Joy, like the rapid Ocean's ceaseless Wave,
With unremitting Force should pour along,
While Strength and Nature aid the generous Course.

AIR and CHORUS. PROD. With Love and Impatience I burn,
In our Revels let Love have his Turn!
From Pleasure to Pleasure we range,
Say, say, what is Life without Change?
Away with the Vintage, away with the Bowl,
Till Beauty has poured her Delights on my Soul.

CHORUS. Away with the Vintage, etc.

PROD. II.
Then again over the Flaggon we meet,
The Roof-rending Chorus repeat;
As the Goblet the Table overflows,
Our Fullness of Transport it shows;
Thus, Thus, let us revel in various Delight,
Let Wine crown the Day and let Love crown the Night

CHORUS. Thus, thus, let us revel, etc.

RECITATIVE. 2d. COM. See, see, behold thy Comrade! say, thou Dreamer,
Why, with reluctant Hand, did thou upheave
The brimming Bowl, and wherefore did thy Lip
Shun the rich Draught distasteful?

1st. COM. With Disgust,
Or Shame -- I know not what -- my Mind is charged
AIR. Within my dark, my troubled Soul,
What sudden Doubts tumultuous roll!
Some awful Power usurps my Heart,
Some awful Voice, cries out, "Depart;"
"The intemperate Board, it is Riots shun,
"Destruction hastes -- away! -- begone! --

RECITATIVE. PROD. Stay, my Friend,
And share my Joys! thy loved Companion-ship
Gives them a double Relish.

2d. COM. Let him go;
Our Portion is the more. See where approaches,
In loose Attire, a lovely Train of Beauties;
With tripping Gait, and wanton Eye, they court
Our ardent Wishes. In delightful Strife
Now war we for the fairest!

PROD. Various Fancy
In each beholds Attraction. Here I fix --
These auburn Locks, these glowing Cheeks, these Eyes,
Practiced in Love's soft Eloquence, invite me.
TRIO and CHORUS. Hither, fair one, hither bend,
Warm Desires thy Steps attend!

2d. COM. Hither, fair one, speed thy Way,
Ardent Throbs brook no Delay!

3d. COM. Hither, fair one, hither dart,
Damp not thou a burning Heart!

PROD. Grandeur thee and Wealth await,
All the Luxury of State.

2d. COM. Thee the full the festive Board,
All that Fruits and Wines afford.

3d. COM. Thee the Pipe, the sprightly Ball,
Haste thee, Nymph, at Music's call!

CHORUS. Hither, fair one, hither bend,
Warm Desires thy Steps attend!

RECITATIVE. 2d. COM. What Heart, but to the Throne of Beauty bows,
And owns her Power resistless? -- See relenting
Thy favorite Comrade!

1st. COM. No such impious Motive
Recalls my Step; but Zeal for thee, my Friend.
Read'st thou not in my Eye some horrid Tidings?
Within this Land, fell FAMINE, meagre Fiend,
With ghastly Mein advances. Wide he stalks,
And, as he goes, destroys; the wretched Rustic
Threats Violation to thy treasured Hoards,
To gratify his Wants. Rouse thee, my Friend,
And open thine Eyes to Virtue!
AIR. What Stores have been consumed!
What Days to Riot doomed!
See! Ruin aims the deadly Blow,
While yet possessed of Power;
Repent the lavish Hour!
Repent, 'ere sunk in endless woe!

RECITATIVE. PROD. Hence! Begone!
Thou Poison to our Joys! and brood alone
Oe'r thy spleen-born Suggestions. While the Moment
Of Mirth invites, no Thought of future Ill
Shall interrupt the Enjoyment. Let us on.

CHORUS. The Heart, inflamed with amorous Fire,
Glowing Charms and ripe Desire,
Scorns to yield to freezing Fear,
Fear and Doubt are Strangers here;
Sovereign of the Bosom's Throne,
Love controuls, and Love alone.

Eldest BROTHER and SISTER. RECITATIVE. E. BRO. Sister, I trust our Father's
long Disease
Will soon have End; his Medicines have prevailed;
And Nature's great Restorative begins
To crown our earnest Prayers.

SIST. Even now I left him
Folded in balmy Sleep. With softest Breathings
His Bosom mildly heaved. Some heavenly Dream
Inspired, and whispered Comfort to his Heart;
For, ever and anon, a gentle Smile
Stole on his Cheek, whileLife's recruited Stream,
In graceful Tints, gave Signs of inward Joy.

E. BRO. Thanks, gracious GOD! Hereon, beloved Sister,
I build a Trust immovable.
AIR. When pious Hearts, with Zeal unfeigned,
The Throne of Heaven address,
The KING OF KINGS an Ear will lend,
Prone to pity, save, and bless.

FATHER, MOTHER, and NEIGHBORS advance. RECITATIVE. SIST. And see! confirming
this your pious Faith,
Our Sire has left his Couch; with added Strength
He moves this Way. Advance we to his Aid!

FATH. Ye (wondrous Pair!) Ye, who can make Amends
For greater Pains, than one unduteous Boy
Can give an aged Parent's failing Heart,
Partake your Mother's Joy; from softest Sleep
Gently released, some more than wonted Spirit
Informs my Mind, my Frame appears new-brac'd,
And every Pain is flown.
AIR. Returning Health has warmed me,
Returning Strength has armed me
To greet once more the all-cheering Day;
With active Heat
My Pulses beat,
In nimble Round
My Spirits bound,
And revel in the sunny Ray.

RECITATIVE. MOTH. Yes, yes, my Children;
The dearest Help-mate, Wife yet ever knew,
Heaven has restored to my desiring Soul;
How shall I speak my Rapture, how my Praise?
QUARTETTO and CHORUS. To pay our GOD the Tribute due,
Faint is Utt'rance, Words are few.

SIST. Bended Knees, and prostrate Heart,
Grateful Thanks can best impart.

E. BRO. What the falt'ring Tongue denies
The Fullness of the Soul supplies.

FATH. Yet your feeble Efforts try,
Lift your Voices, lift them high!

CHORUS. Yet your feeble Efforts, etc.

FATH. When feeling Hearts their Thanks prefer,
Each Sigh, each Thought, to Heaven is dear.

CHORUS. When feeling Hearts, etc.

FATH. Our GOD, who reigns in endless State,
Is mild as just, and kind as great.

CHORUS. Our GOD, who reigns in endless State,
Is mild as just, and kind as great.

END of the SECOND PART.
PART THIRD.
CHORUS of RUSTICS. ALL gracious GOD! Oh! hear our Cry!
Hear and redress -- we faint -- we dye.
No Dew to cheer the parching Ground,
A sad, a dreary Waste around!
The Hind surveys her helpless Brood,
Surveys, and moans their Want of Food!
Each living Thing, in wild Despair,
With piercing Howlings rends the Air.
All gracious GOD! Oh! hear our Cry!
Hear and redress -- we faint -- -- we dye.

FIRST COMPANION. RECITATIVE. 1st. COM. A little longer yet, ye feeble Limbs,
Support my languid Frame! While any Share
Of Strength remains, I must not, cannot leave
This miserable Man. Oh! had he taken
My friendly Admonition! -- What a Change!
Few Days are past, since I beheld him crowned
With Stores for Length of Years -- now, desolate,
In tattered Weeds, (to these inclement Skies
His Body half exposed) for very Need,
He tends a Rustic's Swine, and yearns to feed
On Husks and Filth with his uncleanly Charge.
Lo! now he starts, all frantic with his Woes;
His haggard Eye Balls, and up-staring Hair,
Speak his torn Mind -- this Way, and that, he flies,
As though he shunned himself.
PRODIGAL advances. Destruction come! --
In thy most horrid Shape -- I shun thee not --
Is there within thy Treasury of Plagues
Worse than I now endure? The very Rustics
Taunt and deride my Wants -- How many Servants,
Within my Father's House, have Bread to spare,
While I with Hunger sink -- Destruction, come!
AIR. Unappal'd, thou Sky, behold me,
All thy Plagues around me shower,
In thy bluest Fires enfold me,
Thus I dare thy utmost Power.
RECIT. accompanied. What sudden Bolt! O wished for Blow! my Heart
Is cold -- my Blood is froze -- my sightless Balls
Are sunk in utter Darkness. Friendly Death,
These are thy Terrors -- thus I give thee Welcome*

1st. COM. Lo! dashed to Earth, a perished Monument
Of black Despair he seems!
AIR. In this dread Moment, gracious GOD,
His Pangs with Pity see;
Awake Remorse within his Breast,
And turn his Heart to thee!
O! let the Spirit of thy Grace
His wandering Sense reclaim;
That yet the Suff'rer may repent,
And live to praise thy Name!

RECITATIVE. PROD. Oh, ruthless Fate!
Have thou again unclos'd my Eyes, to view
These Scenes of Desolation? Well I hoped
I had been past the Reach of Pain and Grief;
But Oh! I wake to deeper Sense of Woe,
Such as o'erbears my Spirits. -- Every Nerve
To more than Infant-weakness is relaxed.
Ha! what are these -- these falling Drops, that scald
The Cheek, they moisten? my full Bosom glows.
Methinks, I now could pray -- But in what Terms
Can Guilt, like mine, address the Throne of Grace?

SOLEMN CHORUS, by INVISIBLE SPIRITS. Fear not -- fear not -- waft thy Prayer!
Waft thy Thoughts, thy Wishes there!
Damp not now this infant Flame!
GOD, and Mercy, are the same.

RECITATIVE. PROD. How can I hope my Crimes should be forgiven?
How shall I dare look up, who, unconcerned,
Could hear the Cry of wailing Misery,
While Plenty crowned me? I, who gave to Luxury,
To wretched Wantons, and intemperate Boards,
The poor Man's Dole? -- No, I am past Forgiveness.

CHORUS repeated. Fear not, etc.

1st. COM. Oh! blessed Sight! those bended Knees! that Look,
Of meek, submissive, silent, Adoration,
Imploring Strength and Counsel from above!
Angels of Good, aid, and direct his Mind!

PROD. I will arise, and go unto my Father,
And, stretched in Dust beneath his reverend Feet,
Thus will I say unto him:
Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy
to be called thy Son.
RECITATIVE. 1st. COM. Blessed be our GOD! who has inclined his Ear,
And turned this Sinner's Heart! let me but bear
This feeble Frame along, till I behold him
Clasped in a Father's Arms, and then --
SYMPHONY of AERIAL MUSIC. But hark!
What heavenly Sounds! enkindling all my Soul
With Wonder and Delight!

ATTEND. SPIRIT. Thou chosen Man!
Whose conscious Heart spontaneous could resist
The intoxicating Draught of false Delight,
Warn thy lost Friend, mourn over his fallen Estate,
And share his Troubles, to redeem his Soul,

AIR and CHORUS of ATTENDANT SPIRITS. SPIR. Go hence, in Triumph, go!
Here ends thy Date of Woe --
No longer shall thy Bosom mourn --

CHORUS. Go hence, etc.

SPIR. Bright Friendship and Renown
Thy future Days shall crown;
To Pleasure and to Peace return.

CHORUS. Bright Friendship, etc.

FATHER, MOTHER, Elder BROTHER, and SISTER. RECITATIVE. FATH. Nay, fear me not,
my Consort; bounteous Heaven
Has well repaired my Strength; I can again
Join in the wholesome Labors of the Field.

MOTH. My Life, be cautious, nor, with hasty Zeal,
Risque the dear Blessing you so lately gained;
The Air, from recent copious Showers, is chill;
These new-recover'd Beams but faintly shine,
And the rich Drops yet glisten on the Grass.
Lo! here our duteous Boy! he will prevent
Thy too-advent'rous Care.

E. BRO. With Pride, my Father --
My Life exposed, to shield thy sacred Health,
Were Transport to my Soul.

FATH. Go, my Support!
My Comfort, my Delight!

SIST. O! had a Portion
Of that sweet Virtue, which inspires this Brother,
Glowed in the other's Breast, my honored Sire
Had known no Sorrows, in his Eve of Life.

FATH. Forbear, my Child, nor let the impious Breath
Of Murmur at our Lot pollute thy Lips;
Heaven sees, and judges best. Recall to Mind
The comfortable Rule I gave thy Youth,
Should Pain or Difappointment vex thy Heart.
Follow us in.

SIST. Yes, yes, thou best of Fathers,
Never from my Mind shall that good Precept part.
AIR. Against the Power and Will divine,
Let no vain Mortal dare repine;
The KING of HEAVEN alike is wise
In what he grants, and what denies.

NEIGHBOR approaches. RECITATIVE. NEIGHB. Hail, virtuous Fair! prepare thy
Heart to taste
Of Pleasure mixed with Pain. Thy wayward Brother
Is to these Plains returned; but Oh! how changed!
A Beggar's abject Weeds begirt his Loins;
And in his Visage Shame, Remorse, and Anguish,
Have fixed their Residence.

SIST. May that Remorse
Plead for his Pardon in my Father's Breast!

NEIGHB. Distant, and awe-struck, lo! he eyes the Roof,
Where once his dearest Comfort dwelt! -- he eyes,
But fears to enter now.

SIST. And see, my Father --
(Millions of Blessings warm his precious Heart!)
See how, through Haste, he totters down the Steps,
And teaches Age to vie with agile Youth,
Eager to clasp, and take the Wanderer in.
Lo! now the sacred, dear Embrace! Close-lock'd
To the full Bosom of my kneeling Brother,
(Whom from the Dust he piously has raised)
Tears are their only Language: let us on
To share the Greetings -- but with cautious Step,
Lest, by too hasty Zeal, we interrupt
These first strong Workings of the mighty Joy,
Which bears too heavy on that aged Breast.

FATHER, MOTHER, and PRODIGAL. AIR. PROD. Against high Heaven, and thee, my
Sire,
Such great Offenses have I done,
A Child's dear Claim I do not ask,
No more deserve the Name of Son;
Thy lowest Servant let me be,
That State alas! too good for me.

RECITATIVE. FATH. O! Welcome, welcome! Heaven so deal with me,
As I receive my Boy! -- Call, call my Friends!
My Neighbors! Servants! -- Let them all attend,
And share the old Man's Rapture! Rich Attire,
And costly Jewels bring, to deck my Wanderer;
Feasting and Music shall proclaim his Welcome,
And crown his penitential Heart with Joy!

TRIO. FATH. O! Repentance how precious!

PROD. O! Pardon how dear!

BOTH. These Joys are too mighty for Mortal to bear!

MOTH. Delighted on such do the Angels look down,
Then waft the glad Tidings to Mercy's bright Throne.

FATH. O! Repentance, etc.

PROD. O! Pardon, etc.

Eldest SON advances. RECITATIVE. E. SON. For whom, my Father, these unusual
Sounds,
And Preparations?

FATH. O! my virtuous Son!
Thy once-dead Brother is alive again;
With pious Penitence, once more he seeks
A Parent's Roof, and Blessing.

E. SON. Then this Prodigal,
Who has consumed thy Wealth in vicious Riot,
For very Need returned, reaps a Reward
Unknown to blameless Duty. From my Youth,
When have I disobeyed thee? Yet for me
Never was the Minstrel called, the Feast prepared.

FATH. My steady Boy; thou Treasure of my Age,
All, all I have, is thine. Not that thy Brother
Returns, thy Rival in a Father's Love;
But that a Sinner is reformed, I joy.
For this I call the Guests, and raise the Song;
So Reason bids, and Heaven itself approves.

E. SON. It Is true, my Father! -- Through a fond Excess
Of Love, my Duty erred -- O! Pardon! Pardon!
Lo! he returns, clothed as befits thy Son;
Our Neighbors and Relations gathered round,
With Looks of Transport hail his glad Return.
Let me support thy reverend Steps to meet them,
Embrace my Brother, and improve his Rapture!

FATHER, MOTHER, E. SON, DAUGHTER, PRODIGAL, and NEIGHBORS. AIR. MOTH.
Friends, who often partook my Care,
Now my rising Pleasure share!
Share, and aid this grateful Strain,
That tries to speak my Bliss in vain;
Behold, behold, my newborn Joy,
My late-restor'd, repentant Boy!

GRAND CHORUS. Begin -- each tuneful Voice employ,
With every Power of Music joined,
To spread abroad, in Sounds of Joy,
This welcome Truth to all Mankind:
WHEN GRACE ON GUILTY MINDS HAS BEAMED,
AND SINNERS LEAVE THE WICKED WAY,
DEVOUTLY BENT NO MORE TO STRAY,
CELESTIAL THRONES WITH TRANSPORT RING,
AND ANGEL-CHOIRS EXULTING SING
A MAN RECLAIMED, A SOUL REDEEMED!

FINIS.
