Address to a Locket.
The Words from Emma Corbet.
COME, thou soft and sacred favor,
The remembrance chaste impart;
Take thy station on my bosom,
Lightly lodging near the heart.
While that tender heart shall flutter,
Thou the secret cause shall share;
Whether pleasure or disaster,
Thou shall see what stirs it there.
When the hopes of happy tidings
Shall the sweet sensations move,
When the white and winged agents
Whisper friendship, whisper love;
Then, all sympathetic thrilling,
Thou the rosy form shall guide;
While, as runs the ^iddy treasure,
You Are the genius of the tide.
Happy, when this heart is sinking,
Thou shall sooth the rising sigh;
When with woe surcharged, it is heaving,
Thou shall see the reason why.
Come, thou dear and decent favor,
Learn what thou will never impart;
Fix thy throne, and fix it ever
In the regions of my heart.
FOWLER, PRINTER, SALISBURY.
