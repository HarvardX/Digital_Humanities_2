THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH INSECTS.
PLATE CCCXXV. SPHINX TILIAE. LIME HAWK MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings deflexed when at
rest. Fly slow morning and evening.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings angulated, greenish clouded with brown,
two triangular dive spots disposed as a bar across the anterior wing, tips
white. Posterior wings yellow brown with a transverse dark bar.

The larva of this elegant Insect feeds on the Lime tree. In September it
changes to the pupa, and the Sphinx is produced in May. -- It is very common in
most parts of the country.


PLATE CCCXXVI. PTINUS PECTINICORNIS. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae filiform, the last articulation longest. Thorax
roundish, with a margin into which the head is drawn back.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Brown. Antennae yellowish and pectinated.

PTINUS PECTINICORNIS: fuscus antennis luteis pectinatis. Linn. Syst. Not. p.
1.
This species differs very much from the other Insects of the Ptinus genus in
having feathered antennae. Geoffroy, who described it before Linnaeus, called
it Ptilinus. Linnaeus placed it in his System in the Ptinus genus, and to
distinguish it named it specifically pectinicornis. The two sexes of this
Insect may be distinguished by the form of the antennae; those of the female
are but slightly pectinated, that which we have figured is the male having
large feathered antennae.

This creature lives in decayed wood.


PLATE CCCXXVII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA LEPORINA. MILLER OF MANSFIELD MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings deflexed, white, sprinkled with forked
black spots: no spots on the abdomen.

PHALAENA LEPORINA: alis deflexis albis: punctis ramosis, abdomine inmaculato.

fig. 1 -- 3.
We cannot account for the very absurd name English Aurelians have given to
this Insect. It probably originated in some trivial event, which has been long
since forgotten, but as the Insect will be better known by that name than any
other we could adopt, it is thought most advisable to retain it.

This Moth is uncommonly scarce in Great Britain. The larva is of a pale or
greenish white color with three longitudinal stripes of brown and a few black
bars across. It feeds on the Willow and Alder. Four of those larvae were taken
in the wood of Darent, 1793; and one of them was reared to the winged state.

FIG. II. PHALAENA ALNI.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Anterior wings brown with two
broad spaces of gray, divided by a transverse dark bar, and a kidney-shaped
spot in the middle. Posterior wings whitish with a marginal row of brown spots,
pale brown at the apex.

PHALAENA ALNI: cristata alis deflexis fuliginosis: areis duabus
cinerascentibus priore puncto marginali nigro. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 845. 134. --

Degeer. Ins. 1. tab. 11. fig. 25. 28.
One of the rare English species of Phalaenae known amongst collectors by the
general name of Portland Moths, having been first discovered and introduced to
notice as natives of this country by the late Duchess Dowager of Portland.

FIG III. PHALAENA DIPSACEA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax smooth. Anterior wings pale clay
color, with a broad brown ramose bar across. Posterior pair black, with an
irregular pale oblique bar, and double spot of the same near the posterior
margin.

PHALAENA DIPSACEA: laevis alis deflexis pallidis: fascia lata fusca, posticis
albo nigroque variis. Lin. Syst. Not. 2. 856. 185. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p.
2. p. 33. sp. 83. Wien. verz. 89. 3.
Hitherto considered as a scarce or at least very local species. Dr. Latham
found it in great abundance in a clover field near Dartford, Kent. The larva is
described; it is red with broken or interrupted white lines and a cinereous
head. It feeds on the Centaurea, Plantain and Tragopogon.


PLATE CCCXXVIII. PHALAENA FAGI. LOBSTER MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings reversed, reddish ash color, with two
incurvated yellowish lines across the first pair.

PHALAENA FAGI: alis reversis rufo cinereis: fasciis duabus linearibus luteis
flexuosis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 816. 30. -- Fn. Sv. 113. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. T.

tab. 12. Act. holm. 1749. 132. tab. 4. fig. 10. 14.
The trivial name of Lobster Moth, which this species has acquired from the
singular form of its larva, cannot be unfamiliar to the English Aurelian,
though the Moth itself is in the possession of few. The larva was figured and
described by Albin, and collectors about the middle of the last century
occasionally met with it in the woods near London, which have been since
destroyed. At that time it was however scarce, and being difficult to rear, the
Moth has always been deemed one of the most valuable British species of the
Lepidoptera tribe.

An old collector at Hoxton once informed us, that the larva of this Insect was
called the BREECHES Caterpillar about fifty years ago; that it was in great
request by most collectors of his time, and that he deemed himself fortunate in
finding two specimens of it in the course of his life, though he had not reared
either. Those were taken on some Chestnut trees which grew at that time in St.
George's fields. The late Mr. Bentley found it once on the Beech, and Mr.
Francillon has a specimen of it in his cabinet, which he met with himself. Our
figures are copied from Mr. Francillon's specimen, and the drawings Roesel has
given of it in his History of the Insects of Germany.


PLATE CCCXXIX. SPHEX APPENDIGASTER. SMALL-BODIED ICHNEUMON WASP. HYMENOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth armed with jaws, no tongue. Antennae consist of ten
articulations. Wings extended, without folds, and laid horizontally upon the
back. Sting sharp and pointed, and concealed within the abdomen.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black. Abdomen small, joined to the thorax by
a footstalk. Posterior legs very long.

SPHEX APPENDIGASTER: atra abdomine petiolata brevissimo, pedibus posticis
longissimis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 945. 12. -- Gmel. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 2723.
245. sp. 12. EVANIA APPENDIGASTER: atra abdomine petiolato brevissimo dorso
thoracis imposito, pedibus posticis longissimis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 2. 141. 1.
Degeer. Ins. 3. 394. tab. 30. fig. 14. Reaum. Ins. 6. tab. 31. fig. 13.
The novelty of this creature will be immediately obvious to those in the
slightest degree acquainted with the hymenopterous tribes of Insects. At first
sight it has the exact appearance of an Insect deprived of the body, for the
abdomen is extremely small in proportion to the other parts, and so much
recurved or bent under the posterior part of the thorax as to be scarcely
visible.

It is not more remarkable for its singularity than rarity, for we have
ventured to introduce it as an English Insect on one authority only. -- A
specimen of it was lately taken by the Rev. James Coyte of Ipswich, in Suffolk.
We have it from the South of Europe.


PLATE CCCXXX. PHALAENA ACERIS. SYCAMORE MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, gray,
undulated with black, and a black dagger-like mark at the base of the anterior
pair.

PHALAENA ACERIS: cristata alis deflexis canis nigro undatis, abdomine subtus
basi brunneo. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 846. 137. -- Fn. Sv. 1179. -- Fab. Ent. Syst.
T. 3. p. 2. p. 107. sp. 322. Wilks pap. 32. tab. 2. c. 6. Reaum. Ins. 1. tab.
34. fig. 11. Frisch. Ins. 1. tab. 5.
The larva of this species feeds on the Sycamore, it becomes a pupa late in
August, and appears in the winged state in June.

Another Moth very analogous to this species is known amongst English
collectors by the name of Sycamore likeness; it is exceedingly similar in its
color and marks, but is destitute of the small dagger-form black spot which is
situated near the base of the anterior wings in Phalaena Aceris.


PLATE CCCXXXI. PHALAENA DELPHINII. PEASE-BLOSSOM MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, first pair
purple with two broad transverse whitish bars, second pair pale brown.

PHALAENA DELPHINII: cristata alis deflexis purpurascentibus: fasciis duabus
albidis, posticis obscuris. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 857. 188. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. T.
3. p. 2. p. 90. sp. 267. Geoff. Ins. 2. 164. 109. Merian. Europ. 1. tab. 40.
Roes. Ins. 1. phal. 2. tab. 12. Panz. Fn. Germ. 7. tab. 17.
The Phalaena Delphinii is extremely rare. A traditionary opinion seemed to
prevail amongst the old collectors of English Insects, that it had been taken
in this country, but the fact was not clearly ascertained till within the last
two years.

The late Duchess of Portland, it is reported, once found a mutilated wing of
some Phalaena hanging in a cobweb, which it was conjectured had belonged to
this species; but on such slender authority few were disposed to consider it as
a British Insect: and thence it remained a subject of dispute till the summer
of 1799, when our worthy friend W. Jones, Esquire. met with a charming specimen of
it alive in his own garden at Chelsea; and thereby removed every doubt
respecting it, as a British Species.

The larva feeds on the Larkspur, and is figured by Roesel together with the
eggs and pupa; those figures we have copied in the annexed plate, as they
render the history of this interesting. Insect more complete than our limited
information would otherwise permit. -- The larva seems to bear some resemblance
to those of Phalaena Verbasci, or Water Betony Moth; the colors are nearly the
same, but the black spots in the former are more numerous.


PLATE CCCXXXII. BLATTA LAPPONICA. HEMIPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Head inflected. Antennae setaceous. Elytra semicoriaceous.
Thorax flat, orbicular and margined. Feet formed for running.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Yellowish. A few black spots on the
longitudinal ridge of the wing cases.

BLATTA LAPPONICA: flavescens elytris nigro maculatis. Linn. Fn. Sv. 863. --
Gmel. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 2044. Sulz. Ins. t. 8. f. 3. Geoffr. Ins. par. 1. p.
381. n. 3.
We believe this is a scarce Species in Great Britain. The late Mr. Bentley has
taken it about Epping. -- It is very common in Lapland.


PLATE CCCXXXIII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA REPANDARIA. THE MOTTLED BEAUTY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae pectinated. Wings gray, undulated, clouded with
brown, and surrounded with a black waved marginal line.

PHALAENA REPANDARIA: pectinicornis, alis cinercis: omnibus fusco-undatis;

Suec. 1260. Kleeman Ins. 1. t. 14. fig. 1. 2. t. 28. f. 1.
The two Moths figured I. I. in the annexed plate are supposed to be the male
and female of the same species. Taken in June, about Willows.

FIG. II. PHALAENA CONSORTARIA. THE PALE OAK BEAUTY.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae feathered. Wings pale greyish, waved with brown.
An eye-shaped spot, whith an oblong white pupil in the middle of the posterior
wings.

PHALAENA CONSORTARIA: pectinicornis alis dentatis griseis fusco strigosis:
posticis puncto ocellari oblongo albido. Fab. Ent. Syst. 3. b. 137. 29.
Found on the Oak in June.


PLATE CCCXXXIV. PHALAENA FLAVOCINCTA. GREAT RANUNCULUS MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed: margins
dentated. First pair greyish brown, obscurely clouded and variegated with small
orange-yellow spots.

PHALAENA FLAVOCINCTA: cristata alis deflexis dentatis fusco cinereoque variis
fulvo punctatis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 114. sp. 334. Noctua
flavocincta. Wien. Verz. 72. 2. Roes. Ins. 1. phal. 2. tab. 54. 55.
The larva is supposed to feed on the black Cherry and Sloe; on the latter of
which we once found it. Its English name implies that it feeds also on some
plant of the Ranunculus genus. In the winged state it is sometimes met with in
gardens.

Another Insect analagous to this species has been named the small Ranunculus
Moth.


PLATE CCCXXXV. CHRYSOMELA MARGINELLA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae composed of globular articulations, increasing in
bulk toward the ends. Thorax and elytra without margins.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Black. Head, thorax, feet, and exterior border of the
wing-cases yellowish.

CHRYSOMELA MARGINELLA; niger, capite thorace pedibus coleoptrorumque limbo
flavis.
A new species, taken in Coombe Wood in the month of July, by Alex. M'Leay,
Esquire. and the Rev. Mr. Kirby.


PLATE CCCXXXVI. PHALAENA PINIARIA. PINE MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae feathered. Upper side brown, with
broad yellowish spots in the disk. Under side mottled, and clouded with two
dark bars across the posterior pair.

PHALAENA PINIARIA: pectinicornis alis fuscis flavo maculatis subtus nebulosis:
fasciis duabus fuscis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 861. 210. Fn. Sv. 1233. Fab. Ent.
Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 141. sp. 45. Clerk. phal. tab. 1. fig. 10. Schoeff. Icon.
tab. 159. fig. 1. 2.
This rare and curious species of Phalaena has been for some years admitted to
the cabinets of English Natural History, but on the most dubious authority.
That it is an inhabitant of Great Britain, is however now ascertained, for in
the summer of the present year: about the last week in June, it was observed in
great plenty in a fir wood at Crathis, on the north bank of the river Dee, in
Mearnshire, Scotland, by George Milne, Esquire. of Surrey Place, Walworth. They
seldom fly low, and are consequently taken with some difficulty.

The larva is green, streaked with white and yellow, and feeds on the Pine.
Linnaeus and Fabricius add the Lime and Alder also.


PLATE CCCXXXVII. LIBELLULA VULGATA. COMMON DRAGON FLY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth armed with more than two jaws. Antennae shorter than
the thorax. Wings expanded without folds. Tail of the male furnished with
forceps.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings transparent. Abdomen cylindrical and
reddish.

LIBELLULA VULGATA: alis hyalinis, corpore cylindrico rufo. Linn. Syst. Not. 2.
901. 3. -- Fn. Sv. 1461. Roes. Ins. 2. Aquatic. 2. tab. 8.
This is the most abundant species of the Libellula tribe; frequenting ditches
and other watery places during summer. The colors in different specimens vary
exceedingly.

FIG. II. LIBELLULA GRANDIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings yellowish. Abdomen cylindrical, variegated, four
yellow lines on the thorax.

Libellula fulva alis flavescentibus, thoracis lateribus lineis duabus flavis,
front flavescente cauda diphylla. Geoff. Ins. 2. 227. 12. LIBELLULA GRANDIS:
alis glaucescentibus thoracis lateribus lineis quatuor flavis. Linn. Syst. Not.
2. 903. 9. -- Fn. Sv. 1467. Libellula fusca capite rotundato, thorace lineolis
quatuor transversis luteis, alis flavicantibus, abdomine cylindrico. Degeer.
Ins. 2. 2. 45. tab. 20. fig. 6.
When the fine species of Libellula grandis was figured in plate 166 of this
work, we were not in possession of the variety with yellow wings which Linnaeus
describes. It has since been discovered in the neighborhood of Battersea, and
we deem it too interesting to be omitted.

The yellow color of the wings can by no means induce us to think it a
distinct species from the variety with wings perfectly transparent, especially
as the same variation is observed in most other species of the same tribe, and
particularly amongst the English species in flaveola virgo and puella. The
marks and colors of the abdomen and thorax are still more liable to variation,
and can scarcely furnish any precise character for a specific difference.


PLATE CCCXXXVIII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA CUCULLA. MAPLE PROMINENT MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by Night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Tongue spiral. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, margin
denticulated, yellow brown clouded with ferruginous and marked obliquely with
several interrupted parallel and interwoven waved streaks. A broad white band
next the exterior margin.

PHALAENA CUCULLA: spirilinguis, cristata alis deflexis denticulatis ochraceis
maculis ferrugineis, fasciaque marginali albida striis intertexta fuscis. Linn.
Syst. Not. 81.
This species is uncommonly rare, and has, we believe, not been figured by any
author, unless fig. 1. tab. 71. of Esper is intended for the same insect. -- It
feeds on the maple.

FIG. II. PHALAENA RUBAGO.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Anterior wings yellow: base, costal spot, and oblique
broad bar near the apex reddish, sprinkled with points of a darker color.

PHALAENA RUBAGO: alis anticis flavis; basi macula costali, fascia lata obliqua
punctisque ferrugineis.
A new and undescribed British species. Once found in the wood at Hornsey.

FIG. III. PHALAENA PAR. KITTEN-LIKENESS MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Anterior wings greyish white, with a broad clouded bar
across the middle. Posterior wings darkest near the exterior margin.

PHALAENA PAR: alis anticis griseo-albidis: fascia lata nebulosa, posticis
extus fuscentibus. Marsh. Mss.
Sometimes found sticking against walls and trunks of trees, and is certainly
an hitherto undescribed species.


PLATE CCCXXXIX. PHALAENA SULPHURALIS.
MARGATE BEAUTY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First wings yellow, with irregular connected
streaks of black spots, and detached marks of the same color on the anterior
margin. Second pair brown.

Phalaena Sulphuralis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 881. 333. BOMBYX LUGUBRIS: alis
deflexis flavis: rivulis punctisque atris, posticis fuscis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T.
3. p. 1. p. 467. sp. 188. -- Schaeff. Icon. tab. 9. fig. 14. 15.
A scarce insect in this country. It is said to have been first discovered at
Margate, and from that circumstance was afterward known amongst English
collectors by the name of Margate beauty. -- Another insect, by no means
similar, has however received the same name, having been met with at Margate
likewise.

FIG. II. PHALAENA PURPURALIS. PURPLE AND GOLD MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Purple, with two irregular yellow bands
continued across both the upper and under wings.

PHALAENA PURPURALIS: alis purpurascentibus: omnibus fasciis duabus luteis.
Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 883. 342. -- Fn. Sv. 1356.
Found on nettles in May.


PLATE CCCXL.
FIG. I. PHALAENA LAPPAE. THE BURDOCK MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. First wings ferrugineous; a broad yellow clouded bar with
three yellow eye-shaped spots across the middle. A yellow spot at the base, and
another at the apex. Second wings pale, with an obscure transverse streak.

PHALAENA LAPPAE: alis ferrugineis: basi stigmatibus fascia maculaque apicis
flavis fusco-nebulosis, posticis pallidis striga obscura. Marsh. Mss.
It feeds on the Burdock.

FIG. II. PHALAENA CITRINA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Thorax crested. First wings yellowish, with two transverse
bands of brown; the interior one interrupted and enclosed between two irregular
whitish streaks.

PHALAENA CITRINA alis flavescentibus, lineis duabus irregularibus transversis
albidis, fasciis duabus fuscis, interiore interrupta.
Ernst, in the Papillons de l'Europe, fig. 378. gives the figure of a Phalaena
not very dissimilar to our species, and probably a mere variety of it. Under
this idea we have named it Citrina, from the French name La Citrinne, adopted
by Ernst, for it does not appear to have been either figured or described by
any other author.

This choice and beautiful Insect is one of those discovered by the late
Duchess of Portland, and is in the Cabinet of Mr. Francillon.

FIG. III. PHALAENA CLAVIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. First wings reddish, with a paler dash along the middle,
ending near a kindney eye-shaped mark and a contiguous white spot. An
interrupted dark mark at the base.

PHALAENA CLAVIS: alis fusco cinereis linea media punctoque albis, lineola
interrupta baseos maculisque fuscis.
Several varieties of this Insect appear to have been figured in the work of
Ernst already quoted, but none of them agree so precisely with our specimen as
to permit us to refer to his plates. -- We believe it is not described by
Fabricius or any other systematic author.


PLATE CCCXLI. BLATTA GERMANICA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous. Head inflected. Thorax flat, orbicular,
and margined. Abdomen terminated in two appendices. Feet made for running.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. First wings incumbent,
liver-colour, with obscure spots. Second wings yellow, with a brown lunar mark
in the middle, and a band of the same color near the posterior margin.

PHALAENA ORBONA: cristata alis incumbentibus hepaticis: posticis flavis;
lunula strigaque postica fuscis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 57. sp. 158.
This species is far less frequent than the Phalaena Pronuba, to which, at
first glance, it bears some resemblance. Fabricius describes it as a native of
Germany, and it does not occur in the Works of any Author as a British Insect.

FIG. III. PHALAENA ARBUTI.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, brown; posterior pair
black, with a yellow band across the middle.

PHALAENA ARBUTI: cristata alis deflexis fuscis: posticis nigris flava. Fab.
Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 126. sp. 380.
Described by Fabricius in his last Work as an English Insect, from which we
may infer, that it is not common in other parts of Europe.


PLATE CCCXLIV. JULUS COMPLANATUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Feet numerous. Twice as many on each side as the segments
of the body. Antennae moniliform. Palpi two, articulated, body semicylindrical.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae clavated. Body flat. Tail acute.

JULUS COMPLANATUS: pedibus utrinque 30, corpore planiusculo, antennis
clavatis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 1065. 4. -- Fn. Sv. 2068. JULUS COMPLANATUS:
pedibus utrinque 30, corpore planiusculo, cauda acuta. Fab. Ent. Syst. 2. p.
393.
Fabricius as well as Linnaeus considers the number of feet as an essential
part of the specific character throughout this genus. Both are certainly
mistaken in assigning thirty feet to each side of this creature. Degeer
mentions thirty-one; and in an unmutilated specimen we have, two legs may be
perceived at every joint except those nearest the head. The body is flat, the
shields slightly scabrous, and the antennae clavated, the last we deem more
characteristic than the number of the feet.

This very curious creature is local, being rare in most places.


PLATE CCCXLV.
FIG. I. PHALAENA GRANDIS. GRAY ARCHES MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings whitish, variegated with black, and waved or arched
transverse streaks. A large eye-shaped spot in the middle, and a black
character in the posterior angle.

PHALAENA GRANDIS: alis albicantibus nigro-varie undatis: stigmatibus magnis
subocellaribus, litura prope anglum posticum nigrum.
An Insect well known amongst English collectors by the name of Gray Arches
Moth, from the characteristic arched double lines across the superior wings. It
is altogether unnoticed by Linnaeus a Fabricius, though figured by Sepp. vol.
ii. tab. 27. It is esteemed a scarce species in this country.

FIG. II. III. PHALAENA SPINULA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings variegated brown and gray, with obscure transverse
bars. Three distinct black pointed characters near the apex.

PHALAENA SPINULA: alis fusco cinereis maculis strigisque obscuris lituris
tribus acutiusculis distinctis nigris ad apicem.
The specimens, fig. 2 and 3. appear at the first view two very distinct
Insects; yet on the most attentive comparison of the characteristic marks, we
are inclined to consider them as the two sexes of the same species,
notwithstanding the dissimilarity of their colors in general. The kind
represented at fig. 2, and which from its setaceous antennae is evidently the
female, has been placed in English cabinets as a species somewhat analogous to
the Phalaena Exoleta, or Sword-blade Moth, under the trivial appellation of the
scarce Sword-blade Moth. The other, which from the pectinated structure of its
antennae, is obviously the male, is equally uncommon.

We have observed several figures of this species different only in color in
the works of Ernst, and one in particular nearly corresponding with that
represented in the annexed plate at fig. 2, which he calls spinula; a name we
have ventured to adopt, as the Insect is neither described by Linnaeus nor
Fabricius.

apice punctorum trigonum serie unica. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 103. sp.
306. PHALAENA runica Linn.
Linnaeus has made some confusion between the two species of Phalaena Aprilina
and runica in several of his works. In the last edition by Gmelin, our Insect
stands as the P. runica; and in the Entomologia Systematica of Fabricius, which
we have in this instance preferred, it is the Phalaena Aprilina.

The English Entomologist is indebted to the assiduity of the late Duchess of
Portland for the discovery of this extremely rare species in England. It feeds
on the Oak.

fasciis duabus strigosis maculisque duabus niveis intermediis. Beckwith's paper
trans. Linn. Soc. Vol. 2. p. 4.
The larva is of a pale yellow with a red head. It feeds on the Poplar, and
about the beginning of October encloses itself between two leaves, which it
unites at the edges by means of many strong threads, and becomes a pupa. The
Moth bursts forth about the end of May or beginning of June.

The larva conceals itself in a kind of cylinder, which it forms by rolling up
the edges of the nettle leaves on which it feeds. It is whitish, with a dark
dorsal line, head black, and two spots of the same color on the segment next
the head.

PHALAENA LYNCEATA: alis albis: fasciis duabus punctoque apicis fuscis. Fab.
spec. Ins. 2. p. 262. n. 129. Gmel. Linn. Syst. 2478.
This Insect, though very common in our woods, was unknown to Fabricius before
his visit to Great Britain; he first described it in the species Insectorum,
under the specific name of Lynceata, as an English Insect: it has since
appeared in his other publications, and has been inserted by Gmelin in the last
Edition of the Systema Naturae.

The Linnean description of P. ocellata coincides so nearly with this Insect,
that we may doubt the propriety of separating them: they are probably varieties
only of the same Species.

It is very common in June.

The two black semicircles on the thorax and double row of triangular spots at
the ends of the posterior wings, are mentioned as peculiar characters of this
species; the latter is, however, liable to considerable variations, the spots
being in general, crowded in a confused series, and forming an irregularly
interrupted line. It may be easily distinguished from the Phalaena Aprilina by
its superior size, the colors are less vivid, and it is destitute of the broad
transverse bar, which is conspicuous on the upper wings of Phalaena Aprilina.

The larva is smooth, of an ash color with square brownish spots. It feeds on
the Oak.

Fabricius, when in England, named this elegant little nondescript Francillana,
in compliment to Mr. Francillon, whose exquisite collection of Insects afforded
him such ample assistance in completing his species Insectorum and Entomologia
Systematica, and we are happy in the opportunity to perpetuate the name, as a
small acknowledgment for the confidential freedom with which its worthy

Linnaeus, and after him Fabricius, refers to the works of De Geer and Merian
for figures of this Insect, neither of which are in our opinion sufficient
authorities; that of De Geer is in particular miserable, and so far from
leading to ascertain the species, may mislead us as to the identity of its
genera. Some years since, this Insect was deemed a nondescript by English
collectors, and named in compliment to a much respected Aurelian Beckwithiana;
but agreeing in every respect with the Linnaean Cynosbana, we must unavoidably
reject that name, though generally adopted.

It is very common, and according to Linnaeus breeds in the buds of roses.

Syst. Not. 2. 885. 350. Fn. Sv. 1363. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. 289. 12.
Linnaeus considered the two species of Ermine Moths, Padella and Evonymella,
sufficiently characterised by the number of black spots on the superior wings.
To the first he assigns twenty, and to the latter fifty on each wing.

Those who have attended particularly to those species are aware, that the
number of spots are by no means constant, and may have frequently observed even
more spots on one wing than the other in the same individual, as occurs in the
specimen we have figured. This has occasioned some confusion between the two
species, and we expressed some doubts respecting them in the description of one
of the earliest plates in this work. Since that time we have had more
opportunities of ascertaining the two kinds, and have no hesitation in
admitting them as two species. Not that the variation in the number of spots
will allow us to admit the definition of Linnaeus unconditionally. It may be
said that those on the P. Padella are about twenty, and those on the P.
Evonymella sometimes amount to fifty or more, and the color of the superior
wings is lighter in the latter than the former.

In admitting this, the name Evonymella adopted in the ninth plate, must be
changed to Padella; and the Insect before us be considered as the true
Evonymella.

FIG. III. PHALAENA BIFASCIANA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Anterior wings testaceous, with two whitish bands, and
four distinct undulated streaks and spots of black.

PHALAENA BIFASCIANA: alis anticis testaceis, fasciis duabus albidis, strigis
quatuor undatis maculisque nigris.
A very uncommon Insect, and not noticed by any author.

FIG. IV. PHALAENA LEEANA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings pale, yellowish, with a brown spot in
the middle.

PHALAENA LEEANA: alis pallidis: macula centrali fusca. Gmel. Linn. Syst. Not.
p. 2497. Fab. Spec. Insect. 2. p. 276. n. 2.
Taken in June and July. Not uncommon.


PLATE CCCLVIII.
FIG. I. NECYDALIS HUMERALIS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous or filiform. Wing-cases less than the
wings, and either narrower or shorter than the abdomen. Tail simple.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wing-cases narrow, and tapering to a point,
black, yellow at the base.

NECYDALIS HUMERALIS: elytris nigris basi flavis. -- Fab. spec. Ins. 1. p. 263.
sp. 5. NECYDALIS HUMERALIS. -- Gmel. T. 1. p. 4. p. 1880. sp. 18. Necydalis
(muralis) elytris subulatis fusca, humeris flavis, pedibus simplicibus. --
Forced. nov. ins. sp. 1. p. 48. n. 48.
A scarce species, described by Fabricius and Gmelin as a native of this
country.

FIG. II. NECYDALIS SIMPLEX.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings testaceous. Legs simple.

NECYDALIS SIMPLEX: elytris testaceis, pedibus simplicibus. -- Fab. spec. Ins.
1. p. 264. sp. 9. Gmel. T. 1. p. 4. 1881. 10. Cantharis phthysica: Scop. Ent.
Carn. 144.
Suppposed by Gmelin to be a variety of Necydalis podagrariae.


PLATE CCCLIX. PHALAENA TRITOPHUS. ASPEN PROMINENT MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by Night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings deflexed, a prominent tuft or tooth on the posterior
margin, brown, clouded; in the middle, a white ring, enclosing a ferruginous
lunar mark.

PHALAENA TRITOPHUS: alis deflexis dorso dentatis fusco nebulosis: lunula media
ferruginea alba cincta. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1. p. 448. sp. 108.
The larva of this fine Insect is green, with a brown head, obtuse tail, and
three elevations or gibbosities on the back. It feeds on the Populo tremulo,
from whence we have deduced its English name of Aspen Prominent Moth.

Phalaena tritophus is extremely scarce in this country.


PLATE CCCLX.
FIG. I. PHALAENA ERICAE. TRANSVERSE-STREAK HEATH MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Anterior Wings brown, with two undulated streaks, and
spots of white. Posterior wings pale.

PHALAENAE ERICAE: alis anticis fuscis: strigis duabus undatis maculis
ordinariis lineolisque albis, posticis pallidis.
A non-descript species of the noctua family, and very rare. Found on heaths.

FIG. II. PHALAENA LINEOLA. SHORT-LINE MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Anterior wings ferruginous gray, with undulated streaks. A
small oblique line in the middle, and a row of brown points along the exterior
margin.

PHALAENA LINEOLA: alis anticis griseo-ferrugineis: strigis undatis lineola
obliqua in medio punctisque postice fuscis.
More frequent than the preceding species, and seems to be figured in the works
of Ernst and Esper, but certainly not described by any systematic author.

The color varies in different specimens from ferruginous to greyish or livid
color.

FIG. III. PHALAENA MAPPA. MAP-WING SWIFT MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings brown, with large irregular waved marks of a livid
color, and four distinct white triangular spots near the apex.

PHALAENA MAPPA: alis fuscis: lituris magnis irregularibus lividis punctisque
quatuor postice albidis.
A Moth of the Hepialus, a new genus in the Fabrician System, including only
ten species, neither of which agrees with our Insect, and we apprehend it is
not described by any other Author.

In the Linnaean System, this can only be regarded as a family of the Phalaena
tribe. The English collectors have denominated this family Swifts, as noticed
already in the descriptions of Humuli and Hecta, (plate 274. fig. 1, 2, 3.) --
The present Insect may be considered as one of the rarest English undescribed
species, and the many windings of the numerous marks on the anterior wings,
immediately suggest the appropriate specific name of Mappa.
