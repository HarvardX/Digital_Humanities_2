ACT I.
SONG.
MUSIC BY SARTI.
NAINDA. AVAUNT, ye Storms! nor check the aerial Car,
In other Climes your forky Lightning bear;
In other Regions vent your Clamours loud,
Nor rend the fleecy mantle of this Cloud.
Free from Strife, from Anger free;
Calm and Concord dwell with me:
Hence, for ever! dark-brow'd Storm;
Nor Heaven's azure Sky deform.
Blue-ey'd Zephyrs, in thy place,
Breathing soft through airy space,
Hail me, as I peaceful rise,
The Halcyon Genius of those happy Skies.

SONG
MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE.
ISKOURIAH. HIS Limbs may shame the Arcadian bounding Roe;
His Skin, the famed Olympus purest Snow;
His Hair outshines the Raven's jetty Plume;
His Lips of Roses breath out their Perfume:
And if, by Dreams, his Senses are possessed,
They sure are those of Angels when at rest!
Smiling, he sleeps; -- around his features hang
That Joy expressed when HAFIS youthful sang;
Each Dimple, in his Peach-down Cheek, a Cell,
In which Love, Innocence, and Graces dwell.

DUET.
MUSIC BY GUGLIELMI.
NAINDA. AWAY, and bring that vermil' Cheek; --
Those winning Looks that softly speak,
That melt a spotless Virgin's heart:
Those Graces bring with master art!
Those Graces, that -- by Angels wove --
Entwine two Souls in constant Love!

ISKOURIAH. AWAY I fly, and softly bear
My precious Charge through Realms of Air;
A Charge shall win thy Virgin heart;
My Task, I Will do with Master Art.
Those Graces shall, by Angels wove,
Entwine two Souls in constant Love.

BOTH TOGETHER. Those Graces, etc. etc. etc.


SONG.
MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE.
ACBA. I HAVE read of Love, and all his Tricks;
That he does Gall with Honey mix:
But I Am a Bust with Heart of Steel,
That can nor Pain nor Pleasure feel:
And let me still unmoved remain;
He wants no Joy, that feels no Pain!
O No! O No! O No!
He wants no Joy, who feels no Pain.
I AM blind alike to Smile or Tear;
I eat, I drink, I see and hear
The merry Songsters on the Spray,
While lovesick Boys pine out each day.
O let me still unmoved remain;
He wants no Joy, that feels no Pain.
O No! O No! O No!
He wants no Joy, who feels no Pain.
My undisturbed repose I take,
While Cupid keeps all Men awake;
While he with Sighs annoys each Breast.
I sing, and nightly take my rest.
So let me still unmoved remain;
He wants no Joy, that feels no Pain!
O No! O No! O No!
He wants no Joy, who feels no Pain.

SONG
NAINDA. THE Morning Star, ah! see
How soft how mild her light:
She leads ISKOURIAH on her way,
Expelling sable Night!

DUET and CHORUS.
MUSIC BY SAPIO.
OH ALLAH! rive us means to bear
Her mind from Love's corroding Care!
Give Peace within this Virgin Breast,
Where naught but Peace and Joy should rest.
Nor let her Thoughts, like Tempests, move
In wildest Labyrinths of Love.
OH ALLAH! give us means to bear
Her mind from Love's corroding Care.
END OF THE FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SONG MUSIC, FRENCH ROMANCE.
MORAD. ON the high Top of an old mouldering Tower,
An angry Eagle perched his favorite Son;
Then frowning said -- "There pass each lonesome hour,
"Nor, till I give you leave, can you come down.
DUET. "Can you come down,
" Can you come down."
The youthful Eaglet loved in woods to play
With Birds of Feathers bright, or softest Down;
So much abashed, he to himself did say --
"Unhappy Royal Bird, you must come down.
"You must come down,
"You must come down.
"Your own determined Will must set you free;
"Inactive, here you cannot fit and moan;
"Courage secures to Man his Liberty,
"And Youth, courageous Youth, may venture down.
"May venture down,
"May venture down."
Then opening quick the rusty shutter wide,
He hailed the friendly Luster of the Moon:
With royal Fortitude and manly Pride,
For love of Freedom, soon he ventures down.
He ventures down,
He ventures down.

SONG
MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE.
OLD WOMAN. I Will tell you your Fortune, averse from all Art,
Plain Truth ever flows from my Tongue;
Yet I carry, like Bees, the kind Honey at Heart,
To heal where my words may have stung.
My Power's unbounded, whatever I may seem,
My Dwelling is in the Blue Sky;
Though often on the back of a tranquil Moon-beam,
On Earth for Diversion I fly.
Let other good Fairies use Circles and Wands,
A future Event to foretell;
Trace Lines in the Palm of a True-Lovers Hand;
Exhaust all the Power of Spell:
It Is alone through the Eyes I descry Fortune's Light,
See only to rectify Fate;
Like the Sun, I dispel the black Vapors of Night,
Then listen before it is too late.

TRIO.
MUSIC BY PAESIELLO.
BOTH. Oh! give us leave to go with you;
It is our Wish, and Duty too.

OLD WOMAN. No, no! No, no! it cannot be;
He is secure, who flies with me.

GIOBAR. With you, Ha, ha, ha! he go with you!


MORAD. Oh, oh! Oh, oh! -- This is quite new.


OLD WOMAN. It may be strange, it may be new,
But still, believe me, it is true,
That what my Will is, that must be;
And he is secure, that flies with me.

SONG
MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE.
ZARA. WHEN I am married, Mercies! how I 'll talk.
And rule at home like any potent Queen.
Fair creatures like myself should never walk;
I Will have a gold and silver Palanquin,
The Men shall all adore my angel's face;
The Women fall before me as I pass:
I Will ogle and sigh, I Will smoke, and I Will spit;
Tell many a lie, now and then have a fit;
And study my charms in the glass.
I Will have a thousand fancies in the day;
And change 'em every hour with the wind.
I Will never work at all, but always play,
To chase dull care and sorrow from my mind.
The Men shall all, etc. etc.

SONG.
MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE.
MORAD. SHE is ugly and old,
And looks like a Scold;
Her Nose like a spout to her Head:
Her Robe ragged and black;
Not a Shift to her back;
And must beg all the way, to have Bread.
Well, if I go astray;
Or, like him, run away;
It shall be with a Girl like a Roe;
With a Cheek like a Rose,
A small cock'd-up Nose,
With Arms, and a Bosom, of Snow,

SONG.
MUSIC BY SAPIO.
BY A YOUNG TURK. O Fairest of the Fair! whose spotless Charms
Must bless a lovely Prince's youthful Arms,
Receive these Gems; that will but dim appear,
When Eyes so bright -- ILLYDIA's Eyes are near.

SONG.
MUSIC BY SAPIO.
ISKOURIAH. THE Ship-wreck'd Sailor, cast from off the Strand,
Labors for Life, and thinks it almost gone:
More welcome, to his Sight, appears the Land --
More cheering, than the brightest Morning Sun:
But oh! to me, who can no lower fall,
REVENGE is sweeter far -- Revenge is all!
Revenge! Revenge!
Revenge is ALL!

AIR
MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE.
I.
ANGELS and GENII point the way secure
To Honor, Fame, to Friendship and to Love;
Like Stars, their Course is heavenly, bright, and pure;
For, by Omniscient Power alone, they move.
CHORUS.
Oh drive from hence Remorse and fell Despair;
Be Love and Constancy your only Care.
II.
TO improve, to save Mankind, our only toil:
Ours be the Task to pity and reclaim!
Our only recompense a heavenly smile, --
Disdaining earthly Tributes to our Fame.
CHORUS.
Oh drive from hence Remorse and fell Despair;
Be Love and Constancy your only Care!
THE END.
