To the Ingenious Mr. MOORE, Author of the Celebrated WORM-POWDER.
By Mr. POPE.
HOW much, Egregious MOORE, are we
Deceived by Shows, and Forms?
Whatever we think, whatever we see,
All Human Race are Worms.
Man, is a very Worm by Birth,
Proud Reptile, vile and vain,
Awhile he crawls upon the Earth,
Then shrinks to Earth again.
That Woman is a Worm we find,
Ever since our Gran'am's Evil:
She first conversed with her own kind,
That Ancient Worm, the Devil.
But whether Man, or He, God knows,
Foecundified her Belly,
With that pure Stuff from whence we rose,
The Genial Vermicelli.
The Learned themselves, we Book-Worms name;
The Blockhead, is a Slow-Worm;
The Nymph, whose Tail is all on Flame,
Is aptly termed a Glowworm.
The Fops are painted Butter-Flies,
That flutter for a Day;
First from a Worm they took their Rise,
Then in a Worm decay.
The Flatterer an Ear-wig grows.
Some Worms suit all Conditions;
Misers are Muck-Worms, Silkworms Beaus,
And Death-Watches Physicians.
That Statesmen have a Worm is seen
By all their winding Play:
Their Conscience is a Worm within,
That gnaws them Night and Day.
Ah! MOORE! thy Skill were well Employed,
And greater Gain would rise,
If thou could make the Courtier void
The Worm that never Dies.
O Learned Friend of Abchurch-Lane,
Who sett'st our Entrails free,
Vain is thy Art, thy Powder Vain,
Since Worms shall Eat even Thee.
Thou only can our Fates adjourn,
Some few short Years, no more;
Even BUTTON's Wits to Worms shall turn,
Who Maggots were before.
FINIS.
