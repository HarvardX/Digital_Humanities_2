ODE TO DRAGON, Mr. GARRICK's House-dog, AT HAMPTON.
I.
DRAGON! since lyrics are the mode,
To thee I dedicate my Ode,
And reason good I plead:
Are those who cannot write, to blame
To dedicate their hopes of fame,
To those who cannot read?
II.
O could I, like that nameless wight See the admirable Epistle to Sir WILLIAM
CHAMBERS.
,
Find the choice minute when to write,
The mollia tempora fandi!
Like his, my muse should learn to whistle
A true Heroical Epistle,
In strains which never can die.
III.
Father of lyrics, tuneful HORACE!
Can thy great shade do nothing for us
To mend the British lyre?
One luckless bard has broke the strings,
Seized the scared muses, plucked their wings,
And put out all their fire.
IV.
DRAGON, thou tyrant of the yard,
Great namesake of that furious guard
That watched the fruits Hesperian!
Thy choicer treasures safely keep,
Nor snatch one moment's guilty sleep,
Fidelity's criterion.
V.
O DRAGON! change with me thy fate,
To me give up thy place and state,
And I will give thee mine:
I, left to think, and thou to feed!
My mind enlarged, thy body freed,
How blessed my lot and thine!
VI.
Then shall thou scent the rich regale
Of Turtle and diluting Ale
Nay, share the sav'ry bit;
And see, what thou have never seen,
For thou have but at HAMPTON been,
A feast devoid of wit.
VII.
Often shall thou snuff the smoking venison,
Devoured, alone, by gorging denizen,
So fresh, thou wilt long to tear it;
Though FLACCUS Rancidum aprum antiqui laudabant: non quia nasus Illis nullus
erat, sed, credo, hac mente, quod hospes Tardius adveniens, vitiatum commodius,
quam Integrum edax dominus consumeret. Hos utinam inter Heroas natum tellus me
prima tulisset. HOR. lib. ii. sat. 2.
tells a different tale
Of social souls who chose it stale,
Because their friends should share it.
VIII.
And then on me what joys would wait,
Were I the guardian of thy gate,
How useless bolt and latch!
How vain were locks, and bars how vain,
To shield from harm the household train
Whom I, from love, would watch!
IX.
Not that 'twou'd crown with joy my life,
That BOWDEN, or that BOWDEN's wife,
Brought me my daily pickings:
Though she suspends the scales of Fate,
And deals the scanty mortal date
To turkeys and to chickens!
X.
Though fired with innocent ambition
BOWDEN Mr. GARRICK's gardener.
, great Nature's rhetorician,
More flowers than BURKE produces;
And though he is skilled more roots to find,
Than ever filled an Hebrew's mind,
And better knows their uses,
XI.
I Would get my master's ways by rote,
Never would I bark at ragged coat,
Nor tear the tattered sinner;
Like him, I Would love the Dog of merit,
Caress the cur of broken spirit,
And give them all a dinner.
XII.
I Would copy too his blue-ey'd Wife,
A very Pallas on my life,
Yet I Have a doubt just started --
For what should Pallas have to do
With Venus, and her Cestus too?
Indeed they should be parted.
XIII.
Whenever I heard the ratt'ling coach
Proclaim their long-desir'd approach,
How would I haste to greet 'em!
Nor ever feel I wore a chain,
Till, starting, I perceived with pain,
I could not fly to meet 'em.
XIV.
The master loves his sylvan shades,
Here, with the nine melodious maids,
His choicest hours are spent:
Yet I shall hear some witling cry,
(Such witling from my presence fly!)
"GARRICK will soon repent:
XV.
"Again you will see him, never fear;
"Some half a dozen times a year
"He still will charm the age;
"Accustomed long to be admired,
"Of shades and streams he will soon be tired,
"And languish for the stage."
XVI.
Peace! -- To his solitude he bears
The full-blown same of thirty years;
He bears a nation's praise:
He bears his liberal, polished mind,
His worth, his wit, his sense refined;
He bears his grove of Bays.
XVII.
When others drop the heartfelt tear,
Because this Sun has left his sphere,
And set at highest noon;
I Will drop a tear as warm, as true,
I loved his beams as well as you,
And mourn they are set so soon.
XVIII.
But all in vain his orb he quits,
Still there, in Memory's eye, he sits,
And will, till Time be done:
For he shall shine while Taste survives,
And he shall shine while Genius lives,
A never-setting Sun.
THE END.
