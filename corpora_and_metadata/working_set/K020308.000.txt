IL ne faut pourtant pas croire que les Grecs manquent de Feu. Tout s'anime au
contraire, tout parle, tout agit dans leurs Ecrits. Mais c'est plus l'Action
and le Spectacle que les Paroles, and plus la Passion and le Sentiment que le
Discourse; au lieu que les Francois ont souvent done dans le Discourse and les
Paroles pour suppleer au Spectacle ou a la Passion. Combien de Portraits, de
Sentences, and de Lieux communs bien frappes, ont arrache des Applaudissemens
qui devoient etre reserves a l'emotion Theatrale qu'on ne sentoit pas? ce n'est
que le sang froid qui applaudit a la Beauty des Verse dans un Spectacle.

BRUMOY, Theat. des Grecs.

TO HIS GRACE The Duke of DEVONSHIRE, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
My LORD,
IT was the frequent Practice of the ancient Greek Tragedians, to make their
Compositions for the Theater subservient to the Welfare of the State. The
Legislator's Wisdom was enforced by the Poet's Art. Public Guilt was
stigmatized, and public Virtue applauded. Of this Kind somewhat is, or ought to
be, shadowed out in the following Tragedy.

But it may possibly be asked, "Why this Address from a Writer who is, and
determines to remain, unknown?"

My LORD, it comes from one, who, although he has not wanted Opportunities, has
ever scorned to prostitute Addresses of this Kind to Views of Interest. But if
it has for once happened in his Time, that Virtue and Power are eminently
united; his honest Disdain of offering Incense to the one, shall not intimidate
him from avowing his Reverence of the other.

More especially, the natural Relation which the Design of this Tragedy bears
to your Grace's Conduct, gives its Author a kind of equitable Title, without
Leave, to prefix your Name. Thus, while he delineates Rebellion, he contrasts
it with true Loyalty: And to an Example of Sedition drawn from ancient Days,
opposes a Character from modern Life, who in the highest Station, and most
perilous Times, has been the Restorer of Unity and Concord.

I am, My LORD, with the highest Esteem, your GRACE's most obedient Servant,
The AUTHOR.

PROLOGUE;
Written by the AUTHOR of the TRAGEDY.
Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND in the Character, of the Genius of Britain. TO warn the
Sons of Freedom to be wise,
Lo, Britain's guardian Genius quits the Skies,
With Pity, Heaven has seen through many an Age,
The bold Invader lured by Faction's Rage;
Seen the dark Workings of Rebellion's Train,
While Patriots planned, and Heroes bled in vain.
Behold, your Country's faithless Foe, once more
With threatening Squadrons crowd yon hostile Shore.
Behold Oppression's bloody Flag unfurled:
See Bolts prepared, to chain the Western World.
Rise, Britons, rise! to Heaven and Virtue true:
Expiring Liberty looks up to You!
Pour on the common Foe your Rage combined,
And be the Friends of Freedom and Mankind!
No more let Discord Britain's Peace destroy;
Nor spurn those Blessings, Reason bids enjoy:
Oh, weigh those Blessings in her equal Scale! --
Say; -- When did Justice wear a whiter Veil?
When did Religion gentler Looks disclose,
To bless her Friends, and pity even her Foes?
A richer Harvest when did Commerce reap?
When rode your Flects more dreadful over the Deep?
Or when more bright (hear, Envy! hear, and own!)
Did Truth, did Honor beam from Britain's Throne?
Seize then the Happiness denied your Foes:
Nor blindly scorn the Gifts which Heaven bestows:
Gifts, the World's Envy! happy Britain's Pride!
For which, your generous Fathers toiled and died!
Let Union lift the Sword, direct the Blow,
And hurl a Nation's Vengeance on its Foe!
As your bold Cliffs, when Tides and Tempests roar,
Fling back the mad'ning Billows from the Shore.
One Head, one Heart, one Arm, one People, rise!
Nor fall, divided Valor's Sacrifice! --
But if, by Hope of proud Invasion led,
Unawed Rebellion lift her gory Head; --
Treason, attend! -- here view the Rebel's Fate;
Nor hope, thy Arm can shake a freeborn State:
See Blood and Horror end what Guilt began;
And tremble at thy Woes, in Athelstan.

SCENE, the Danish Camp near London. Time, from the Evening, till Midnight.

ATHELSTAN.
ACT 1.
SCENE 1.
The open Camp. HAROLD. GOTHMUND a Warrior? By our Gods of Denmark,
I could have sacked ten Cities since the Morn.
The lingering Sun goes down, and yet beholds
The Danish Sword hang pow'rless over the Foe.
To him, DUNELM. DUNELM, well met. -- What means this vile Delay?
What have thou seen?

DUNELM. From yonder Eminence,
Even now, I saw proud London wrapped in Fire.
HAROLD, behold yon dusky Wreaths of Smoke:
Yon pitchy Cloud is fraught with glorious Ruin.

HAROLD. Indeed!

DUNELM. I saw the Flames besiege the Tower
Which proudly had scorned the general Assault
Of Denmark's Power. Soon spread the sulphur'd Fires,
Mining it is Base: at length, with horrid Crash,
The Pile fell headlong, like a Wreck of Nature.
And as it fell, a hollow Murmur pierced
Mine Ear, that seemed an Army's dying Groan.
I saw the Breach in the proud City's Wall,
Where our brave Danes poured in, while Shouts of Conquest
Dismayed the flying Rear. HAROLD, ere this,
The City's won.

HAROLD. No more -- I Am sorry for it.

DUNELM. What! when our Troops through ten long Moons have toiled,
Till Siege and fell Disease have thin'd our Ranks,
Before this Capital, this haughty London,
The Mistress of the Island. When her Towers
Are humbled in the Dust! even then to wear
That clouded Eye! Much it might suit a Briton;
But ill becomes a Dane.

HAROLD. Have I not Cause
To hate our General?

DUNELM. Grant it: yet no Cause
To hate the Victories his Sword has gained
For Denmark's Weal.

HAROLD. Dishonor blast his Laurels!
Ere since I won full Glory from our Wars,
He checks my Valor, lest it should o'ertop,
And shadow his -- Behold, this very Day,
When mighty London falls a Prey to Denmark,
I Am pent within the Circuit of a Camp,
On an obscure and ignominious Charge.
My Sword, inglorious, sleeps within its Scabbard,
Deprived its Prey. Yes: well he knew, this Arm
Had led the Storm: as erst it did, to him
And his Compeers; when Norway's frozen Cities
Sunk at my Frown; when through conflicting Hosts
I opened the dreadful Track; while far behind
He loyter'd in the Breach, and poorly reaped
The Gleanings of my Faulcion.

DUNELM. Peace, brave HAROLD.
Nor let Dissension blot the general Triumph.

HAROLD. Here, DUNELM, here shall deep Revenge lie pent,
Must'ring it is Rage: but soon the impatient Flood
Shall burst the Mound, and overwhelm his Pride.
Yes: may I never more win the Wreath of Conquest;
Never fall triumphant in the Field of Fame;
But groan out Life, stretched on the unmanly Couch;
If I repay not GOTHMUND's uncaus'd Hate,
With deadliest Vengeance!

DUNELM. Let thy Vengeance wait
Some darker Hour. -- Behold, where GOODWIN comes.
His Eye speaks Victory: and his glad Step
Prevents the welcome Tidings of his Tongue.

SCENE II.
To them GOODWIN. GOODWIN. Hail, valiant HAROLD! This great Day shall shine
In Denmark's Annals. GOTHMUND sends thee greeting;
With the glad News of England's Overthrow.
Himself shall soon arrive.

HAROLD. Brave GOODWIN, welcome:
More welcome for thy Tidings. London then,
England's chief Boast, is fallen. --

GOODWIN. Even now it burns.
See yon ascending Clouds. Yon pillar'd Smoke,
That hides the Welkin, is it is last Remain.
The English Powers have left the bleeding Ramparts;
The wide Breach choked with Heaps of Slain, on which
We mounted to the Storm.

HAROLD. How went the Day?
Where fought our General GOTHMUND?

GOODWIN. On the Thames.
Soon as the Signal of Assault was given,
The Danish Fleet came on. Our Standard then,
The Raven, hovering on his Wing, appeared
With ominous Glare; and seemed to croak Destruction.
Then furious GOTHMUND, from the crowded Decks
Followed by shouting Thousands, leapt to Shore
With ruinous Assault:

HAROLD. What? no Resistance?

GOODWIN. Yes; bloody was the Fray: The Scale of War
Hung doubtful; till the mighty ATHELSTAN,
Mercia's brave Duke, to Denmark's aid came on;
Spurred by a keen Revenge more strong than Glory,
Led his revolted Mercians up the Breach,
And mingled in the Storm.

HAROLD. What next ensued?

GOODWIN. Confusion and wild Rout. For England's Power,
Dreading the vengeful Sword of ATHELSTAN,
Shrunk from his Rage: then Denmark's Star prevailed:
The Britons fled: and now, by Right of War,
The City's Wealth, it is captive Youth and Virgins,
Are fallen the Soldiers Plunder.

HAROLD. It seems then, GOTHMUND owes full half his Conquest
To ATHELSTAN's Revenge.

GOODWIN. Aye, more than half.
Never did such deadly Valor sweep the Field:
His hoary Head clasped in a steel rib'd Helm,
He sprung to Vengeance, and forgot old Age.
With such a headlong Course he led the War,
That Denmark's Troops, nay his own firey Mercians
Lingered behind: while he, attended only
By Death and Fate, which at his right Hand raged,
Thin'd the retreating Foe.

HAROLD. Thank we the Gods,
Who sow Dissension in these British Hearts!
Else, never had this fair City fallen our Prey!

DUNELM. Know ye the Cause why this proud Duke of Mercia
Revolted from his King?

GOODWIN. Pride and Revenge.
Some suit denied him, which the royal Bounty,
Unequal to the Cravings of it is People,
Granted his Foe. No more. His firey Spirit
Mounted to sudden Rage: with secret Levy
He mustered all his Powers, and joined with Denmark
To overwhelm his Country.

HAROLD. Be it ours,
To nurse this useful Treason: Thus invading,
While we divide, we conquer.

DUNELM. Hark! I hear
The Shouts of Victory.

GOODWIN. GOTHMUND approaches.
His Troops come laden with the precious Spoil
Of this imperial City. Captive Maids,
The sweet Reward of Valor, grace his Triumph:
And Infants, doomed to drink the bitter Draught
Of endless Slavery in a foreign Clime.

SCENE III.
To them, GOTHMUND in Triumph. A Train of Prisoners. And EGBERT in Chains, as a
Prisoner. HAROLD. Hail, valiant GOTHMUND! Denmark's proudest Boast!
Whom mighty ODIN, the dread God of War,
Has crowned with England's Conquest!

GOTHMUND. Faithful HAROLD,
The City's won. London, whose haughty Towers
We shook so long with terrible Assault,
At length is fallen, and blazes to the Sky.
'Twas Pity, HAROLD, on so great a Day,
When the rich Plunder of the War was seized,
Thy Valor lost it is Prey. But fair Division
Of our acquired Spoil, of Wealth and Captives,
Shall bring thee Recompense.

HAROLD. I thank thee, General.
Devoted to thy Will, I held my Charge,
To guard our Camp from the out-sallying Foe:
A Charge less splendid than the Post in Battle;
Yet, as conducing to the general Weal,
No whit less honorable.

GOTHMUND. HAROLD, behold
This Train of Captives: to thy Charge I give them:
But chiefly that stern Youth, whose Arm opposed
Singly to mine, long held the Conflict doubtful.
No common Ransom shall redeem him hence.
Why do thou frown?
[to EGBERT.
EGBERT. Because I dare to scorn
My Country's Foe.

GOTHMUND. So haughty in thy Chains?
What Title bear thou?

EGBERT. It Is enough for thee,
To know me still a Briton: thence to fear me.

GOTHMUND. A Conqu'ror fear his Captive! By our Gods,
Speak but another Word, audacious Christian,
I Will plunge thee in the deep Norwegian Mine,
Among these Slaves the Vassals of my Sword,
To toil in Darkness through the live-long Year,
Till baleful Damps consume thee.

EGBERT. Yes: bury me in Darkness; in the Depth,
Where Slavery drinks the pestilential Vapor;
For that I Have lived to see my Country's Fall!
I dare thee to the Deed, rapacious Dane!
But well I know, thy Hand expects the Ransom;
Nor aught but Avarice chains thy Cruelty.

GOTHMUND. What? Shall I waste the Hours in fruitless Parle
With an audacious Slave! -- Lo, Mercia's Duke
Comes with his warlike Train. Retire, ye Slaves;
And at an awful Distance bow to Valor. --
[They retire backwards. This firey ATHELSTAN! Yes, I could curse
[Aside. His Sword victorious, and wide wasting Arm
That blasted all my Wreaths; and won the Praise
Of this eventful Day! -- Hence envious Fame
Shall tarnish GOTHMUND's Glory; while she whispers,
Or^haply to the listening World proclaims,
That Britain conquered Britain. -- Come; fell Hate!
Pour all thy Poison on my Heart; and turn
Friendship to Enmity! -- Should he revolt? --
The Rebel dare not: Nor can ever repass
The Gulf which he has leapt; and severs him
For ever from his Country. -- Yet it is meet
That Prudence greet him with fair Speech, and Smiles;
Till some desired Occasion yield Pretense,
And spurn him off, to Shame. --
Let Denmark's Raven wave his dreadful Wing,
[Aloud. To hail the glad Approach of ATHELSTAN:
And sound, in Honor of our firm Ally,
The Instruments of War.

SCENE IV.
To them, ATHELSTAN; with his Train. GOTHMUND. I greet thee, ATHELSTAN. Thy
mighty Arm,
On this great Day, has shamed it is former Doings.
Through the red Tracks of Death I saw thee seek
The King. His Troops, stricken with coward Guilt,
Fled trembling at the Sight of injured Valor
Waked into Wrath. Yes, wondering Denmark saw,
How Terror stalked before thee through the Streets,
While thy broad Faulcion flamed; and dread Revenge
Frowned on thy Helm like Fate.

ATHELSTAN. No Flattery, GOTHMUND.
Balm to the Fool's, it wounds the brave Man's Ear.
My Sword has reaped sull Vengeance on its Foes;
And vanquished ETHELRED with Tears and Groans
Shall rue the Wrongs he did me.

GOTHMUND. Valiant Duke,
Such Vengeance well became such Wrongs as thine.

ATHELSTAN. My Wrongs were loud for Vengeance. Pity wept:
But Reason choked her Voice: -- For awful Justice
Must drop her Sword, unnerve her lifted Arm,
Unbridled Power turn Order into Chaos,
Should Pity melt at proud Oppression's Fall. --
What Youth is that, who from the captive Throng
Comes forth with haughty Strides?

GOTHMUND. An unknown Briton:
Yet fierce in Battle; for his Sword was fatal
To many a Dane; and midst the falling Ranks
Raged like a Whirlwind. Mark his fearless Mien.
He wears the Pride of Conquest, though in Chains.
His Eye devours thee, ATHELSTAN. --

ATHELSTAN. I reck not.
Let him come on: I Will meet his Pride unmoved.
[EGBERT advancing. Who dares to frown on ATHELSTAN?

EGBERT. A Briton.

ATHELSTAN. Who art thou?

EGBERT. One, who heedless of thy Rage,
Dares throw his Scorn on Guilt.

ATHELSTAN. Audacious Captive!
Think thou I fear thy frown?

EGBERT. Oh, bleeding England!
Behold thy fatal Foe!
[He bursts into Tears.
ATHELSTAN. Weep'st thou, brave Youth?
Though I have poured Destruction on thy King,
I wage no War with Captives. Generous Warrior,
My Power shall shield thee, and unbind thy Chains.

EGBERT. Stand off. -- I choose to wear them.

ATHELSTAN. Why that Choice?

EGBERT. Lest these brave captive Britons, shackled there,
Should brand me for a Traitor.

ATHELSTAN. Heed thee well.
Think what thou art, and where. --

EGBERT. Thank Heaven,
I am not ATHELSTAN!

ATHELSTAN. Nay, I can frown too. --

EGBERT. Blush, -- rather blush! The crimson Hue of Shame
Would better suit thy Crimes!

GOTHMUND. Peace, arrogant Youth!

ATHELSTAN. Who gave to thee this Privilege of Scorn?
This Right of Insult and bold Accusation?

EGBERT. That Power who gave me Reason and Humanity:
That awful Power Above, who bids me dare
To strip false Treason of her Mask of Pride;
And show the Hag, in her own Shape and Hue,
The foulest Fiend of Hell.

ATHELSTAN. Thy Chains protect thee!

GOTHMUND. GOODWIN, lead forth these Captives to the Fleet;
And let the first fair Breeze that fills the Sail
Waft them to Denmark's Shore. -- HAROLD, bear hence,
And guard that Insolent.
[Pointing to EGBERT.
EGBERT. Farewell, brave Friends!
My faithful Countrymen! I weep your Fate,
Doomed to the Oppressions of a barbarous Clime!
Oh, may some friendly Storm in Pity rise,
And bid the Fury of devouring Seas
In Mercy swallow you! -- Accursed Treason!
Lo, thy devoted Train! Oh false, false ATHELSTAN!

[Ex. EGBERT, HAROLD, GOODWIN, DUNELM, and Captives. ATHELSTAN. Go, froward
Briton!

GOTHMUND. Valiant ATHELSTAN,
Heed not a Captive's Clamor. Denmark now
Boasts thee her Friend. And for undoubted Proof
Of that Esteem, wherewith I note thy Valor;
Behold the precious Spoils my Arm has won
Amid the general Plunder: Gold or Captives,
Lands, Palaces, whatever inventive Passion
Can fancy for Enjoyment, waits thy Will:
Command it; for it is thine.

ATHELSTAN. Of Gold, or Lands,
The Plunder of the War, I reck not aught.
For, to the noble Mind, a great Revenge
Outweighs all other Good. This I have reaped
Full-measur'd; Of my thankless Country's Blood
My Sword has drank, even to Satiety:
No other Boon it craves.

GOTHMUND. Brave ATHELSTAN,
Even as thou will. -- Has then no precious Spoil
Enriched thy Valor?

ATHELSTAN. Yes: one beauteous Captive,
Won in the City's Storm: and now consigned
To SIWARD's Care, a brave and faithful Friend,
Who leads her hitherward. So winning sweet!
The surly Troops gazed on her as she passed,
And Silence spoke their Wonder.

GOTHMUND. Such a Fair
May happily mourn in secret; that her Lot
Fell to thy aged Arm. Some youthful Warrior
Might better suit her Wish.

ATHELSTAN. I mean, to shield her
From the rude Will of insolent Desire.

GOTHMUND. Indeed!

ATHELSTAN. Indeed. -- It was her chaste Request.
And mark me: Though my Arm has quelled it is Foes,
Yet ATHELSTAN would blush, to wreak his Vengeance
On a defenseless Woman.

GOTHMUND. By what Chance
Did thou obtain this Captive?

ATHELSTAN. While the Storm
Raged in the Streets; Fate led my conquering Band,
Where this fair Captive mourned the Lot of War.
I found her kneeling; with uplifted Eyes,
And Majesty resigned, imploring Heaven.
Roused by the Shouts of War, she rose: Her Train
Filled all the Place with female Lamentation:
But she, in Grief superior, checked their Cries,
And graced her Woes with regal Dignity.
With such a noble Mien she su'd for Mercy,
That Vengeance stood subdued: while nameless Graces,
Beauty, and Mildness, and majestic Grief,
Like Guardian Powers which Heaven had planted round her,
Checked the rude Access of unhallowed Rage:
That even the Sons of Violence dropped the Sword,
To gaze at awful Distance. -- Towered her Tent,
This Way she moves with her attendant Train.
Behold her here.

SCENE V.
To them, THYRA, EDWINA, SIWARD, and female Attendants. GOTHMUND. Indeed,
supremely fair.

ATHELSTAN. THYRA, be comforted: Nay, dry these Tears.
Else shall I deem my too officious Cares
Lost on a thankless Heart.

THYRA. Oh, ATHELSTAN!
Whose Mercy speaks thee brave! Forgive these Tears.
For my dear Lord, to me than Life more dear,
These Sorrows flow! -- Indeed, my thankful Heart
Melts in warm Gratitude to thy kind Care,
Which saved me from the Horrors of this Day.
But, Oh! -- my Husband!

GOTHMUND. Why these streaming Tears?
What of her Husband? Did he fall in Battle?

ATHELSTAN. That is her Fear:
Though Rumor yet speak doubtful of his Fate.

THYRA. Too sure, he is fallen! -- Ye generous Warriors, hear, --
Hear a poor Captive's Prayer! -- Oh, let your Guards
Conduct my faithful Servants to the Field:
Or give me Safeguard through the deathful Scene;
I will divest me of my Woman's Fear,
And with a Scythian Boldness tread in Gore;
Drag off the Heaps of overwhelming Foes,
Till I have found my EGBERT's dear Remains,
To give them Burial. The last, mournful Duty
I ever can pay his Love.

ATHELSTAN. Despond not, Fair one:
Happily, he yet may live.

THYRA. Oh, flattering Hope!
Grant me but That! -- But That, ye Powers of Heaven!

GOTHMUND. Now, by our Gods of Denmark, ATHELSTAN,
This is too bright a Fair, for Age like thine
Idly to gaze on.

ATHELSTAN. Beauty, thus afflicted,
Merits my Pow'r's Protection.

GOTHMUND. Is she not
The Captive of thy Sword?

ATHELSTAN. True, but the Sword
That won, shall guard her.

GOTHMUND. What if GOTHMUND's Will
Should raise this Fair one from the captive Throng,
To grace his Bed?

ATHELSTAN. By Law of War she is mine;
And I have sworn Protection.

GOTHMUND. From thy Foe
To shield thy Captive, were a Task of Praise
Worthy thy Arm. But when a true Ally,
Thy Friend in War, entreats so small a Boon --

ATHELSTAN. GOTHMUND, the Friend whose erring Wish demands
What Honor cannot yield -- I pray, no more --

GOTHMUND. If GOTHMUND's Friendship, in thy thankless Heart,
Insensible to all my proffered Bounty,
Stands at so cheap a Price -- Protect thy Captive. --
Let thy Power shield her as it may. -- Lead on. --

[Exit GOTHMUND. ATHELSTAN. Imperious Dane! Would thou bend ATHELSTAN
Beneath thy Pride? -- His parting Words and Looks
Darted Contempt. -- This the Reward of Conquest?
This, Valor's Recompense?

SIWARD. 'Twas what I feared. --
Why did Revenge seduce thee from thy King!
Bear Witness, Heaven, if ever I trod the Field,
Or barred my Sword in seeming Aid of Denmark,
Save in the honest Hope, to check thy Vengeance.

ATHELSTAN. What? To a thankless King, a favored Foe
Basking beneath the royal Smile, to yield
With coward-like Submission? -- Friend, no more.
The Dye of Fate is thrown.

SIWARD. Did thou not see,
How Passion kindled, while with ardent Gaze
He eyed fair THYRA's Charms? His Soul has caught
A swift and deep Infection. Mark the Event.

ATHELSTAN. Weak is thy Fear. Though bold in Violence,
He dare not wake my Rage.

THYRA. Oh generous Duke,
Behold me at thy Feet! I see the Storm
Fast gathering over my Head! Redeem, redeem me
From this rapacious Dane! I dread not Death;
Whose Image, from my earliest Age of Woe,
Has been the calm Companion of my Thoughts.
Then let thy Arm, which on this fatal Morn
Did shield me, now complete it is generous Care.
My forfeit Life is thine. In Pity kill me,
Ere yet Dishonor blot my Innocence.

ATHELSTAN. By my good Sword, which won thee in the Storm,
Again I swear, not Denmark's proudest Threat
Shall wrest thee from me. -- SIWARD, are my Mercians
Camp'd in their separate Quarter?

SIWARD. Aye, my Lord:
Westward, a Mile; on a fair rising Ground,
Fast by the River's Brink.

ATHELSTAN. This Night I meant
To pass in Council with the General GOTHMUND,
On future Enterprise. But since his Pride
Brooks no Control; -- would Heaven I had not come!
Since it is thus: -- At least his Pride shall seek me:
And if I find him bent on Violence,
The Morning Sun shall see me quit his Camp.
Have thou prepared fair THYRA's Tent by mine?

SIWARD. I did command it so.

ATHELSTAN. Retire we then.

THYRA. I merit not thy Care. Why should I live,
When my dear Lord is lost, and England fallen!

ATHELSTAN. Touch not on That: -- For by this Arm it fell.
Yes: I have washed my Footsteps in the Blood
Of my despairing Foes. -- But oh, for whom!
I Will think no more. -- Come, THYRA, to thy Tent.

End of the FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE I.
The open Camp. GOTHMUND, HAROLD, DUNELM. GOTHMUND. HAVE thou not seen her,
HAROLD?

HAROLD. Much I have heard.
Her Beauty dwells on every Soldier's Tongue,
And half eclipses Conquest.

GOTHMUND. Oh, such Beauty!
HAROLD, her Eye's bright Beam might thaw the cold
Norwegian's Breast; or warm the frozen Sons
Of Lapland into Love. -- Oh Earth and Heaven!
My Soul's on Fire! -- The Glories of the War,
The Wreaths of Conquest sicken on her Sight.
Avaunt, Ambition! yield thy Throne to Love!
HAROLD, she must be mine.

HAROLD. What lets thee then?
What Bar so strong, to guard her from thy Wish?
Each cobweb Hindrance to thy Breath shall yield,
If thou but will her Thine.

GOTHMUND. May I never taste the Warrior's Lot in Death,
Never quaff the rich Mead in the infernal Courts,
Where mighty ODIN rules the glorious Dead,
If I not seize her Beauties. -- But, brave HAROLD,
This delicate Captive is no common Food,
Like what we snatch in every City's Plunder,
For gross Desire to seed on. I would win
Her Soul's Consent: would kindle mutual Passion,
To meet my Flame: At least, by fair Persuasion
Would temper Power; that the Effect might seem
Without all Show of Violence. HAROLD, haste thee
To the fair Captive's Tent. Tell her, the Gods
Of Denmark claim their wonted Sacrifice
Of captive Youths, and thirst for England's Gore.
But if her dear Consent shall crown my Wish,
Our Gods propitious will accept her Smile,
In Ransom for their Blood. Paint forth the Terrors
Of the dread Sacrifice; the Victims bound;
The howling Incantations of our Priests
Invoking Hell; the glittering Faulcion barred;
The streaming Gore, and Horrors of the Altar.
The mournful Tale shall melt her into Grief,
And Pity plead Consent.

HAROLD. I wait thy Will.
Yet were my Counsel worthy GOTHMUND's Ear --

GOTHMUND. What would thou? -- Say. --

HAROLD. Some captive Briton best
Would bend her Pride.

GOTHMUND. Not so. These stubborn Britons,
Unconquered even in Chains, defy our Swords;
Awful in Ruin: Like their kindred Oaks,
Though blasted by the Thunder of the War,
They proudly bear their scorched Ribs aloft,
And brave the Power that struck them. Therefore, HAROLD,
That Hope is vain.

HAROLD. Persuasion, sure, would flow
Prompt, and more powerful from some Captive's Tongue,
To Death or endless Slavery doomed; yet soothed
With Hope, and promised Freedom. For the Speech
Of mimic Art is weak and sinewless,
To the strong Workings of the laboring Soul,
When Passion glows within.

GOTHMUND. It Is well advised.
Then lead some captive Briton to her Tent,
On this great Purpose. But over all I fear
This haughty ATHELSTAN: He claims her His,
By Law of Battle; and has sworn Protection.

HAROLD. Is GOTHMUND's Power so weak, then, that he dreads
A Traitor's Frown?

GOTHMUND. Nay, by our Gods, I Will seize her;
Though he, and all the witching Powers of Hell,
Though the weird Sisters, and each horrible Shape
That haunts the midnight Forest, hemm her round
With Magic Incantation. -- HAROLD, speed thee.
I Will wait thee in my Tent. --

[Exit GOTHMUND. SCENE II.
HAROLD. Now, Spirit of Mischief, rise! Welcome, foul Fiend,
That rid'st the Carr of Night; and scatter'st Plagues
With unseen Hand! -- DUNELM, he fears me not:
Nor dreams what Tempest soon shall blacken round.
Did thou not mark that frowning Captive, EGBERT?

DUNELM. I did.

HAROLD. He best will bear the General's Love
To THYRA's Tent. -- Command him hither, DUNELM.
[Exit DUNELM. His generous Heart shall burn with fierce Disdain;
And strengthen THYRA's Virtue into Scorn,
Which Pity cannot bend. -- So black a Purpofe
Known and proclaimed, may happily rouse to Rage
The Duke of Mercia; in whose fiery Breast
Lies Fury, ripe to catch, and blaze in Flames.
Oh, for some swift Occasion, that my Breath
May kindle Discord into deadly Feud!
Like angry Clouds that sail on warring Winds,
Their sierce conflicting Wrath shall meet in Thunder,
And Ruin close the Fray! --

SCENE III.
To him, EGBERT. HAROLD. Welcome, brave Youth.
Thy Fame, and known Pre-eminence in Valor,
Have called thee to a generous Task of Duty,
For Britain's Weal. -- Thou know, by Doom of War,
Full fifty Captives to our Gods must bleed.

EGBERT. So doom your fancied Gods, the vain Creation
Of Fear and Cruelty. But righteous Heaven,
That sees your Blindness with a pitying Eye,
Detests the Sacrifice.

HAROLD. Prevent it then.

EGBERT. Name but the Means. If my devoted Blood
Can save my guiltless Countrymen from Death,
I yield it to the Altar.

HAROLD. Valiant EGBERT,
A gentler Task is thine. A captive Beauty
Brightens yon Tent: She has subdued our General.
The Rage of Love is on him. If thy Tongue
Can win her to his Bed. --

EGBERT. HAROLD, no more.
Think thou, because I drag the Chain of War,
My Soul must wear your Shackles? Fallen a Captive,
I bear a Briton's Heart: The Coward only
Earns Safety by Dishonor.

HAROLD. Yet many a Briton
Would deem it Service, worth a brave Man's Care,
To save devoted Innocence from Death,
At this cheap Price. Weighed with the Blood of Man,
What is this unknown Woman's Weal or Woe,
This captive THYRA's Honor?

EGBERT. THYRA? -- THYRA?
What THYRA?

HAROLD. ATHELSTAN's fair Captive THYRA.
What Terror's in that Name? What wonder moves thee?

EGBERT. Ye Powers of Heaven! -- HAROLD, if you are a Man;
If ever brave Compassion touched thy Breast;
If ever the tender Names of Wife and Husband,
The bleeding Anguish of despairing Virtue,
The Love of Worth, or Piety to Heaven,
Did sway thy Heart to great and generous Deeds,
Or melted thee to Pity, hear me now!
That THYRA is my Wife!

HAROLD. Indeed? thy Wife?

EGBERT. So sure, as Infamy is hovering over her,
My Wife! Devoted to this Ruffian's Lust!

HAROLD. EGBERT, I love the Valor of a Foe:
And Worth like thine turns Enmity to Praise.
How will thy Bosom burn with honest Rage,
When hissing Scorn proclaims --

EGBERT. Oh, thou have shook
My firmest Fortitude! I thought her dead.
When she was lost, what more could EGBERT fear?
Hence cold Despair had gathered over my Soul,
Wrapped it in Ice from every Sense of Ill,
And chained the struggling Tear. But her loved Name
Has roused me from this Lethargy of Woe,
Has thawed the frozen Horrors of my Heart,
And melted me to Childhood. Grief and Joy,
And Fear, and Hope, in tumult rise within me:
While through the moistened Channels of mine Eyes
These Sorrows flow: -- Yes, for thy Sake, thy EGBERT
Weeps his Captivity!

HAROLD. Waste not in Tears
The precious Minutes. Speed thee to her Tent.
Dishonor and Pollution hover over it.

EGBERT. Perdition seize the Robber! Generous HAROLD,
Lead me to aid this helpless Innocence.
Hear me, brave Countrymen! and witness Heaven,
That to redeem your death-devoted Blood,
EGBERT would yield his own -- But oh, my Wife!
What! yield her to a Russian's Lust? -- Nay rather,
I Will dash her Beauties into Wounds and Horror,
For Lust to start at. -- Lead me to her Tent.
My laboring Heart will burst!

HAROLD. The attending Guard
Shall guide thee to her Tent.

[Exeunt. SCENE IV.
Changes to THYRA's Tent. THYRA, EDWINA. Sure, it is some warning Power that
whispers here.
My beating Heart forebodes the Approach of Fate,
And labors with the Event. -- EDWINA, come:
Friend of my Life, dear Partner of my Woes!
Teach me to combat these surrounding Terrors,
That overwhelm my Soul!

EDWINA. Take Comfort, THYRA:
All may be well.

THYRA. Oh, this unpitying Dane!
Raging with Insolence, and red with Slaughter!
What cannot he attempt!

EDWINA. Distrust not Heaven.
The valiant ATHELSTAN has vowed Protection.
Wrong not his generous Care.

THYRA. May every Power
That watches over the just and brave, protect him,
And crown his Days with Honor!

SCENE V.
To them, DUNELM. DUNELM. Beauteous Captive,
A Messenger from GOTHMUND --

THYRA. Oh, my Fears!

DUNELM. He wills, that all depart,
Save only Thee: for he has much to say,
Meet for thy private Ear.

THYRA. Alas, EDWINA!
What shall I do! Oh leave me not, EDWINA!
Undone, undone!

DUNELM. Nay, weep not, beauteous Captive.
Let all depart; else ye provoke his Rage*

[Ex. DUN. ED. THYRA. Now which Way shall I turn me! Whither fly
To shun these gathering Horrors! -- Would I had fallen
Beneath the Battle's Fury! That the Spear
Had pierced my Heart! Or that some flaming Tower
Had been my funeral Pile! -- Why was I spared,
To sink in deeper Woes! -- Oh, pitying Heaven,
If ever thy Care regarded Innocence,
Restore me to my Lord!

SCENE VI.
To her, EGBERT. EGBERT. Behold him here!

THYRA. Is It possible! -- It Is He! my Lord! my Husband!
Oh happy Change! Oh Bliss unspeakable!
Support me, heavenly Powers! Support me, EGBERT.
I faint, I faint! Oh, take me to thy Breast! --

EGBERT. Thou Crown of all my Joys! Thou Cause beloved
Of all my bitterest Pangs! Do I once more
Infold thee in these Arms!

THYRA. Too bounteous Heaven!
And are my Sorrows sled! Shall Hope once more
Visit this Breast? And do I live to see thee!
Alas, my Lord! through what unnumber'd Woes,
Through what a Sea of Horrors have we past,
Since last we parted!

EGBERT. Such is Heaven's high Will.
England is fallen! The Majesty of Empire
Is sunk by Fate! Destruction rears her Banner:
The fatal Raven croaks; and Britain's weeping Genius,
Yielding his Charge, flits to some happier Clime!

THYRA. Oh fatal Day! be thou for ever wept!
Yet every future Morn shall hear my Praise,
And Gratitude sincere arise to Heaven,
For this dear Boon, this Cure of every Woe,
That I have found my EGBERT! -- Say, my Lord,
Who led thee to these Tents?

EGBERT. Through the wide Waste
Of mortal War, I sought my virtuous THYRA,
To save her from the Foe: But sought in vain.
Then rushing on the thickest War, my Sword
Edged by Despair, I mowed my Way; to where
GOTHMUND, entrenched in triple Rows of Spears,
Stood like our Country's Fiend. He met my Arm.
But soon th'o' erwhelming Files that hemmed him round
Ended the mortal Strife; and led me hither,
The Captive of his Pride.

THYRA. Blessed, blessed Event!
Sure, 'twas some unseen Angel ruled thy Fate;
Now, barbarous GOTHMUND, I defy thy Threats!
Oh Coward! to insult a helpless Captive!
[Bursts into Tears.
EGBERT. Soul of my Soul! The frowning Fates surround us!
That thou art here, restored to Life and Me,
This grateful Tear I offer up to Heaven!
But if some heavier Ruin hangs unseen,
Unkind and cruel was the Sword that spared thee! --

THYRA. But thou art come, like some blessed Power from Heaven,
To banish all my Fears! Ah, why that Groan?

EGBERT. Dear THYRA! See, -- these Chains! --

THYRA. Would I could wear them for thee!

EGBERT. Generous THYRA!
I know thy Love: I do believe thou would.
Think then, what Pangs must rend thy EGBERT's Heart,
To see thy Worth insulted, dragged by Power
To soul Dishonor; while this cruel Chain
Binds down his honest Vengeance!

THYRA. Since I have found thee,
Though setter'd in this ignominious Chain,
I know not why, -- but every Fear is fled: --
There Is Safety in thy Arms. --

EGBERT. My Soul's best Part!
Wrap not thy Heart in blind Security!
Helpless thou see me here, as Age or Childhood: --
I fear the rising Storm. Forgive me, THYRA,
If in the Tempest of my Rage, these Chains
Should strike thee to the Earth! the cruel Task
Of desperate Love! and blot that Heavenly Form
With deadly Wounds and Blood; to rescue thee
From this remorseless Dane!

THYRA. But ATHELSTAN,
Who saved me midst the Horrors of this Day --

EGBERT. Who? Mercia's Duke?

THYRA. Has bravely sworn Protection.

EGBERT. Curse the Traitor!
'Twas he, whose Sword, unsheathed by lawless Fury
Against his Country, and the best of Kings,
Has brought Destruction on us. -- May his Treason
Fall, like an impious Arrow shot at Heaven,
And cleave his hoary Head!

THYRA. Yet, if I err not;
Ere this, Conviction of his Crime has wrought
Repentance in his Heart.

EGBERT. No: plead not for him:
He has undone us all!

THYRA. Forgive me, EGBERT,
If Gratitude work strong within my Soul. --
He saved me from the Dane. A Mind so noble,
Though headlong driven down by the Tide of Passion,
Must soon return to Virtue.

EGBERT. Could I hope it?
Could I but hope he would rejoin our Arms,
We yet might rescue Thee, and rescue England!

THYRA. Behold, he comes! -- Now, EGBERT, curb thy Rage,
Think: He is still the Guardian of my Honor.
Assume the winning Eloquence of Grief,
Laboring beneath it is Wrongs: His generous Heart
Will melt in Sympathy.

EGBERT. My virtuous THYRA,
For thee, and for my bleeding Country's Sake,
I Will choke the Pang I groan with. --

SCENE VII.
To them, ATHELSTAN, SIWARD. ATHELSTAN. Down, proud Heart!
Oh, I am rent with Anguish! Never more
Shall fair Peace keep her Sabbath in my Breast!
Unthankful Dane!

SIWARD. What less could Reason fear
From unrelenting Robbers?

ATHELSTAN. Blind Revenge!
Oh whither have thou led me! -- Say, proud Captive,
Who brought thee to these Tents?

THYRA. Brave ATHELSTAN,
This is my Lord, my EGBERT. -- Honored EGBERT,
Lo, Mercia's Duke, who saved me from Dishonor. --

ATHELSTAN. Yet, ruled by sullen Pride, he scorns to thank me.

EGBERT. That thou did save her from the Rage of War,
Binds me thy Friend: But that thy traitorous Arm
Has madly drawn thy Sword against thy King,
Unties that private Bond of Man with Man,
And bids me stand thy Foe.

ATHELSTAN. To injured Honor
A brave Revenge was due.

EGBERT. Oh ATHELSTAN!
Thy Vengeance, in its fatal Course, has swept
Thy Friends and Foes in one promiscuous Ruin!
Childhood and Age, the Gentle and the Brave,
And helpless Innocence which never wronged thee,
Have felt the Fury of thy mad Revenge.
Had thou been England's Friend, these bloody Danes,
Had fled our Shores: No Briton then had dragged
These ignominious Chains! nor helpless THYRA
Had called in vain on Earth and Heaven to save her!

THYRA. Dire is our Fate's Decree, when EGBERT weeps!
Oh cruel GOTHMUND!

EGBERT. False, false ATHELSTAN!

ATHELSTAN. No more: -- Why rend ye thus my tortured Heart?
Thy Words are Scorpions in my Breast. -- Rash Man,
Take back thy THYRA: -- Guard her as thou can: --
Farewell: I Will hear no longer. --

THYRA. [catching his Garment. Generous Duke!
Leave us not thus! Leave us not to Destruction!
We have no Hope but thee!

ATHELSTAN. [breaking from her. Thy tears are vain. --

SIWARD. Spurn not her Griefs --

ATHELSTAN. SIWARD, if you are my Friend --

EGBERT. Nay, but thou yet shall hear me: -- Across thy Steps
I Will throw my Body, though thy Hand were armed
With Lightning, till thou hear me --

ATHELSTAN. Urge me not:
Urge not thy Fate --

EGBERT. Alas! can Fate do more!
Oh ATHELSTAN! but that I know thy Virtues,
I would not stoop to entreat thee. Life I reck not.
Then spite of thee, I dare to be thy Friend: --
Yes; I will search thy Heart; will there dethrone
Usurping Passions that have banished Reason,
Eclipsed thy Virtues in their noontide Sphere,
And darkened all their Brightness!

ATHELSTAN. Let me pass --

EGBERT. By Heaven, I will not, till I have paid the Debt
Due to thy generous Soul. -- Yes; thou have been
My THYRA's guardian Genius: -- Hear me now,
Hear Me, as thine: Sent by all-gracious Heaven,
Kindly to warn thee of that Sea of Guilt,
In which thy Rage has plunged thee! -- Hear the Voice
That calls thee, to return to Honor's Path;
Bravely to quit thy guilty League with Denmark,
And save poor bleeding England!

ATHELSTAN. Witness Heaven,
How dear has England's Happiness and Fame
Been to my Soul! How, on this dreadful Morn,
When Vengeance led me to the Field of Death,
My bleeding Heart wept for my Country's Woe,
And half subdued Revenge! -- Behold these Tears --
These Tears proclaim, I am a Briton still!

EGBERT. Then act a Briton's Part. --

ATHELSTAN. Ungrateful King!
Why did thou wake my Rage! why urge my Vengeance
To lead Destruction on!

EGBERT. Nay, wrong him not.
It Is Passion's Blindness rules thee. -- Heaven and Earth
Witness the untir'd Bounties of his Hand.
But when bold Expectation, nursed by Vanity,
Brooks no Denial; and assumes to weigh
Its own fantastic Worth; -- what earthly Power
Can satisfy it is Cravings, or fill up
The unfathomed Measure of Self-Love and Pride!

SIWARD. Or grant thy Worth neglected: -- Grant the Slave,
Fool, Flatterer, Whisperer, reptile Sycophant,
To thee preferred in Honor: -- Virtue still,
Wrapped in the Majesty of calm Disdain,
And self reyer'd, in her own Dignity
Would check Revenge; would welcome Injury
With manly Scorn, and for the public Weal
Forget all private Wrong.

ATHELSTAN. No more, no more!
Would Heaven, I had not done it. --

EGBERT. Imperial London!
Fair England's Boast! The Glory of the Isles!
How art thou fallen! Thy Palaces and Towers,
Low levelled with the Dust, now smoke in Ashes! --
Heaven! as we passed in Chains the Streets along,
How the loud Shrieks of ravished Maids and Matrons,
The Groans of Britons weltring in their Blood,
Of Infants writhing on the bloody Spear,
Transfixed my Heart! --

THYRA. In vain the holy Priest,
The trembling Sire, and widowed Wife, in vain
Clung to their Altars, and implored for Mercy: --
The Ruffian Foe with sacrilegious Hand
Dragged them to Death; and to his Idols grim
Did shed their innocent Blood! --

ATHELSTAN. What have I done!
Oh Britain! hapless Britain!

SIWARD. Do thou weep?
Come, fair Repentance, Daughter of the Skies!
Soft Harbinger of soon returning Virtue!
The weeping Messenger of Grace from Heaven!
Lovely in Tears. -- Now melt his generous Heart!
Infuse kind Pity for his Country's Woes!
Wake his great Soul; and bid him shine once more,
It Is Pride, Support, and Glory! --

ATHELSTAN. It Is too late!
Oh Madness! Headlong Madness!

EGBERT. Never too late
To turn to Virtue! -- THYRA, SIWARD, kneel;
And sue for Mercy to our ruined Country! --
[They kneel.
THYRA. Could a poor helpless Captive's Prayer be heard! --

EGBERT. Behold in us, Millions of guiltless Britons --

SIWARD. Pleading for Life and Freedom! --

EGBERT. Hear the Groans
Of martyred Christians --

THYRA. Bleeding for their Faith --

SIWARD. Imploring Help from thee! --

ATHELSTAN. Rise, Britons, rise. --
I yield, I yield! -- Yes; England, I am thine! --
[They rise.
EGBERT. Oh happy Change!

SIWARD. Oh generous ATHELSTAN!

ATHELSTAN. And yet -- to stoop! -- meanly to sue for Pardon! --

SIWARD. He, he alone degrades his State, who stoops
To wrongful Deeds; these done, it is truly brave
To sue for Pardon, and who stoops, is greatest.

ATHELSTAN. [embracing them. Come to my Heart! my Friends! my Guides to Peace!
Your Words, like Light from Heaven, have pierced my Soul!
Oh Blindness, Frenzy! -- Generous, injured King,
How can I ever behold thee!

EGBERT. Trust his Goodness.
His chief Delight is Mercy: and when Justice
Demands the awful Sacrifice of Life,
Reluctant he confirms the harsh Decree.

SIWARD. Even now a trusty Spy returned, informs me,
Our valiant King, must'ring his scattered Powers,
Ere Morning dawns will storm the Danish Camp:
Lead but thy valiant Mercians --

ATHELSTAN. Grant me, Heaven,
On a wide Heap of routed Danes to die!
I ask no more. -- Come, let us quit the Camp. --

EGBERT. Alas, brave Duke, I am a Captive here.
I cannot go. A thousand guiltless Britons
Must bleed, should I escape. -- But to thy Care,
Here I bequeath a Trust more dear than Life.
Let THYRA be the Partner of thy Flight.

THYRA. Must I then leave my Lord!
Severe Decree! Shall I not see my EGBERT,
Ere I depart?

EGBERT. My ever honored Wife,
Be sure thou shall.

ATHELSTAN. THYRA, retire: and while I seek the Dane,
To lull Suspicion, wait us in thy Tent,
Prepared for Flight. -- Now SIWARD, to my Mercians. --
Tell them my Wrongs from Denmark: paint the Pangs
Of my unfeigned Repentrance: rowze their Valor
To quenchless Rage, that may atone my Guilt.
That to the Ghost of every martyred Briton
We slew in Fight, a Host of Danes may die.

[Exeunt. End of the SECOND ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE 1.
THYRA's Tent. GOTHMUND, GOODWIN. GOTHMUND. HER Husband, did thou say?

GOODWIN. So Rumor speaks.

GOTHMUND. Amazement -- Then he has played false with HAROLD,
And quenched my Hope. -- Did thou not say, thou saw him,
Walking-the Camp?

GOODWIN. He shot athwart the Tents
With proud and hasty Step, that seemed to scorn
The Ground he trod.

GOTHMUND. Then we shall meet him here.
This is his Wife's Pavilion. If he comes,
I mean to speak him fair. Persuasion mild
Shall first allure Consent: Should that be vain,
From the false Calm a sudden Storm shall rise,
And bury him in Ruin. -- Is the Guard
Armed, and at Hand to seize him?

GOODWIN. Armed, and ready.

GOTHMUND. Behold, he comes.

GOODWIN. It Is he: I see his Chain,
That glitters in the Moon-beam.

GOTHMUND. GOODWIN, hence:
Wait within Call. --

[Exit GOODWIN. SCENE II.
To him, EGBERT. GOTHMUND. Briton, I greet thee well.
Is the fair Captive won to GOTHMUND's Love?
Why art thou dumb?

EGBERT. Why do I see thee here?

GOTHMUND. Lest Insult should approach fair THYRA's Tent,
I come to watch her Welfare.

EGBERT. As the Wolf
Guards the defenseless Lamb.

GOTHMUND. Have thou forgot
Whose Chain thou wear'st?

EGBERT. It Is Thine: and thence I scorn it.

GOTHMUND. EGBERT, beware: Thou know the Victor's Power:
Wake not his Rage. --

EGBERT. I bear a guiltless Mind,
Thou can not conquer. --

GOTHMUND. Hence, audacious Captive.
I know thee THYRA's Husband. -- Tremble, Briton:
Nor sport with angry Power!

EGBERT. Hence, ruffian Dane! -- This Tent is ATHELSTAN's.
THYRA's his Captive: and kind Heaven ordained him,
To rescue Innocence from Lust and Rapine.

GOTHMUND. Yet I am calm. -- But have a Care, rash Youth --
For ATHELSTAN: -- What Power but mine can shield him
From the just Vengeance of his injured King?
Whatever the Traitor won, he won for me.
Like these rich Territories, THYRA'S mine
By Conquest: Let not then weak Shame or Pride
Obstruct the Victor's Wish: Be just, brave EGBERT,
And yield her Beauty to its new Possessor.

EGBERT. Come, honest Pride! Oh fill my swelling Heart,
And arm mine Eye, and point my Tongue with Scorn,
Keen as the Scorpion's Sting! -- By Heaven, this Chain,
This Chain alone bids Insolence be bold,
Which else were dumb, as Cowardice or Guilt!
Oh, for my honest Faulcion! which this Morn,
O'erwhelming Numbers wrested from my Hand!
Yes: I would hunt thee through the Battle's Rage:
Surrounding Guards, and doubling Ranks in vain
Should shelter thee!

GOTHMUND. Hell's Curses blast thy Pride!
Had not the busy Guards forestalled my Vengeance,
The Lightning of my Sword had cleft thee down.
Shall I bear this? Hoa, GOODWIN! Bring the Guard!
[To him GOODWIN. Seize that insulting Captive: Drag him hence,
To dark Imprisonment, and sevenfold Chains,
Till the Fleet sail for Denmark.

SCENE III.
To them, THYRA, EDWINA. THYRA. Mercy, Mercy!
Oh GOTHMUND, at thy Feet!

GOTHMUND. Let go thy Hold. --
Quick, bear him to his Prison.

EGBERT. Why this Violence?
I am your Captive: Bear me where ye may.

THYRA. Must we thus part! -- Oh cruel Dane! In Mercy
Destroy us here together!

EGBERT. Strive no more:
Waste not thy generous Tears on barbarous Power:
For what can Right, when Lust and Madness rule?
Yield to thy Fate. Farewell!

[Exit EGBERT and GOODWIN. THYRA. My Lord! my EGBERT!
Oh lost, lost, lost! --

GOTHMUND. Thou yet have Power to save him. --

THYRA. Oh name the Task which Honor sanctifies,
And I will die to save him! -- Bid me roam,
An Exile from my Country, through the Climes
Where frozen Lapland's wintry Wastes extend;
Doom me for ever to the unwholesome Mine,
Where hopeless Slavery toils: -- I Will bless my Fate,
So I may save my EGBERT.

GOTHMUND. Fear not, THYRA,
So harsh a Doom -- That delicate Frame was formed
For gentler Offices. -- Crown but my Love,
And EGBERT shall be free.

THYRA. Peace, Monster, Peace!
Nor wound my chaste Ear with thy Words, which taint
The wholesome Air.

GOTHMUND. Else shall my Vengeance sweep
Thy stubborn EGBERT to far distant Shores.
Yes: he shall dwell with Darkness, pine with Want,
Rot 'midst the cold Damps of a hideous Dungeon;
And live a lingering Death!

THYRA. Oh horrible!
Thou can not mean it!

GOTHMUND. By our Gods, I do!
While thou, the Minion of the general Camp,
Shall feed unbridled Lust; till wrinkled Age
Doom thee at length a household Drudge, the Scorn
Of loathing Appetite!

THYRA. Oh hear me Heaven!
Hear me, thus kneeling, low on Earth! Descend,
Ye guardian Powers that watch over Innocence,
Descend, and soften his relentless Heart,
Or I am lost for ever! -- Hear me, GOTHMUND,
For the chaste Matron's Sake, who gave thee Birth!
Oh, hear!

GOTHMUND. Nay, yield thee; or his Fate is sealed. --

THYRA. Pity my captive State! a helpless Orphan,
With not a Friend! an outcast from my Country!
Unknown to all; even to myself unknown!
A poor lost Infant, wrecked on England's Coast!
Perhaps an Infant Dane! -- Oh why, EDWINA,
Why was I rescued by thy Father's Hand!
Else had my Sorrows found a peaceful Grave
In the devouring Deep!

GOTHMUND. An infant Dane?
Give me but Proof of That --

THYRA. Concurrent Proofs
Bespeak me such: Wrong not thy Country then:
Wrong not thy Friends: Oh think thou see thy Friends,
And thy dear Relatives now plead in me;
And thus with bended Knees and lifted Eyes
Beseech thy Pity! -- speak, EDWINA, speak!
Oh tell the Tale of Woe! The mournful Tale
Needs not the coloring of artful Tongues,
To melt the hardest Heart!

GOTHMUND. I charge thee, Woman,
Be bold in Truth: or instant Death awaits thee.

EDWINA. Hear then the Tale, which at the hallowed Altar
I dare confirm. -- Near to the Coast of Wessex
My Father lived; an humble Villager.
'Twas on a Time when Storms had vexed the Deep,
We spied a Danish Vessel driven on Rocks,
Then swallowed in the Flood. The Storm raged on:
And on the rolling Billows, mountain-high,
This helpless Babe came floating. The next Wave
Had washed her to the Deep: 'Twas then my Father
Snatched her from Death. -- Soon as our Cottage Warmth
Recalled her into Life, the lovely Babe
Smiled on us, all unconscious of her Woe.
Tears gushed from every Eye. My generous Father,
Generous though poor, and now a Saint in Heaven,
Embraced the Child, and vowed her as his own.
Beauty, with every winning Quality,
Grew with her Growth: She was our Village Pride.
EGBERT at length, drawn by her peerless Fame,
Beheld, and loved, and won her.

THYRA. Generous EGBERT!

GOTHMUND. But say -- Did this poor Babe alone survive
The general Wreck?

EDWINA. Alone: The rest were swallowed
By the devouring Flood.

GOTHMUND. But tell me, Woman,
Why did ye judge the sinking Wreck, a Dane?

EDWINA. 'Twas from the yellow Streamers, hoisted high
In Signal of Distress.

THYRA. [Taking a Chain from her Neck. Behold this Chain,
[Gothmund takes the Chain. By me held sacred from my earliest Age:
This, happily, may confirm the wondrous Tale.

EDWINA. That very Chain adorned her infant Neck:
Inwrought with mystic Figures, it has tired
Each lettered Sage's Eye.

GOTHMUND. The Signatures
Are of a Runic Import: which our Bards,
And Priests, and Sages magic-taught, can spell.
I Will bear it to their Search.

THYRA. May Heaven infuse
Soft Pity to thy Heart!

GOTHMUND. Could I but win
Fair THYRA's Love! -- The Camp shall pour its Treasures:
Freedom and Wealth, the Spoils of conquered England,
Shall join to grace thy Tent: while thou supreme
Shall triumph over thy Fate, and bless the Hour
That spoke thy Birth, and gave thee to the Dane.

THYRA. Oh mighty GOTHMUND!

GOTHMUND. Nay, dry these Griefs; though much indeed they grace thee.
Come; let thine Eyes beam with their own soft Fires,
And all thy Form awaken into Beauty.
Dwell not with fruitless Woe: Lot bitter Tears
Rain from the Captive's Eye, condemned to Exile,
And endless Slavery: But a happier Lot
Awaits fair THYRA's Choice, and pleads Acceptance.

THYRA. My EGBERT! O my Husband!

GOTHMUND. Weep no more;
Thy Tears can never recall him.

THYRA. Little know thou;
What strong eternal Bands of mutual Love
Have knit our Souls: Divided Happiness
We never can know. Joy, like one common Sun,
Must shine on Both or Neither: and if Night
Has overcast his Fate; my Sun of Life
With his, is set for ever. -- Give me the Chain. --

GOTHMUND. Nay, by my Sword, the Chain
Is dearer to me than a Diamond's Mine.
This Chain's the Clue, shall guide me to thy Birth;
Which, once revealed, shall every Tie dissolve
That binds thee to these Britons. Denmark then
Shall claim thee Here Is; and GOTHMUND plead her Rights.

[Exit GOTHMUND. THYRA. Unfriended Innocence implores in vain!
EDWINA, range the Camp! seek out my EGBERT!
Tell him, his THYRA kneels in vain for Mercy,
And bid him fly to save her! -- Oh, I rave!
Even now, reientless Ruffians bind him down,
In the drear Depth of dark Imprisonment;
Far from his helpless THYRA.

SCENE IV.
To them, ATHELSTAN. ATHELSTAN. Sure, the Voice
Of Female Lamentation struck mine Ear. --
THYRA! -- whom do I see? -- What, drowned in Tears?

THYRA. Oh, lost, for ever lost! -- This barbarous Dane!

ATHELSTAN. What of him?

THYRA. Bent to do a Deed of Horror,
Even now he has dragged to dark Imprisonment
My guiltless Lord! -- He threatens instant Violence!

ATHELSTAN. Cursed be the Day on which he touched our Shores!
Come; let us from the Camp: -- Ere this, my Mercians,
Warned of the Oppressions of this bloody Dane,
And touched with Pity for their Country's Woes,
Burn to rejoin their King. -- Come, gentle THYRA, --
EDWINA, come. -- My Presence shall protect you,
Safe through this hostile Camp.

THYRA. Too generous, Duke!
Can I desert my Lord!

ATHELSTAN. Then stay, till GOTHMUND --

THYRA. Oh, save me, ATHELSTAN!
Haste, let us hence! -- I have no Help but thee!
Alas, my virtuous EGBERT, must I leave thee!

ATHELSTAN. Nay, fear not for him: -- Ere yon Moon has rode
Her Circuit round the Skies, I Will pour my Thunder
On these accursed Danes, and give him Freedom.
SIWARD, ere this, throughout the Ranks has waked
Brave Discontent, and kindled all my War. --
Come, let us quit the Camp. --

SCENE V.
To them, GOODWIN. GOODWIN. Hear, ATHELSTAN!
Our General sends thee Greeting. -- Sacred ever
He deems the Rights of War: yet Powers allied
Own the Priority of peaceful Claim. --

ATHELSTAN. It Is granted. -- What of this? --

GOODWIN. That captive Fair,
Won by thy Prowess in the City's Storm,
By Law of War is Thine: An earlier Right
Our General pleads: For Proofs of Circumstance
Speak her by Birth a Dane.

ATHELSTAN. No false Pretense
Shall wile her Virtues from me. -- THYRA, speak: --
Is It not a feigned Pretense?

THYRA. Oh mighty Duke!
Though Ruin hangs upon the Acknowledgment;
I fear, I am a Dane; and thence unworthy
A generous Briton's Care!

ATHELSTAN. Wrong not thy Worth:
For, as within the Forest's howling Depth,
Where grifly Bears, and Pards, and Tigers roam,
The wild Rose blooms; So often in savage Lands
Untutored Virtue dwells: Wherever it is found,
It claims Defense: Virtue is Virtue's Care,
Alike in every Clime. -- Then tell me, GOODWIN, --
For ere I yield my Captive, I will know: --
What Proofs of Circumstance --

GOODWIN. [producing the Chain. Behold this Chain --
With Runic Characters --

ATHELSTAN. [seizing the Chain. Ye Powers of Heaven,
That weave the inextricable Maze of Fate!
What do I see! -- If it is your sacred Will
To make me blessed, now lend a pitying Ray!
This very Chain, my once victorious Arm
Rent from the proud Neck of a slaughtered Dane. --
Oh Joy, Oh Grief! Oh Rapture to my Soul!
How, -- when, -- where, -- whence? Speak, GOODWIN!
[THYRA, speak! Or Hope and Doubt will heave my Heart to bursting!

THYRA. Ah me! I was a helpless Infant, lost
Ere Memory yet was seated in the Brain!

ATHELSTAN. Oh blessed Hope! Such was my EMMA too! --
EDWINA, -- can thou tell? -- Range, range the Round,
Where Memory hoards her Treasures, and brings back
Old Time! Confirm the Whispers of sweet Hope,
And give me back my Child!

EDWINA. Heaven! do thou weep
A Daughter lost?

ATHELSTAN. And long have wept in vain! --
Since she was lost, full twenty Years have shed
Their various Woes on my poor orphan'd Child! --
When furious HALFDEN ravaged Mercia's Cities,
Then was my Child (this very Chain she wore!)
Snatched from her Cradle by unpitying Danes
And thence conveyed to Denmark's barbarous Shore!

THYRA. Oh gracious Heaven!
On that lamented Time,
This very Chain circling her infant Neck,
By my dear Father's Hand was THYRA snatched
From the devouring Deep!

ATHELSTAN. It Is She! -- My Child! my Child!
[Embracing her.
THYRA. My Father!

EDWINA. Gracious Heaven!
Who can behold this Sight, and not dissolve
In Tears of Joy! --

ATHELSTAN. And was it mine, to save thee!
Oh Powerful Nature! -- For since first I saw thee,
My EMMA's Sweetness struck on every Sense:
Some soft Attraction drew! -- some unknown Charm
Worked in my Soul, and bade me wish thee Mine! --
Haste, GOODWIN, haste to GOTHMUND: there disclose
This Tale of Joy, this wondrous Burst of Bliss!
Tell him, that Nature cancels every Claim,
And gives my EMMA to her Father's Love!

GOODWIN. I Will forthwith to his Tent: A Minute's Round
Shall bring thee his Resolve.

Exit GOODWIN. ATHELSTAN. Eternal Providence!
To whose all-seeing Mind, the unmeasured Round
Of wide Events is present! far beyond
The narrow Ken of a weak mortal Eye!
Deep and unsearchable, yet just and true,
Are thy adored Decrees, O Power divine!
Thou even beyond the Darings of fond Hope,
Have from the Bosom of the raging Seas
Restored my long-lost Daughter! --
[Embracing her passionately.
THYRA. Happy, happy!
Oh Bliss unspeakable! And do I live,
Thus to be pressed to a fond Parent's Heart!
To hang upon his Breast! To know the Joy,
The heartfelt Raptures that attend the Names
Of Child and Daughter!

ATHELSTAN. Darling of my Soul!
Oh Comfort of my Age; -- Yet, yet one Grief
Checks the sweet Tumult of my honest Joy!
One piercing Grief lies heavy on my Soul! --

THYRA. Can I relieve thy Pain?

ATHELSTAN. Not all the lenient Balms thy Love can pour,
Can ever give me Rest! -- Oh Madness, Madness!
I have undone my Country!

THYRA. Alas, the Pity!
Think not so deeply of it.

ATHELSTAN. Oh, I am vile!
I dare not lift my guilty Eyes to Heaven!
Yet Heaven has show'r'd a Blessing on my Head,
Beyond the World's wide Empire! -- What may this mean! --
Sure, it is the Prelude to some dire Event!
A passing Gleam, sent by almighty Vengeance,
To deepen future Woe!

THYRA. Nay, rather deem it
The kind Encouragement of Heaven, vouchsafed
To thy returning Virtue!

ATHELSTAN. Heaven is just,
Yet merciful: -- Let me but rescue England,
And I shall yet be blessed! --

SCENE VI.
To them, GOODWIN. GOODWIN. Hear, Mercia's Duke!
GOTHMUND decrees, that every Right of Peace
Yields to the Conqu'ror's Power; and claims his Captive.

ATHELSTAN. Sooner your Swords shall drink my warm Lifeblood --

GOODWIN. Hoa! DUNELM -- Bear her off! --

[DUNELM and the Guard appear, and seize THYRA. THYRA. [as they carry her off
struggling. Help! Help! Undone!
Dear Father, help! --

ATHELSTAN. [Part of the Guardremain and intercept him. Damnation! Treach'ry!
Treach'ry! --
Slaves, let me pass --

GOODWIN. Not this Way, by the Gods --

ATHELSTAN. [drawing his Sword. By Heaven, I Will mow my Passage with my Sword.
--

GOODWIN. Disarm him --

[the remaining Guards disarm him. ATHELSTAN. Villains! give me back my
Daughter!

GOODWIN. Rave not, old Man! -- She now is GOTHMUND'S Charge.

[Ex. GOODWIN and Guards. ATHELSTAN. Inhuman Dogs! -- Tell me -- in Pity tell
me --
Where is my Daughter! Give me back my Daughter! --
Oh, Mercy, Mercy, Heaven! --

EDWINA. Alas, my Lord!
I fear She Is lost for ever! --

ATHELSTAN. Vengeance! Vengeance --
EDWINA, come! -- I Will to this bloody Dane,
And frown him into Stone! -- Loud in his Ear
I Will thunder all my Wrongs; and shake his Soul
With Sounds as dire, as when at general Doom
The dreadful Trump shall wake the guilty Dead!
Should he be deaf to injured Nature's Claim, --
I Will to my Mercians, and let loose Revenge!
Swift over these ruffian Danes I Will pour the Flood
Of War; and drown the guilty Camp in Blood;
Rage through their Tents, like fierce consuming Fire;
And among Heaps of slaughtered Foes expire!

End of the THIRD ACT.
ACT IV.
SCENE I.
GOTHMUND'S Tent. GOODWIN, DUNELM. GOODWIN. IS she secured?

DUNELM. Fast: -- Barricado'd strong
By doubled Ranks of Guard: whose levelled Spears
Hem round the Tent.

GOODWIN. Did not the Duke of Mercia,
Attempt to wrest her from them?

DUNELM. Yes: with Fury,
Fierce as the foaming Boar that whets his Tusks,
When the bold Hunter has destroyed his Young,
He clamoured to the Guard. They mocked his Rage.
Thrice he essayed, with phrenzy-like Despair,
To pierce their Ranks: Then Fury sunk to Grief.
Melting in Tears, he fu'd for one small Grace:
Prayed that EDWINA, her late fellow Captive,
Might share her Griefs. His Suit in Sport was granted.
EDWINA now weeps over her. -- But he comes,
To plead his Right with GOTHMUND.

GOODWIN. Fierce will be
Their meeting Frown; when Rage encounters Rage;
In either Breast a Storm.

DUNELM. I Will to my Watch:
Even let the Tempest roar.

[Exit DUNELM. GOODWIN. My Charge is here.

SCENE II.
To him, ATHELSTAN. ATHELSTAN. Vile Caitiff! Where Is thy General?

GOODWIN. Fair Words, Briton.
Choke thy foul Breath. The General's in his Tent.
What would thou?

ATHELSTAN. Tell him, ATHELSTAN is come.
His Heart will speak the rest.

GOODWIN. Even now he sits
On secret Council: Nor can Clamor gain
Admittance to his Ear.

ATHELSTAN. Insidious Hell-hound!
Or bring us Face to Face; or by yon Heaven,
His Tent shall be a Cobweb to my Rage.
I Will tear the sheeted Cordage from its Base,
And give it to the Winds: I Will call so loud,
The Heavens shall echo me; and the chaste Stars
Eclipse with Horror at the infernal Deed
Which his fell Heart conceives.

SCENE III.
To them, GOTHMUND. GOTHMUND. What lawless Clamor
Breaks on my Tent?

ATHELSTAN. What lawless Rapine late
Invaded mine?

GOTHMUND. Thou shall be answered bravely. --

ATHELSTAN. I will be answered truly. -- Think not, GOTHMUND,
That Frowns can terrify; or vile Evasion
Silence my loud-tongu'd Wrongs. -- Speak -- tell me, Dane, --
Why this audacious Insult on the Rights
Of sworn Alliance, and the Laws of War?

GOTHMUND. Am I not here supreme? -- Whatever was won,
Was won beneath my Banner. Thou, proud Duke,
Were but a Wheel within the vast Machine
That tore up England's Freedom. Yes, thy Sword
Was but the Instrument of GOTHMUND's Will.
I was the Soul, the all-directing Power
That ruled the War: Whatever ye won, ye won
Each for himself indeed; but all for me.

ATHELSTAN. Oh Falsehood, foul as Hell! What Dane so vile,
But now enjoys the Conquest that he reaped?
Behold the unpitying Riot of the Camp,
Rich with the Spoils of my poor ruined Country!
How every Soldier lords it over the Heap
Of Plunder which he won!

GOTHMUND. So GOTHMUND wills.
But did so dear a Prize enrich their Tents,
As lately brightened ATHELSTAN's; -- my Voice,
Swift as the Virtue of a magic Spell,
Should leave them void as thine.

ATHELSTAN. Cursed Insolence
Of barbarous Power! -- Yet think not ATHELSTAN
Rolled in the sordid List of GOTHMUND's Slaves.
I plead the Law of War; and claim my Captive.

GOTHMUND. Thine*

ATHELSTAN. Mine: by Right of War. --

GOTHMUND. Hence, prating Pedant!
Thou shall be frock'd, and mantled in the Garb
Worn by your Cell-bred Monks. -- By Right of War?
Do thou not see, what Thousands hemm me round,
Dreadful in crested Helms? These plead the Rights
Of GOTHMUND and of Denmark. Think thou, Briton,
We touched these Shores, to parley with our Slaves
In weak Contention? Violence is our Law.
The Sword is Valor's God: 'Twas thine this Morn:
And now it is GOTHMUND'S.

ATHELSTAN. Blush, Ingratitude!
What Sword but ATHELSTAN'S! -- Down, swelling Heart!
No! heavenly Powers! I dare not call you down,
In witness to my Wrongs! -- Yet this from thee! --
Oh thankless Dane!

GOTHMUND. Go, preach thy Follies, Christian,
To the obscure and coward Sons of Peace.
I wing a loftier Air; where Eagle-Glory
Soars high above Reproach. -- Fair THYRA'S mine.
More dear than half the Spoils of conquered Britain.
Thou never shall see her more.

ATHELSTAN. O stern Decree!
Yet hear me, GOTHMUND! -- Hear a Parent's Prayer! --

GOTHMUND. A Parent's Prayer!

ATHELSTAN. Yes: THYRA is my Child; now scarce restored
To the fond Wishes of her aged Father,
Till plunged in deeper Woe!

GOTHMUND. THYRA thy Child?
A thin Pretense! -- She was an infant Dane;
Snatched from a Wreck that sunk on England's Coast.

ATHELSTAN. That Wreck was rich with conquered MERCIA's Plunder.
My Child was there. Each speaking Circumstance,
The well-known Chain, the fatal Time, the Place,
All rising into Proof, proclaim her mine:
Mine, GOTHMUND, mine: The only Pledge of Love,
Her dying Mother left. -- Behold these Tears
That trickle down my Cheek. -- Oh think what Pangs
Must inly rend the Heart of ATHELSTAN,
Ere he could weep! -- Let gentle Pity then --

GOTHMUND. Pity! The Foe to every manly Deed!
The Bane of Victory: a timorous Child,
Scared at the gorgeous Pride and Pomp of War;
Fit, only fit, to rule a Woman's Breast!
Avaunt! -- I scorn its Cries! -- What! Mercia's Duke
Dissolved in Woman's Tears? --

ATHELSTAN. Yet, there are Times,
When Tears are brave and honest: Such are these:
Ennobled by Humanity and Love.
It Is Nature pleads within me: Scorn not, GOTHMUND,
Her generous Feelings! -- On some future Hour,
When Fate shall frown on Denmark; some dear Child,
Thy Soul's best Treasure, may be torn from thee!
Would thou not weep? Oh, timely wise, beware!
Nor heap an injured Father's Curses on thee!

GOTHMUND. Is this brave ATHELSTAN? Beneath whose Spear
Squadrons have sunk, unequal to its Rage?
The Warrior's sled. Hence, Dotard, hence: and take
The effeminate Staff and Spindle; best befitting
A Soul so like a Woman.

ATHELSTAN. Hell and Horror!
Pangs! choking Pangs! -- No -- burst not yet, my Heart;
Till I have reaped Revenge.

GOTHMUND. Revenge? old Man!
Hence, Traitor! -- seek for Vengeance where thou may.
Haste thee to ETHELRED: go tell thy King,
GOTHMUND has injured thee. --

ATHELSTAN. Rush down, ye Heavens!
Ye pitying Thunders, rivet me to Earth!
And save me from this Hell-hound's Voice, that shakes
My Frame to Dissolution!

GOTHMUND. Such Reward
Shall every Traitor find.

ATHELSTAN. Oh, I could tear these white Hairs from their Roots! --
Cursed be the Pine on which ye plough'd the Seas!
Cursed be the unhallowed Breeze that filled your Sails!
Cursed be the Tides that bore you to our Coast!
But doubly cursed am I, whose headlong Rage --
Yes; righteous Heaven! with Tears of burning Anguish,
I own thy Justice on me!

GOTHMUND. Hence, vile Rebel!
Hence, -- nor pollute my Camp. For know, that Treason
And prostituted Faith, like Strumpets vile,
The Slaves of Appetire, when Lust is sated, --
Are turned adrist to dwell with Infamy,
By those that used them.

ATHELSTAN. Oh, for my honest Sword! -- I burn, I burn!
And Hccla's Fires are here! -- The envenomed Shast
Drinks up my poisoned Spirit. -- Come, wild Fury!
Come with thy Blood-shot Eyes, and mad'ning Foam!
Oh, nerve me to the ten-fold Strength of Phrenzy!
That I may rend up Rocks and rooted Trees,
And hurl Destruction on him!

GOTHMUND. Quit my Tent:
Think thou, a Warrior crowned with Glory's Wreath
Can dread the Foam of headlong Rage? Or stand
Awed by the Phrenzy of a Madman's Brain!
Hence! vent thy Ravings to the stormy Seas:
They Will heed thee, more than I. --

ATHELSTAN. Yes: I will go. --
Thou think me helpless, friendless, and disarmed:
Yet shall thou rue my Wrongs. -- By Heaven I Will come
In Terror clad; more dreadful than the Pest
That walks in midnight Darkness. -- Yes: I Will go.
But, barbarous Dane! -- Take heed of my Return!

[Exit ATHELSTAN.] SCENE IV.
To him, DUNELM. GOTHMUND. Hoa, DUNELM!
Guard each Avenue of the Camp.
Forbid yon Traitor's Egress: If he attempt
To 'scape the Watch, arrest him: For his Heart
Labors with Ruin: He is false to Denmark. --
[Exit DUNELM.] Go, credulous Dotard! Could thy Folly hope
To win the Friendship of thy Country's Foe?
Even such, through every Age, shall be the Lot
Of British Blindness, when it aids Invasion:
The Slave of Conquest first; and then her Scorn:
The Scaffolding on which Ambition mounts;
Then spurns it to the Earth, a Refuse vile,
Fit for Contempt to tread on. -- Welcome, HAROLD,
Have seen our Captive EGBERT?

To him, HAROLD. HAROLD. Aye, my Lord.

GOTHMUND. Did thou declare my purposed Thought?

HAROLD. I did.

GOTHMUND. How did he meet it?

HAROLD. First, with frantic Rage
He shook his Chains, and cursed thee by his Gods.
I told him, Rage and frantic Banns were vain.
If he resigned fair THYRA to thy Arms,
(Since only He could win her to thy Wish)
Freedom was his. But if his stubborn Pride
Should thwart thy Will; Tomorrow's Breeze should waft him
To Chains, to Darkness, and the dreary Depth
Of Norway's mine: while she, imprisoned here,
The Vassal of Desire, should sat thy Wish.

GOTHMUND. Did not the threatened Vengeance bend his Pride?

HAROLD. A sullen Pause took Place. His fixed Eyes
Devoured the Ground: as if some mighty Thought
Labored within him; and to secret Council
Called inward every Power; that for a while
Each idle Sense stood vacant.

GOTHMUND. What ensued?
That Pause from Rage did, sure, bespeak Consent.

HAROLD. It did. Yet with evading Speech he answered,
Cannot thy General wait some happier Hour,
When Time has healed her Woes? -- On that, I told him,
Unconquerable Passion swelled thy Breast;
He might as soon control the Tides, impelled
By yon fair Planet's Influence. --

GOTHMUND. Aye: though Storms,
And raging Seas conspired with every Orb,
To drown the lofty Shore!

HAROLD. Such was my Hint. --
He said, the burning Blush would stain his Cheek,
Should the surrounding Guard that led him to her,
Witness his Shame: I gave him fixed Assurance,
That my Command should keep the Guard at Distance:
While he, admitted to her lonely Tent,
Unheard should plead his Life, and GOTHMUND's Love.
On this, he gave Consent. --

GOTHMUND. Then haste thee, HAROLD.
Bid GOODWIN lead the Captive to his Wife:
See him recalled: That done, draw off thy Guard
To a more distant Station from her Tent.
For ere the Noon of Night, on Passion's Wing
I Will fly, to celebrate the Rites of Love.
Yet wear a watchful Eye, intent though distant:
Happily, he means to wile her from our Camp.

HAROLD. My Life shall answer it. --

GOTHMUND. At length she is mine.
Deceit has colored over my bold Attempt.
Now, fiery ATHELSTAN, go curse thy Folly:
Rave to the Winds and Seas, and rend the Air
With twice their Clamor! -- Farewell, valiant HAROLD:
Speed my Resolve: I Will to my inner Tent.

[Exit GOTHMUND. HAROLD. Now, Vengeance, thou art mine! -- Unthankful GOTHMUND!
To pay my honest and deep-printed Scars
With vile Neglect! -- Go, headlong Fool of Passion!
Whose flattering Whisper could alone infuse
This Dream of Hope, that EGBERT ever shall stoop
To gather Life from Shame! -- Yes, he shall go:
Yet not to mould her into vile Compliance,
But arm her fainting Virtue with new Strength,
Equal to this dread Conflict. -- Yet, lest Fear,
Or Woman's Weakness sink beneath the Trial,
A better Hope remains: -- MERCIA's brave Duke: --
Yes, injured ATHELSTAN! Thy Arm shall be
The dark and fearless Minister of Fate;
And give me deep Revenge.

[Exit HAROLD. SCENE V.
Changes to the open Camp. DUNELM. ATHELSTAN, following. ATHELSTAN. Yet hear
me, DUNELM!
For Pity's sake, relent.

DUNELM. Peace, clamorous Tongue!

ATHELSTAN. What! shall your Guards spurn me with Insolence?
Your barbarous Camp imprison me?

DUNELM. No more.
Within this Mound, the General's Voice is Law.

ATHELSTAN. She is my Child! Art thou, too, deaf to Mercy?

DUNELM. Vex me not, Briton!

ATHELSTAN. But release my Daughter! --
Give me my Child, and let me quit your Camp, --
My Dukedom's Wealth is thine!

DUNELM. Thy Dukedom's Wealth?
Vain Man! Thy Power is swallowed up in Conquest:
Thy Titles vanished with thy Country's Freedom:
Thy boasted Wealth is fled to Denmark's Shore:
Thy Palace doomed for Danes to riot in.
Peace then: and thank our Bounty, that we leave thee
Life, and the general Air. --

[Exit DUNELM. ATHELSTAN. Oh merciless!
Yet, righteous Powers! what Claim have I to Mercy!
Did I show Mercy, on this fatal Morn,
To my poor bleeding Country; when this Arm
Made Widows childless! -- Dare thou then, bold Wretch,
Dare thou against the afflicting Hand of Heaven
To rise, and plead for Mercy! -- Rather bow thee
Low in the Dust! -- Yes, thou shall be my Bed,
[Throws himself (...) the Ground. Cold Earth! Here will I lie, till Anguish
end me!
Now rise, ye Ghosts of my wronged Countrymen!
Ye Specter pale, rise with your gaping Wounds,
And hideous Yell! -- Bring with you dire Despair
From the dread Caverns of eternal Night,
Where deep she dwells with agonizing Groans,
And sleepless Terrors! Rise, arrayed in Blood!
Plant round your Horrors! 'till affrighted Reason
Start from my Brain; and I, the Prey of Phrenzy,
Like the fierce Mountain-Wolf in Madness foaming,
Howl to the midnight Moon! --

SCENE VIII.
To him, HAROLD. HAROLD. 'Twas sure, the Voice
Of ATHELSTAN. -- What! prostrate on the Ground!
Art thou not ATHELSTAN?

ATHELSTAN. I am that Wretch
Which once was ATHELSTAN! Fair England's Boast,
I reared my Head in Honor: now behold me
Low-level'd with the Earth; a hideous Ruin;
Where, 'midst the Desolations of my Soul,
Despair and Anguish dwell!

HAROLD. What heavy Woe
Has weighed thee to the Dust? -- Speak, valiant Duke. --

ATHELSTAN. Whoever thou art, Oh leave me to my Pangs!
If you are a Dane; know, I detest and curse thee.
If you are a Briton, waste not generous Pity,
But pour thy Curse on Me! --

HAROLD. Know thou not HAROLD?

ATHELSTAN. HAROLD? My Woes had swallowed all Attention:
Indeed, I knew thee not.

HAROLD. Why this Despair?

ATHELSTAN. Alas, my Child, my Child! -- But you are a Dane,
And know not Pity!

HAROLD. Hapless ATHELSTAN!
The Color of thy Grief indeed is deep:
Thou know not half thy Woes!

ATHELSTAN. Thy Words are dark. --
Oh my prophetic Soul! -- I dare not ask thee. --
But if thou bear a Tale, with Horrors fraught,
Which Pity dreads to tell; -- In Mercy kill me:
Strike deep thy friendly Sword into my Breast;
For I am robbed of Mine! -- My injured Daughter! --
Is it not so?

HAROLD. The fatal Hour approaches.
For ere the Night has won the Vault of Heaven,
GOTHMUND, resolved on impious Violation,
Will plunge her in Dishonor.

ATHELSTAN. Plagues and Palsy,
Disease and Pestilence consume the Robber,
Infect his Blood, and wither every Power! --
Oh HAROLD! why, -- why did thou pierce my Soul
With this heartbreaking Tale! -- I knew it not: --
Blast him, ye Fiends! -- Why sleeps thy Thunder, Heaven!

HAROLD. Know, that Heaven's Thunder sleeps not.

ATHELSTAN. Say thou, Dane?

HAROLD. Heaven's Thunder sleeps not, if thou dare to wield it.
[Rising.
ATHELSTAN. By Heaven, I dare. Where is the flaming Bolt?
I Will hurl it on him, though with dire Rebound
It strike me to the Center!

HAROLD. Fear not, ATHELSTAN.
Behold it here. --
[He draws a Dagger.
ATHELSTAN. A Dagger! Let me grasp it! --
[He takes the Dagger. Oh precious Gift; more precious than the Plank
Thrown to the drowning Wretch! -- I Will to his Tent,
And plunge it in his Heart!

HAROLD. Curb thy fell Rage.
I Will give thee safer Vengeance.

ATHELSTAN. Generous HAROLD! --
I know the Wrongs thou bear from GOTHMUND's Pride. --
Where? -- when? -- Oh speed thee; for my Soul's on Fire!

HAROLD. Know then, I rule the nightly Watch that Guards
Devoted THYRA's Tent.

ATHELSTAN. Indeed!

HAROLD. The Files,
At my Command, shall move to such due Distance,
That by a secret Path I Will give thee Entrance.
Then, when the midnight Spoiler comes --

ATHELSTAN. Oh Vengeance! --
By Heaven, his mangled Arteries shall spout
Fountains of Blood!

HAROLD. Yet, lest Suspicion wake,
To intercept thy Entrance, or thy Flight --

ATHELSTAN. Oh, for some Dane's Disguise!

HAROLD. I will array thee
In Safety's Garb: Will thou be plumed like GOTHMUND?

ATHELSTAN. Yes: for Revenge, I Will wear the Shape of GOTHMUND,
Or any Fiend in Hell.

HAROLD. Come on, brave Duke.
I will prepare thee for the mortal Conflict.
Fate crown thy Wish! GOTHMUND has injured me.

ATHELSTAN. Yet, weighed with mine, thy Injuries are light:
Mine sink the groaning Scale!

HAROLD. The more befits thee
That mortal Weapon.

ATHELSTAN. Yes: Revenge shall thank
Thy honest Hand, which gave it: And thou, HAROLD,
Shall thank my brave Revenge. -- Come, valiant Dane,
We'll roam the midnight Camp, like prowling Wolves,
Trooping in quest of Blood! Now, injured Nature,
Brace my old Arm! Oh touch this deadly Steel
With more than Aconite! Give it the Speed,
And fiery Stroke of Lightning, when it shoots
Through the dun Sphere of Night; too swift for Thought,
Or Fear, or slow Defense! -- Now ruthless GOTHMUND!
Vengeance awaked shall slake her Thirst in Blood;
And Justice, riding on the raven Wing
Of midnight Darkness, wrapped in clouded Wrath,
Comes like avenging Heaven!

End of the FOURTH ACT.
ACT V.
SCENE I.
A grove, by THYRA's Tent. EGBERT, GOODWIN. GOODWIN. BEHOLD the Path, which
leads to THYRA's Tent:
This Grove, through which the Moon scarce throws her Beam;
Well suits thy purposed Privacy. -- The Guards,
Which late closed round the Tent, by HAROLD's Order
Have left this Entrance free.

EGBERT. The Path is dark: Nor can I aught descry,
Save the faint Glimmering of a distant Lamp,
That lights the inner Tent. Is this dark Path
The sole Approach?

GOODWIN. It is. -- But if thy Purpose
Be undivulged Secresy of Converse,
Call forth thy THYRA to this ample Round,
Where neither Ear can hear, nor Tongue betray thee:
The distant Guard here circles round the Wood:
But on yon opposite Side, the Sentinels
Hemm in the Tent, a close compacted Body:
No Whisper can escape their watchful Ear. --

EGBERT. It Is well: I Will call her hither. Leave me, GOODWIN:
So HAROLD gave Command. Her Weal and mine
Hang on the Purport of my Thought; which asks
Her private Ear.

GOODWIN. I leave thee to thy Wishes.

[Exit GOODWIN. EGBERT. Where is my Wife! -- Come forth, thou innocent Lamb,
To Slaughter doomed! -- Oh speed thee; for even now
The bloody Tiger, eyes thee in the Fold!
Will thou not hear the Shepherd's friendly Voice,
That warns thee from thy Foe? -- THYRA -- dear THYRA! --
It is thy EGBERT calls! --

SCENE II.
To him, THYRA, EDWINA. THYRA. My Lord! my EGBERT!
Do I once more behold thee! Oh, my Lord!
Unutterable Woe! --
[She bursts into Tears.
EGBERT. [Embracing her. Thou Sum of all my Wishes!
My Soul's far dearer Part! -- Yes, I will mix
My Tears with Thine: Thy Wrongs demand them all!

THYRA. Undone! undone! -- Oh EGBERT! --

EGBERT. Dearest THYRA!
EGBERT would die, to save thee!

THYRA. I know, thou would.
Is there no means of Rescue?

EGBERT. None, my Love.
This Grove is hemmed round by a Guard of Danes,
Who own no Law, save cruel GOTHMUND's Will;
Whose Bosom, sacred Pity never touched
With soft Compunction; nor for other's Woe
Called forth the generous Tear.

THYRA. Oh, I am lost!
Ye Saints and Angels, Ministers of Grace!
If ye do waft the Prayers of Innocence
Up to the Throne of Mercy, hear me now!
Oh, from your Mansions of unclouded Bliss,
Let Heaven send down your Sister-Angel, PITY;
And melt his Heart's fell Purpose!

EGBERT. Hope not Pity!
In vain thy Father (for I have heard thy Story)
With Tears and Grief's Entreaty strove to melt him.
He spurned him with Disdain. -- But when I tell
The Tale of Shame, that heaves my throbbing Breast! --
Oh THYRA! hide my Blush!

THYRA. What mean thy Words?
Can Fate yet swell the Number of our Woes?

EGBERT. Think thou that EGBERT, for a Life of Shame,
Would sell thee to Dishonor?

THYRA. Heaven forbid!

EGBERT. On that infernal Errand am I come.
So GOTHMUND wills. -- Why do thou turn thee from me?

THYRA. Am I betrayed by EGBERT? -- Gracious Heaven,
Be thou my Help! If EGBERT has proved false,
All human Faith is vain!

EGBERT. Thou Heaven of Love!
Thy Virtue charms me! -- On this Task of Shame
GOTHMUND indeed has sent me. -- Virtuous THYRA,
Far distant is my Purpose. Think not EGBERT
Would vilely purchase Life. -- But oh, my Love,
Thy fatal Hour comes on! Even now, the Ruffian,
With lustful Rage and fierce Impatience flown,
Prepares him for thy Tent!

THYRA. Is there not Hope,
That England's Power, beneath the Veil of Night,
May storm this guilty Camp, and give us Freedom?

EGBERT. Heaven speed their Valor! But, alas! -- that Hope
Too late shall visit Thee! -- Even now he comes,
To rob this sacred Temple, where pure Chastity
And Honor long have dwelt!

THYRA. Oh fatal Tidings!
Will thou not stay, to save me?

EGBERT. Dearest THYRA!
The unrelenting Guard that brought me hither,
Even now expects, and soon shall tear me from thee!

THYRA. Oh Horror!

EGBERT. Now, my THYRA, arm thy Heart
With manly Strength: drive all the Woman thence.
See thou this deadly Steel?
[He draws a dagger.
THYRA. Oh welcome, welcome!
Thy Looks are dreadful, and I read thy Purpose.
If it is the Messenger of honest Death,
Behold my Breast! I Will bless the friendly Stroke;
And bless Thee for this last, most generous Proof
Of Faith and Love sincere!

EGBERT. Yes! I have read
Of a stern Father, who, severely kind,
And deaf to struggling Nature's loud Appeal,
Shed his dear Daughter's innocent Blood, to save her
From an Invader's Lust: -- A juster Purpose
Glows in my Breast -- Why should the Brave and Good
Fall self-devoted? -- Let the guilty Heart
Bleed for its Crimes. Then take this honest Dagger:
And when the Robber comes, with dauntless Arm
Plunge it into his Heart.

THYRA. Alas, my Lord!

EGBERT. What? does the treacherous Blood forsake thy Cheek?
Thou who, unmoved, coud'st dare it is deadly Point,
Not dare inflict the Blow! Thou lovely Weakness!
Courage with Softness joined! -- O sweet Perfection!
Yet must thou strike! -- Oh think, how future Times,
Ages unborn, shall belss thy friendly Hand!
How the chaste Praise of Matron-Tongues shall saint thee,
And wondering Babes, rescued from Slav'ry's Woe
By this brave Deed, shall lisp my THYRA's Name!

THYRA. What, stain my Hand with Murder! Heaven forbid!

EGBERT. Blaspheme not Justice. -- What! when you are pursued
Even to Perdition's Brink; shall thou not turn,
And slay the fell Destroyer?

THYRA. Oh, my Heart!
Alas, my Arm is weak! I am unpracticed
In Deeds of Blood! It Is terrible to think!
What then, to do! -- When I should strike, the Dagger
Would faulter in my Hand!

EGBERT. Let Danger rowze thee;
Fear make thee bold. -- Even now the Spoiler comes!

THYRA. [catching him. Oh save me, EGBERT!

EGBERT. Hark! the Guard requires me!
I must be gone. --

THYRA. No, we will never part.

EGBERT. We must! we must! -- Hark! GOODWIN calls again.
Another Moment brings Destruction on thee.
Speed thy Resolves -- Farewell! --
[Going.
THYRA. Oh horrible!
Give me the Dagger!
[She takes the Dagger.
EGBERT. Angels strengthen thee!
Now, prove thee worthy of a Briton's Love.
By one brave Blow, redeem thyself from Shame;
Thy EGBERT from the Depth of poisoned Dungeons;
Thy groaning Country from the Scourge of Denmark!
Retire: he will seek thee in the inner Tent;
And when he comes; -- Oh Heaven direct her Hand!

[Exit EGBERT. THYRA. Farewell, my honored Lord! -- Here am I left,
With not a Friend to aid, but this dire Weapon!
Now, pitying Heaven, protect me! -- Hark! what Noise! --
In every Sound I hear the Ravisher! --
How dreadful Silence, at the Dead of Night!
Pregnant with Horrors! -- Oh, thou fatal Weapon,
Dark Minister of Death! Often have thou armed
The Assassin's Hand with Fate! This once befriend
Despairing Innocence. --
Come, Matron-Courage! Thou who did inspire
The brave Bethulian; and with dauntless Step,
Did lead her to the proud Assyrian's Tent!
Now aid my trembling Hand! Teach me, like her,
Fearless to strike where Justice points the Blow!
That when he comes, This may revenge our Wrongs,
And set my Country free. --
[She puts up the Dagger.
EDWINA. Hark! -- did not hear
The Tread of Feet, as rustling through the Grove? --

SCENE III.
To them HAROLD, ATHELSTAN, on the opposite Side of the Stage. THYRA. [Aside to
EDWINA. Oh, blasting to mine Eyes! The Robber comes!
Clad in his gorgeous Plume!

EDWINA. Retire we hither,
[They retire to the farthest part of the Stage. Till he has gained the Tent.

[To ATHELSTAN. HAROLD. This Way, brave Friend. --

ATHELSTAN. Soft! -- lest the Guard
O'erhear us -- Prosperously we have eluded
The unsuspecting Watch. -- I dread the Sound
Of my own Footsteps. -- Lead me, generous HAROLD,
Where I may lurk unseen. --

HAROLD. Through that blind Path,
He must approach her Tent. It Is formed for Ambush:
Dark as his purposed Deed. Go, hide thee there. --
And when he comes -- For ever a Minute's Round
He means to come --

ATHELSTAN. [Draws a Dagger. Now GOTHMUND, Fate draws near. --
Down, throbbing Heart! Thou shall have speedy Vengeance!
HAROLD; all Thanks are poor! --

[Athelstan enters the Tent. HAROLD. [Aloud to ATHELSTAN. Hold thy Resolve;
And Fate shall crown thy Wish. --

[Exit HAROLD. THYRA. [Advancing. Oh, dreadful Sounds,
To which, the Midnight Thunder's Voice were mild!
"Hold thy Resolve, and Fate shall crown thy Wish!" --
Then I am lost! -- EDWINA, let us fly, --
Rush through these Woods, and trust his merciless Guards:
They may have Pity!

EDWINA. Rather, linger not.
Pursue the Robber through that gloomy Path:
Its Darkness aids thy Purpose. Haste thee, haste thee:
This Moment's thine: The next, perhaps, is GOTHMUND'S.

THYRA. [Drawing the Dagger. Then, Heaven assist me! -- Oh, thou treacherous
Arm,
Why do thou tremble thus! -- What mean these Horrors,
That freeze my Blood! -- Did I not hear a Voice? --
With hollow Groans, it cried, "Hold, hold thy Hand!" --
Insernal Fiends, why do you thus beset me?
Hence, bloody Specter, nor afflict my Sense:
Go, glare on Guilt: for I am innocent! --
Avaunt, false Terrors! -- Now be firm, my Heart!
Oh, my revolting Hand! -- I dare not strike. --
Hence, feminine Fear! -- The Coward turns to Valor,
When goaded by Despair! --

[She enters the Passage. EDWINA. Heaven guide her Dagger,
And bury it in his Heart! --

ATHELSTAN. [Within. Oh Treachery!
Die, Villain, die!

EDWINA. Ye blessed Powers, protect her!

ATHELSTAN. [Entering with his Dagger bloody. Whoever thou art, false Dane,
I bear thy Lifeblood on my Dagger's Hilt.

EDWINA. Who? ATHELSTAN! -- What Blood? -- I fear, I fear!

ATHELSTAN. If Fate be just, it is GOTHMUND's. -- Where Is my Child?

EDWINA. Oh, could eternal Darkness bury Her,
Or bury Thee! Or Thunder strike thee dead;
And save thee from that killing Sight, which soon
Shall turn thee into Horror, -- thou were happy! --
For thou have done a Deed --

[She enters the Passage Within. THYRA. I bleed! I die! --
EDWINA! EDWINA! --

ATHELSTAN. Chained down by Terror,
I wait the Bolt of Fate! -- That Voice of Death,
Dreadful as Lightning from the Midnight Cloud,
Has cleft my Brain! -- Nor ever did the Flames
Of Hell discover, to the hopeless Damned,
A Glympse of deeper Horror! -- Where Is my Child! --
Oh Torture, Torture!

To him EDWINA, leading THYRA wounded and fainting. THYRA. Help me! -- Oh! my
Father! --

ATHELSTAN. Oh Heaven and Earth! Death! Murder! Parricide!
[She falls: he throws himself on the Ground by her. Speak, EMMA, speak! How is
it with thee?

THYRA. Oh! --

ATHELSTAN. [Rising and traversing the Stage. Can thou not speak? -- Hoa!
help! she bleeds to Death!
No Friend to help! -- hear me, ye barbarous Danes!
Behold a Sight, shall make the flinty Heart
Of savage Power weep Blood! -- My Child! my Child! --
'Twas I that killed thee!
[Kneels over her.
THYRA. Can thou ever forgive --

ATHELSTAN. Forgive! Forgive!

THYRA. My parricidal Hand,
That aimed an impious Blow. -- Content I die:
Yes gladly yield my Life: pleased to have 'scap'd
A Fate more dreadful; had my guilty Arm
Shed my dear Father's Blood!

ATHELSTAN. Oh Scorpion Stings!
Thou dear expiring Saint! What! ask Forgiveness
Of him who murdered thee! She faints, she faints!
Oh tell thy Murderer, tell thy wretched Father, --
Leave me not to Distraction, -- tell me, tell me,
Thou do forgive my Crime!

THYRA. Witness, ye Powers,
How I forgive! Kind Heaven, assuage his Pangs! --
Oh EGBERT! must I never more behold thee!
Bid my dear Lord remember me -- Alas!
My swimming Eyes grow dark! -- Where is my Father! --
Where is my Husband! -- lay me down in Peace!
Oh Heaven receive my Soul --

[She dies. ATHELSTAN. She Is dead! she is dead!
Stay, blessed Saint! hover awhile in Air,
And take thy lost, thy wretched Father with thee! --
That never must be! For she is fled to Heaven,
Where Peace and Virtue dwell! Where Guilt and Treason,
Murder and Parricide, must never come!
Open, thou Earth! Oh, drag me down, ye Fiends,
To endless Anguish! Heap the sulfurous Torture
On my accursed Head! Exhaust the Stores
Of heavenly Wrath awaked! Yet weak will be
Your fiercest Vengeance, to that inward Hell
That Rages here --

[Strikes his Breast, and throws himself on the Body. SCENE VII.
To him SIWARD and Officers. SIWARD. Hoa, ATHELSTAN, where art thou?
The King has stormed the Camp: the Danes are flying:
England again is free.

ATHELSTAN. Too late -- Oh, Oh! --

SIWARD. What means this Scene of Blood! -- Ah! THYRA slain! --

ATHELSTAN. Behold the Work of this accursed Hand!
Lo, where she lies! -- A dark and fatal Error
With sacrilegious Fury armed the Father
Against his blameless Child!

SIWARD. Oh Sight of Woe!
Poor bleeding Innocence! -- Let honest Vengeance
Rowze thee from Grief. To fire thy Soul to Conquest,
I hasted through the Camp; and left the Field,
Where valiant EGBERT, freed from Denmark's Chain,
Has buried deep his Sword in GOTHMUND's Heart,
And leads thy Mercians, clad in gloomy Terror,
Over Heaps of slaughtered Danes! -- Rise, valiant Duke;
Rise from this Trance of Woe! The Danes are flying.

ATHELSTAN. Oh never, never will I rise from hence! --
Go, tell thy injured King, that ATHELSTAN,
Wounded by Penitence, wept his Wrongs in Blood!
Tell him, thou saw me leaning over my Child,
Raving in Pangs of Horror and Despair,
A Sight to melt stern Justice into Tears! --
Oh tell him, SIWARD, hapless ATHELSTAN
Though guilty, yet not vile, self-punish'd fell! --
Now die and be at Peace! -- Now traitorous Heart,
Receive thy just Reward!

[He raises his Arm to stab himself, they prevent him. SIWARD. Prevent his Fury,

ATHELSTAN. [Struggling. Off -- nor tempt your Fate! --
Dreadful is armed Rage, that pants for Death;
By Ills exasperated; -- Such is mine;
Made fatal by Despair! -- Then shun my Fury!
My Dagger thirsts but for my own Life Blood:
Why must it rush on yours! -- Too much, too much,
My murderous Hand has spilt! -- Oh EMMA, EMMA!

[He sinks and drops the Dagger. SIWARD. Support and raise him. -- Hear me,
ATHELSTAN!
Hear Friendship's Voice! -- It is thy SIWARD calls. --
His Cheek turns pale. -- Alas, my generous Friend,
How are thy Virtues lost! --

ATHELSTAN. Oh dire Event!
Was it for this, thy dear, thy virtuous Mother
Endured the Childbed Pang! Was it for this,
She fostered thee at her chaste Matron-Breast!
And, in the Fondness of parental Hope,
Styled thee the Joy of our declining Years! --
Oh fatal, fatal Blow!

SIWARD. Lift up thine Eyes!
In Pity to thy weeping SIWARD, speak!
Hear, generous ATHELSTAN!

OFFICER. He heeds thee not.

ATHELSTAN. Thus to be slaughtered by thy Father's Hand!
My EMMA -- Oh, my Child!

SIWARD. An agonizing Sweat
Sits on his Brow: The Hand of Death is on him.

ATHELSTAN. Oh! Oh! Oh!

[Dies. SIWARD. He dies! he dies! -- His strong conflicting Griefs
Have burst his mighty Heart! -- Oh, ATHELSTAN!
Thy Friends shall weep, and every generous Foe,
Confess thy Virtues, and lament thy Fate!
Had thou been true! what brighter Name had decked
Thy Country's Story! But thy towering Spirit,
Deep-shaken by the Tempest of Revenge,
From its Uprightness tottering, bore thee down
Even to Perdition's Depth -- Yet may the Woes
Which Heaven's avenging Hand has heaped upon thee
Recorded stand, a Monument of Justice!
That when in future Times a King shall reign,
Brave, good, and just, the Father of his People,
The abhorred Example may avert those Ills
Thy traitrous Arm has wrought -- That black Rebellion
May never rear her Standard; nor unsheath
Her guilty Sword, to aid the fell Invader!
That Faction's Sons in thee their Fate may read;
That by the Father's Crime the Child shall bleed,
And private Woe to public Guilt succeed.

End of the FIFTH ACT.
EPILOGUE,
Written by Mr. GARRICK,
Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER. To speak Ten Words, again I Have fetched my Breath;
The Tongue of Woman struggles hard with Death.
Ten Words! will that suffice? Ten Words -- no more.
We always give a Thousand to the Score.
What can provoke these Wits their Time to waste,
To please that fickle, fleeting Thing called Taste?
It mocks all Search, for Substance has it none;
Like Hamlet's Ghost -- It Is here -- It Is there -- It Is gone.
How very few about the Stage agree!
As Men with different Eyes a Beauty see,
So judge they of that stately Dame -- Queen-Tragedy.
The Greek-read Critic, as his Mistress holds her,
And having little Love, for Trifles scolds her:
Excuses want of Spirit, Beauty, Grace,
But never forgives her failing -- Time, and Place.
How do our Sex of Taste in Judgment vary?
Miss Bell adores, what is loathed by Lady Mary:
The first in Tenderness a very Dove,
Melts like the feathered Snow, at Juliet's Love:
Then, sighing, turns to Romeo by her Side,
"Can you believe that Men for Love have died?"
Her Ladyship, who vaults the Coarser's Back,
Leaps the barred Gate, and calls you Tom and Jack;
Detests these Whinings, like a true Virago;
She Is all for Daggers! Blood! Blood! Blood! Iago!
A third, whose Heart defies all Perturbations,
Yet dies for Triumphs, Funerals, Coronations!
Never asks which Tragedies succeed, or fail,
But whose Procession has the longest Tail.
The Youths, to whom France gives a new Belief,
Who look with Horror on a Rump of Beef:
On Shakespeare's Plays, with shrugg'd up Shoulders stare,
These Plays? They Are bloody Murders, -- O Barbare!
And yet the Man has Merit -- Enter Nous,
He Would been damned clever, had he read Bossu.
Shakespeare read French! roars out a surly Cit:
When Shakespeare wrote, our Valor matched our Wit:
Had Britons then been Fops, Queen Bess had hanged 'em;
Those Days, they never read the French, -- They band'd 'em.
If Taste evaporates by too high Breeding,
And eke is overlaid, by too deep Reading;
Lest then in search of this, you lose your Feeling,
And barter native Sense in foreign Dealing;
Be this neglected Truth to Britons known,
No Tastes, no Modes become you, but your own.
