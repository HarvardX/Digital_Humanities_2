Performed at the THEATER ROYAL in Covent Garden. Altered from the Original
Italian of Signor CARINI. Set to MUSIC By Mr. JOHN-FREDERICK LAMP.

The SECOND EDITION, with Additions.

LONDON: Printed for J. SHUCKBURGH, at the Sun near the Inner-Temple-Gate in
Fleet Street, 1738. (Price Sixpence.)

The ARGUMENT.
MAUXALINDA, enraged at the Falsehood of MOORE, retires disconsolate to a
Desert, unable to bear the Triumphs of her Rival MARGERY (now Lady MOORE) who
from the meekest of Creatures, is so elevated with her present Grandeur, that
she becomes a very Virago, a worse Plague than the Dragon; and leads her
Husband such a confounded Life, that he runs away from her on the very
Wedding-Night, and flies, for Quiet-sake, to the Desert; where meeting with
MAUXALINDA. they renew their former Loves, and grow fonder than ever. Lady
MOORE pursues them with the utmost Fury, surprises them in the beight of their
Endearments, and sends MAUXALINDA to Prison. MOORE makes a second Elopement,
and sends GUBBINS to release MAUXALINDA; which being done, GUBBINS, who has
long loved her in secret, courts her, and gains her Consent. MOORE wants to
renew his former Acquaintance with MAUXALINDA, but is repulsed by her, and
furiously attacked by his Lady: After a smart Scolding-Bout they make it up:
MOORE is friends with his Lady; GUBBINS is married to MAUXALINDA; and the Opera
concludes, according to the Custom of all Operas, with the general
Reconciliation of all Parties, no matter how absurd, improbable, or ridiculous.

Exeunt. SCENE II. A Desert.
MAUXALINDA sola. From Moore, and my too happy Rival flown,
Poor Mauxalinda wanders here alone.
Their Bridal Joys are worse than Death to me.
Alas! how cruel is my Destiny!
AIR.
The Swain I adore has undone me;
He wooed me until he had won me:
He courted me, sure, but to shun me,
And now from his Arms am I thrown.
Come Death, from Distraction relieve me,
Cold Earth to thy Bosom receive me;
Come thou who so basely could leave me,
And shed one kind Tear on my Stone.

Exit. SCENE III. Moore-Hall.
MOORE and his Lady, GUBBINS, Guests, etc. An Entertainment of Dancing; after
which, enter Herald, Pursuivants, etc. Herald. Most puissant Moore! Our
Sovereign Lord the King
Hearing your Fame, which far and near does ring,
Sends you this Token of his Royal Bounty,
Puts on a Golden Helmet. And makes you Lord Lieutenant of the County:
A Dragon passant guardant is your Arms.
And hearing of your Consort's peerless Charms,
Invites to Court both you and Lady Moore,
Where he has farther Honors yet in store.

Moore. My kind Love to his Majesty, I pray:
We'll just keep Honey-moon, and then away.

Exit Herald, etc. Moore. How comes it Mauxalinda is not here,
Surveying the Company. To grace our Nuptials, and partake our Cheer?

Lady. Methinks, in Manners, you might longer stay;
Cannot you forget her on your Wedding Day?
Ungrateful, --

Gub. -- Daughter, set your Fears aside,
For Mauxalinda, mad with Rage and Pride;
Has, in a Hurry, packed up all her Things,
Her Clothes, her Money, nay, her three Gold Rings,
And went away this Morning by the Carrier.

Moore. She Is a smart Girl, some Londoner may marry her,


AIR.
Thus the Damsel young and pretty,
Quits the Country with Disdain,
Takes a Trip to London City,
Nobler Conquests to obtain.
There she Prudes it so demurely,
And so well displays her Charms,
That some Townling, most securely,
She allures into her Arms.
Lady. All this is mere Contrivance and Deceit:
With half an Eye I can see through the Cheat.

AIR.
Go, Cuckoldly Cull,
Follow your Trull,
I Am not to be made such a Tool.
Sir Knight, I Am your Wife,
And, during my Life,
Your Worship shall find me no Fool.
Moore. I Am all Surprise! What means this sudden Change!
It Is wondrous odd!

Gub -- It Is more than odd, it is strange!

Moore. Speak to her, Sir --

Gub. -- Not I, upon my Life:
It Is dangerous meddling betwixt Man and Wife.

AIR.
Agree, agree;
If not, do you see,
As you fall out,
Fall in, for me.
Moore. Why is my dearest Dear so cross to me?
I would not be so to my Margery.

Lady. It might be Marg'ry Gubbins heretofore;
But now I Will make you know I Am Lady Moore.
Strutting.
Moore. Why so thou art: -- But yet I hope, my Dear,
Coaxing. If thou art Cap, I may be Button here.

Lady. You think you're Master now; but that will not do,
I tell you, I Will be Cap and Button too.

Moore. My Anger rises: -- Woman, have a care!

Lady. I scorn your Anger. -- Strike me if you dare!

AIR.
You! You! You!
Coxcomb! Blockhead! Numpskull! Nizey!
I defy you! I despise you!
Do! 'Do! Do! --
Exit Lady. Moore. Are these the Joys of Wedlock! This the Life
A Man must lead with an outrageous Wife?

Gub. Son! keep your Temper; -- Let her have her Way,
Brides know their Power on their Wedding Day.
The Joys they give us would be too complete,
Did not some Bitter mingle with the Sweet.
This is some female Flight, some jealous Fit.

Moore. You see, my Friends, how it is; -- I must submit.

AIR.
So Hercules of old,
The Valiant and the Bold,
Who made the fierce Giants and Monsters to rue,
Was forced to rock and reel,
And turn the Spinning-Wheel;
So much could a Woman his Passion subdue.
So Hercules, etc.
Exit. Gub. Farewell, Moore-Hall, thou art no Place for Stay:
O, Friends! this is a dismal Wedding Day!

Melancholy CHORUS.
Oh sad! oh strange!
Oh doleful Change!
Oh, etc.
Exeunt Omnes. ACT II.
SCENE I.
A Desert. MOORE solus. FArewell, Moore-Hall -- I now have broke my Chain,
I never more will darken thee again.
This Woman has a Spirit would scare the Devil;
Tigers and Wolves, compared to her, are civil.
Alas! what mighty Deeds have I to brag on?
I Am more afraid of her, than of the Dragon.
Sooner in Deserts with wild Beasts I Will dwell,
Than with that Wife, who makes my Home a Hell.

AIR.
Was ever Man so much deceived?
Can ever Woman be believed?
I thought my Love
a Turtle-Dove,
And dreamed of endless Charms;
But now I Have got,
O cursed Lot!
A Dragon to my Arms.
Was ever, etc.
Maux. Cruel Swain! --
Behind the Scenes.
Moore. What tender, plaintive Sounds invade my Ear?
Sure Melancholy's self inhabits here:
Approach, sweet Warbler! thou perhaps may be
Some easy cred'lous Wretch, deceived like me;
I Will not obstruct, but listen to thy Moan,
Then mingle, with thy soft Complaints, my own.
Retires to a Corner of the Stage. Enter MAUXALINDA.
AIR.
Cruel Swain, since you forsake me,
I Will to lonely Shades betake me,
Like the mournful Turtle-Dove:
While my Fondness you're disdaining,
Faithful still in soft complaining,
I Will lament my hapless Love.
Cruel Swain, etc.
Moore. My Mauxalinda! O transporting Sight!

Come to my Arms, thou Treasure of Delight.
Goes to embrace her, she flies back.
Maux. What new Device is this, to mock my Grief?
Experience now has banished all Belief.

Moore. I own my Crime; O pardon my Offense;
I Am all Consusion, Shame and Penitence.
Kneeling.
Maux. O Moore! I loved you as I did my Life --
I Would fain believe you, but you have got a Wife.

Moore. Oh! name her not. -- With thee, my Love, I Will fly
Far as the utmost Verge of Earth or Sky:
We'll traverse every Sea, and every Shore,
And never approach that hated Object more.

DUETTO.
Around the wide World we will wander,
Grow fonder, and fonder, and fonder;
We'll cuddle together,
To keep out the Weather,
And kiss the cold Winter away.
When Sol's sultry Heat does invade us,
Green Osiers and Willows shall shade us.
We'll chirrip and sing
Like Birds in the Spring,
And frolic it all the long Day.
Around, etc.
Exeunt. SCENE II. Gubbins 's House.
GUBBINS and Guests as from Drinking. 1st Guest. Thanks, noble Gubbins, for
this Night's Repast: --
I think we have fairly made it out at last.

Gub. But why so hasty, why so soon away?
Another Bottle will bring on the Day.

Enter Lady MOORE. Gub. What Is this I see? -- My Daughter! --
Say, my Dear!
What brings thee thus unseasonably here?
How could thou quit so soon the Bridal Bed?
Lady sighs. A Sigh too! Tell me, is thy Husband dead?

Lady. Oh! ten times worse!

Gub. -- How can that be?

Lady. -- He Is fled.

Gub. What! before Consummation?

Lady. Ay, to my great Vexation.

Gub. O Daughter, Daughter! if I right conjecture,
He ran away, to 'scape a Curtain-Lecture.

Lady. No, he has Mauxalinda in his Mind:
Now she is gone, he cannot stay behind.

AIR.
Wretched is a Wife's Condition,
When not Rage, or yet Submission,
Can reclaim her faithless Rover,
Or to Virtue bring him over.
When she sees her self neglected,
And her Rival more respected,
Oh! how great must be her Anguish!
Who can blame her then to languish. Wretched, etc.
Gub. He Is sadly off; for she, like thee, I fear,
May have a Tongue too many for his Ear.

Lady. Unhappy me! I came to be redrest,
And you, I see, make all my Wrongs your Jest:
But I Will, through all the Courts of Law pursue him;
I Will rumage Hell it self, but I Will undo him:
I Will issue out Reward by Proclamation,
And have him, if he is living in the Nation.

Exit. Gub. Well said, my Girl -- thy Mother's Daughter still;
She had a Tongue most exquisitely shrill.
Horn sounds. But hark! the jolly Huntsman's Horn
Gives Notice of approaching Morn:
Let Us lose no Moment of Delight,
But hunt all Day, as we have drank all Night.

AIR.
Come follow, brave Boys, to the Chase,
For Morning breaks on us apace;
The Fogs and the Mist disappear,
The Dawn is delightfully clear.
The Hounds are uncoupled, then have and away,
You Will lose all the Sport, if you longer delay.
What, what are your Opera's to me,
But Tweedlecum-Tweedlecum-twee:
No Music, that is under the Sky,
Can equal the Hounds at full Cry.
Then a Fig for Italians, their Squeak and their Squawl,
One true English Sportsman shall dumbfound 'em all.
Omnes, Hiddow, etc.

Exeunt. SCENE III. The Desert.
MOORE and MAUXALINDA embracing. DUETTO.
Maux. By these Arms, that round thee twine
Like the ever-circling Vine:
By this tender fond Embrace,
Nothing shall my Love efface.

Moore. By the Nectar, which I sip
From thy soft and ruby Lip,
Never, never will I leave thee,
Never, never more deceive thee.

Enter Lady MOORE with Constable, Guards, etc. and surprises 'em. Lady. So, so,
my pretty Turtles, are you there --
I Have caught you napping, as Moss caught his Mare.
Sir, that is your Prisoner --
To Constable. Take my Lady Stock,
To Maux. Make her beat Hemp, and chain her to the Block.
Mauxalinda is carried off; Moore strives to follow, but is prevented by his
Lady. For you, Sir Knight, come Home, and mind your Duty;
I Will teach you to run rambling after Beauty.

DUETTO.
Lady. O ungrateful! to deceive me,
Thus to rob me of Content.

Moore. O most hateful! leave me, leave me,
You my Anger but augment.

Lady. Faithless Traitor!

Moore. Plague of Nature!

Lady. Where Is your Conscience?

Moore. Curse your Nonsense!
Let me go, Let me go.
Struggling.
Lady. No, no, no; No, no, no.
O ungrateful, etc.

Exeunt. ACT III.
SCENE I.
GUBBINS 's House. GUBBINS and MOORE. Moore. OH, Sir! here is been a most
confounded Rout --
Mauxy's in Hold, and you must bring her out.
As she and I, like Turtles of a feather,
Were cooing in the Wilderness together,
My Lady came with Posse Comitatus,
And sent poor Mauxalinda to the Gate House.

Gub. I cannot bear she should a Prisoner be --
I Will tear the Jail down, but I Will set her free

Exit. MOORE solus. Was ever Man so hampered with a Wife?
Patience, ye Gods! but I am linked for Life:
The Knot's too fast, it is needless to complain;
I wish the Dragon were alive again.

AIR.
The Lion in Battle engaged,
When he fills all the Forest with Dread,
Is a Lamb to a Woman enraged,
If once Jealousy gets in her Head.
Her Soul's on a Ferment of Fury,
No soothing the Tempest can still;
She values no Law, Judge or Jury,
Her darling Revenge to fulfill.
Exit. SCENE II. A Prison.
MAUXALINDA in Chains. AIR.
O piercing Anguish!
O cruel Destiny!
Here must I languish
For Loss of Liberty.

Enter Lady Moore. So, Madam, -- How do you like your stately Lodging?
Is not this better than in Deserts dodging?

Maux. Madam, I see through all your saucy Sneer --
You may provoke my Scorn, but not my Fear.

Lady. Your boasted Courage I Am resolved to try.
Behold this Dagger, and prepare to die.
Draws a Dagger.
DUETTO.
Maux. Since you have robbed me of my Treasure,
Lise is now no more a Pleasure:
Death is welcome even from you.

Lady. Since you have robbed me of my Treasure,
In your Death is all my Pleasure:
Vengeance, Vengeance is my Due.

Enter Gubbins with Jailor and Guards. Daughter, forbear, and let your Fury
cease;
For know I Am come poor Mauxy to release.

Lady. My Father too my Foe! Patience is vain

Gub. Marg'ry thy Pride, I think, has turned thy Brain.

Lady. I Will be revenged --

Gub. -- Nay, if she makes a Riot,
To Jailor. Jailor, secure her, 'till she grows more quiet.

Ex. Gub. Maux. etc. Lady MOORE sola. This is enough to make a Woman mad --
I Will be revenged, if Vengeance can be had.

AIR.
Thus distracted, thus tormented,
Nothing shall my Rage delay;
Never will I rest contented
'Till my Vengeance makes it way.
Exit Lady. SCENE III. Gubbins's House.
MAUXALINDA and GUBBINS. Maux. This wondrous Goodness how can I repay!

Gub. Oh! you shall make it up another way.
Chucking her under the Chin. Sweet Mauxalinda, if you can forsake
All other Men for Gaffar Gubbins' sake,
And prove to him a true and faithful Wife,
With all I have I Will Jointure thee for Life.

AIR.
Mauxalinda thus admiring,
Does my Soul of Souls inslave;
For her Charm of Charms expiring,
See her fond Adorer crave.
Lady Moore over-hearing. Maux. Since they have deprived me of my dearest Knight,
Aside. I Will marry Gubbins merely out of Spite.
And when I Am Madam Marg'ry's Mother-in-Law,
By Jove, I Will keep her Ladyship in awe.

Turns to Gubbins, and sings. AIR.
Then come to my Arms, old Dad,
And fondle thine own dear Honey:
If Love is too late to be had,
Let Us make up the Loss with Money.
They Embrace. To them Lady MOORE. Lady. Why Father, what do you mean?

Gub. -- What Is that to you?
I Am old enough to know what it is I do.
Enter MOORE. O joyful Sight! my Mauxalinda freed!
Thanks noble Gubbins for this generous Deed:
O let me clasp thee to my Arms.

Runs to embrace her. Gubbins interposing. Gub. -- Not so --
She Is now My Mauxalinda, you must know.

Lady comes up to Moore. Lady. How can you bear the Loss of one so dear?

Moore. My Plague! my Bane! my Evil Genius here!

Lady. I come, Sir, a Wife my Right to claim?

Moore Of me you shall have nothing but the Name.
No Nuptial Kindness? --

Moore. -- Not one single Kiss.

Lady. Barbarian, did thou marry me for this?

Moore. Henceforth no Husband hope to find of me,
'Till you more gentle and submissive be.
Beneath one Roof, with each a separate Bed,
We'll live polite -- and wish each other dead.
Lady aside. To Moore. O, Sir! your Looks, your Words have riv'd my Heart --
No other Punishment, but Beds to part? --
See at your Feet, your Pardon I implore;
I never will provoke your Anger more.

Moore. What Farce is this! --

Lady. -- No Farce, my dearest Life,
But a Converted and Obedient Wife.

AIR.
Never, never I Will offend you,
Or your warm Resentment dare.
Ever, ever I Will attend you,
Your Content shall crown my Care.
Moore. Come to my Arms, thou Treasure of my Life,
Henceforth my best beloved, and dearest Wife.

DUETTO.
O happy Transformation!
O sweet Reconciliation!
O joyous blessed Event!
Moore. And now, my Marg'ry, may thou ever be
Embracing Lady Moore. As kind to Moore, as he is fond of thee.

Maux. I wish you Joy, Sir! May she ever be
As true to you -- as you have been to me.
Aside.
Gub. Why now all is right. -- Call all the Country in;
Keep Open-House, and let the Sports begin.

An Entertainment of Dancing; afterward Moore comes forward. Moore. Henceforth
let Discord and Dissension cease,
While we all live in Harmony and Peace.

Gub. And have of Wealth and Children great Increase.

CHORUS.
Strain your Voices, crack your Strings;
He sings best, who loudest sings.
Blow your Cheeks of Sound away,
This most Glorious Holiday.
