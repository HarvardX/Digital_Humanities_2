PROLOGUE.
TELL me, ye matchless Fair! Ye fearless Brave!
Is there one Briton -- born to be a Slave?
No. -- While your Prince half Europe's Ri^hts maintains,
Nor Souls, nor Bodies, here, can stoop to Chains.
Angels, and Englishmen, like Homage, pay:
Bow, but, from Love, -- and, but by Choice obey:
I oyal, to keason's Rights, not Slavery's Awe,
The Sons of Freedom serve the Kings, of Law.
Act, with no Clogs on Sense, no Clouds on Art,
But let in Truth's whole Light, to hear the Heart.
Such, once, was Rome-to Strength, not Luxury, trained:
Then Liberty was Hers, and Virtue reigned:
Safe, in her own felt Power, and bluntly brave,
She scorned alike to be -- or make -- a Slave.
No puny Popeling, yet, Man's Birthright Stole:
Foe, to the invaded Empire -- of the SOUL!
Plain, prideless Rule bound short Ambition's Plea:
But left Thought, Art, Faith, Hope, and Conscience free.
Far other Fame was hers, when Church-craft reigned,
Then, every Cherub's Face, with Gall, was stained:
Sweet-ey'd Religion, sow'rd, by priestly Leaven,
Frowned on pale Peace -- and shook her Keys at Heaven.
More than her Maker's Rights, She found too small,
And murmured, that his Grants could give -- but ALL.
Wil'd, Inconsistent, Blasphemous, and Vain,
Reversed God's Laws -- to propogate his Reign!
Her Creeds taught Curses. -- Her proud Schools Debate
Nothing, but Fool, a Flattery, 'scap'd her Hate.
She loved Obedience, -- but she loved it, blind:
And, safelier to subdue, debased Mankind.
No Pardon, there, let Britain's Sins presume;
Freedom, and Truth, are HERETICS -- at Rome.
Religion's Dark^ners will no Reverence feel
For Faith, that bears no Craft, and blinds no Zeal:
Learning, uncurb'd by Cant; Truth, washed from Wiles,
An Earth, that Reasons -- and a Heaven that smiles:
Homage, that no Sedition can betray,
Yet Liberty, that laughs at lawless Sway.
Such had the World's vain Mistress, then, been framed,
When this Night's Story Rome's Attention claimed;
Freedom had nursed no Son, to blast her Reign,
And Caesar had a Soul, without one Stain.

THE ROMAN REVENGE.
ACT 1.
SCENE 1.
A Hall in Caesar's House. CASSIUS. TORBILIUS. (Crossing.) CASSIUS. STAY! turn!
-- The imperfect Dawn deceives my Sight,
Or, it is Torbilius.

TORBILIUS. Cassius:

CASSIUS. He! -- How comes it,
I meet thee, in the House of hated Caesar!

TORBILIUS. Portia, tonight, was frighted, in a Dream;
And, hastening hither, to alarm Calphurmia,
Called for my Hand, to guide her.

CASSIUS. In the Forum.
Expect strong Clash, this Morning.

TORBILIUS. Will Caesar, then,
Be King.

CASSIUS. He will -- yet, Dreams of a tomorrow.

TORBILIUS. So dies, our Plot abortive.

CASSIUS. Rather, die Caesar!
Fix Brutus ours -- and yon pale -- rising Sun
Shall drink the Tyrant's Blood, before its setting.

TORBILIUS. Speak softly. -- It Is an unsafe Scene, for Treason.

CASSIUS. Not now. -- The House is Desert. -- Every Eye,
Busied remote, strays upward, from the Grove;
Hard, through dim Dawn, the Patient Augurs pore,
Watchful to teach mysterious Birds, to lie,
And mock insulted Heaven, to flatter Caesar.

TORBILIUS. Wait you the Auguries?

CASSIUS. Away -- light Questioner!
Brutus, and I, with more tame Slaves, called Senators,
Last Night, beseeching Audience, kingly Caesar
Told us, fair Meanings shunned the Shade of Night,
And bad us, when Day rose, attend his Pleasure:
I came a willing Hour too soon -- for, oh!
Such a Discovery! -- Such Intelligence!

TORBILIUS. Whence flows it?

CASSIUS. Whence do all Court Secrets flow?
Kings trust their Minions -- and King-Blasters bribe 'em:
Caesar, tonight, sat writing, till alarmed,
He heard Calphurnia shriek, and rose to aid her.
Left, in his Closet, lay a half transcribed,
And strangely -- purposed WILL: -- wherein who (think thou)
But Brutus! -- Our last Hope -- Rome's freeborn Brutus!
Is named the Tyrant's SON! and Heir of Empire!

TORBILIUS. In Form of Will adopted?

CASSIUS. Direly; adopted!
Owned his true natural-born decendant Son,
By Cato's solemn Sister! -- Curse her Hypocrisy!
'Twas Ruin -- to the Hopes of Rome, and Liberty.

TORBILIUS. What Bribe had Power, to force a Friend from Caesar.

CASSIUS. Thy Friend, and mine -- imperial Gold! -- more Eloquent,
Than ten smooth Caesar's! bought a true King-Server
From his Lord's Bosom, -- Opportunely near,
He caught the inviting Moment: -- left his Covert, --
Read -- started -- sent to press my early coming,
And, private here, in the still dusk, discolosed it.

TORBILIUS. Gods! What persidious Friendships cheat Mankind!

CASSIUS. Laugh, and be wise. -- So, to betray, gives Greatness.
-- Forget not thou, meanwhile, to speed thy Charge:
Prepare cold Brutus for the Day's Impression:
Swell him, with all his praised Forefather's Pride;
Fume his enhaling Soul with Flatte'ry's Incence,
And share divided Rome's best Hopes, with Cassius

TORBILIUS. Why must Rome's Hopes depend on One Man's Aid?

CASSIUS. All Men are Ours in Brutus. -- Thou, and I,
And every Roman, leagued, to cut off Caesar,
Hate Caesar. -- Every burning Breast, but His,
Has sep'arate, inselt, private Cause, for Malice:
Who will believe, we strike for Rome. -- So known,
So marked, malignant to the Name of Caesar?
Brutus is Caesar's Idol! -- and loves Caesar!
His Aid will consecrate Revenge to Virtue.
He can, when Caesar bleeds, turn Tears to Triumph,
And blot the whitest Star, that lights his Character.

TORBILIUS. But this is Baseness, Cassius! -- grant it needful,
The Man should die -- why must we kill his Virtues?
Why, to oppose his reigning, must we rob
His natural Rights? -- why shade the Soul, he shines by?
No -- let us own the Beauties of his Heart:
Weeping, confess his Brave'ry, Tempe'rence, Pity,
Long patient Courtings of rejected Peace --
Yet -- dreadful Darings, in Contempt of Danger?
Else, we shall spot Laws Face, with Marks of Envy,
Treating this vastness of a Mind, like Heaven's,
As if keen-ey'd for Guilt, but blind to Goodness.

CASSIUS. Perish his Goodness! -- grind my Ear no more
With his cursed Qualities: -- I hate his Power:
I hate myself -- hate Rome -- hate Life, Joy, Victory,
Hate every Hope, but one. -- to make Him feel,
That slighted Cassius drew down Fate on Caesar.
This let me live to teach him -- Then, -- though Rome,
Sunk, round me, till her tumbling Capital
Smoked, for my funeral Pile. -- 'Twere Death, with Glory.

TORBILIUS. Cassius! my Soul, less fiery, cannot strain
Resentment into Frenzy: -- In my Sense,
Reason, not Rage, should measure Plotter's Passions.
Be temperate, or

CASSIUS. Hastily. By Heaven! he comes! you Gallery
Sounds, with his Step. -- The holy Farce is ended:
Poet, -- farewell. --

Exit Cassius. TORBILIUS. alone. Farewell, detested Envy!
Motives like thine, turn Justice into Murder.
Something shall, strait, be done. -- Caesar! be safe:
He, who forgave my Guilt, demands my Virtue.

Exit. SCENE II.
CAESAR, Preceded by Lictors, and Officers, and followed at some Distance, by
an Augur. AUGUR. Caesar! imperial Caesar! hear the Gods.

CAESAR. Go: -- Thou art known. -- The Gods, thou serv'st, are Senators:
Cassrus, thy Phoebus -- and his Gold, thy Jove.

AUGUR. Rest, from this fatal March, restrained by Heaven,
And, by such unpropitious Auguries, warned.

CAESAR. Shame on your pious Frauds! they tire Indulgence.

AUGUR. Check not the Voice of Truth: 'twas formed, for Plainness.

CAESAR. Own it with conscious Shame. -- If Truth loves Plainness.
Why are the God's clear Wills perplexed, by Art?

AUGUR. Speaks Rome's high Pontiff This?

CAESAR. He does, bold Augur!
'To rescue Zeal, from Pride's unhallowed Claim;
That robs, to reve'rence Heaven.

AUGUR. Heaven calls for Faith.

CAESAR. How dare you, then, make Infidels, by Falsehood?
Would you, over Reason, stretch the Chain of Faith,
Gild it, with Heaven's broad Light: Touch the taught Heart.
Nobly, speak out: -- and tell the attracted World,
Nothing is from the Gods, that shakes Man's Honesty.

AUGUR. Oh! stay thy fatal March -- change thy rash Views;
Bid thy raised Eagles fall the expanded Wing:
Air's plumy People, screaming from the Left,
Stoop in their Flight, to warn Thee: -- Omens on Omens,
Bode unauspecious Doom -- and teem, with Death.

CAESAR. No more.

Augur the Gods

Caesar away -- I know 'em, best,
Who know 'em Friends to Virtue. --

AUGUR. Virtue is Liberty.
The Foes of Freedom can attract no Gods,
To prop their falling Standards; -- Heaven beglooms
Thy Star, with some dire Fate: -- but what, is Darkness.

CAESAR. Go: search it, in the Air, -- and, if thou find'st it,
Armed, in its ugliest Menace, bring it hither. --
When Screams of Birds can shake a Soldier's Heart,
Thou shall lead Priests to fight, for feeble Rome,
And lend their Arts, to Caesar.

AUGUR. Tremble. --

CAESAR. Away.

Exit Augur. SCENE III.
CAESAR alone. CAESAR. I would, be happy. -- Why, then, am I Great?
Men, who desert their Peace, to serve their Glory,
Toil, for the Malice of obliged Mankind:
Yet -- weigh, warm Heart, impartially sincere,
Whence Opposition Springs -- and Love its Boldness.
Why claim I Power Supreme? -- was Empire -- mine?
Freedom is every Roman's native Right;
And every Roman Voice demands it back,
Where Power's, unjustly, held -- the Opposer's just:
But, -- where even Freedom is, by Choice, corrupt,
How fruitless -- to redeem the willing Slave.
Can I recall the Dead? -- Rome gives up Rome;
The cheapen'd Varlets rate their venal Votes,
And sell their Soul's Redeemer. -- Sleep, Ambition?
How easier it is to save, than mend, a People!
Fall, servile Rome! -- No. -- Rome is Caesar's Country.
And, who dares injure, where he is born -- to save?
Foes! wrong me on -- till pardoned into Friends:
Busy, for Greatness, I Will neglect Revenge;
Take Envy in Reward, and make it Fame.
What new, kind Fear, alarms thy Lady's Love?

Enter Flavia frighted. FLAVIA. Danger, most instant, she would, now, impart,
E're Cassius, and his proud Confederates come --
Those Enemies of all her Hopes -- and Gaesar!

CAESAR. Go: tell her, Caesar dreads no Enemies,
But those, Her selt Afflictions teach to wound him.

Exit Flavia. CAESAR. Kneeling. Hear me, Thou! self-producing, dark, first
Cause!
All-ruling! all-evading! aweful Power,
Whom, under various Names, blind worship seeks!
If, till compelled, I drew the public Sword,
Sheathed, in my Bosom, let the Guilty fall!
rises But, if bribed Hopes, or partial Sense of Liberty,
Sovereign'd, a Senate, over a Nation, Slaves:
Then, Tyranny (assumed, to bar a Tyrant)
Gave Rome five Hundred Kings -- lest one should reign.
If I must war -- be edged my Sword, for Glory:
Better to hold, than bear tyrannic Sway:
Where but the Great are free -- Reason's, a Slave,

SCENE IV.
CALPHURNIA, to CAESAR, (entering hastily.) CALPHURNIA. Caesar! my Life! -- my
Love!

CAESAR. my Soul's soft Care!
Thou tremblest! -- Some new Vision has alarmed Thee.

CALPHURNIA. Heaven is alarmed -- for Virtue sleeps, in Danger.

CAESAR. Rest, from thy Dreams, by Day -- thou dear Intruder!
Fears, and Affections, are for happier Hours:
War, and our Country's Cares, demand us, now.

CALPHURNIA. Can you be deaf to Warnings, from the Gods?
Portia came, trembling, from a dreadful Dream,
That proves mine ominous.

CAESAR. What has she dreamt?

CALPHURNIA. Frighted, she saw her Father's entering Shadow
Glide through her Chamber, in a dusky Ray:
Stopping, it fixed a pale, and empty Eye,
Spoke, in a thin, faint, death-denoting Voice,
And pierced her to the Soul. -- Portia, You Are mine,
The unbodied Phantom cried. -- Brutus no more
Thy Lord -- nor Caesar Rome's. -- It said, and passed,
And melted into Air, and flowed away.

CAESAR. The night-born Tremblings of a timid Love,
Unstedfasted by Reason!

CALPHURNIA. Be it no more! --
Yet, see not these dire Men: -- They find, and dread
Their Power's Destruction, in the Crown of Caesar.
Hence, have their plotting Fears, this Day, combined,
To blast thy Purpose -- or, cut short thy Life.
Soft knocking at the Door.
CAESAR. Go, with thy meddling Tenderness. -- They come;
Anon, thou shall be heard:

CALPHURNIA. -- One Word indulge me:
E're to the People's public Voice proposed,
Plebian Votes permit this Crown to Caesar,
Hear a sad Secret, my touched Heart would tell Thee.

CAESAR. Give thyself Peace. -- I will.

CALPHURNIA. May all Rome's Gods,
In pity of her Fate, defend, and bless thee.

Exit Calphurnia, meeting Antony who bows to her, in passing. SCENE. V.
CAESAR, MARC ANTONY. ANTONY. Health, and a length of happy Days to Caesar!
Freedom, and Faction join, to crown him King.

CAESAR. Who would be King of Faction, Antony?
Monarchs, by Freedom crowned, reign Kings, indeed!

ANTONY. Why checks that boding Sigh, the public Joy?
What is there, in the Course of worldly Dread,
That thy great Heart can Sigh for?

CAESAR. -- For a Friend

ANTONY. No Friend to Caesar needs a Sigh, in Rome.

CAESAR. Oh, Antony! -- who would not sigh, in Rome,
That thinks of her lost Virtues.

ANTONY. -- If there lives
One, who not hates Oppression, let him love
Rome, and her Virtues. -- Both grown false, and hateful.

CAESAR. Hate not the Guilty, but the guilt, my Antony:
Never shall thy Soul expand, in public Love,
Till it can bear, and pardon, private Wrongs.

ANTONY. When Slander stings us, what should Sufferers do?

CAESAR. Invulnerably Faultless, shame Detraction. --
Why should th'ungrounded Slanders of the Unjust,
Provoke us, to deserve 'em? -- Late, when here
We met, I told thee, Caesar, had a Son.

ANTONY. If I forsake thy Race

-- Caesar swear nothing, Antony
Exacting Oaths, I must suspect Deceit:
And he, who trusts the doubted, cheats Himself.

ANTONY. But who? -- what Star of Rome is Caesar's -- Son!

CAESAR. Suppose it Brutus. --

ANTONY. Starting. -- Every God renounce him!

CAESAR. What God renounces Excellence, in Man?

ANTONY. Brutus is hard, and stern. -- and, what is Man,
Who cannot weep for Man -- and feel, for Nature?

CAESAR. Servilia was, in secret, vowed my Wife,
When Cato, whose austere, and captious Virtue,
Repelled even Virtue -- if it crossed his own
Jealous of our Assistance, -- yet, undreaming,
How far one soft, stolen, amo'rous Hour had borne us,
Snatched the succeeding Day, and, in my Absence,
Forced her, distracted, to a Brutus's Arms.

ANTONY. What mean the wanton Powers, who license Chance,
To shame thee, with a Son, unlike, as Brutus!
Sedition, will not hear, the call of Blood:
Intractably morose, it shuts out Pity,
And starves Humanity, to cherish Pride.

CAESAR. Time, that transforms us all, shall win back Brutus.

ANTONY. Time's Comqueror might reclaim him.

CAESAR. Who Is that?

ANTONY. -- Death.

CAESAR. How! -- To whom speak thou this?

ANTONY. -- To Man.

CAESAR. -- Be one.
And, when thou speak again -- speak, to the Father.

ANTONY. If I offended -- Caesar can be partial.

CAESAR. No. -- For, I see thee honest, through thy Error.

ANTONY. I thought, Revenge of Wrongs was right of Nature.

CAESAR. Men think but to the Limits of their Minds.
For me -- despising Wrongs, I shun Severity.

ANTONY. Yet, sure! Allenvied Greatness, would be safe.

CAESAR. Greatness is safest, when it dares forgive.

ANTONY. Rome hates your Power.

CAESAR. Then, she shall love my Mercy.

ANTONY. I can but wish thee blessed: -- And, still, serve on.

CAESAR. Come, thou shall aid me. -- Thou have lent thy Arm
To conquer Nations for me: -- Conquer Brutus:
Teach him, that noblest Courage shuns to hate:
Charm him, to taste the Power of gentle Sway;
New humanize his Heart, to thy soft Model,
And graft Politeness on his Savage Virtue.

ANTONY. When Caesar bids -- his Antony obeys:
Had Brutus been my Son -- I, too, had hoped.

Enter CURIO. CURIO. Caesar! -- the expected Lords'

CAESAR. Admit 'em, Curio.

Exit Curio SCENE VI.
Caesar, seated: Antony, Brutus, Cassius, Cimber, Decimus, Casca, Cinna,
Marcellus, advancing to their Seats. CAESAR. Health to the Jealous for their
Country's Freedom;
Caesar's Distrusters, welcome! -- Cimber! Decimus!
Marcellus! Gasca! Cassius! Brutus! -- All!
This Day, the Senate sits: quick, therefore, teach me
The previous Purpose of your offered Zeal.

BRUTUS. Rome dreads to lose her Caesar, in a King.

CAESAR. What would you do with this famed Sybil's Prophesy?
How check the public Terror? -- Must I march
With trembling Legions, unsustain'd at Heart,
And desperate, from Defect of, but a Name?
By Oracles fore-doom'd for Parthia's Fall?
Cassius, you smile. -- The Great should judge the Great:
For, never mean Man's Thoughts out-stretch'd his Feeling:
Speak, Brutus -- were your Choice your General's Leader,
What would you wish him called?

BRUTUS. Rome called him -- Consul.

CAESAR. Rome did so -- but, when superstitious Dread
Of hostile Arms has damped a Nation's Fire,
Changes, which tend to raise dejected Hope,
Are Wisdom.

BRUTUS. Wisdom has its Fears. --

CAESAR. -- Speak boldly:
Attentive, even from Foes, to borrow Benefit,
I court Suspicion's Gall, to aid my Judgment,
With all the instructive Doubts of Men, who hate me.

BRUTUS. No Foe has Caesar -- but his Crown has many.

ANTONY. King, was a Title, aweful, anicent, sacred.

CIMBER. Rising. Plain Truth is a blunt Talker -- never, rash Consul.
Never did Sylla, Marius, Pompey, -- Never,
In all the Boldness of usurped Command,
Dare the shunned Name -- however they grasped the Power:
Nor challenge kingly Style, in freeborn Rome.
But Liberty, perhaps, becomes too bold.

CAESAR. True Liberty is bold, without Presumption:
And, without Flattery, gentle. -- Cassius, be heard.

CASSIUS. Raising. Caesar has sworn, to guard our ancient Rights;
Sworn, to uphold one sole Supreme -- the Law:
Caesar unperjur'd, Rome can fear no King.

CAESAR. Malice, disguised in Counsel, -- Keep it, Cassius:
Permitted Slander is a willing Tax,
That patient Power pays, to the Rights of Liberty.

DECIMUS. rising Be Caesar King -- but, still, let Rome be free!

CAESAR. A plain Man's honest Prayer. -- Brutus why dumb?

BRUTUS. rising mournfully. I must be dumb, if neutral: -- but, compelled
To speak, disdain to speak, unlike a Roman:
What helps it to Rome's Friends, if Rome wears Fetters,
That Foes, in Asia, join, to drag her Chain?
Leave Parthea safely fierce: -- Dangers remote
Touch but our Fears -- Domestic Ones are felt.

CAESAR. Brutus! Thou err'st, undreaming it. -- Thou, Cassius,
Art, knowingly, an unmisled Misleader:
Thy Passions framed the Pile: -- good Decimus,
Marcellus, Cimber, and such live Materials,
Buttress thy factious Building: -- It Is in vain,
To reason with the Partial: Men, who call
Their own corrected Pride, the public Danger;
Else, I would say, to Minds, that could reflect,
Be Freemen among Freemen. -- hard Control
Breaks a wronged People's Spirits, into Slaves,
Or, spur's 'em into Rebell's. -- It Is dishonest:
What Right have we to Freedom, not alike
The Property, even of the Poorest Roman?

BRUTUS. When fed the laboring Ox, abreast the Lion?

CAESAR. How venal is all Rome! -- Her every Senator
Sold, to his Passion's Biddings. -- Brutus is sold
To Pride, -- to avarice, some: -- These Envy draw;
Those Fear; -- in Others, hopes of promised Power
Warp the Dependent Will, to crooked Reasonings;
Loose, as the Bribes, that bought 'em.

CASSIUS. -- Voices, Caesar!
Are, sometimes, sold -- where Hands retain their Liberty.

CAESAR. True -- Angry Cassius! -- But, the Head, misguiding,
Hands will mistake the Mark, and wound Themselves.
How soon have you forgot Pharsalia's Field?

CASSIUS. Fortune decided, there: -- At Rome, it is Law,

CAESAR. Fortune decided strangely Caius Cassius!
If I, by having conquered, must obey,
And you, from being beaten, claim Command!

ANTONY. rising with Emotion. Aften such sierce, unveiled, presumtuous Menace,
Rome must forget, ferever, to obey,
Or Caesar, once, to pardon.

CAESAR. to Cassius. -- Cassius, it grieves me,
That Thou compell'st a Sentence, too severe,
rises Since Mercy serves but to excite Offense,
And Bounty spurs Ingratitude -- be -- safe: --
Sunk, to the Shelter of a wronged Man's Pity,
Too feeble to provoke. -- Escape Revenge.
comes forward
BRUTUS holding him. Call it no Crime, to apprehend Distress!
If Liberty offends, and Truth grows Treason,
Thank Heaven, the most dejected Slave, on Earth,
Holds Privilege to die. -- But Caesar frowns!
Note it, attentive Gods! and wake, for Freedom!
Imperial Caesar frowns! -- Rome's Master frowns --
That Opposition speaks uncourtly Truth.
turning to go.
CAESAR. No more. -- The Rest, when in full Senate, met: --
Till then, farewell. --
Exeunt Senators. -- Stay Consul, -- Brutus -- stay.

SCENE VII.
CAESAR. BRUTUS. ANTONY. CAESAR. -- after a long Look, fixed carnestly upon
Brutus, Maxims, inhumam, fierce, and blind, like Thine,
Disgrace a Freeman's Name.
Brutus turns to go -- Stay, I command Thee;
Return, rash Man -- and know -- it is Caesar, calls.

BRUTUS. returning. All my adhering Heart feels Caesar, King,
Leave but Rome's Senate free, devoted Brutus
Shall rest thy willing Slave. --

CAESAR. Proud, as Thou art
Of Liberty, thou have not learnt, that Freedom,
Beyond all Yokes, hates, most, this Yoke of Prejudice,
That makes Men Siaves, at Soul. -- THINK freely, Brutus
And let us argue, like unbiased Romans:
Thou talk of Rights -- Rome's Rights: -- are not the People
The assembled People; ROME? Is not Law Theirs?
Counsel, that, not complied with, would compel,
Turns Law to Tyranny.

BRUTUS. Shall Tumult reign?
Shall highborn Senates serve, and Groundlings govern?

CAESAR. No. -- Mark the Senate's Bounds -- and mark the People's:
Foresight, and Guardian Care, and weighed Advice.
Debated Means, and Remedies proposed,
These and these only, are the SENATE's Rights:
Propounded Laws accepted, or refused,
This is the PEOPLE's Claim: and both are Rome.

BRUTUS. Thanks to the Gods, Rome boasts some Patriots, still.

CAESAR. Yes -- grasping Hopes undue and checked of Aim,
Patriots, in Aid of Vengeance! they combine,
To clog the Wheels, they can no longer guide:
Hiding low-self, behind the Public Cause,
They Murmur, till they purchase private Ease,
Then, License General Pain, to curse Mankind.

BRUTUS. Held not the Senate S^ale most Weight, in Rome?

CAESAR. Rome felt it, Brutus -- till my Arms relive'd her.

BRUTUS. He, who, by Arms, rules Freemen, teaches Slaves --
By Arms, to rule that Ruler.

CAESAR. Trust a tried Sword.

BRUTUS. Curse its bold Use -- in any Hand, but Caesar's,
When, to the vulgar Herd, it levels Nobles,
Born, to be Great -- and mixes Hinds with Consuls.

CAESAR. Born did thou say? -- mark, how thy partial Pride,
Barring the Gates of Hope, would shut out Merit!
No Man was ever Born, but formed to Greatness:
Who, but aspiring -- Hinds -- were -- Rome's first Fathers?
Unvulgar Spirit raised their Deeds to Fame,
And, thence, unvulgar Reverence marked 'em Noble.
-- But, in our Hands, diminished Honor Shrinks
To bare Degree, -- and shames the Rights of Rank.
Heaven! -- what a difference 'twixt Old Rome, and Ours?
Our first famed Ancestors gave worth -- to Blood: --
We, from a worthless Birth, would steal Distinction.
Pensions, with us, take Place: -- with them, 'twas Virtue.
Our Avarice Plunders Friends: Their conquering Bounty
Took nothing, even from Foes -- but Power of Insult.

BRUTUS. Grant us less worthy; still Their Claims are Ours:
And Sons, who basely quit their Father's Rights,
Deserve to live, like Slaves -- or die, like Traitors.

CAESAR. Fie! -- let us Blush, to name our Father's Right's,
Who leave their Claim to Honesty, forgot!

BRUTUS. Often, in sunk States, when Power presumes, on Vice,
New Crimes call out new Virtues.

CAESAR. Rome's new Virtues
Match her new Maxims: Mark their Grandeur, Brutus
Active, in other's Industry, we build, --
Race, Game, Dress, Dance, Feast, and drink deep, for Glory:
Ours are the Tastes of Life: Let humbler States
Learn its lean Duties: -- We, to lighten Joy,
Have, elegantly painless! cast off Care: --
Hunger, and Thirst, and loose Desires -- anticipate:
Posponing nothing -- but Thought, Fame, and Justice.
Valleys we teach to rise: Over levelled Hills
Stretch the tired Sight: -- But, inward turn no Eye:
Ourselves the darkest Part of our own Prospect.
Well say they, Rome is changed. -- It Is changed, indeed!
Women are changed to Men, -- and Men to Women.
Anger has changed its Mark: -- Roman's shock Roman's,
Yet, tame to Parthian Insults, hold back Vengeance,
That Robbers may have Rest, -- and Bribery Leisure.

ANTONY. To Sons of Faction, screen'd but by Rome's Crimes,
Why name we Roman Virtues?

BRUTUS. -- On Thy Voice
Dwells Eloquence, that make even Error charming,
O, too persuasive Caesar! -- But Thou, Antony,
Shall know, that, when fallen Rome's degenerate Consuls
Live, -- a King's Slaves, -- Brutus shall die -- a Roman.

Exit. SCENE VIII.
CAESAR. ANTONY. ANTONY. after a Pause. Now, Caesar! what deserve such Romans?

CAESAR. after a short Pause. -- Freedom.

ANTONY. They are too f^ee, who treat their Friends, with Insult,

CAESAR. If Man were placed above the Reach of Insult.
To Pardon, were no Virtue: -- Think, warm Antony,
What Mercy is -- It Is daring to be wronged,
Yet, unprovoked by Pride, persist in Pity.

ANTONY. Power, that endures Contempt, invites Rebellion,

CAESAR. Dream not, that Moderation weakens Power:
The heartfelt Sovereign smiles, at Faction's Rage;
And those malignant Men, who hate unjustly,
We punish most, when we are most beloved.

ANTONY. What Prince, who was not feared, was, eyer, safe?

CAESAR. Only, in War, he shoud be feared. -- In Peace, be honored Antony.

ANTONY. Even Self-defence requires, at least, that bloody Cassius fall.

CAESAR. Why should I strike the Weak, who cannot wound me*

ANTONY. Punish the guilty Will, that dared imagine.

CAESAR. So Minions teach tame Kings, to merit Hate.

ANTONY. Where Kings suspect, -- preventing, they secure.

CAESAR. Scorn to suspect, where thou would scorn to fear.
Nor waste, on every slight and weak Offense,
The Dignity of Vengeance. -- I will, anon,
Trust Brutus with his Birth: Nature must move him.
If not -- I leave him to the Gods, and Time.

ANTONY. Shall he oppose, yet, wear his Father's Crown?

CAESAR. Should Life allot me Hope, to stretch Rome's Soul
To Latitude for Liberty -- 'twere more
Than Empire, to restore her. -- If the Task,
Hard, and extensive, calls for lengthening Years,
While, in untimely Hour, I, distant, die,
Brutus, by this last Light, will judge my Purpose.
gives a Paper.
ANTONY. Long may the Gods, preserving Caesar's Life,
Protect his Purposes, from Care, not Caesar's.

CAESAR. Life has too short a Reach, for long Designs:
And, often, the Fruit not ripe, the Tree declines:
No Help unneedful, Man should all purfue,
Lest Time slide from him, -- and his Hopes die, too.

End of the First ACT.
ACT. II.
SCENE I.
A Room in Caesar's House. Two Chairs placed: Calphurnia, Flavia. CALPHURNIA.
GO, Flavia; -- spread Enquiry through the Palace:
While I, prolonging Time, by every Art
Of apprehensive Love, hold Caesar, fixed
In Conference, till slow Torbilius comes:
Fittest Reporter of his own sad Tale,
To force Belief, and fire reluctant Vengeance.

CAESAR. without Where is this bosom Counselor of Caesar?

CALPHURNIA. Fly -- find Torbilius: -- when he comes, touch soft
My Silver Bell, that the known Sound may war me.

Exit Flavia. CAESAR. It Is past, Calphurnia. -- The tried Faction's hatred
Repelled obtruded Candor.

CALPHURNIA. Shun thy Forgiveness?

CAESAR. Men, of contracted Views, distrust kind Meanings;
For, no Heart credits, what it cannot feel.
What frightful Story has my Dreamer, now?

CALPHURNIA. A sad, and dreadful Truth.-No Dream-No Doubting:
He, whose dire Property the Secret rests,
Guardian of Caesar's Life, demands his Ear.
For me -- I could but speak my Fears, and Follies.

CAESAR Follies have Charms, when Fears, like thine, are follies:
Man may draw Profit, then, from Woman's Weakness:
And, in one tender Wife's mistaking Faith,
Find Recompense, for every Friend, that is false.
they sit.
CALPHURNIA Can there be Rest, in Danger?

CAESAR. Sure! There should not:

CALPHURNIA. Why is Ambition, then, too hard for Peace?
Why, always busy, to be never blessed,
Does restless Caesar sacrifice, unthank'd,
The Taste, the Quiet, the Serene, of Life,
For an ungrateful World, that hates his Bounty?

CAESAR. It Is the great Mind's expected Pain, Calphurnia
To Labor for the Thankless: -- He, who seeks
Reward in Ruling, makes Ambition Guilt:
And, living for Himself, disclaims Mankind.

CALPHURNIA. Alas! -- the Friend to All obliges none.

CAESAR. It Is nobler to protect Mankind, than please.

CALPHURNIA. Is it a Crime, when Virtue loves itself?

CAESAR. Princes should widen self: -- Their Power, and Heart,
Alike Receptive, must make room for All:
It Is theirs, to Sigh, for every Sufferer's Woe;
Lend their own Joys, that others may be glad:
Think ev'en for unborn Ages; and transmit
Blessings unshar'd -- and quiet, not their own.

CALPHURNIA. Virtues, so rais-d, as these, but waste their Warmth,
And shine, unfelt, in Rome. -- The Vulgar Eye
Sees, by its own low Level: -- As Men act,
They judge: and, by corrupt Self-Interest weighed,
Goodness, like Heaven's, would seem Self-Interest, too.

CAESAR. No Matter. -- Virtue Triumphs, by Neglect:
Vice, while it darkens, lends but Foil, to Brightness:
And juster Times, removing Slander's Veil,
Wronged Merit, after Death, is helped to live.

CALPHURNIA. Can present Pain be cured, by future Ease?

CAESAR. Who would not, once, look dim, to shine, for ever?

CALPHURNIA. How happy is it for a Wife, who loves,
When lowlier Prospects bound her Lord's Desires,
And Home-felt Quiet fills his peaceful Heart!
Why would you be a King? -- wait, till some King
Aspires, to be a Caesar: -- Lend not Envy
New Props to lean against: This threatening Name
Beats on the Roman's unaccustomed Ear,
Like a black Storm -- and blasts the Hope of Liberty.

CAESAR. Never, henceforth, disturb thy gentle Breast,
With false Forebodings, from a regal Toy!
Know me above its Want: -- beyond its Glory:
Given, though unheld, It meets the Parthian Prophesy;
Bids the roused Legion's superstitious Hearts
Resume lost Ardor: -- and fure Victory's, Theirs.

CALPHURNIA. Though Parthia fell, there is a Patrician Envy,
That, never quenched, burns but with fiercer Blaze,
From each new Proof, that Old Injustice wronged thee:
Taink of those Midnight Haunters of my Fancy!
Think, how I saw thee bleed, at every Vein:
While, at each spouting Stream, a murderous Roman
Stained his extended Arm, and roared for Liberty.
Cassius! -- stern Cassius! --
starting up -- Blast him, Heaven! -- methinks,
I see him, there, -- full, in my Eyes, he glares!
Pale, in the horrid Transport of his Vengeance;
And, dreadfully, enjoys the ghastly Scene! --
Kneels. Oh! grant thyself, to live: Grant sad Calphurnia
That Prayer: -- She begs it, but for Rome, and Nature.

CAESAR. Why will thou kneel?-What coud'st thou ask, in vain!

CALPHURNIA. Death -- instant Death, to that malignant Cassius!

CAESAR. Since thou were it first my Wife, I never saw thee
Cruel, till this strange Moment! -- Dovelike gentle,
Healing Compassion soothed thy Heart, to Softness:
And, on thy sparkling Eye, sat weeping Mercy.

CALPHURNIA. It Is Mercy, to Mankind, to punish Villains.

CAESAR. Rise: and relieve me, from this new Distress.
Bell rings without.
CALPHURNIA. Rising. I will: -- And thou shall owe to Woman's Fear
A Safety, manly Confidence had lost Thee.

CAESAR. How art thou heated, by an idle Dream,
To strike at fansied Guilt, with real Anger!

CALPHURNIA. The Wife of Caesar wrongs not, even his Foes.
Flavia! Lucilia! here -- who waits, without?
Enter a Lady. The Man, with whom I held Discourse, this Morning!
Bid him Re-enter.

Exit Lady. CAESAR. Who! -- What Man is this?

CALPHURNIA. Torbilius -- the sow're Satirist: -- Thy Enemy. --

CAESAR. No Enemy of mine -- if Wit's his Friend.

CALPHURNIA. Once, when condemned, for libelling my Caesar,
Thy all-permitting Mercy, not alone
Forgave -- but, bad him claim distinguished Bounty;
Till Wit, misled, could find the way to Judgment.

CAESAR. I know him not: -- What can thou hope, Calphurnid,
From these slight Men? -- So bold, yet, blind of Soul,
That Wit, with them, supplies the Place of Virtue;
And, censuring other's Faults, absolves their own.

CALPHURNIA. Staying, when Portia went, his trembling Gratitude.
Prayed Audience, in a Cause, that touched the Life
Of threat'ned Caesar: -- For the Rest, he comes:
Let his own Tongue retrace the horrid Tale.

SCENE II.
CAESAR, CALPHURNIA, TORBILIUS. TORBILIUS. Hail, Caesar! more than Victor! --
Common Conquerors
Vanquish but Power: Caesar subdues the Will.

CAESAR. Why do thou flatter! -- Stranger to my Passions,
Whence would thy Skill presume, to judge my Virtue?
Take heed, thou sell'st not Praise, to purchase Scorn!
Encomium is a bold, and dange'rous Province!
It calls for Reason: -- Slander asks but Rage:
Who drt Thou? -- what is thy Pretense, in Rome?

TORBILIUS. Touched by the Muse's Love, I, there, indulge
The tuneful Transports of Satiric Fire:
Rome is a fruitful Field, for Themes, like mine!
And Brutus, wit's kind Patron! loves my Verse.

CAESAR. Where Wit wants Patronage -- a State wants Wisdom.
Keen, though the Darts, by angry Genious thrown,
The Wise can Guide 'em, while the Base Restrain:
Satire, in honest Hands, is Murmuring Virtue:
And He, who fears its Hiss, deserves its Sting.
Yet, it is a dangerous, and malignant, Good!
Though Freedom's Property, it is Faction's Spoil.
Where justly bold, it is Reason's manliest Impulse:
Where blindly virulent, it is Wit's Disease.
Think, and distinguish: -- Are thy Censures weighed?
Do thou Proportion Anger, to its Cause?

TORBILIUS. Had I done that, I had not wronged thy Name:
I was not just: -- For, I was Caesar's Foe. --
Can Caesar have forgot Torbilius Asper?

CAESAR. Why wonder'st thou at that? -- For my own Sake,
My Friend imprints Remembrance; -- but my Foe,
For His, should be FORGOTTEN.

TORBILIUS. Generous Caesar,
Forgetting me, forgets the Guilt, he pardoned,
And Claims not his own Virtues!

CAESAR. Roman! learn
To measure Truth, more justly: -- Benefits,
From their Receiver only, claim Remembrance:
He, who bestows, and not forgets -- resumes 'em

TORBILIUS. Perish the Mem'ory, and the Man, together,
When I forget such Greatnef? --

CALPHURNIA. Spare thy Words: --
And hasten to disclose thy Thanks, in Action.

CAESAR. What know Thou, that deserved Attention, here?

TORBILIUS. Cassius, whose Love of Rome, is Hate of Caesar,
Lists an implicit Clan of warm Resenters:
Men, who, with dim Discernment, tracing Liberty,
Plunge headlong in Sedition. -- Among these,
He stooped his active Bribe'ry, even to me:
Courting my humble Aid, to influence Brutus,
Whose Name, and Power, might Mask the Face of Murder.

CAESAR. Whom would they Murder?

TORBILIUS. -- Rome's last Hope, in Caesar.

CALPHURNIA. Now, Caesar! now, am I an idle Dreamer?

CAESAR. Does Brutus know this Purpose?

TORBILIUS. -- Yet he does not:
And Caesar, still, might guard the generous Heart
Of his beloved: And save him, from the Vile.
All Flatter'y's full-try'd Power Unites, to shake him:
That done, the Tempter ply's his Master Engine;
Draws him, this Day, to meet the assassin Faction:
Then -- but that Heaven defends Thee -- joined by Brutus,
The encouraged Murde'rers strike: -- not joined forbear.

CAESAR. If Caesar's Death must wait, till Brutus strikes,
His Life would prove immortal! -- Men, of Heat,
Like Cassius, torture their distempered Reason,
To Act their Passion's Impulse: -- Brutus weighs
Desire's warm Pleas, in the cool Scale of Justice:
Finds Force, in Other's Claims, against Himself,
And loves the Virtue. that condemns him.

CALPHURNIA. Go on, Torbilius! -- Set, in Caesar's View,
What Cassius loves; and Point us out His Virtues.

CAESAR. It shall not need: -- He stands condemned, already.

CALPHURNIA. Joyfully. To what condemned?

CAESAR. Condemned to live, Calphurnia.

CALPHURNIA. What! and not tortured?

CAESAR. -- Pride's severest Rack
Is that sharp Mercy, which descends from Scorn.
Think it a Fault, to fear these choleric Praters:
Their hot, slight, Threat'nings waste themselves, in Slander;
And rail away Revenge, to gradual Peace:
But, there is a cold, slow, silent, patient Malice,
That carries Mischief with it! -- Such a Soul,
As Brutus Acts by -- had it Will, for Murder:
Cool, in its governed Hate, might call for Cruelty. --
What read'st Thou?

TORBILIUS. -- Silent Summoners, to Murder
These Cassius Causes to be dropped, with Art,
Where Brutus must be sure to find, and read 'em.

CALPHUREIA. What wiles has Malice!

CAESAR. Poor, and petty, Crafts!
They want but my Regard, to lend 'em Weight.
Returning the Paper. Torbilius, meet 'em: -- and, with strictest Note,
Mark, what Impression Cassius makes on Brutus.
All, Thou can learn of That, be swift to bring me;
And trust the Claims of Gratitude, to Caesar.

TORBILIUS. The grateful make no Claims. -- A mindful Debtor
Pays -- not obliges: -- Never met, in one,
The Poet, and the Miser: -- The same Fire,]
That sparkles, in his Fancy's native Blaze,
Glows, at his honest Heart; and burns out Baseness:
True Genious will not -- cannot; stoop to Bribes:
And He, who sells his Passions, never had Wit, --
Or had it, for a Curse, unmixed with Judgment.

CAESAR. It Is nobly said; -- and, with a warmth, that only
Suspected Virtue feels. -- Henceforth, be mine:
On modest Merit, not to force Reward,
Were to degrade Supremacy.

CALPHURNIA. Where meet They?

TORBILIUS. In the cool Grot, behind the Platan Grove:
There Brutus, often alone, and often with Friends,
Steals an unbusied Hour, for reasoning deeply:
Or, in free Mirth, dilates the slack'ning Soul.

CALPHURNIA, What was the appointed Time?

TORBILIUS. The fatal Choice,
Yet doubtful, must depend alone on Brutus.
Some Three Hours, hence, I look to find 'em met,

CALPHURNIA. Go, good Tarbilius. -- Wait within my Call:
For I shall Try thy Faith in Caesar's Cause.

Exit Torbilius SCENE III.
CAESAR, CALPHURNIA. CALPHURNIA. I am alarmed. for Brutus!

CAESAR. Doubt him not:

CALPHURNIA. Is he ambitious?

CAESAR. No, -- but he is vain.

CALPHURNIA. Then, beyond Hope, he is lost. -- Ambitious Men
Lead, and discern -- but vain Ones follow, blind.

CAESAR. Thou have contagious Power, in that Suspicion:
Great Minds, on some unguarded Quarter, weak,
Find their tried Virtue, there, sublimely frail:
Were Cassius artful! -- Had his Malice, Coldness,
-- Could he first praise, -- and, then, attack, where warmest,
The Public-hearted Brutus.

CALPURNIA. Nay he does;
It Is from that Point, he levels all his Aim. --
Who knows not Brutus proud! -- and Flattery's Art
Sets Pride at work, to sap her own Foundation:
And pull down Character, to build up Name.

CAESAR. Then, Cassius merits my regard: -- and dies:
Light, in himself, he, yet, deserves but Scora:
Awak'ning Danger, in corrupted Brutus,
He makes his own raised Mischief worth Revenge.

CALPHURNIA. But, can I trust a Doubt, like this, to chance?
The unsure Conversion of a rash Man's Spleen?
Who knows, but, feigning Penitence, Torbilius
Courts you to Confidence, he would betsay?
No. -- It shall never be said, that Caesar's Wife
Left Caesar's Safety, to Another's Faith.
She, who, too lightly weighs a Husband's Danger,
Takes Arms, at Heart, against him.

CAESAR. Trust Torbillius,
He will deserve thy Faith: -- Reflecting Minds,
By Gratitude once gained, relapse no more.

CALPHURNIA. Thus will I sound his Purpose: -- then, confide. --
Portia, this Morning, pressed a Visit, from me:
Often, through her Garden's private Gate, unmarked,
Entering alone, that Grot, invites my Notice:
There, silently concealed, where Art-form'd Rocks
Lend jutting Umbrage to the cavy Screen,
I hear, what Cassius moves: -- What Brutus yields:
This, if the Satrist dissuades: -- he is false:
This, if he aids, Calphurnia judges Cassius:
And Life, or Death, be His, as Justice Dooms.

CAESAR. In Love, and Anger, Woman's Will is deaf;
I know, thy generous Purpose is too firm,
To let my Fears for Thee, forbid this Danger.
Yet, while, in Dread of mine, thou dare thus rashly,
Be it my Care to interpose, in Thine.
Curio, the Tribune, with a Guard, must wait Thee.

CALPHURNIA. Their Number will detect me.

CAESAR. No, -- let Torbilius,
Singly, and slow, unnotic'd, introduce 'em;
Through the lone Postern, that adjoins the Grove.

CALPHURNIA. Bless the kind Thought! -- And now, should Murder dare
One Glance, at thy dear Bosom, bloody Cassius
Shall, on the guilty Spot, that Moment die.

CAESAR. Spare thy disordered Heart. -- Cassius is hasty!
But, Brutus shall with mild Reproof, reduce
The Madman's Rage, and shame him into Safety.
I dread to arm Thee. -- Prejudice is rash. --

CALPHURNIA. Have I been subject, then, to rash Impressions?

CAESAR. Thy Reason, I could trust -- but not thy Anger:
Religion's Curb, in He^rt's, like Thine, binds surest:
Swear, by some sacred Tie. --

CALPHURNIA. Hear me, whole Heaven!
By Rome's raiss'd Fate! -- By her Forefather's God's!
By aweful Vesta's unexpiring Flame!
By Venus, M^ther of thy Race, of Caesar!
If Treason leaves out Time to reach thy Ear,
E're Danger catch thy Life -- Cassius shall live,
To learn his Doom from Thee. -- and 'scape my Vengance.

CAESAR. See! the concurring Gods have sent Thee Curio!

SCENE IV.
CAESAR, CALPHURNIA, CURIO. CURIO. Shouts, from ^^patient Crowds, demand a King;
And royal ^aesar glads the Streets of Rome.

CAESAR. after writing in a Table Book. Curio! -- Joy's flattering Sounds are
loud Deceivers: --
C^lphurnia's busy Fears have traced a Traitor,
B^rn to high Rank, and famed for Arms, and Envy.
Go, with due Strength; guard thou the Wife of Caesar:
And, if this Blank, that, now, conceals his Name,
Filled, by her Hand, points out the guilty Roman,
Weigh Caesar's Life, with His: -- and be this Warrant
Thy Sword's Authority, to do me Right.
giving the Table Book to Curio.
CURIO. Where e're your Danger warrant's me to strike,
If Treason 'scape my Sword -- let Flight in War,
Want -- and eternal Infamy, Revenge,
The Cause of Caesar, on his Soldier's Name!

CAESAR. Marc Antony returned!

CALPHURNIA. Curio! thy Ear. --

SCENE V.
CAESAR, ANTONY. ANTONY. All is prepared; -- pale Cassius Looks, still paler:
And starts at every Shout, that Shakes the Forum:
Never, henceforth, let Noise be called Sedition:
Rome's public Mouth outroars a hundred Senates!
One loud Consent unites her grateful Tribes,
And Parthia's Fall takes Date, from Caesar's Crown.

CAESAR. Joined Brutus, in that Voice. --

ANTONY. No Roman hoped it:
Reserves, they know, must guard the Stoick's Gravity:
What sour Solemnity of Look, like His,
Stoops a lost Smile, to grace Plebeian Lightness!
Men, who can laugh, as I do -- jovial Thinkers!
Framed for their Ease, and born, to hate Affliction!
See Things, but as they are! void of the Wit,
That hunts for covered Anguish! long, sound Sleepers!
Dull, satisfied, glad Rogues! they trust their Senses,
Love their Friend's, best: and wish, but what they want.
Brutus is deep: -- dives farther into Bliss --
Shakes his superior Brow, and pities Fools,
Who dare be happy, against Rules of Policy,

CAESAR. Where coud'st thou find him, now?

ANTONY. Immured, at Home,
Sagely despising his good Lords, -- the People: --
And shutting Caesar's Triumph, from his Ear.

CAESAR. Take this Occasion, Antony, to visit him;
Bid his wished Presence grace thy public Zeal!
If he declines it, sting him, to Resentment:
Watch, in that Warmth of Heart. what Thoughts escape him;
Sound the dark Depth of his Designs; -- and tell him,
That to the Capitol, thou mean to bring me:
Rome's Crown, by Freemen given to guard their Liberty,

ANTONY. How noisy is that Nothing! All its Virtue
Dwells in its Sound: -- It means but covered Tyranny.

CAESAR. Ever distinguishing Substances, from Sound:
There is in Liberty, what God's approve;
And only Men, like Gods, have Taste, to share.
There is in Liberty, what Pride perverts,
To serve Sedition, and perplex Command:
True Liberty leaves all Things free, -- but Guilt;
And fetters every Thing, -- but Art and Virtue.
False Liberty holds nothing bound, but Power,
And lets loose every Tie, that strengthens Law.

ANTONY. Caesar, in Science, as in Power, Supreme,
Calls Luster, out of Darkness! -- But to Me,
What seems most strange, of Faction's strange Effects,
Is, that among those Crowds, she tempts to Mischief,
I see good Men, beloved for every Virtue!
Blindly misdrawn, to hate the peace they wish.

CAESAR. Boast fully blind, a Bigot's Proof is Trust;
Faultless in Purpose, yet -- his Choice unjust!
Active, that erring Zeal may Truth invade,
Enthusiast Pride obtrudes her blund'ring Aid.
Fierce to the Field, keen Disputants she draws,
Implicit Props of some unreasoning Cause!
The absurd Reformer Order overthrows,
And works up Discord -- for the World's Repose!
Jealous of Enemies, disquiets Friends,
Groans, without Wound; and without Fruit, contends,
Wildly sincere! unprevalently strong!
Struggling for Right -- and introducing Wrong:

End of the Second Act.
ACT III.
SCENE I.
A Grand Apartment in the House of Brutus. BRUTUS, ANTONY. BRUTUS. URGE it no
more -- I am fixed.

ANTONY. Think wiselier Brutus

BRUTUS. Consul! when bold Oppression grapples Law,
Men, who protect the Oppressor, stab the State.

ANTONY. Men, who so roughly dare Mischarge their Lord,
Pretending Liberty, pursue but Pride.

BRUTUS. Caesar, however raised, is less than Lord.

ANTONY. Caesar however wronged, is more than Friend:
Even Gratitude has made Respect, a Duty:
Present, or absent Thou -- the Tribes will crown him.

BRUTUS. Crown? whom?

ANTONY. One, whom if Brutus knew but rightly,

BRUTUS. I fear I do!

ANTONY. No -- if you did, you would tremble.

BRUTUS. I have already, trembled Antony!
Trembled -- to hear a Roman tempt a Roman,
And dare corrupt a Patrsot, yet unsold!

ANTONY. Corrupt, I would not. -- All I would, I dare.

BRUTUS. The basely bold should learn, to dread the Just.

ANTONY. When Brutus bids me dread -- I hear and Smile.

BRUTUS. Smile on your King: Flattery was made for Thrones.
The rough, wronged Roman frowns, with honest scorn.

ANTONY. Brutus, I rev'erence Firmness; but despise
The Hypocrisy of Envy! I have a heart,
That being human, feels for humankind.
I tow're not to the Gods: -- Virtue, once raised
Above Compassion, ceases to be Virtue:
Aiming at more than Man, thou sink'st to less.

BRUTUS. I would be less than King; and more than Slave.

ANTONY. Farewell: -- rash Zealots blindly grow unjust;
And Pride inflexible,, and deaf, as Thine,
Professing Virtue, make's even Virtue hateful.

Exit. SCENE II.
BRUTUS alone. Heaven! what a Change in Rome! -- breathe these her Sou^
Oh! grieved Quirinus! what Reproach wero Thine,
Did not thy fellow Gods disdain to note us!
Rome has no Remnant, now, of Roman Greatness:
Sold, or seduced, we give up Claim by Claim,
Till even our Virtues are engros'd by Caesar!
O, Souls of long lost Glory! Fabii! Decii
O, all ye Pompey's! Scipio's! Cato's! hear me!
Re-kindle, in my Breast, your patriot Lights:
And live, once more in Brutus! -- fill this Heart,
With Caesar's Fire -- but, let it flame, for Rome.

SCENE III.
BRUTUS, TORBILIUS BRUTUS. Torbilius! Thou intrud'st on my Retirement:
The Muse, and my sad Heart are, now, not social,

TORBILIUS. Cassius approaches. -- There Is a Name, indeed,
Unsocial! -- Every Muse would start, to hear it.

BRUTUS. Thou wrong'st him. -- Cassius is a noble Roman.

TORBILIUS. There is a Jaundice, in thy Judgment, Brutus,
That lends him Golden Color, from thy own:
I know him, to the Soul. -- Have sounded all
The Shallows of his Envy; -- and I could,
But that an Oath, enjoined, has bound my Tongue,
Convince thee, that he dares assault thy Honor;
And plots, to blast thee to the World, for ever.

BRUTUS. Who bound thee, by such Oath?

TORBILIUS. Calphurnia's Piety.

BRUTUS. What had Calphurnia's Piety to do
With Plots? and Oaths? and Secrecy? and Brutus?

TORBILIUS. Earnest, herself, to warn endangered Brutus
With Consequence, she feared, my Words might lose,
She claims your instant Ear: -- Be swift -- incline it.
Shun the too near Approach of Cassius, hither:
And, hastening to the House of Caesar, weigh,
What her Wish forms, to guard thy Fame, and Virtue.

BRUTUS. Thou art too bold, Torbilius: -- Tell Calphurnia,
I, best, myself, defend my Honor's Claims:
And grasp, too hard, to need a Woman's Aiding.
Torbilius! -- Rome has lost thee. -- Caesar's Bounties
Have bribed thy Gratitude, to slander Honesty.

TORBILIUS. Ill am I known, where, most, my Heart lies open,
If, after all my rash Contempts of Power,
Brutus can doubt me Venal: -- Yet, doubt on:
No undeserved Reproach adheres to Virtue.
No Matter what bold Slander wounds Torbilius,
Where he, who Wrongs him, has the Rights of Friendship.

BRUTUS. I will not see Calphurnia.

TORBILIUS. Oh! revoke those fatal Words, lest

BRUTUS. By the Gods! I will not; till Cassius, and his Friends have, first,
been heard.

TORBILIUS. Cassius is Caesar's Enemy.

BRUTUS. But I am Brutus;- and thou know me Caesar's Friend.
Let that Truth, known, content thee.

TORBILIUS. -- No. -- It cannot:
Brutus not fearing, I must fear for Brutus.
Greatness of Soul, confiding in itself,
Exposes an unguarded Side, to Baseness.

BRUTUS. What would thou lead me to?

TORBILIUS. To one kind Promise:
I urge it but to save thee. -- I conjure thee;
By every Claim of long, untir'd Adherence!
By every Recompense, thou ow'st my Dangers!
By every grateful Sense of every Duty!
Love, Friendship, Reverence, Faith, Advice, and Service!
Promise, whatever dire Result the Gods
Permit, -- for Cassius comes on no light Errand!
Previous to any Deed, thy will may purpose,
To hear my Thoughts: -- Entrust me with thy own:
And teach my willing Hand, and Heart, to aid thee.

BRUTUS. I see the strangely moved: -- I will, by Heaven!
Entrust thee, unreserv'd, and seek thy Counsel.

TORBILIUS. Bark on, ye Dogs of envy! Bark, in vain:
Brutus is Safe, and Spotless

Exit Torbilius. BRUTUS. Alone. -- Caesar's Graces.
Win every Heart! and no Corruption's Power
Out-bribes the native Sweetness of his Pity.

SCENE IV.
BRUTUS, CASSIUS, DECIMUS, CINNA, CASCA. CASSIUS. Hail! death-devoted Brutus!
Romes last Friend!

DECIMUS. Guardian, in vain, of our expiring Liberty!

CASSIUS. Caesar, Tomorrow, marches hence, a King.

BRUTUS. What are Rome's Prospects, then?

CASSIUS. Taxes, and Chains.
Brutus, farewell, for ever
Embracing. -- Life grows Shameful,
Where Freedom is resigned, and Man's a Slave.

BRUTUS. Can Cassius feel Despair?

CASSIUS. When Rome Despairs.

DECIMUS. When even her Soul -- her Brutus! -- Breaths for Caesar*

CASSIUS. No Force on Earth, but our unshaken Hearts
Held back this bold Invader.

DECIMUS. Caesar's too Wise,
To spare our Lives, who live, -- to shake his Throne.

CASSIUS. Escaping us, he meets but Men: -- Not Romans.

BRUTUS. Oh! Honor, Virtue, and the Rights of Law!

CASSIUS. It Is past: -- The Laws have been. -- Honor, and Virtue
Are, now, the public Jest of penfion'd Parasites:
Who sell Submission, and receive back -- Scorn.

DECIMUS. Rome, and the World are fallen! -- it is Caesar, All!

CASSIUS. All, that Six Hundred bleeding Years have gained,
Thrown, at one Cast, to Caesar! -- Why had Times,
Like these, a Brutus? -- Graced with fruitless Virtues?

BRUTUS. If I have Virtues -- Why should They be Fruitless?

CASSIUS Join every Power, above? -- To bless that Question!

DECIMUS. Hear yon licentios Noise!
Shouts at a Distance
BRUTUS. -- Curse the vile Sound!
It Is Breath of Adulation! Rome's lost Gods
Expelled! -- And Insense paid to human Pride!
Shouts again.
CASSIUS. Again! -- Those Shouts are Insult.

DECIMUS. -- Cimber comes,
And, if I read him Rightly, in his Look,
Caesar's Attempts succeeds; for, see! he is Angry.

SCENE V.
BRUTUS, CASSIUS, DECIMUS, CINNA, CASCA, CIMBER. CASSIUS. Tell us, what would
they?

CIMBER. -- Slavery, they would

BRUTUS. Have we a King, in Rome?

CIMBER. Have we a Freeman?

CASSIUS. What call you Caesar?

BRUTUS. Less, when he dares be more.

CIMBER. Caesar high-seated, -- Sovereign of the Slaves!
Shone, from the Capitol, as who would say,
Make me a God, and Rome shall shake with Thunder:
Up, from Ten Thousand bribe-attesting Throats,
Flew purchased Gratulation: "Hail, Great Caesar!
"Rome's dread Avenger! -- Fate of punished Parthia!
"Star of thy Country's Hope? And War's brave Guider!".
Timely, to cool this Madness, at its Height,
So Heaven decreed it! -- In Stalks Antony;
Blast him, deaf Genius of devoted Rome!
A cushion'd Crown, and Scepter, shamed his Hands:
Yet, was his venal Eye fixed bold, on Caesar.
Down sunk, at once, the Tempest of Applause;
Hushed, as a Coward, in his Midnight Bush,
The sickening People flattered into Silence;
He, 'midst a horrid Glare of wide-stretch'd Eyes,
Unheeding, on his Master's Brow, set, soft,
The regal Gew-gaw: -- Then, with abject Knee,
Bent, for inflructive Homage, -- be a KING,
He cried -- and reign over Rome, that rules the World,
Caesar, mean while, who watched the public Eye,
And read Reluctance, Grief, and Terror, there;
Starting indignant with well-acted Scorn,
Hurled, from his Front, the uninclining Toy;
And cried -- "I am not King, my Friend -- but Caesar.

BRUTUS. O, Truth! -- Beyond all Pride of kingly Greatness!

CIMBER. Then, general Joy new-voic'd the gaping Press;
And shook the distant Roofs, with loud Concurrence;
Even Antony, then, blushed.

CASSIUS. -- And did not Caesar?

CIMBER. Caesar smiled sweet Contempt: -- And then, again,
The unfeeling Fools, more charmed, renewed their Shouting:
I laughed, aloud: to mark him thanking Rome,
For finding Virtues in him, which he had not!
At length, disdainful of the hard Constraint,
Parting, he frowned Sincerity. -- The Rest
You Will learn, when I do.

BRUTUS. What means That?

CIMBER. -- Anon,
The Senate sits.

BRUTUS. What then?

CIMBER. Why then, Six Hours
May pass, betwixt his pushing back the Crown,
And our exacted Votes, to bid him take it.

BRUTUS. Holds he that Hope?

DECIMUS. Yes: And who helps us?

CASSIUS. -- Death.

BRUTUS. Death is, indeed, the Slave's last Hope: -- but, he,
Who dares embrace that Help, might find a better.

CASSIUS. While my doomed Country had a Gasp for Life,
I struggled on, to live: -- Now, World, farewell!
No God sustained me, to support the State:
But, to die, with it, still, is left to Freedom.
To Heaven's imperial Rome, from ours, I go;
There, no bold Caesar sways: -- There Pompey serves!
No Roman, there, need blush to own a Master:
Where even a Cato finds, and fears, a Lord!
These will I follow, thus.
Drawing his Sword.
BRUTUS. Disarming him. -- Follow we none:
It Is ours, to lend, not borrow, brave Example.
It Is ours, to stem the Tide of a bad World,
And justify to Time the Roman Greatness.
Much is to Anger due -- but more to Rome.
Cato had died, unblam'd -- first, killing Caesar;
But, turning on himself, his erring Sword,
He fell, unjustly: -- For, he punished Innocence.

CASSIUS. What can we, in a World, despairing, round us?

BRUTUS. Showing a Billet. See! What the Friends of Liberty expect!
See! What they hope from Romans!

CASSIUS. This Reproach
I, too, have met with: -- And 'twas hard to bear!

BRUTUS. Cassius! -- 'twas harder, far, -- to have deserved it.

CIMBER. Good Talkers might attract a Gown-man's Praise:
And had Time Ears -- fine Words were Marks of Wisdom:
But lose this Day, no Orator, in Rome,
Must be admired, but Caesar.

BRUTUS. -- E're this Day
Yet passes, -- Twenty Tyrant's Fortunate,
As ours -- but never Greatness equaled Caesar!
Might expiate, with their Lives, their bold Ambition.

CIMBER. Ay! That Is a Flower of Speech, my Rhetoric reaches!

CASSIUS. Rome lives again! She breathed, in that raised Voice!
And Brutus has received her. --

DECIMUS. -- Fatal Name
To Tyrants! -- Brutus, to assert his Race,
Speaks the dire Duty, which We dared but think.

CASSIUS. My Friend has reconciled me to myself; --
If there is future Glory due to Cassius,
Brutus bestows it, all -- BRUTUS! and ROME!
Flow mixed, ye reverend Names! down Time's dark Stream!
By Ages emulating Ages, blessed!
Decimus! Cinna! Casca! Patriot's! Roman's!
Join your Sword's Aid: Obey this gener'ous Leader.
Live to approve, and to support his Vengeance;
And drive Dejection from the Heart of Virtue,

CIMBER. All Rome will think, and Act, with Roman Brutus.

DECIMUS. Born the Sustainers of patrician Honor,
Senates, despised, would fall with double Shame,
Survived, by their Despiser. --

CASSIUS. -- See a List,
Shinning with Names, of Rome's distinguished Sons!
Associates, All, to strike one Glorious Blow!

BRUTUS. Taking the Paper Soft, Cassius! -- have a Care! nor arm Revenge
Too Strongly: -- lest it look, perhaps, like Baseness.
One were enough, to bid a Tyrant die,
Who dared Himself, die with him.

CASSIUS. Roman's numberless
Stand, now prepared for Summons.

BRUTUS. Summon none:
Should they be sold to Caesar, they are untrusty: --
And, if they fear him, heartless. --

CASSIUS. Such a Tongue,
As Cicero's.

CIMBER. No. -- let us list no Praters;
These Speechmen of the Senate range but Periods:
Tropes are their Javelins: -- Climax forms their Ranks:
And, when they charge, it is with some smart Harangue.
Twill be Renown enough, for these Tongue -- Cohorts,
To praise our Bravery, when it meets Success:
Or, if it fails, teach pliant Law to teize us.

CASSIUS. Enough!- then, Caesar finds us, in the Senate. --

BRUTUS. There, be it lawful, O, immortal Guiders!
To consecrate this Sword, that, once, was Cato's,
To Cato's Death, revenged! and murdered Pompey's.
Draws.
All the Conspitators draw their Swords. CASSIUS. Now, I will ^ive. -- Li^^,
now, becomes a Roman.

BRUTUS. No. -- Let no vain false Hope of Life deceive ye:
Know -- yet despise, your Danger. -- Caesar's Friends
Crowd his tame Senate: -- Ardent, All! and tried,
In Service of their Master, while the People,
The suffe'ring People! pleased at once, and wretched!
Dote on the Tyrant's Heart, whose Hand they fear!
Think, too, it is CAESAR, we presume to wound:
Caesar! who awed an Army, with his Frown!
Our Death, in the Attempt, is fixed as Fate:
But, what a Death! -- How to be wished, and envied!
Dying, that unborn Rome may live, in Liberty!

CASSIUS. How will our Deaths endear yon aweful Capitol!
That Seat of our Oppression, doomed by Heaven,
The Scene of our Revenge!

DECIMUS. -- But, should the People --

CIMBER. Why let the People prate: -- So People will --
Bless the Light Murmurings of their hungry Love!
Poor Gnats! They know, it is Summer, now, with Caesar:
Cloud but his Sunshine -- all their Buzzing ceases.

BRUTUS. Kneel, gener'ous Friends: They kneel, Brutus continues standing. Raise
your Right Hands, to Heaven;
Swear -- by the all-dreaded Powers, to wait my Call:
Nor, till I sound him, touch the Life of Caesar. -- All the Conspirators.
We swear. --

BRUTUS. -- But should he -- (some kind God restrain him!)
Force my afflicted Hand, to point the Way. --
Then, -- by that thin, pale, Flight of Roman Ghosts,
Whose hovering Forms skim over the unburied Bones,
Which the wan Moon sees whit'ning twelve lost Fields!
Their Murderer, if he Reigns, in Rome. All shall die!

CASSIUS. Brutus, kneel with us. -- Rome exempts no Knee:

BRUTUS. Kneels. Blast, Heaven! The Man, who spares a Tyrant's Life!
Be he Son, Patron, Brother, Friend, or -- Father!

BRUTUS. Or Father? -- Cassius!

CASSIUS. Son, Friend, Father, Brother:
Tyrants can Claim no Kindred: They renounce
All social Ties: -- And hate a hating World.
The expanding Soul, that swells a Roman Breast.
Stretched beyond Rights of Blood, attones 'em, All,
By Virtue, Glory, Liberty, and Law.

BRUTUS. Be it, then, SWORN. -- All -- By Earth, and Heaven, we swear.

BRUTUS. Soul-shaking Oath! -- it is past, and, from this Moment,
Rise and put up their Swords. No Man has Parent, Child, or Friend -- but Rome,
If there, among us, shrinks one recreant Slave,
Curse him, ye Gods! For every Guilt of Caesar!
And never let his Race know Comfort, more.
loud Thunder. Hark! the confirming Powers approve my Curse --
Or, testify Dislike, in Peals of Thunder!

CASSIUS. Let 'em call on: The Brave, they know, are ready,

BRUTUS. We meet, then, at the Capitol.

CASSIUS. -- Haste, Decimus --
With heedful Caution, Summon each great Name,
That gilds our Glorious List: -- previous, we meet,
(Immortal Brutus!) in thy aweful Grot.
There, shall thou fan their Fire; confirm their Hearts:
Unite their Purpose, and instruct their Hands:
That one concurring Spirit may direct,
And no Confusion Rise, to blast our Vengeance.

BRUTUS. It Is dreadful! -- But, it is necessary: -- Mark!
When you pale Sun, that, with receding Ray,
Starts from our notic'd Purpose! -- When that Sun,
Slow-measuring, sheds an Hour -- This private Key
Admits you, through the Grove: -- Be punctual All.
Gives Cassius a Key, then, advances to a Statue of Cato. Cato! Lost Soul of
Freedom! Witness form!
Here, I divest my Heart of Love, Grief, Pity,
Of every tender call of pleading Nature,
That moves too soft a Pang.
The Thunder repeated. -- Again! -- It Is Strange!
Why hangs this infelt Weight, upon my Purpose?
Can it be terrible. -- To die for Rome!
What has he left to fear, who saves his Country!
Enter Marcellus, hastily
MARCELLUS. Break off -- or, be prevented: -- Caesar comes.

CASSIUS. Now, let him die.

BRUTUS. -- Avoid him, through that Gallery.

Exeunt Conspirators. SCENE VI.
BRUTUS, CAESAR. CAESAR. With whom do thou retire?

BRUTUS. -- With banished Liberty.

CAESAR. Vain, honest Purposer! Made weak by Virtue!
Thou wrong'st the Friend of every Wish, thou form'st!
Cited by Antony, why came thou not?
Or why, not coming, was Reproach thought needful?
With insolent Contempt of Power above thee?
Find'st thou Delight, in living to offend?
There Is not a Name, in all thy private Friendships,
That is not marked, in public, as my Foe.

BRUTUS. When Foes to Caesar are the Friends of Rome,
May Heaven inspire his Will, to love their Counsel!

CAESAR. Speak out: -- The just Enjoy the Slanderer's Malice,
And weigh their Virtue's Force, by bad Men's Censure.

BRUTUS. All Men confess the Force of Caesar's Virtues:
Resistless Virtues! -- They endear the Chains
Of a submitting World, that smiles, and suffers!

CAESAR. Thou art, thyself, in Chains, and see it not;
Thou art that poorest of blind Slaves -- a Tool!
Whose Bluntness works for Wills, that scorn thy Promptness.
So worked they, once, on Pompey. -- Weak well-meaner.
Driven, yet, too proud to follow! -- Had he conquered,
His flexile Yoke had galled, both Men, and Laws:
Then, what had Brutus been?

BRUTUS. -- Lord of one Dagger.

CAESAR. Fell mind! -- And can there none be found, for Caesar?

BRUTUS. Strike, first -- and blast the distant Possibility!

CAESAR. No. -- Brutus! -- There Is a Power forbids that Blow:
Read this, blind Wanderer! -- Know thyself, and me.
Gives him Servilia's Letter.
BRUTUS. Caesar, I die: -- Punished by Heaven's just Hand,
At once, my Life forsakes me, and my Love.
Pity, when I am gone, and think of -- Brutus:
The Life, you gave him [Starts] will deserve your Care.
Farewell! -- And, for the Father, may the Gods,
To the Son's Heart, transfer the Mother's Love!
Servilia! -- Heaven, Servilia! -- wrote she this?
She did -- and, if I wake, Rome sleeps forever.

CAESAR. I had not thought, till my return from Parthia,
To trust thee with this Secret, of thy Birth:
But to protect Thee, from the Wills of Cassius,
I claim Thee, and Precipitate my Purpose.
Offers to embrace him, who starts back
BRUTUS. Rome! Virtue! Nature!

CAESAR. Nature! young Man, call it
By its sincerer Titles? call it Pride,
Self-soothing. -- Hurl your Bolts, ye Gods! at Faction!
Faction! -- that finds a Power to blot out Nature!

BRUTUS. Spare an astonished Wretch, who lives too long.

CAESAR. Is there, who fears to be the Son of Caesar?
Wretch, say thou? -- to be born the World's next Heir,
And reap the Laurels of a Hundred Victories?

BRUTUS. Oh, Caesar! --

CAESAR. Laboring with a Will to speak,
Some infelt Horror checks thy rising Accents.

BRUTUS. Caesar!

CAESAR. Speak like my Son.

BRUTUS. Would I were dead.

CAESAR. Sounds Death more soft than Son?

BRUTUS. Such if I am,
Brutus, unbow'd to Kings, may kneel to Caesar.
Kneels.
CAESAR. On. --

BRUTUS. Offering his Sword -- Kill me; -- or, forbear to be a King.

CAESAR. Thy very Soul's a Rebel: -- not alone
To Power, but ev'en to Blood: -- unatural Traitor!
Rise, and repent: -- and, when thou think, like Man,
Be owned Rome's Son, and mine: -- till then, be Brutus,
Turning to go.
BRUTUS. Holding his Robe. Oh! stay. -- I never can quit Claim to Caesar:
Hear, if a Father, with a father's Ear;
Or, judge with a Friend's Heart, and ease my Horror.

CAESAR. Leave me. -- My Heart is Adamant: -- Away; --
My Blood grows warm against thee: Dread thy danger.
Be gone -- or, I shall catch Disdain, from Thine,
Till, conquering Pity, to repel Presumption,
To punish Insolence, I push back Nature.
Caesar, at least, was born, to govern Brutus.

BRUTUS. He was -- he was -- but not to govern Rome.

CAESAR. Headstrong Enthusiast! Stubborness, like Thine,
Embroils Republics; and makes Tyrants needful:
Go: join thy savage Friends: chase Fear from Faction:
Bid Guilt sleep safe, in my Contempt of Treachery:
Their Conqueror stands subdued, by his own Mercy:
-- Yet bid their Blindness learn, when Claims contend,
And Rights invaded rouse resenting Realms,
It Is Fierceness, in the Free, most, hazards Freedom.
And Liberty is lost to punish Pride.

Exit Caesar. BRUTUS. Rising Let me not leave him, though Despair has caught me:
But, following, sigh for Rome -- and live for Caesar.
Why was I born to think, and be unblessed,
To license Reason, is to forfeit Rest:
He, who assumes Distinction, calls for Woe;
Peace is a Cottage Claim, and loves the Low.
Nor Shame, nor Trust, nor Envy, finds us, there!
Hearts, filled with Quiet, leave no Void, for Care.

End of the Third Act.
ACT. IV.
SCENE I.
A Grot in the Garden of Brutus. CALPHURNIA, TORBILIUS. CALPHURNIA IT IS near
the appointed Hour:

TORBILIUS. I judge, it is past.

CALPHURNIA. Then Heaven, that loves its Likeness, wake for Caesar,!

TORBILIUS. In this Out-Grot, they meet: -- In that adjoining,
Curio has close concealed his chosen Guard,
Each Moment strengthening, by admitted Files:
Hence vocal Windings, which pervade the Rock,
Swell whispering Sounds to Loudness.

CALPHURNIA. How looked Portia?

TORBILIUS. Sad -- till she heard your animating Name:
Then, like a Sunbeam, radiant through a Mist,
She smiled away her Anguish.

CALPHURNIA. -- At her Approach,
Leave me Torbilius.

TORBILIUS. -- Who then guards you hence?

CALPHURNIA. I marked the impending Ivy, over the Arch --
Grieve, not though Pride repelled thy honest Purpose,
Nor fear the endangering Fate of stubborn Brutus:
My Friendship, in alarming Portia's dread,
Will caution, and preserve him. -- Go: -- she is here.
[Exit Toroilius bowing to Portia, whom he meets entering.

SCENE II.
CALPHURNIA, PORTIA. PORTIA. This mournful Grot never touched my Taste till now:
But present Friends bring Sunshine to the Soul.
And Seats of Horror change to Scenes of Bliss.
'Twas fortunate, thou call'dst thy Portia, hither!
Brutus is sad today, and Purposes
Retirement, here, beneath this sullen Shade:
Our Presence will relieve him.

CALPHURNIA. -- Stop him, Portia!
Let me not find him: -- save my Eyes that Horror!

PORTIA. Good Heaven! -- what has he done?

CALPHURNIA. Stay not, to ask:
Even that lost Moment may be fatal to him.
Go; bid him guard his Ear from cruel Cassius:
Time will permit no more; go warn him -- save him. --
If thou delay'st a Moment, Fate o'ertakes him;
And staying but, till Cassius comes -- he dies.

PORTIA. Be clear in Pity to my beating Heart;
Brutus has been traduced. -- He loathes all Falsehood*

CALPHURNIA. Shunning the Falsehood loathed, he may be safe.

PORTIA. He comes. -- Now, hear him justify his Fame,
From this foul Charge -- and vindicate thy Goodness.

CALPHURNIA. No. -- It Is thy Weight must shake his concious Soul.
Save his endangered Name, and bless my Notice.

PORTIA. I cannot move: -- forgive my trembling Knees,
My Heart restrains their Power.

CALPHURNIA. Alas! I pity Thee:
Rest, and recall thy Spirits, and receive him.
Aside. Now, to my fatal Post. --

Exit. SCENE III.
PORTIA. alone. After an astonished Pause. -- Some dreadful Meaning!
And my too wakeful Fears confirm it just:
Cassius, of late, with warm, assiduous Art,
Flatters my Brutus, whom his Envy shunned:
Cassius is wily, proud, malicious, bitter!
Burns, with ungoverned Hate: and brooks not Caesar.
Associate Vice may taint the soundest Virtue:
And Honor bleeds, should Caesar fall by Brutus!
Not that my patriot Heart disclaims the Roman!
I, who was born to Liberty's great Guardian,
By right of Nature, shun tyrannic Sway:
Yet Brutus -- twice offending -- twice forgiven,
Twice, forfeited to Caesar's Clemency,
His own lost rights to Justice: -- should he, then,
Quench the kind Light, he lives by, the rash Murderer
Kills his own Fame, and dies to every Virtue;

SCENE IV.
PORTIA, BRUTUS BRUTUS. Who called thee hither Portia?

PORTIA. Rome's kind Gods.

BRUTUS. In Haste they summoned, and, in Haste they left thee.
Was it, because they saw Calphurnia with thee?
And shun Society with Caesar's Friends?

PORTIA. Never may the Gods forsake the Friends of Caesar,
Since Brutus more than all Men, such, by Gratitude,
Merits Protection from the Powers, who love it. --
Does Cassius move in Grots?

BRUTUS. Why ask'st thou that?

PORTIA. Romans, who meditate the Death of Caesar,
And owe him not their Lives, may mean no Murder.

BRUTUS. Torbilius is a Traitor: -- Rome is bought,
And all those guardian Gods, who loved her Liberty.
Forsake her, and support the Cause of Caesar.

PORTIA. Rome bought? -- and Traitors? -- If I watch thy Look:
Rage, and Despair, have dimmed thy Eyes with Anguish,
If I regard thy Language, -- Death dwells, there,
And, like a Groan, at Midnight, frights my Fancy.
Stay I would ask.

BRUTUS. Ask nothing; -- it is a Time
For Action: -- keep thy Words for idler moments [is going.

PORTIA. Holding him. Hark! it is thy Fate, that calls the.

BRUTUS. I have heard it:
Why would thou thus restrain me? -thoughtless Portia!
Be wiser. -- All the Lives of Rome's best Friends
Demand me! Theirs the Fate, that calls! -- Away: --
Honor, and Oaths, and Death, and Glory -- call me.

PORTIA. Still holding him. By Heaven! you go not, till you first relieve me,
From this dark Torment, which your Words implant:
I Will know, what Friends? what Oaths?

BRUTUS. Loosen thy Hold:
Nay, if thou stay'st me, my unwilling Strength
Must break ungently from this ill-timed Rashness.
Forces himself away
PORTIA. With a Dagger Turn, Brutus! turn, -- regard this silent Pleader?
If thou would wish to spare the Breast of Portia,
Dread the determined Hand of Cato's Daughter.

BRUTUS. What would thy Madness hint? what means that dagger*

PORTIA. Pointing a Dagger to her Breast. Stir, not a Step. -- Thy first vain
Start to seize me,
Plunges Deliverance to my rescued Heart,
Which unconfiding Brutus loves to torture.

BRUTUS. What would thy Soul-distracting Purpose frame?

PORTIA. The bloody Secret, thou conceal'st from Portia,
Thou shar'st, with every vulgar Friend of Rome.

BRUTUS. Suspended, and amazed. Why would thou bid me license future Scorn,
To haunt my hated Name? -- Make me not faithless,
Lest Songs teach Times to come my Hearts fond weakness;
That, to a Woman's Tongue, resigned a Secret,
Which sunk the World's last Hope; -- and gave up Rome.

PORTIA. Where sleeps the Spirit of thy stern Forefather?
Whose awful Firmness, sculptured into Life,
Frowning through Stone, disclaims degenerate Rome!
Teach him, some God! that CATO called Me Daughter*
Brutus believes me light, like vulgar Woman!
Oh! -- 'twas for this, the sorrowing Shade resought me;
Hinted Futurity, through mystic Night,
And showed me, Brutus would be Mine -- no more.
Find, in that dreadful Warning, how HE judged:
Feel, what he thought of his own Portia's Daring.
Trusting the Fortitude, he gave -- HE knew,
That Cato's Daughter could not dread to hear
The worst, that Cato's Spirit dared to tell.

BRUTUS. Generous, I know thou art; -- But thou art Woman:
Secrets of State, and Blood, o'erload your Minds.

PORTIA. It Is the false Reasoning of a Sex, that wrongs us:
Why should a Secret's weight o'erload the Heart
Of Portia -- yet, disturb not that of Brutus?
All, thou can wish me, thou shall find, I am:
All, thou can suffer, thou shall feel, I dare.
Poorly, perhaps, thou think, the Fear of Wounds,
And Pain, and Sword's, and threatening Death, might shake me!
-- Judge, -- by this willing Blow --
Strikes the Dagger into her Left Arm, which Brutus, advancing swiftly,
snatches from her. " -- off -- off -- by Heaven
Thy Failure had transferred it to my Heart.
Learn, from this bleeding Proof, that, -- when I shrink
from Thoughts of Death, I fear not for my own.

BRUTUS. What has thy Pride's ill-grounded Rashness done!
Oh! let me Mend that error of thy Hand: --
Bind up the ungentle Wound, and call Aid to thee.

PORTIA. Never! -- tho'Death divide us! -- Never -- never
Shall Portia veil this Mark, how Brutus loved her;
Till, to Redeem her Life, he trusts her Virtue.

BRUTUS. Perish the Pride of such a dear-bought Fame,
As costs my widowed Heart the Life of Portia!
-- Read that dire List.
Gives her the Roll. Till my Return conceal it:
And weigh those mighty Names, against ONE Caesar.

PORTIA Permitting Brutus to bind her Arm with his Handkerchief. Must Caesar
die?

BRUTUS. -- It Was sworn.

PORTIA. -- Did Brutus swear.

BRUTUS. He did: -- A dreadful Oath! -- ask what, hereafter*
Bound to the Gods, those angry Souls of Rome.
Submitting to my Hand, the public Vengeance,
Kill Caesar, instant, -- or permit his Life,
As Brutus warrants, or withholds, the Blow.

PORTIA. Then, Caesar cannot die. -- He pardoned Brutus.

BRUTUS. Oh! I could tell thee Wonders! -- But the Help,
I fly to send thee. -- and their forfeit Lives,
Whose Rashness I must warn, permit no more.
Portia, farewell: -- If e're we meet again,
I will complain, of thy impatient Ardor,
And thou shall justify the Heart of Brutus.

Exit hastily SCENE V.
PORTIA. (alone.) PORTIA. Live, Caesar! live, and reign! -- Though Cato's Blood.
Calls for Revenge; -- and a whole People's Rights,
Usurped, absolve one bold Assumer's Fall; --
The Hand of Brutus must not stain Rome's Justice;
Nor, with detested Murder, pay back Mercy.
Peruses the Paper. Heaven! what confederate Power! what Names, least likely,
Start from this dreadful Roll, and threaten Caesar!
-- Would I were still a Stranger to this Secret!
Yet, that unknown, -- who had dissuaded Brutus?
Is he dissuaded? -- let me weigh that Question.
Who knows but, while I speak, the appointed Hour
Impends! -- It DOES! -- Farewell, he said -- and left me!
Farewell! -- then added -- if again we meet!
IF! -- Heaven! what meant that if?- it is plain he doubted,
Whether we ever were to meet, or No!

SCENE VI.
To PORTIA, enter CALPHURNIA, with TORBILIUS, CURIO, and Soldiers. CALPHURNIA.
Never, unhappy Portia! -- Far divided
Be Innocence like Thine, from Guilt and Murder!
Teach thy reluctant Heart, to give up Brutus:
For never will thy Eyes behold him more.
Portia fixed in Amazement, lets fall the Roll, which Torbilius takes up, looks
into, and offers to Calphurnia. Let not the hated Scroll pollute my Touch!
Fly with it, hence -- bear it, with Speed to Caesar:
Tell him, Torbilius! how the Gods have saved him:

TORBILIUS. Happy, to miss thy Name, loved Brutus, here!
Well-vers'd in Caesar's Pity, -- glad, I go.

Exit. SCENE VII.
PORTIA, CALPHURNIA, SOLDIERS. PORTIA. Oh! --

CALPHURNIA. Wife of Brutus!

PORTIA. -- Chilled to Stone, by Horror,
Kindly, thou wak'st me, with that powerful Name.
And my recov'ring Breath implores thy Mercy.

CALPHURNIA. The Wife of Caesar speaks: Absolve her Justice:
Had the too dreadul Danger been Calphurnia's,
Then, had my willing Pity met thy Prayer:
Saved, whom thou love, and lost a Third vain Mercy,
But thou have heard it! Brutus murders Caesar!
-- Yes Cassius! -- bloody Cassius! -- I have wronged thee:
The Foe but wished Revenge: -- The Friend resolved it.

PORTIA. What does thy angry Virtue mean to do?

CALPHURNIA. -- Blast his vowed Guilt, and force him to be safe.
Round, from the neighboring Grot, rush Caesar's friends,
Rapid for Interception: -- If they find him,
Try thy wished Power: reclaim his Will, from Cassius,
Whom if his Fate has driven him, now, to join,
By all my Fear for Caesar's Life -- he dies!

PORTIA. Detain him, all ye Powers, who pity Woe!

Enter Curio with other Soldiers. CURIO. Vain was our speed: -- There is an
Iron Door,
That, opening to a Vault, beneath these Rocks,
Leads toward the Aemilian Baths: -- 'scap'd through that Passage,
E'ere now, he rises in the Shade of Rome.

Portia faints. CALPHURNIA. To a Soldier. See! the unhappy Sufferer faints! --
support her:
To Curio, in a lower Voice. Mean Time, while slow-returning Sense forsakes
Her pitied Ear, whose Sighs my Soul deplores,
Curio! -- The blank Commision, Caesar gave thee,
Claims, from my Hand, a Name, to guide thy Duty:
Receives the Table Book, from Curio, writes in, and returns it to him. Brutus
becomes the Void, with bloody Grace;
Take it, and know thy Hour.

PORTIA. Blessed, ye kind Rocks!
Blessed, be your guardian Echos! That have swelled
Death's Murmurings to my Ear: -- If my Strength fail
Home, on the Wings of Love, and Fear, I Will fly: [not,
Brutus shall live; and every God shall guard him.
Starts up and goes out.
CALPHURNIA. Restrain her, Curio! -- The preventive Love,
This weeping Virtue bears her sentenced Lord,
Would warm him from the Fate, his Guilt compells.
Curio brings her back. Come -- guide the afflicted Trembler to my Palace.

PORTIA. No. -- Kill me, here: -- Earth has no Place, so fit
For Portia's Death, as where her Brutus left her:
Art thou a Soldier? hear me: -- All the Brave
Have Hearts to weep the Woe, their Hands have caused.
But Man is cruel. -- Hear, Calphurnia! -- Thou
Art Woman: -- Thou art Caesar's tender Wife.
Measure another's Mis'ery, by thy own.
Pause but, to think thyself the Wife of Brutus;
'Twill plead my Cause, and force thee to forgive.

CALPHURNIA. Could Portia so forgive the sought, sworn, Death
Of Him, beyond whose Life she shuns to live?
Knock at thy own Heart's Door, and find mine justified:
Yet, bleeds my social Soul, and feels thy Fate;
Poor, suffering Excellence! And wretch, unguilty!

PORTIA. Oh! I can never by a Wretch, by Thee!
I am thy Friend:- Dwell on that Thought, Calphurnia:
Even, when the CRADLE claimed me, I was Thine:
Sorrows, and Pains, must come: -- They come to All,
But, sure! they should not come from those, we love.

CALPHURNIA They cannot come from Love:-They may from Justice.

PORTIA. Let Foes, and Strangers be, severely Just:
Friendship declines to punish, though it is wronged.

CALPHURNIA. Think of the present Hour.

PORTIA. Think of the Past;
When prattling Childhood, yet, had learnt no Power,
To lisp its little Meanings, into Sense;
Stammering our untaught Instinct, Side by Side,
We wandered, fearful of each other's Fall,
And tripp'd, and smiled, and tottered, into Love.
Scarce felt our ripening Years a Sense of Woe:
'Twas Foreign, all -- for all, within, was Peace.
While the divided City, round us, glowed
With cruel Discord, and domestic Rage;
Even, while our dearest Friends took different Sides,
And Civil Fury shook the partial Soul:
We, still superior, to a Nation's Hate!
Smiled on -- confided, mixed embracing Minds;
And all our Contest was -- which, most, should Love.

CALPHURNIA. Why would thou, thus, recall past Hours of Joy?
Those were the sunshine Days, of Mirth, and Peace.
Now, it is all win'try Darkness, -- War, and Blood!

PORTIA. Brutus is dear to Portia.

CALPHURNIA. -- Not less dear
Is Godlike Caesar, to Calphurnia's Soul.

PORTIA. If Brutus lives.

CALPHURNIA. -- Caesar, he swore, must die.

PORTIA. Cruel Impatience! Not to hear Distress!

CALPHURNIA. Patient I heard, till he confessed it sworn:
Heard, till he told thee, -- each dire Murderer dared
Vow Caesar dead, -- when Brutus Wills it done.

PORTIA. Brutus will not.

CALPHURNIA. -- Away- 'twas Sworn, 'twas SWORN.
Hear that, all-judging Heaven! And think, by whom^!
Ingratitude's a Guilt, that startles Nature,
And, with a Fury's Foulness, stains Mankind!
Constrain her, Curio! -- Force her gently, on:

PORTIA. Stay, Stay -- I will be heard, -- cruel Calphurnia!

CALPHURNIA. Alas! What would thou say?

PORTIA. -- Would I could tell!
Would I were skilled in Woe, to touch thy Pity!
Perhaps, I should be Humbler? -- Teach me, tell me.
Oh! I Am not stubborn. -- If the Queen of Caesar,
Waits for the bended Knee; and, looking down
To suppliant Homage, tastes the Flatterer's Prayer:
See! Portia, prostrate on the Dust, implores thee,
Kneels. See her Soul agoniz'd, -- and ease her Terrors.
Grant him but Life! Spare his mistaking Virtue:
Banish him -- far from Rome, and Power, and Caesar.
To unhous'd Seythia's bleakest Wilds, expose him:
Leave him one -- one -- but one! Sad, humble Shelter!
His Portia's aching Bosom! -- Never -- ah? -- Never,
Will she forsake him! -- Off, ye glittering Trifles!
Tears off her Jewels. Ye Toys! That help to blind unblessed Distinction!
Come -- in their Place -- Despair! Affliction! Penitence!
Be these my Claims! -- For these my Brutus shares in.
Shuddering, and bare, I Will trace the unsheltry Desert
Tread the bleak Wilderness of Want, unsighing,
Unwishing Comfort, and content with Pain.
Sleepless, myself, I Will watch his weary Slumbers,
Feed his pale Fire, hang over his heedless Bosom:
Break ye rude Snow-drifts, which the Storm blows round him,
And love him into Taste of safe Distress.

CALPHURNIA. To the Soldiers. Why will ye wound Compassion, by Delay?
The Sorrows of a suffering Friend, are Torture,
None, but a Devil, at once can cause, and bear.
Relieve me, and, with tenderest Force, obey.

PORTIA. To the Soldiers, Reverence, ye Slaves of Power! The Race of Cato:
His unsubmitting Soul survives, in mine:
And swells against Compulsion.
Soldiers step back. -- Dare not think,
I dread to die. -- But know, that Portia's Death
Shall be the Choice of Portia.
At a Signal from Calphurnia, they seize her Hands. -- Hope, as soon,
To claim impassive Spirit! -- High Disdain,
Resisting Insult, at a Thousand Doors,
Can let out Life, and laugh at vain Restraint!
I will, with stubborn Pain, imprison Breath,
And burst, indignant, from a World, that holds me.
I will, on stony Pavements, hard and cold,
As deaf Calphurnia! Dash my dizzy Brain:
I Will swallow Fire: -- Rend, with impatient Teeth,
This suffering Flesh, and plunge from hated Light:
Unhand me, Torturers! Murderers! -- Help! HELP!
I will extend my Voice, if Brutns hears not,
Till the forgetful Gods are roused to Justice!

CASSIUS. From the Garden. Where are you? say! Whence flowed that suffering
Sound?

PORTIA. Blessed be the attentive Powers! -- It Is Cassius calls.

CASSIUS. Without. Haste, Cimber! Join Marcellus; guard the Postern:
Cross those armed Enter'ers, e're they reach the Grove:
Fabius! -- Fulgentius!

CALPHURNIA. Save me, righteous Jove!

CURIO. Scorn this new Terror. Think, whose conquering Fortune
Summons a Sword, untaught to wrong his Cause.

Exeunt Curio, and Soldiers, drawing their Swords. CALPHURNIA. Heaven guard my
Caesar,

PORTIA. Save my Brutus, Gods!

Clashing of Swords heard, without. SCENE VIII.
CALPHURNIA, PORTIA, CASSIUS, CASSIUS. Entering. Guard well those Priso'ners,
while I --
Starts. Calphurnia, here!
Nay then, some Villian has betrayed our Cause.

PORTIA. Torbilius bears your listed Names to Caesar,
And Brutus, if you save him not, must die.

CASSIUS. Freedom has Friends, in Heaven, too strong for Caesar;
No Note of Danger, ever, more shall reach
The Tyrant's watchful Ear: -- Rome's vowed Avenger's,
Now, at his Entrance to the insulted Senate,
Led on, by Liberty's returning Gods,
Shall, there, appease them, with his offered Blood.

Exit hastily. SCENE. IX.
CALPHURNIA. Aside. Hold firm my frighted Heart! It Is but a Moment!
Suffering with Dignity, disgrace not Glory:
Even, in this dreadful Turn, preserve thy Greatness
Nor let thy trembling Fears, alarmed for Caesar,
Lose the Distinction, due to Caesar's Wife.
Advances to Portia. Portia! A Change, like this, might prompt weak Minds,
To justify Despair, and give up Virtue.
But I, who trust the Gods, with good Men's Safety,
Know, that, in Caesar's Triumphs, Heaven but guards
The assaulted Greatness, which, Itself, inspired:
Rising against Distress, Calphurnia smiles
At Traitor's Threats, and brightens from Eclipse.
Fearless, to persevere her Lord has taught her;
And, from meant Evil, force unwilling Good.
All, Thou must hope, when Caesar's cloudless Star
Meets, and shines through, and burns above this Tempest;
Is -- that my Sentence may remain suspended,
Till the Dictator's never-wearied Mercy
Pours Penitence, on the touched Heart of Brutus.

PORTIA. Slow Blessings come too late, and bring new Curses:
This, but a Moment past, had saved us, Both:
Now, Portia rules not, here: -- It Is angry Cassius:
The proud Conspirators possess my Gates,
And Brutus, absent, leaves me to their Power,
He flew, to warn those rash, discovered, Romans:
But hasty Rage makes frustrate every Care.
-- Yet, claim what e're my Weakness can: -- It Is due
To kind Forgiveness of a Friend's first Fault:
To our past Wish's, and our present Fears:
For, ah! Who knows, what dire Events impend,
To blast eluded Hope, and make both wretched?
-- Come, to my Chamber, let us sadly move,
Pensive, from Fear, and terrified for Love:
There, let us mourn Ambition's restless Rage,
And mutual Mise'ry mutual Help engage.

CALPHURNIA, Warm, from my willing Heart, I join that Prayer,
Never may Ambition waste a good Man's Care!
Vain are his Hopes reluctant Foes to bless:
And still, the more his Toils, his Praise the less.

End of the Fourth ACT.
ACT.V.
SENEI.
A Court before the Capitol. CASSIUS, CIMBER, CINNA, CASCA. CIMBER. Sure! Never
Day ran back, like this, before!
So sweet a Dawn, so changed, at once to Tempest:

CASSIUS. Changed, like the Fate of Rome! Above, it is Sunshine:
Beneath, it is, all, due Darkness! -- Senate's Power
Shall brighten, and plebeian Clouds ride low.
What hasty Footstep that?

CIMBER. -- It Is Decimus!

Enter Decimus. CASSIUS. Alone! Why comes not Brutus?

DECIMUS. -- Near thy House
I met him hastening to suppend our Meeting:
And urged the general Cause, that claimed his Presence.

CASSIUS. He should not, yet, have heard of Portia's Danger,
Nor Caesar's Warrant, found. --

DECIMUS. I told no more
Than that Torbilius, trusted with our Names,
Lodged 'em, in Caesar's Hand. -- So, what, before,
Was common Glory, common Safety, now,
Demanded instant: -- therefore, here we met,
No more to part, till Rome, or Caesar fall.

CASSIUS. Heard he that, firmly?

DECIMUS. He Is at Hand, to join us.

CASSIUS. Then Fate is Ours: And this proud Climber's Height
Sinks to the Level, where his Name shall rot:
Mark, with what Ease a Tyrant's Empire falls!
But yesterday, this Man's exalted Praise
Trod on the Stars: and Caesar was a God!
To Day, the insulting Foot of Rome shall spurn him,
And mix his powerless Ashes with the Dust.

CIMBER. Hark! Was not that a Scream?

CASSIUS. Some Prophet Raven,
That, conscious, on the Dome's high moold'ring Roos,
Feels, and foretells, that Caesar's Ghost is rising.
A Noise heard, without, like the Fall of a Building
CIMBER. Some horrid Ruin that!

CASSIUS. Look out, good Decimus.

DECIMUS. Looking out Amazement! The long, venerable, Line
Of Statues, -- All Rome's old, and aweful Chiefs
Lie fallen! And shapeless Fragments load the Floor!
Long, and loud Thunder.
CIMBER. Shoud not a Change, like this, that mixes Palaces
With the up heaving Center, at the Moment,
When our bold Purpose moves, alarm our Caution?

CASSIUS. Blow, till ye burst, ye big-mouth'd Menacers!
It Is but a Breeze, to Hearts, inflamed for Glory.

CIMBER. Breeze! -- In such Breezes, Furies imp their Wings
Death! The Storm howls, as if the Winds felt Envy;
And woudd out-mouth the Thunder! -- Call ye This
A Breeze? -- my Feet want Steadiness! -- The Pavement,
Heaved, in disjointed Surge, rolls loose beneath me.

CASSIUS. By Heaven, it is Glorious Ruin! -- Round our Heads
Fall Rome's imperial Turrets: -- Earthquake, and Tempest
Plow the mixed Elements: Noises, far heard,
Live, in the Winds, and Voice the frantic Air.
Day darkens: and the Eye of Heaven seems quenched.
Nature's wide-loos'ning Fabric shakes, about us!
While we, with Nerves of Steel, press on to Vengeance.
Oh! my brave Friends! What future Fame is Ours!
What Cato could not -- what nor Asia's Aid,
Nor Pompey's failing Fleets -- not tawny Afric,
With all her Sun-defying Swarms of War!
We few -- we, Roman Few -- have done -- this Day!

CIMBER. One Way, or other, we shall serve the Senate:
Living, we set it free. -- And, if we die,
We teach it to vote safe; -- and rail, in private.

DECIMUS. See! What a pensive Visage Brutus brings!

CASSIUS. Save us! He looks, as if the tumbling Statues
Had crushed him into Cowardice!

SCENE II.
CASSIUS, CIMBER, DECIMUS, CINNNA, CASCA, BRUTUS. BRUTUS. Rome's lost.

CIMBER. Then, Coesar timely warned, has shunned his Danger.

BRUTUS. No. -- The last Thing, Caesar will shun, is Danger.
-- Roman's! Att^nd; and weep your Country's Fate:
I swore the Death of Caesar: -- Curse me not,
Ye Parent Gods! -- I thought it due, to Rome.
To Law -- to Liberty -- to Man's lost Rights;
To Power's Restraint, and a delivered World.
The Hour -- the dreadful Hour, high Heaven! I named!
Even now, its, last dire Moment calls on Brutus:
And now, even now, Brutus is Caesar's -- SON!
Conspirator's, all start, and look down, in a speechless Astonishment.
BRUTUS after a long Pause. Servilia was in secret wedlock joined --
And gave He^self, and me -- to Caesar's Love.
Conspirators still silent, fixed, and amazed.
BRUTUS. After another short Pause. Is there a Roman, so benumbed of Soul,
So firm, so passionless, so steeled a Stoic!
So nerv'd, beyond all vulgar Strength of Man!
That he dares urge what Brutus swore to do?
Cassius! -- Thou tremblest. --

CASSIUS. Thou shall tremble, too,
At the last Counsel, I will live, to give thee.

BRUTUS. Think, e're thou speak -- for Nature is at Stake;
And, listening, dreads the Advice, thou dare obtrude.

CASSIUS. Mark then -- were Brutus of Plebeian Mould,
Cassius would say, serve on: The Tyrant Son
Should aid the Ambition of the Tyrant Father.
Rome had but marked two Caesar's for one Fate.
But thou were born her Friend -- thy Name is Brutus,
And every Brutus breathed, to bless Mankind.
Thy changeless Heart, inflexible for Virtue,
Patriots a Tyrant Blood, though drawn from Caesar.

BRUTUS. Be dumb -- be warned -- 'twere impious more to hear thee,

CASSIUS. Nay mark -- thou know what Cataline proposed,
When, with a Rebel Hand, he shook his Country:

BRUTUS. I know it, Cassius!

CASSIUS. -- On that lawless Day,
When, desperate, he presumed an Act, like Caesar's,
Suppose -- all -- wily, with a Tyrant's Craft,
This Catiline had claimed thee, for his Son?

BRUTUS. Roman thou wrong'st me. --

CASSIUS. Call me, then no Roman:

BRUTUS. It Was a disgraceful Question: -- It implied, --
A Brutus might be bribed, to wrong his Country.

CASSIUS. Caesar yet lives. --

BRUTUS. -- Caesar -- and Catiline!
Gods! -- what Disparities thou yok'st together!
-- That Caesar's Policy not feigns me His,
Learn -- I have Proof, too plain. -- Servilia spoke
Spoke, from the Shades of Death, and owned me Caesar's.

CASSIUS. Did her Ghost tell this Dream?

BRUTUS. The Dream is Thine,
Light Cassius! -- She confessed it, in her Letter:

CASSIUS. Caesar has Arts, beyond thy honest reaching, --
But, let it pass -- Caesar is Caesar, still; --
Be Bru^us cheated, by his Tale, or no --
He no less guilty. -- Thou no less a Roman.

BRUTUS. If he is my Father. --

CASSIUS. Rome was still his Mother:
Where lives a bolder Paricide, than Caesar?

BRUTUS. Away -- my shrinking Soul abhors thy Purpose!
If I am Caesar's Son, Caesar, to me,
Is faultless: -- Nature made me not his Judge.
And, till Rome's Gods redeem her, Brutus dares not.

CASSIUS. If Duty binds -- thy Soul was Son to Cato:
He formed thy Truth, thy Firmness, and thy Virtue:
He taught thee to revere the Gods, thou swor'st by:
And feel the sacred Force, that firms on Oath.

BRUTUS. Perish an Oath -- against the Birth, I breathe by!

CASSIUS. Thou but contribut'st Faith, to help Deceit!
Thou art not -- can not be -- the Son of Caesar:
I know, thou art not.

BRUTUS. Cassius! -- If I am!
-- What Clash of Contradictions rends my Soul!
Horror, and Piety, divide my Virtue,
Save Caesar, all ye Gods! -- But save Rome from him,

CASSIUS. Caesar must not be safe, -- Or, Rome must fall.

BRUTUS. Oh, Cassius! partial Hatred weighs unjustly:
Mercy so tempers his Pretense to Power,
That Tyranny grows safe -- and looks, like Freedom.

CASSIUS There is an awful Equity, that towre's
Above Men's private Passions: -- Tyrants die. --
And Sons of Tyrants want their Father's Virtues:
Then bleeds a groaning State! and Right, and Rapine
Descend from Heir to Heir, for ten red Ages,
E're comes Another Caesar. -- Hence, 'us Mercy,
When One Man dies, to save the Blood of Nations.

BRUTUS. Dies, Cassius! -- by a SON! -- Oh! righteous Heaven!
Ayert the impending Horror! -- Foe to Nature,
Hint it no more -- Or, Brutus, turns the Sword,
Thou point'st at Caesar's Life -- against thy own.

CASSIUS, I Have heard I am too hasty! -- Judge me Romans: --
You, who have seen the Proof, that Heaven has lent me;
Judge, to what daring Length, this rash, blind, Man
Provokes his Friend's Impatience: -- Let that punish thee.
Gives him Caesar's Table Book. Read there, what envied Rights thy Birth derives
From Caesar's Blood -- who, thus, could sentence Thine.

BRUTUS. Reading. "Wronged Caesar claims Redress from Curio's Sword'
"Be this his Warrant for dispatching -- Brutus.
-- If this was Caesar's, he believed me not
His Son. -- and I have treated Truth, unkindly,

CASSIUS. Yes -- thou have thanked us well! -- these Friends! -- this Cassius,
Who in the Grove, from Caesar's Murderers, saved
Doomed Portia, thy Beloved! on Death's dire Verge.
And seizing Curio, found that Warrant with him.

BRUTUS. Reviewing the Warrant. By Heaven! it is Caesar's Hand.

CASSIUS, -- It Is Caesar's Heart:
He judged the Virtue, like his own-Disguise:
So tried Corruption's Power -- and held out Hope
Of proud Succession: Thou, if Caesar's Son.
Were Heir to Caesar's Empire. -- Failing, there,
He found One surer Way: -- Marius, his Uncle,
Had taught him, that dead Foes resist no longer.

BRUTUS. Oh! it is all, too plain! -- Come, Cassius! Cimber!
Decimus! Casca! Cinna! -- Guardian Friends?
Dwell in my Bosom; share the Joy, you give:
Help me to thank the Gods, I Am once more Brutus?
Oh; I could play the Wanton -- let loose Pleasure; --
Laugh with the light: grow thoughtless, and forget
Rome's Danger, for a Day -- to Cherish Rapture!
Now, where is the Tempest?- where is the Thunder, Now?
Loud let it rend, unfear'd, the Arch of Heaven:
It Is ominous, no longer: -- let it roar
Delightful? Brutus is no Son of Caesar!
That! let it swell that Sound? -- let it to Earth,
Air -- Heaven, and lowest Hell's lost Hope -- proclaim,
That Roman Brutus is not SON to Caesar.

CASSIUS. Thank the kind Gods, who saved thee from such Horror.

BRUTUS. Indulgent Heaven! were I like happier Roman's,
Nature had now set free my patriot Hand,
And Brutus were again, but Friend to Caesar.

CASSIUS: Time calls; -- the Senate waits us.

BRUTUS. Stay, stay Cassius!
I feel, I know not what, of Nameless Doubting,
Still, hovering dark, and slack'ning half my Heart:
Oh! I am, yet, his Son. -- A Friends a Father:
And That kind Title has been, ever, Caesar's.
Trumpet heard at a distance. Help Heaven! that Trumphet calls him to his Fate!
Fly, Decimus? prevent him: court him hither:
For the last Time, I Will press my Power, to save him.

CASSIUS. Think -- how exposed thou leave the Friends of Rome!

BRUTUS. If I betray you, may the Gods, I swore by,
Revenge your Cause! and Rome renounce my Name!

CASSIUS. On thy known Truth, deserted we depend:
Fixed in Belief, as if those Gods, invoked,
Stood Pledges for thy Purpose. -- On to the Senate.

Exeunt all, except Brutus. BRUTUS. alone. Immortal Taskers of this fatal
Moment!
Free my entangled Thoughts from gathering Darkness,
And let Rome's safety flow from Caesar's Will!
-- He comes -- Oh, Shade of Cato! guard my Virtue

SCENE III.
BRUTUS, CAESAR. and LICTORS. CAESAR. To the Lictors. Retire, and wait within:
-- I would be private.
Exeunt Lictors. They tell me, thou have Secrets to impart:
What are they?

BRUTUS. -- May the Soul of Rome inspire me!

CAESAR. Will thou be Son to Caesar?

BRUTUS. -- Caesar's Son, --
With Pride -- if Caesar will be Son of Rome. --

CAESAR. Again? -- persumptous Weakness! know thy Duty:
Whether would popular Pretension drive Thee?

BRUTUS. To live for Liberty -- Or die for Glory:

CAESAR. Thou mean a Substance, but thou serv'st a Name.

BRUTUS. Rome's Senate held her Freedom more than Name.

CAESAR. Her Senate, rich and proud, oppressed her People:
Her People, poor and headstrong, spurned their Yoke:
Hence, rose the new Necessity, thou see not,
Of some unformal, Self-supporting Sword,
To cut Sedition boldly, to it is Root,
And rectify the crooked Growth of Empire.
This done -- regenerate Rome grown fit f^r Liberty,
Make it thy future Gift: -- and, therefore reign.
Now, it is Seditian's Cloak. -- Her Trumpet's Call,
That State-disturbers arm by.

BRUTUS. Teach the Senate
These found Defects; and shape their wished Redress,
Theirs is the Right to think, for counseled Rome:
Caesar a King -- Were all his Virtues Stars,
Rome's Rights invading, makes his Virtues -- Crimes.
Caesar a Citizen, protecting Law,
Mixed with the People, reigns the People's God.

CAESAR. What Law? what People? -- Government grew Graft,
And Violation throve by Law's Protection:
Power's tottering Balance shall be fixed more justly.

BRUTUS. What single Hand has Right to fix Rome's Scale?

CAESAR. All Men have Nature's Right, to bless their Country.

BRUTUS. Blessings are Insuits, if by Force, imposed.

CAESAR. Then Heaven, that blessed an unconcurring World,
Insulted Nature's Freedom.

BRUTUS. Give up the Stubborn;
Trust Rome to Rome; and Freedom, to the God.

CAESAR. Errors that spring from Pity, call for Pity.

BRUTUS. Pity thy Country's Tears: the Groans of Millions!

CAESAR. I did. -- and, therefore, I assumed Dominion.

BRUTUS. Dominion adds no Fame to Worth like Caesar's:
Nature proclaimed Thee Noblest. -- Deeds, like thine,
Raise their Performer's Rank, till King sounds poorly,
Times purple plunderers, All, shall steal thy Name,
And bid their proudest Title be but -- Caesar.

CAESAR. Surphace, without a Depth! -- false Patriots, thus,
Busied in Forms, let slip the Soul of Purpose!
While with delusive Toil, thou plow'st for Freedom,
Cheated by factious Seed, thou sow'st but Slavery.
Against One fansied Tyrant, blindly warmed,
Thou, for a Hundred, help'st to curse thy Country.

BRUTUS. They curse their Country, who disturb her Peace;
And march their iron Legions, over her Bosom.

CAESAR. I showed thee, obstinate, persisting Rebel!
Peace had no Root, in Rome: -- Her Rights were Forms:
Her Senate -- a loud Hive of insect Kings;
That robbed, and stung: and called Oppression -- Privilege.
Their lawful sovereign Lord, the People -- Slaves:
Slaves! in the Mockery of imagined Freedom!
See thy Misguiders rightly. -- Trust a Father:
Affection cannot injure: -- Thou art pale!
Look on me Brutus! -- What new Dream disturbs thee?

BRUTUS. -- Wake me some Roman God!

CAESAR. -- Wake thee, to feel
Nature's lost Power.

BRUTUS, -- I feel it All, for Caesar.

CAESAR. What would thou teach my Doubts to apprehend?

BRUTUS. Vengeance, and Death, from Romans.

CAESAR. Vengeance is Mine:
I won it in the Field, -- to throw it back, --
And scorned the unmanly Trophy: Death is my Friend:
Come, when it will -- it is but discharge from Care:
It Is but to 'scape false Fears, and real Sorrows,
It Is but to rest from Wrongs, and rise to Glory.

BRUTUS. There Is not an unbought Roman, in the Senate,
But meditates thy Murder.

CAESAR. Murderers, Brutus;
Kill their own Character: -- He, whom they strike,
Dies, to his Memory's Profit. -- All, they can dare,
When they attempt like Men, -- like Man, Itll meet.

BRUTUS. But should they mean some dark, dishonest Blow?

CAESAR. Then Heaven, that hates the base, will strike the Strikers.

BRUTUS. If thou can fear, fear All.

CAESAR. To say, I cannot,
Were light: -- I will not, Brutus. -- Feeble Fear
Is a low, fruitless, Passion: -- It unnerves
Resistance; and obscures Prevention's Eye:
Meets a'short Blow, halfway; -- and aids its Weakness
Life is not worth a Fear.

BRUTUS. Fear for Mankind;
Fear, for the sat of Rome, that loses Caesar.

CAESAR. No more. I know Rome's wants, and reign, to serve he*
Menace to me, means Nothing: spare thy Terrors:
Not even the Threats of Heaven alarm the Just:
Should the contending Elements break loose,
And into formless Atoms, rend the World,
The Friend of Truth must fall -- but falls unshaken.

BRUTUS. Oh, Caesar! -- my full Heart! -- farewell, forever.
Turning away, Disordered.
CAESAR. Brutus, in Tears! -- so mourn we Griefs, we make?
Immortal Gods! -- what Madness blinds Conceit!
He, who, unmoved, resists the Voice of Nature,
Melts, in imagined Woes, and weeps for Rome.

BRUTUS. No: -- I but die for Rome. -- I weep for Caesar,

Exit, in Confusion. SCENE IV.
CAESAR, TRINOVANTIUS. CAESAR. What? my bold Briton -- Welcome, Trinovantius,
I love thy Country's Virtues.

TRINOVANTIUS. Caesar, hail!
When thy Friends fear -- and ev'en a Brutus weeps.
May thy Gods guard thee, as thy Soldier would!

CAESAR. Long, has thy brave and faithful Cohort served Me;
What are their Want's? -- teach Caesar how please Thee.

TRINOVANTIUS. No Briton wastes a Prayer upon Himself,
When his Friend's Life's in Danger.

CAESAR. What then would thou?

TRINOVANTIUS. The Senate, met, and full of seeming Faith,
Wait thy wished Presence; -- Rome's raised Throne invitee, thee,
Thy plain, well-m^aning. Friends, the Populace,
Bear offered In^ense, through the Streets-of Rome;
And pay their willing Worship to thy Statues.
All the pleased City smiles. -- Yet, could I move thee;
Could thy old Soldier's first-felt Fear persuade; --
Caesar should shun the sad-presaging Hour,
And bid this Diadem attend his Leisure.

CAESAR. I thought, the Sons of Thame's had felt no Fears.

TRINOVANTIUS. No Fears they feel from Earth's uniting Anger:
But* when Heaven frowns, it is impious, not to tremble.
All Nature, through her Works, seems, now, convulsed:
-- I met the pali^ Vestals, wildly screaming:
Fled, from the e^tin^uish'd Fire, robeless, and bare:
And blind amidst the Dust of crumbling Towers;
Shook from the dark'nd Summits! -- Doors of Sepulchre's
Untouched, fly open: and from silent Urns,
Where slept in Monumental Rest, the Bones
Of Rome's first Founders, slow-ascending Shades
Catch form; -- and hovering, in the quick'n'd Air,
View some sad Fate, they want the Power to tell:
And shrink, and start -- and fly the sickening Sun.
-- Such boding Signs fore-note impending Fate:
And Heaven, from whom Kings hold, postpones thy Claim.

CAESAR. Fie Trinovantius! -- 'T is to bold for Man!
It Is Insolence, to list the Eternal Gods:
Make Nature bus, and un-hinge a World.
To lengthen, or cut short, a Mortal's Moment?
The all-ruling Powers have fi^'d our destined Space;
And we, too weak to shun, must wait their Will.

TRINOVANTIUS. It Is whispered, -- some great Names unite for Mischief.

CAESAR. Ambition, born for Contest, owes Contempt
To Threat'ners. --

TRINOVANTIUS. Yes. -- But, cautious Note of Treason,
Timely, and often, averts the Traitor's Purpose.

CAESAR. To live in daily Dread, is daily dying:
'^is worse than Death: -- It Is Sickness never cured!

TRINOVANTIUS. Suffer my Briton's to surround the Temple,
And trust malicious Senates to their Eye.

CAESAR. Who awes his Enemy, submits to fear him.
-- Stay, my good Friend, thou comst no farther on.

TRINOVANTIUS. I leave thee, Caesar! with a strange Regret!
For my fore-boding Heart is filled with Terror.

CAESAR. Be comforted. -- Thou over-rat'st my Danger.
Three hundred new Patrician's swell the Senate:
All, mine, for their own Safety: -- Half the old, --
Names, like the Julian, famed, e're Rome was Rome!
Converts to slow-found Truth, embrace her warmly,
These, nobly owning, teach the Rest to own,
When Error is Disgrace, Retraction's Virtue.
What apprehend'st thou, then, from that small Remnant,
Whose Weakness is too wise, to dare their With,

TRINOVANTUS. O, Pallas! Pallas! -- Guide of Martial Caesar!
How grew the Master-Soldier of the World
Unmindful, what Success, in Deeds of Blood,
Crowns unexpected Rashness! -- If we but think
The Attempt impossible, we make it safe.
-- Had (but that Heaven forbids) this unfear'd Few,
Weak as they seem, dared in full Senate, strike,
Firm, and combined, at Caesar's sacred Life;
His Friends, the astonished many -- powerless unnerv'd,
In Gaze of helpless Horror, had sat passive;
Each doubting each -- a Foe; till Fate had reached thee,
And, while Prevention paused, Presumption triumphed.

CAESAR. Briton! Thy Heart is manly: and thy Mind
Adorned with every Gift of Faith, and Wisdom!
Act, as thy Doubts inspire thee. -- Since thou fear,
It Is strange, that I, too, cannot! -- Yet, beware,
Thou call'st no Aid of Arms: -- Civil to Civil,
And, but to martial military. -- Hear'st thou
Loud Cry of A Caesar -- A Caesar! You shoutig Swarm, that shakes Rome's
echoing Domes?
Lead those loud Voters, from the o'rerowded Streets,
To where their Cry may reach the Senate's Ear:
'Twill caution Guilt, perhaps! And aid Resolves.

TRINOVANTIUS. Thanks to the Gods, thy Friends! Who led thee, once,
To charm our fraudless Isle! -- By them inspired,
One grateful Briton saves the Roman Soul!

Caesar, and Trinovantius, turn to go off, on opposite Sides. SCENE V.
TORBILIUS. (Entering hastily.) TRINOVANTIUS. meeting him. Bless thy quick
Step! Come thou to hold back Caesar?

TORBILIUS. Brave Islander, I do:

TRINOVANTIUS. Emperor! Dictator!

CAESAR. Hush thy too busy Terrors.

TRINOVANTIUS. Aside. Hold him, sweet Roman!
Tuned Eloquence is thine: Tell him some Tale,
No matter on what Subject, make it but long,

Exit hastily. CAESAR. seeing Torbilius. Why art THOU, here! -- Did Brutus vote
for Murder?

TORBILIUS. Shun the met Senate: -- All mean Murder, there:

CAESAR. All cannot. -- Thou defam'st too broadly: -- WHO?

TORBILIUS. The Patriot Faction.

CAESAR. Thou has't yoked Ideas,
Which Reason must divide. -- Patriot, and Faction,
Like Oil on Waters, mix, when strongly shaken:
But never can unite. -- disjoined, by Nature!

TORBILIUS. Patriot's can envy. -- And who envies -- hates.

CAESAR. Let 'em hate on. -- In Men, who love their Country,
Envy but quickens Virtue.

TORBILIUS. This black List
Contains O, Caesar! thirty Traitor's Names:
Traitors, by great Calphurnia's Care detected:
Traitors, who under Friendship's fair Disguise,
Have with confederate Malice, sworn thy Murder.

CAESAR. Taking the Roll. Did my Calphurnia send thee?

TORBILIUS. Caesar, she did:

CAESAR. My Friend's Names, say thou, in this Roll of Traitors?

TORBILIUS. All thy most trusted, most distinguished Friends?

CAESAR. After a Pause, returning the Roll, unopened. Take back thy bloody
List. and hide Man's baseness:
Where Trust is tainted by such dire Deceit,
Life is not worth preserving.

TORBILIUS. Loved Calphurnia.
Demands it: -- for her sake, repress thy Scorn. --
Stay but to go well-guarded.

CAESAR, Against Enemies,
Caesar suffices for the Guard of Caesar: --
But, against Friends, Distrust were Violation.

TORBILIUS. Holding his Robe. Stay, but to be convinced -- ill-fated Caesar!

CAESAR. I will not be convinced, that Faith is Weakness.
W^o would take Pains to lose that Peace, he feels,
From generous Confidence in human Virtues?
If there are Wretches, who, obliged, betray,
It Is Comfort, not to know 'em

Exit Caesar SCENE VI.
To TORBILIUS enter TRINOVANTIUS and two Roman Officers. TORBILIUS. Oh!
farewell,
Rome's Fame! -- Her Evil Genius has prevailed:
And Caesar's Death shall doom declining Empire.

Exit. TRINOVANTIUS. Repelling a crowd of Plebeians? Stand back, keep distance;
reverence the sitting Senate:
Whom will you crown your King?

PLEBEIANS. A Caesar.! A Caesar!

TRINOVANTIUS. Bless your concurring Joy! ye grateful People!
Caesar is yours -- and you are justly Caesar's!
Crown him with Rapture. -- For were Caesar King,
Rome had no Tyrants: All your lordly Patrons,
Stripped of oppressive Power, shall call you Brothers.
Office, with equal Eye, shall search for Skill,
And Liberty become the poor Man's Claim.
There are, who justly dread in Caesar's Crown,
His Love of the Unhappy: -- dread his Pity.
He will not see the groaning Debtor sold,
To feed the rich Man's Luxury. -- No Tears
Of starving Want; -- no iron Hand of Law;
No Slaves to fellow subjects, shall make sad
The Streets of happy Rome -- If Caesar reigns.
A cry from within -- Liberty! Liberty: Liberty! Hark! in that Cry, arose no
voice of Joy!
By Heaven; they Murder Caesar! guard this Door,
Good Romans! Fulvius! Aetius! your tried Swords,
And mine, dare enter. -- Follow Me, and save him.

As they are going off, with their Swords drawn; they are stopped by Antony, who
enters disordered. ANTONY. Spare your meant Aid: -- alas! it comes to late:
Murder, with all Briareus's hundred Hands,
Pierced the World's Soul -- and Conquest is no more.

TRINOVANTIUS. Curses consume their Names; what villain Hand! --

ANTONY. Casca struck first. -- Caesar, up-starting seized
The assassin Steel -- back plunged it home, -- and cried,
No -- villain Casca! No -- thus, thy own Poiniard
Corrects thy feeble Purpose: -- die -- die -- Traitor!
Down to the expecting Shades -- say Caesar sent thee.
There, pressed beneath a storm of Wounds, at once,
He stood, and frowned, and bled, on every Side:
Moving at last, Majestic -- the red Hand
Of miscreant Brutus met his radiant Eye.
Then thus. -- All, cruel Murderers? what! All?
And Thou! My SON 1 My BRUTUS! Nay then, to conquer,
Were to perpetuate Pain: -- and Death grows Joy.
Speaking, he sunk: -- Soft, over his manly form,
Smoothed his disordered Robe -- and, sighless, died.
Cry again, from within, Liberty! Liberty!
TRINOVANTIUS. Edge this true Sword, kind Heaven! they dare descend.

Advancing to meet the Conspirators, he is held back by Marc Antony. SCENE VII.
TRINOVANTIUS, ANTONY, and Officers, CASSIUS, DECIMUS, CINNA, MARCELLUS, with
bloody Daggers. It Is past -- Ambition bleeds; and Rome is free:
Hail Lords of Rome revived! Nation of Princes.
Now once more, Masters of a World, you won!
Dare vindicate the Hands, that broke your Chain.
TRINOVANTIUS. struggling against Antony. Cowards! cold-hearted Cowards! --
You, who thus
Fear to Revenge -- it is you, have murdered Caesar.

ANTONY. No, Trinovantius. -- Trust the Gods, and Rome.
With Caesar's Vengeance! -- careful, through the Crowd,
I seek, but find not Brutus.

CIMBER. Enters wounded -- Who named Brutus?

CASSIUS. 'Twas Antony -- come forward, valiant Cimber!
Where have thou left our Chief?

CIMBER. [Unhappy Brutus!
Struck, by the Words, and Look, of dying Caesar,
He bowed to weep upon the Wound, he made:
When, from a Gallery, bursting in, above,
Held twixt the frantic Vestals, there appeared
Cato'^ yet living Sister -- lost Servilia!
See! cried the breathless Trembler, -Traitor! Paricide!
Called by thy Crimes, in vain, from a Retreat,
W'ere hid, (not dead) I shunned a hated World,
Thy Mother's blasted Eye, -- fell Monster! Murderer!
Finds thee, too late: And ev^ry God shall Curse thee,
She scream'd, and sunk, amid the vestal Train.
Brutus! all Wild, as with a Fury's Horror,
Gazed, up, down, round -- wrung his closed Hands -- ran -- stopped,
Returned -- then, with a bursting sigh, resumed
Composure: kneeled, and kissed the Robe of Caesar?
But sn^tchin^ a fallen Dagger, rose, distracted,
And cried -- take, take me Vengeance! Rome is free:
"But Brutus, in her Cause, has stabbed a Father!
Near, as he aimed the meditated Blow,
I br^ke its erring Force -- and on this Arm,
Received the pointed Mischief. -- So, prevented,
I left him, 'midst a Guard of weeping Romans.

ANTONY. Well may he weep! -- but when he reads a Charge,
The murdered Father left the murdering Son;
What will he then endure? -- what Cave has Earth,
So deep, so dark, to hide him from Himself!
When he shall see, that, to his bloody Hand;
Caesar consigned the Power to fix Rom's Liberty.

CASSIUS. Thou speak in Mystery, Marc Antony!

ANTONY. Move to the Forum. -- In the Face of Rome,
I shall unfold the Will of Rome's lost Guardian.

CASSIUS. Could artful Antony, prove Caesar wronged;
Cassius would then confess, he was too hasty.

ANTONY. Traitor! thy willing Envy loved the Error:
And thou shall expiate -- far, as lowest Vice.
Too weakly can atone for murdered Virtue,
This Hour's detested Guilt, by Death and Infamy.

TRINOVANTIUS. Summon the People: -- I Will revenge this Murder;
Then, mourn lost Rome -- and guard Britannia's Liberty.

Exeunt Roman Offic^rs, and Plebeians. ANTONY. coming forward. Had but Ambition
Eyes, to look through Time,
Twoud see its ^rui^l^ss Toil, and shun to climb:
Fondness of Noise, and Crowds of Court would cease,
And Man's whole Happiness be placed in Peace.
Safe Liberty would guard each Patriot Throne,
And Tyrant be, henceforth, a Name unknown:
All Fruit of Power is Pain: and what is Fame?
When even a Caesar's Glory stains his Name.

The END.
EPILOGUE. In D^etta:
CALPHURNIA. WHAT think ye^ Sirs, of ou^ Quack-stage Ph^sician;
Who gives Folks Pills, in Verse -- to cure Ambition?

PORTIA. entering Opposite Fifty to One, he breaks: -- for, to my Knowledge,
That Cure's too hard, even for our Female College!
And, (don't look silly, Sirs, when plainly told it)
Where we give out, You Have poor Pretense, to hold it.

CALPHURNIA. Well -- but, pray, Madam! -- was not this Intrusion?
Two -- to One Epilogue?

CALPHURNIA. turns to the Audience Though, born, a Maid. -- and, therefore, no
Man-hater.
There Is ONE He Thing I loathe -- and That Is, a Traitor.

No King can please him -- and no Wife can humble.
What'ere hard Durance binds him, -- (make no doubt on it)
He Will find some strange new Hole. and creep safe ou't on it.
Horrid, the Traitor's Wife's abhorred Condition!

PORTIA. Worse, ten times worse, the Maid's, that weds Ambition!
Oh* Ladies! -- too, too apt, to over rate it,
Catch a few, private Hints: and learn to hate it.
The Traitor, once for all is, but hanged and quiet:
The ambitious Fribbler's Life's one, long-stretch'd, Riot.
Like a Nun's Flannel Shift, worn close, to teaze ye.

CALPHURNIA. Now, it is my Turn to speak -- Avaunt, SEDITION!

PORTIA. Not yet, this half hour. -- Ladies, fly AMB^T^ON
Husbands, who that hard horny Taste, inherit,
Dry, like 'still Rose-Cakes, and turn, all, to Spirit.

Good Friend, and dear Ally! -- henceforth, uniting,
Spite of bad Patterns, let us join Hands, for Fighting.

PORTIA. A Match. so joined, each Star must Conquest, mean us.
Lord help the poor French Prig. that falls, between us!

CALPHURNIA. Say, what Ambition is.

PORTIA. It Is Treason's Mother:
Nurse, of Debate --

CALPHURNIA. Sly Devils! Both one, and To'ther!
What is Sedition?

PORTIA. Virtue's false Pretense:
Religions Cloak, -- the two-edged Sword, of Sense.
It Is Freedom's resty Start: Pride's patriot Plea:
Sound, that ca'nt hear: and Sight, that will not see.
Sedition! Thou art Discord never ending.

CALPHURNIA. Ambition! Thou art pointing to the Head cracked, past Power of
mending
Past even St. Edward's Cure, thou dire King's Evil!
Thou first Plague Mark, -- on Angel, Man, and Devil!
Snubborn as Woman's Will, thou hat'st Restriction:
And grow'st but ten Times worse, for Contradiction.

PORTIA. Shun plotting Heads, dear Ladies -- All miscarries,
When one, that hums and haws at Midnight, -- Marries,
Better, plain downright Dunce. no Dreams pursuing.

CALPHURNIA. One, that means bluntly and knows, what he is doing.

PORTIA. Not him, whose towr'ing Mind, estranged from Pleasure,
Holds him, still busiest, -- when his Wife's at Leizure.

CALPHURNIA. Better, a Sportsman, sound of Wind, and hearty.

PORTIA. Better a Sot -- than Spouse dry drunk with Party.

CALPHURNIA. A hunting Husband hallows, and we bear him.

PORTIA. A drunken Deary Staggers, and we steer him.

CALPHURNIA. Each, conseious of his Wife, take Care to make her,
One Way, or other -- an indulged Partaker.

CALPHURNIA. And ^ould -- for Satire.

PORTIA Stranger, at home, he looks abroad for Blessing!
And finds whatere he has, not w^rth Poss^ssing.

CALPHURNIA Freedom, and Mirth, and Health, and Joy -- despises.

PORTIA. And Shuns all Rest. -- H^ so Profoundly, wise, is!

CALPHURNIA. At length, (Thank Heaven) he dies: kind Vapors strike him.
And leaves behind --

PORTIA. Ten Thousand Madmen, like him,
