BURKE's ADDRESS TO The "SWINISH The following Passage is extracted verbatim
from Mr. BURKE's Reflections on the French Revolution, p. 117. "Along with its
natural Protectors and Guardians, Learning will be cast into the mire, and
trodden down under the hoofs of a Swinish Multitude."
" Multitude!
Tune "Derry down, down." etc.
YE vile SWINISH Herd, in the Sty of Taxation,
What would ye be after? -- disturbing the Nation?
Give over your grunting -- Be off -- To your Sty!
Nor dare to look out, if a KING passes by:
Get ye down! down! down! -- Keep ye down!
Do ye know what a KING is? By Patrick I Will tell you;
He has power in his pocket, to buy you and sell you:
To make you all Soldiers, or keep you at work;
To hang you, and cure you for Ham or Salt Pork!
Get ye down! etc.
Do you think that a KING is no more than a Man?
Ye Brutish, Ye Swinish, irrational Clan?
I swear by his Office, his Right is divine,
To flog you, and ^eed you, and treat you like Swine!
Get ye down! etc.
To be sure, I have said -- but I spoke it abrupt --
That "the State is defective, and also corrupt."
Yet remember I told you with caution to peep,
For Swine at a distance WE prudently keep --
Get ye down! etc.
Now the Church and the State, to keep each other warm,
Are married together. And where is the harm?
How healthy and wealthy are Husband and Wife!
But Swine are excluded the conjugal Life --
Get YE down! etc
The State, it is true, has grown fat upon SWINE,
And Church's weak Stomach on TYTHE-PIG can dine;
But neither, you know, as they roast, at the fire,
Have a ^ight to find fault with the Cooks, or enquire.
Get Ye down! etc.
"What use do we make of your Money" -- You say?
Why, the first law of Nature: -- We take our own Pay --
And next on our Friends a few Pensions bestow --
And to you we apply when our Treasure runs low.
Get ye down! etc.
Consider our Boroughs, Ye grumbling SWINE!
At Corruption and Taxes, they never repine:
If we only Proclaim, "YE ARE HAPPY!" -- They say
" WE ARE Happy!" -- Believe and be Happy as they!
Get ye down! etc.
What know ye of COMMONS, of KINGS, or of LORDS,
But what the dim Light of TAXATION affords?
Be contented with that -- and no more of your rout:
Or a new Proclamation shall muzzle your Snout!
Get ye down! etc.
And now for the SUN -- or the LIGHT OF THE DAY!
"IT does not belong to a PIT?" -- You will say.
I tell you be silent, and hush all your Jars:
Or he will charge you a Farthing a-piece for the Stars.
Get ye down! etc.
Here Is MYSELF, and His Darkness, and Harry Dundass;
Scotch, English, and Irish, with Fronts made of Brass --
A cord platied threefold will stand a good pull,
Against SAWNEY, and PATRICK, and old Johnny Bull III
Get ye down! etc.
To conclude* Then no more about MAN and his RIGHTS,
TOM PAIN, and a Rabble of Liberty Lights:
That you are but our "SWINE," if ye ever forget,
We'll throw you alive to the HORRIBLE PIT!
Get ye down! down! down! -- Keep ye down!
