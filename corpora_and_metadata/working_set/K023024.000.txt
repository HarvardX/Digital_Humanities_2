I.
TO Lordings Proud I tune my Song,
Who Feast in Bower or Hall;
Though Dukes they be, yet Dukes shall see
That Pride will have a fall.
II.
Now that this same it is Right Sooth,
Full plainly does appear;
From what befell JOHN DUKE OF GUISE,
And NIC of LANCASTERE.
III.
When Richard Coeur de Lion Reigned,
(which means a Lyon's Heart)
Like him his Barons raged and roared,
Each played a Lyon's Part.
IV.
A Word and Blow was then enough,
Such Honor did them Prick,
If you but turned your Cheek, a Cuff,
And if your A^e, a Kick.
V.
Look in their Face, they tweak'd your Nose,
At every turn fell to it;
Come near, they trod upon your Toes;
They fought from Head to Foot.
VI.
Of these the Duke of Lancastere
Stood Paramount in Pride;
He kicked and cuff'd, and tweak'd and trod
His Foes and Friends beside.
VII.
Firm on his Front his Beaver sat,
So broad it hid his Chin;
For why, he thought no Man his Mate,
And feared to Tan his Skin.
VIII.
With Spanish Wool he died his Cheek,
With Essence oiled his Hair;
No vixen Civet Cat more Sweet,
Nor more could Scratch and Tear.
IX.
Right Tall he made himself to show,
Though made full short by G^d;
And when all other Dukes did Bow,
This Duke did only Nod.
X.
Yet Courteous, Blithe and Debonaire,
To GUISE's DUKE was he;
Never was such a Loving Pair,
Why did they disagree?
XI.
Oh! thus it was, he loved him dear,
And cast how to requite him;
And having no Friend left but This,
He deemed it meet to fight him.
XII.
Forthwith he drenched his desperate Quill,
And thus he did Indite,
This Eve at Wisk OUR SELF will Play,
Sir Duke, Be here to Night.
XIII.
Ah no! ah no! the Guileless GUISE,
Demurely did reply;
I cannot Go, nor yet can Stand,
So sore the Gout have I.
XIV.
The DUKE in Wrath called for his Steeds,
And fiercely drove them on;
Lord! Lord! how rattled then thy Stones,
O Kingly Kensington!
XV.
All in a Trice on GUISE he rushed,
Thrust out his Lady Dear;
He tweak'd his Nose, trod on his Toes,
And smote him on the Ear.
XVI.
But mark! how midst of Victory
Fate shows an Old Dog-Trick;
Up leaped DUKE JOHN and knocked him down,
And so down fell DUKE NIC.
XVII.
Alas, Oh NIC! Oh NIC, alas!
Right did thy Gossip call thee,
As who should say, Alas the Day
When JOHN of GUISE shall maul thee.
XVIII.
For on thee did he clap his Chair,
And on that Chair did sit?
And looked as if he meant therein
To do what was not fit.
XIX.
Up did thou look, Oh woeful DUKE,
Thy Mouth yet durst not open,
Certes, for Fear of finding there
A T^d instead of Trope.
XX.
" Lie there thou Caitiff vile, quoth GUISE,
" No Sheet is here to save thee,
" The Casememt it is shut likewise,
" Beneath my Feet I have thee.
XXI.
" If thou have ought to say, now speak,
Then Lancaster did cry,
" Know thou not ME, not yet thy self,
" Who Thou, and WHO AM I?
XXII.
" Know Thou not ME, who God be praised,
" have bawled and quarell'd more
" Than all the Line of Lancaster
" That battled heretofore?
XXIII.
" In Senates famed for many a Speech,
" And what some Awe must give Ye,
" Though laid thus low beneath thy Breech,
" Still of the Council Privy.
XXIV.
" Still of the Duchy Chancellor,
" Durante Life I have it,
" And turn (as now thou do on me)
" My A^e on those that gave it.
XXV.
But now the Servants they rushed in,
And DUKE NIC up leaped He,
I will not cope against such Odds,
But GUISE, I Will fight with Thee.
XXVI.
To Morrow with Thee will I fight
Under the Greenwood Tree;
No, not to Morrow, but to Night,
Quoth GUISE, I Will fight with Thee.
XXVII.
And now the Sun declining low,
Bestreak'd with Blood the Skies,
When with his Sword at Saddle Bow
Rode forth the Valiant GUISE.
XXVIII.
Full gently praunc'd he on the Lawn,
Often rolled his Eye around,
And from his Sirrup stretched to find
Who was not to be found.
XXIX.
Long brandished he his Blade in Air,
Long looked the Field all over,
At length he spied the merry Men brown,
And eke the Coach and Four.
XXX.
From out the Boot bold NICHOLAS
Did wave his Hand so white,
As pointing out the gloomy Glade
Whereat he meant to fight.
XXXI.
All in that dreadful Hour so calm
Was Lancaster to see,
As if he meant to take the Air,
Or only take a Fee.
XXXII.
And so he did, for to New Court
His trowling Wheels they run;
Not that he shunned the doubtful Strife,
But Business must be done.
XXXIII.
Back in the dark, by Brompton Park,
He turned up through the Gore,
So slunk to Campden House so high,
All in his Coach and four.
XXXIV.
Mean while the GUISE did fret and fume,
A Sight it was to see,
Benumbed beneath the Evening Dew,
Under the Greenwood Tree.
XXXV.
Then wet and weary home he fared,
Sore mutt'ring all the Way,
The Day I meet NIC he shall rue
The Cudgel of that Day.
XXXVI.
Mean time on every pissing Post
Paste me this Recreant's Name,
So that each Pisser-by shall read,
And piss against the same.
XXXVII.
Now God preserve our GRACIOUS KING,
And grant his Nobles all
May learn this Lesson from Duke Nic,
That ^Pride will have a Fall.
FINIS.
