The Brimstone Butterfly is common in many places in the month of June in the
Fly-state. In the Caterpillar state it is seldom taken, and when in chrysalis
it is generally concealed among the herbage, where it is almost impossible to
be discovered. In this state, like all other species of the Butterfly tribe, it
is suspended by the tail, but has such muscular strength, that if touched it
can throw itself upright immediately, in the same manner as the Chrysalis of
Phalaena pentadactyla. It feeds chiefly on buck-thorn, whence it has received
the specific name Rhamni.


PLATE CXLVI. BOMBYLIUS MEDIUS. DIPTERA. Wings two.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Trunk taper, very long, between two horizontal valves.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax and body yellowish brown, white at the
extremity. Wings with brown spots.

The Bombylius genus is very concise. Fabricius in the Species Insectorum
enumerates only nine species, of those five are found in Europe, major, medius,
minor, ater and fuscus; the three former are natives of this country; the
fourth is frequent in Germany, the last in Italy. -- To these Fabricius has
added a few species in his last work Entomologia Systema, which have not been
described before, but they are all exotics.

The species figured in the annexed plate is not common. It lives on the
nectareous juice of flowers. Is found in May.

FIG. III. MUSCA HYPOLEON. DIPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. A soft flexible trunk, with lateral lips at the end. No
palpi.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Eyes brown. Thorax black, margined with yellow. Abdomen
black, with five yellow spots. Legs yellow.

This Insect was taken last August, flying among some rushes in Battersea
meadows. The line at Fig. 2. denotes the natural size.


PLATE CXLVII. GRYLLUS GRYLLOTALPA. MOLE CRICKET. HEMIPTERA.
Shells or upper wings semi-crustaceous, not divided by a straight future, but
incumbent on each other, beak curved down.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Head maxillous, and with palpi. Antennae filiform, or
taper. Wings folded. Hind legs strong for leaping.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Dark brown. Antennae filiform, long, small.
Head long and small. Four short palpi. Corselet cylindrical, shells small,
veined, wings long. Body hairy. Two small tails. Fore feet large, palmated.

It is scarcely possible to find a more singular creature than the Mole
Cricket. It lives in burrows which it forms about an inch or more below the
surface of the ground. The female deposits a large bed of eggs about the size
of small pease, rather of an oval form, and brownish color. They are laid in a
circular cavity, which is two or three inches wide, and near an inch in height.
An aperture is made on one side, with an easy ascent to the surface of the
ground, and is ingeniously covered at the top with loose earth. When the young
larvae are first hatched, they scarcely exceed the twelfth of an inch in
length. They ascend through the opening, and subsist on the plants nearest
their habitation, till their fore claws have acquired sufficient strength to
burrow into the earth. In the larva state they nearly equal the perfect Insect
in size, and resemble it in every respect, except that they have no wings. The
shells appear first; this is the pupa state, and shortly after the membraneous
wings appear also. It makes very little use of its wings, as they are too weak
to support its body long; and indeed it has not much occasion for them, as it
lives in the same manner as the Mole, and, like it, is furnished with powerful
claws, with which it can burrow through the ground to a very considerable
distance.

This destructive creature is generally found in great numbers wherever they
once deposit their eggs; for it is impossible to pursue and destroy them
without doing much injury to the ground they infest. If they find a way into a
kitchen-garden, they sometimes destroy whole beds of young plants in the space
of one night; and this is not astonishing, when we consider that they seldom
eat any part except the roots, which they nip very close, and consequently the
other parts must perish. They seem particularly fond of Lettuces.

PLATE CXLVIII. PHALAENA POTATORIA. DRINKER MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

BOMBYX. Antennae, male feathered, female, like a bristle.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Yellow brown. Wings slightly scalloped; on
each of the upper wings an oblique line, and two white spots near the anterior
margin. Female paler color than the male.

The Caterpillars of this Insect feed on grass, they are found in May, and the
Moth appears about the middle of June.

The female differs in several respects from the male; it is of a buff color,
and is generally, though not always, larger. The chrysalis is black, and is
enclosed in a strong yellowish case, as shown in the plate.


PLATE CXLIX. ATTELABUS CURCULIONOIDES. COLEOPTERA.
Wings two, covered by two shells, divided by a longitudinal future.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thicker toward the end. Head narrow behind. Four
joints in each foot.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shells and thorax red. Head black.

A pair of this very singular and rare species was taken on a young nut tree in
Darent Wood, Dartford, early in May, 1795.

The remarkable structure of it is head deserves particular notice; it is shaped
like a vase, and when the Insect is alive is protruded far beyond the thorax by
it is long slender neck. It has also a very busy motion of it is head from the
right to the left when it runs: we observe a similar motion in many Insects;
but as few have such a slender neck, it is seldom so quick and repeated as in
this.

The natural size is given in the upper part of the plate, the magnified
appearance of the head is shown below.


PLATE CL.
FIG. I. PHALAENA MARGINATA. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

NOCTUA. Antennae setaceous.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Upper wings, yellow brown, with four streaks
of red brown across each; two circles of the same color in the middle; space
next the exterior margin dark color. Lower wings pale brown with a spot of
black in the center, and band of black next the posterior edge.

The Synonyms of this rare Insect have been more minutely collected, than is
common in the descriptions of this work, as it has been generally considered an
undescribed species. Mr. Crow, of Feversham, who has enriched the collections
of several gentlemen in London, with many curious Insects, met with two or
three specimens of this Moth, and among others sent one to Mr. Bentley, a
collector in London, a few years since. I have to acknowledge being favored
with this Insect by LORD WILLIAM SEYMOUR; his Lordship met with it in Wiltshire.

Fabricius, in the Species Insectorum, has made a very considerable error; and
which it is proper to notice in this place, " Noctua Marginata, native of
America," and described from the Collection of Dr. Hunter, occurs in page 216.
spec. 40; and again in page 230. spec. 108, " Noctua Marginata, a native of
Europe," the present specimen. The former he has indeed changed to "Noctua
Marginella" in his last work, Entomologiae Systematicae, but without the
slightest notice of the first mistake, or any reference to the Species
Insectorum.

It appears to be a native of Germany by the last work published by Klemann,
though perhaps it is very rare in that country as it is given in a
supplementary series of plates to his work, and his plates are but a supplement
of the more rare Insects, not figured in Roesel's publications.

PHALAENA AURANTIAGO. ORANGE MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Upper wings orange color with spots, waves, and streaks
of brown; several minute white spots along the anterior margin. Body and lower
wings cream color, with a pale wave in the middle of the latter.

This is certainly a non-descript. T. Marham, Esquire. Sec. L. S. has described it
in his manuscript notes under the specific name Aurantiago.

The specimen from which the figures in the annexed plate are copied was found
on an oak in Richmond Park, in June, 1793. The under-side as well as upper-side
is shown in the plate.

FIG. I. MUSCA BRASSICARIA. CYLINDRICAL FLY. DIPTERA. Wings 2.
GENERIC CHARACTER. A soft flexible Trunk, with lateral lips at the end. No
Palpi.

The Muscae, if we follow the arrangement of Linnaeus, form by far the most
extensive of any genus (except Lepidoptera) we have at present any knowledge
of. Fabricius enumerates in his last Syst. Ent.
Work no less than 202 Species, under the generic title Musca; independent of
these we find 122, under the head Syrphus; 22 under Rhagio, and 25 under
Stratiomys, all of which (with some exceptions) would make by Linnaean
arrangement 349 species; not to notice the Insects of the same tribe included
under his generic appellations, anthrax, bibio, nemotelus, etc.

Musca Brassicaria is not uncommon in gardens in May and June. Sometimes found
on Willows.

middle. Wings plain. Body hairy. Abdomen connected by a pedicle.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae rather longer than the body.
Entirely black, with greyish hairs. Jaws yellow.

This extraordinary Be is found in Summer, against banks, when the weather is
fine. Were it not for the remarkable length of the Antennae, it would scarcely
deserve notice, though it is rather a scarce Insect.

FIG. III. TABANUS PLUVIALIS. SPECKLED-WING. STINGING FLY. DIPTERA. Wings 2.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae conic, of four Segments. Trunk fleshy, terminated
by two lips. Palpi one on each side of the Trunk.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Eyes green. Thorax brown gray, with seven
longitudinal lines. Abdomen gray with marks of black. Wings brown speckled with
white.

During all the Summer months we find this tormenting little Insect in great
abundance, in the narrow lanes and skirts of woods. If it settles on the hands,
face, or legs, its sting is very acute, and excites an inflammation and
swelling in the stung-part, very similar to that we experience from the sting
of the Tabanus caecutiens, described in Plate 131, of this Work.

Its sting is most violent about the middle of the day.

A very curious and scarce species. It was found among some elder leaves which
were gathered in Battersea Meadows, early in June, 1795.

When this Insect is alive the yellow color of the body is exceedingly bright,
and partakes somewhat of a metallic and green hue in several parts, but this
brilliant appearance gradually fades after death.

The line denotes the natural size, it being necessary to give a magnified
figure of such a minute Insect.

It is to a very singular and trivial circumstance we are indebted for the
specimens of both the male and female of this rare species. They were observed
together on the bark of an elm tree in the Mall in St. James's Park, by some
ignorant persons, who being terrified at their extraordinary appearance,
attempted to destroy them, but a gentleman who happened to pass by at the same
instant, having either more curiosity or less apprehension of danger from
touching them, took them up, and preserved them. We conclude they could have
but just before come out of their chrysalides, the female being in a most
perfect state, and the male equally fine, except that it had lost one of its
upper wings.

We must claim the indulgence of the more scientific part of our readers for
the minuteness with which we have detailed such trifling circumstances; it can
indeed afford very little amusement to them, but, it may serve to remind many
who are not in the habit of collecting Insects, that their occasional
endeavors would be likely to extend the Science of Entomology; for it often
happens that the most assiduous Naturalists are indebted to such persons for
the rarest specimens their cabinets can boast.

The Moths were found late in June. On examining the crevices of some of the
trees near the spot, we found a quantity of the eggs; they were rather of an
oval form, and linked together like a chain, as shown in the Plate; and having
carefully preserved them in a branch of a plumb-tree I frequently find, when
the Plant of an Insect is unknown, that they will live on the Plumb-tree, when
they refuse other food.
under the bark, we had the satisfaction to see some young Caterpillars
produced in a few weeks. But either owing to the want of proper food or good
management they all died soon after except two or three, and these never
arrived at their full size. The Caterpillar from which the Figure in the
annexed is copied, was found under the bark of one of the elm-trees in St.
James's Park, but being disturbed, it never became a Pupa. The Caterpillar
makes a case, of the dust of the wood which it gnaws, and cements together, and
in this it lies concealed beneath the bark. The head of the Caterpillar is
hard, and the first ring is furnished with a strong horny substance.

Harris, about twenty years ago, was so fortunate as to breed this Moth from
the Caterpillar, and we are not acquainted with any similar instance since that
time. In the Plates of Roesel, vol. 4, a Figure of the Caterpillar is given,
but without either Pupa or Moth, so that were it not for the reference and
authority of Linnaeus, and since his time, of Fabricius, it would scarcely be
known to what Insect it belonged. The eggs we have not found either figured or
described, though they are so very singularly united together, and would
certainly have been noticed by the ingenious Roesel if he had met with them.

The Antennae of the female are setaceous, or like a bristle, but that part of
the male is both singular and beautiful; it is elegantly feathered next the
base, and terminates in a bristle, like the female.

This is not an uncommon Moth in some places, yet we find no figure of it in
any work on British Insects. In the work of Klemann, quoted in the Synonyms, a
figure of it is given without the Larva; from this we may safely infer it is
seldom found in that state, or that indefatigable writer would certainly have
added it to his Plate.

It is supposed to feed on some plant of the Euphorbia genus, and hence the
specific names fuscata and unicolorata have been abandoned.

The Moth was found late in May.

This is much rarer than the preceding species, and is also a far more
beautiful Insect. We have never found it except about the hazel nut trees in

are found in abundance. Is found in Germany.

The Larva of this rare and elegant Insect is wholly unknown to Collectors of
British Insects. The Moths were formerly taken at the Chalk-pits, near Charton,
in Kent, but either the brood has been destroyed, or the seasons so
unfavourable, that few, if any, have been seen for several years. The Moth
comes forth in May, and, like other species of the same tribe, fly very low,
and always settle on the blades of grass, with their Wings folded, so that
Collectors can readily distinguish them from other Moths.

This species is not much unlike the Scarabaeus Auratus (large green Beetle, or
Rose Chaffer) but is far more scarce. The larva lives entirely under the
surface of the ground, and feeds on smaller Insects. The Jaws are very strong,
but in other respects it appears unable to defend itself if attacked. It is
very sluggish, and always lies with its body coiled round. The case in which it
remains in the pupa state is very strong, and consists of small bits of wood,
pebbles, earth, etc. cemented and fastened together, by a slight silky web. It
continues during the Winter in this case, and in May the Beetle comes forth.

There are two sorts of Caterpillars belonging to this species. They are alike
in size and form, but are very different in color. One sort is green, the
other purplish red, varying much in different specimens, being sometimes almost
brown. Both sorts are spotted with minute white specks, which are disposed in
regular order over every part, except the belly.

Every Caterpillar is also furnished with a posterior horn, which is blue from
the base for more than half its length: the tip is bright orange color.

The Chrysalis, which is of a pale yellowish-brown at first, changes to a more
dusky color before the Sphinx comes forth.

The Caterpillars feed on several kinds of plants, but seem chiefly to prefer
those of the Galium genus, particularly, the White Galium Palustre.
or Yellow -- Verum.
Lady's Bedstraw, and Cleaves, or Goosegrass -- Aperine.
. They go into the ground about the latter end of August, and remain there in
chrysalis till April, or May at the farthest.

It is rather a scarce Insect: sometimes visits gardens in the winged state;
and extracts the sweetest juices of the flowers, by darting its long proboscis,
or trunk into them; it is from this peculiarity, and its hovering over the
flowers at the same time, like the Humming Birds when they feed, that it has
received its English appellation.

This Insect is found in most parts of Europe, but it appears is more frequent
in Northern Countries. A near variety of it is found in Botany-Bay; and we have
specimens of it from North America.

Sphinx Belis of Linnaeus and Cramer, is described amongst the Synonyms given
by Fabricius, as a variety of Sphinx Stellatarum, and Sphinx Ciculus of Cramer
scarcely differs from our Insect.

Linnaeus gave this little Moth the specific name Bergmanniana, in honor of
Prof. Bergmann, a naturalist of distinguished eminence. It is a very pretty
Insect; but, when magnified, its appearance is truly superb, the ground color
which is bright yellow, showing the orange markings to great advantage, and the
metallic splendor of the burnished silver appearing like raised work above the
stripes or bands of dark brown that cross the upper wings.

We have found this Moth at Highgate. The Caterpillars are yellow, with a
streak of green down the back; but the green disappears before the last skin,
in which they are of a pale yellow, without any marks whatever. They feed on
white thorn.

This is exceedingly rare. The upper wings are very curious, being entirely

the wings. Of its Larva we are entirely ignorant; nor can we derive any
assistance in that respect from entomological writers, as Fabricius only has
described the Moth. He says it is a native of England, and preserved in the
cabinet of Mr. Monson.

This extremely rare Insect is always considered as a British species, and is
usually found in the cabinet of the English entomologist; yet those are German
Insects generally, for we know only of one specimen which is clearly
ascertained to have been found in this country. The specimen alluded to is in
the collection of Mr. Francillon, jeweller, in Newcastle-street, in the Strand:
it is a female, and was, found by that gentleman's brother in his garden at
Carshalton.

Whether Harris ever met with this Insect we cannot pretend to determine; he
says it appears in the winged state in April Vide Aurelian's Companion.
. We cannot hesitate to suppose, that this Moth has been found in England
several times, particularly in Kent; but none of these remain at this period in
the collections of the curious.

The Male differs much from the Female: both sexes are shown in the annexed
plate. Fig. I. Male. Fig. II. Female.

Fuesly, in a German publication, has given the only figure we are acquainted

brown, and large spots of golden yellow.

This species is less frequent than Oniscus Asellus, (Common Woodlouse). It
lives in clear waters, most part of the summer. It scarcely exceeds one half of
the length of O. Asellus in England, yet if we may form an opinion of the
German specimens from those figured by Sulz; they are larger than with us.

The Oniscus Agilis of Persoon, figured in Panzer's Work Faun. Ins. Germ.
, corresponds perfectly with ours in size; and the minute markings on the
shells, if carefully examined with a glass, will be found nearly alike. The
antennae of the figure in Sulz seems rather contrary to the specific character
of the insect; and that of Panzer's, though of another species, more resemble
those of our specimen.

Of the Oniscus Asellus we find different colored specimens, some are almost
white with gray marks, others are nearly deep black; we find also, Oniscus
Aquaticus liable to variations, though not so much as the former insect in some
the light ground color is very distinct, in others rather confused. Some are
deeper colored; and again, many, when first taken, have a fine glowing, olive
brown appearance throughout, though less vivid than that of Oniscus Agilis
before noticed.

The transformation of any insect from one state to another is both curious and
entertaining to an enlightened observer; yet there are a few species whose
manners are so peculiar, and their changes so astonishing, that they seem to
demand more than ordinary attention; and of this description we consider the
subject of the annexed plate. If we speak of it as to its manners collectively,
one peculiarity implies a contradiction of the other, for it is an aquatic, a
terrestrial, and an aerial creature. Few insects that inhabit the water, in the
perfect state ever quit it; and the generality of those whose larvae live in
that element could exist for a few minutes only in it, after they become winged
insects; this is particularly noticed of the Libellulae, Phryganeae, Ephemerae,
Tipulae, and an immense crowd of other insects that are bred in the water; but
it appears this insect in the larva state can leave the water without injury,
and in the last state, though a winged creature, it lives for the most part in
the water, and quits it only in the evenings; or when the pool dries up, it
uses its wings in search of another.

In the larva state it is not less remarkable for its savage disposition, than
its formidable appearance. The whole body is covered with a hard shell, or coat
of mail, and the head is armed with two long, semi-circular, sharp-pointed
forceps. It is very alert in the water, and when it takes its prey, which
consists of smaller aquatic insects, it plunges these weapons into them, and
through a minute aperture, at the extremity, it extracts all their juices. When
the time arrives in which it is to become a pupa, it leaves the water and forms
a cavity just below the surface of the earth of an oval form: how long it
remains in this cavity in the pupa state is uncertain. The beetle comes forth
in May.

Much doubt has arose respecting the female of this species; Linnaeus, in the
Systema Naturae, described the supposed female as b Dysticus Semistriatus.
Fabricius, in the Species Insectorum, adds a long list of synonyms from
different entomological writers, several of whom had figured or described it as
a distinct species before the time of Linnaeus, and some subsequent authors
have held the same opinion; but in the last work, Entomologia Systema,
Fabricius considers it to be the female, and includes only a few of his former
references. Upon the first view of these opinions the point seems undetermined;
and though we partly assent to the opinion of the last writer, we must
endeavor to be entirely satisfied, before we give a figure of Dytiscus
Semistriatus.

The upper side of this insect is generally described black; this is not the
color in living specimens: it is of a fine glossy black-green, and the
marginal color brighter than in those that have been dead some time. The
greenish hue on the back seldom entirely disappears.

The fore feet of this beetle have an appendage of a very singular structure;
it is nearly round, flat beneath, and has in the middle two remarkable circular
cavities, with many others more minute: it is supposed, that through minute
apertures in these cavities it can emit a kind of oily fluid; or that, by their
assistance, it can collect air bubbles, to raise itself from the deep parts of
the water to the surface, in an instant. The larva of the Musca Chamaelion,
which lives in the water, collects the air in a bubble within the rays of its
tail, and thereby raises itself to the surface in like manner.

That the Phalaena Dispar was not uncommonly scarce about fifteen years ago, is
evident from this circumstance, few collections of British insects, that were
in the hands of eminent collectors, are without an English specimen, which was
procured about that time; and Harris, in 1775, as well as some other writers
about the same period, speak confidently of its being found in this country.
Berkenhout, in his Synopsis, says, it is " frequent about Ealing, in
Middle-sex." But this we can, on the best authority, dispute; it never was
frequent in that place, though it has several times been met with, by
collectors of insects; a parcel of eggs being obtained from them, and hatching,
many caterpillars were procured; and these being carefully attended, several
moths were also produced. This is not a very extraordinary circumstance, as
many of the rarest insects may become common, when the eggs, or a brood of
caterpillars, can be discovered.

We are willing to acknowledge, that we have not been more fortunate in our
researches for the caterpillar or moth of this species, than any others engaged
in the science of entomology; but we have procured from Germany a collection,
containing many valuable rarities that have been found in this country at
different times; amongst these we have most perfect and finely preserved
specimens of Phalaena Dispar, in its several states, and these perfectly agree
with those formerly collected in England. Our Plate contains only one figure of
the caterpillar, and that is of the female. The male differs only in being
smaller, and in the size of the head, which is less in proportion than that of
the female.

In this instance, we trust, any apology will be unnecessary, though the
original specimens were not found in this country: it must be an advantage to
the work to contain figures of the rarest insects; and should any of our
readers be so fortunate as to find the caterpillar, they will be able to
determine the species, and the proper food to rear it on; or, if the brood be
extinct, the plate will be more interesting, as there cannot remain a doubt of
its having been indigenous in England.

In foreign countries it is very injurious to gardens, and fruit trees in
particular. Berkenhout says, it feeds on "Oak, Ash, Apple Trees, etc." but we
are rather inclined to doubt his information, except as to the latter, though
he is partly sanctioned by Linnaeus. Geoffroy says, it feeds on the Elm.

For the time of its appearance we are indebted to Harris; he says the
caterpillar changed to chrysalis the 11th of July, the moth appeared July 31;
from which it appears certain that he reared it from the caterpillar. He has
not, however, given a figure of it in the Aurelian, or any other of his
publications.

In the larva state, this species feeds on the leaves of the Rose, and from
that peculiarity it has received its significant specific name, rosae. The
larva casts its skin several times before it becomes a pupa, its exuviae we
frequently find adhering to rose-leaves. When the larva is in its last skin it
is yellowish, inclining to orange, with many minute black specks, disposed in
ringlets, on every joint; but in the early stages of its growth we find them of
several shades of colors, between green and orange, and some partake of both
colors, and are speckled with black, as in the last skin. The larva is very
tender, and, we suspect, is liable to some distemper of a very different kind
from any noticed to affect other insects; it then appears sickly, and is
covered with a whitish down, or powder, which flies off on the slightest touch.
We have often found the larva of another species of the same genus covered with
this kind of white powder, but as they always died, it is impossible to
determine to what insect they belonged.

In the pupa state, the outer case is not perfectly oval, but rather flattened
on the sides; it is generally fastened on a stalk. The perfect insect is found
in great plenty during most of the summer months.

Several early systematic writers placed this insect amongst those whose
antennae consisted of seven joints, or articulations: Whence Linnaeus In the
last edition of the Syst. Not. "antennis septemnodiis, etc." is changed for
"antennis clavato filiformibus, etc."
included the number of the joints with the specific character; and in the
Species Insectorum Fabricius has followed the same arrangement. Though with the
assistance of a microscope we may discover in this, and other species, the
exact number of the articulations described, yet they are too minute to serve
as part of a good specific character, which should, if possible, be selected
from the most conspicuous and peculiar parts of the insect. Fabricius seems to
have been aware of this in his last work, Entomologia Systematica Tom. 2. p.
109. 18.
; and has made a very judicious alteration; though it appears singular for a
systematic writer to change "Antennis filiformibus articulis. 7 -- 9." for
"Antennis inarticulatis, extrorsum crassioribus."

The caterpillar of this species is found on the White Thorn, in April; in May
it becomes a pupa: the moth does not appear before September.

It will be readily conjectured, from its English name, to be more frequently
taken about Ealing, in Middlesex, than elsewhere, though it is not peculiar,
like some insects, to one place only. The caterpillar is smooth, or without any
hairs; it eats ravenously, is very sluggish, and forms a fine silky web, in the
ground, in which it passes to the pupa state In the plate of this species in
Roeel's German Insects, the silky cone of the pupa is drawn in the unequal part
of a leaf.
. We find the moth very liable to variation in colors; in some specimens the
green is very brilliant, in others the red; and again, in others, the lunar
white marks are very conspicuous. In some specimens, natives of warm countries,
we have seen them finer colored than those from the northern parts of Europe.

If we except a very small number of exotic Libellulae, L. Grandis is the
largest insect of the genus known: it is certainly the largest of the European
species.

It is not uncommon in woods; but never flies far from the water. In the larva
state it lives in the water, and, like others of the same genus already
described in this work, does not quit it till it becomes a winged creature. In
the larva state it also resembles in its manners those voracious insects that
devour smaller insects, and in the winged state it takes moths and other weak
insects in its flight. Is found in most of the summer months.

The Staphylini were formerly known among English collectors by the general
appellation Rove-Beetles; we have in the present instance adopted this English
name, and added the only specific distinction which occurs likely to convey the
meaning of Linnaeus, when he named it Riparius.

All the insects of this genus are very voracious. The larvae so much resemble
the perfect insects, that they can hardly be distinguished from them.
Staphylinus Riparius is found in most parts of Europe. It frequents moist sandy
places, and the sides of banks. Found in May. The natural size and magnified
appearance is given in the annexed plate.

The caterpillar of this moth feeds on whitethorn, current and
gooseberry-trees, etc. The chrysalis or pupa is enclosed in a strong web of a
greyish color; it is of a dark brown color. The caterpillar is found in June.
In July or August, the moth comes forth.

The upper wings of this moth have a very striking characteristic; that is, the
yellowish lunar mark within two small spots: from this character it has been
aptly named Satelliti; and in English, the Satellite Moth.

Insects, when in the larva state, have various means of protecting, or
concealing themselves from other species that would annoy them, as well as from
birds who prey on them. This remark is partly justified by the subject of our
annexed plate, the larva of which we find is not furnished with any means of
defense when attacked: nor of agility to run away, or secret itself from its
enemies; but to compensate for this, nature has formed it with a skin of such a
color, and structure, that its greatest safety is in its inaction. We
frequently see it fastened by its hind feet to a small twig or branch in such a
posture, that unless it moves, it is scarcely possible to discover it. It is
sometimes in an erect position, at others with its head downwards, but in an
oblique position; and, as it hangs in this manner, without the least appearance
of life for a considerable time, it exactly resembles a small twig of the
branch to which it is attached.

The caterpillars are not uncommon in April, or early in May. It feeds on
several plants; particularly, when in confinement, it prefers bramble, or white
thorn. It is found in the winged state in June, so that it remains a very short
time in chrysalis.

From the English name given to this beautiful and extremely scarce moth, we
learn that it has been taken at Clifden: we have also heard of its being found
in other parts of England; and, if we can rely on our information, a specimen
was taken in July, 1795, in the fields.

We have never understood that the larva had been found in this country. Feeds
on the ash tree.


PLATE CLXXI. THE CATTERPILLAR AND CHRYSALIS OF PHALAENA FRAXINI.
The rarity of this subject must plead our apology for the liberty we have
taken in introducing it into our work. It is the only instance in which we have
given place to a copy from the works of others of any subject, however rare. We
have in our possession a preserved specimen of the caterpillar of Phalaena
Fraxini, sent from Germany; but as it is of that kind in which the colors and
form cannot be preserved well, we have preferred giving an exact copy of the
caterpillar as well as chrysalis, from the works of a respectable, but little
known author, Ammiral. This author appears to have been singularly fortunate in
presenting a figure of the caterpillar, when the accurate Roesel did not
publish a figure of the moth till his fourth volume, and was not then in
possession of the caterpillar.

Some of our readers will be perhaps surprised to find that our figures
precisely agree with those contained in the Aurelian of our countryman Harris;
but whoever possesses the plates of Ammiral, will find that in the most minute
parts of Harris's plates, he has only traced and reversed the originals of
Ammiral throughout; and in many instances by a clumsy imitation, in reversing
the foliage and flies, has even spoilt the effect, and lost sight of the
accuracy of them.

A specimen of this very superb and rare butterfly has been taken at Cambridge.
It has always had a place in the cabinets of English collectors of consequence;
but we cannot learn by whom it was first discovered in this country. Papilia
Virgaureae and Papilio Hippothoe, has been frequently confounded with each
other; but on a comparison, a material difference will be discovered.

Harris has made one error, which it is of importance to the English collector
to correct; he says, " Papilio Virgaureae, copper, feeds on grass, found in
June and August in meadows, is shining copper, spotted with black." From this
it appears he could mean no other than the common copper butterfly, which is
found in June and August in meadows, Papilio Phlaeas; for though the scarce
copper butterfly was probably found in his time, it must have been very rare;
and he would not have omitted in his catalogue of English Lepidopterae, to
mention an insect so common as Papilio Phlaeas, if he had noticed the other. He
has also the same error in his Aurelian.

Linnaeus says this beautiful little Insect feeds on the Chestnut. We found it

There are two varieties of this species: one kind being at least twice the
size of the other; in every other respect they perfectly agree. This Insect is
commonly seen on still waters, in the Summer; when they cause a gentle
agitation of the surface, by the quickness of their motions, and row along on
their back, with their hinder legs, which are formed for swimming. Both kinds
are shown in the Plate, FIG. I. and II. FIG. III. is the largest sort magnified
to exhibit the curious markings of the Elytra.


PLATE CLXXVII. THE CATERPILLAR OF PHALAENA PINI.
We have introduced in the annexed plate, figures of the Caterpillars of
Phalaena Pini, copied from the works of the two most accurate entomologists
that have described or figured the insects of any part of the European
continent; and though unfortunately the descriptions are written in a language
so little understood as to be wholly useless; the figures are very interesting.
In this instance we have deviated no more from our original plan than when we
introduced the larva of Sphinx Euphorbiae, and Phalaena Fraxini; and we flatter
ourselves in thus endeavoring to give the history of a rare insect complete,
the approbation expressed by our subscribers, on former occasions, will not be
withheld on the present.

Roesel, in 1746, published the Insecten Belustigung; in which work we find a
figure of the Caterpillar of Phalaena Pini: it accords with the description
given by Fabricius; perhaps the description was taken from Roesel's plate.
"Larva subcaudata, albo griseo fuscoque variegata, collaribus coeruleis:
punctis utrinque rufis." Fab. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. 426. 62.

Kleeman, the relation and successor of Roesel, in the third part of his
supplement, Plate 6. fig. 7 Published in 1793.
. has shown the Caterpillar of this insect in another skin, or probably it is
the Caterpillar of the male, Roesel having only the female in his works; in
this specimen the colors are bright, and it is particularly distinguished by
the collar being red instead of blue. -- As this part of his work is scarcely
known, and has not yet been noticed by Fabricius, we cannot collect the opinion
of any systematical writer, whether it be the other sex, or only a different
skin.

The pupa we received with the moths; and the eggs figured in plate 178, were
taken from the body of the female.

The Pine Lappet Moth is one of those species of insects, that we can have no
doubt are natives of this country, from the concurrent testimony of the
respectable authors; though from the scarcity of many amongst them, we should
be scarcely inclined to admit them into an English collection without such
authority. Perhaps the rarity of some of those insects should be rather
attributed to the little attention bestowed on the science of Entomology by
such as reside in parts of the kingdom that are most favorable to the increase
of insects in general; or to those particularly rare species that are local, or
feed only on plants of one kind; such as the Sphinx Euphorbiae, and many others.

Wilks has given the Pine Lappet Moth in the third plate of the English
butterflies. Harris has not figured it in the Aurelian Published in 1766.
, but in the Pocket Companion 1775.
he not only describes it amongst the English Lepidoptera, but says, the time
of its changing into Chrysalis is May, and that it appears in the winged state
in June; from this we must suppose, that he had reared it from the Caterpillar.
Berkenhout, in his synopsis of the natural history of Great Britain 1789.
, has given it without hesitation as an English insect; and the authority of a
little tract on insects, by Martin 1785.
, may be adduced as a further confirmation of its being a native of this
country.

This Insect is not uncommon in Germany. Schaeffer has figured it amongst the
insects that are to be found in the environs of Ratisbon; and Roesel, without
considering it a local species, has given it as a native of Germany. Whether it
is found in other parts of Europe, except Switzerland and Germany, we cannot
decide; but we have the precise species from Georgia in North America.

We observe a considerable difference between the coloring of this moth in the
works of Schaeffer and Roesel, which is the more remarkable, as they both
describe the insects of the same country; the figure given by the latter is
much darker in the chestnut color, and the gray has no appearance of an
intermixture of red specks and markings, like that figured in Schaeffer, which
inclines very much to red or flesh color throughout. Roesel has only figured
the female; Schaeffer has given both sexes.

This Moth is far from common. It is found on the oak, in the Caterpillar
state, late in the summer; changes to chrysalis in the first week of October;
the fly appears late in April, or early in May. Harris greatly mistook the
meaning of Linnaeus, when he says, "Linnaean name, Sphinx Oo."


PLATE CLXXX. ASILUS CRABRONIFORMIS. HORNET FLY. DIPTERA. Wings, two.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Trunk horny? long straight, bivalved.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Body hairy; the three segments next the
thorax black, the four others yellow.

This is a very confined genus. Fabricius in the Species Infectorum describes
only thirty-three kinds; of these not more than eight are natives of this
country. The Asilus Crabroniformis is the largest, and is not uncommon in some
places in the summer, particularly frequenting wet meadows, and flying busily
about the middle of the day amongst flowers.

Its proboscis is a curious instrument; the sting of it is very painful, and
causes a swelling.
