ACT 1.
AIR by Mr. DODD.
I.
Which sense of the five does not Bacchus delight!
He Is a rose to the Smell. He Is a ruby to Sight.
From the flask as He sparkles, He sings to the car,
And He Is soft to the Touch as to Taste He is dear:
'Gain'st his Godhead it is impious for Mortals to strive;
For each sense should be His, who can cherish the five.
II.
But no charm that He gives no delight He supplies,
Is so sweet as the Opiate He sheds over our sighs;
For when Care or dull Sorrow perplexes our breasts,
He can banish the Senses that harbor such Guests!
To his God-^ead let Mortals then servently call,
Who can sooth every Sense, by suspending them all.
AIR by Mr. BANNISTER.
I.
Soon as the busy Day is over,
And Evening comes with pleasant shade,
We Gondoliers from shore to shore,
Merrily ply our jovial trade.
And while the Moon shines on the stream,
And as soft music breathes around;
The feathering oar returns the gleam,
And dips in concert to the sound.
II.
Down by some Convent's mouldering walls
Often we bear the enamored youth;
Softly the watchful Fair he calls,
Who whispers vows of Love and Truth.
And while the Moon, etc.
III.
"And often where the Rialto swells,
"With happier pairs we circle round;
"Whose secret sighs fond Echo tells,
"Whose murmured vows she bids resound.
And while the Moon, etc.
IV.
"Then joys the Youth, that Love concealed,
"That fearful Love must own its sighs;
"Then smiles the Maid, to hear revealed
"How more than ever she complies,"
And while, etc.
AIR by Mr. DU BELLAMY.
I.
By adverse Fate when Beauty sighs,
A mingled claim our bosoms prove;
It Is Virtue graced with gentler ties,
It Is Pity softened into Love.
II.
Blessed, doubly blessed, his transport glows,
Whose Pity can each joy refine,
When from that God-like source it flows,
The generous passion is divine.
AIR by Mrs. CARGILL.
I.
In my pleasant native plains,
Winged with bliss each moment flew;
Nature there inspired the strains,
Simple as the joys I knew;
Jocund Morn and Evening gay
Claimed the merry Roundelay.
II.
Fields and slocks, and fragrant flowers,
All that health and joy impart;
Called for artless Music's powers,
Faithful echoes to the heart!
Happy hours for ever gay
Claimed the merry Roundelay.
III.
But the breath of genial Spring
Waked the warblers of the grove;
Who, sweet birds, that heard you sing,
Would not join the song of love?
Your sweet notes and chauntings gay
Claimed the merry Roundelay.
AIR by Mr. DU BELLAMY.
I.
"Not for thy wings, oh God of love!
"Sighs the Youth that would not rove;
"Not for thy arrow pants the heart,
"Blessed to seel the mutual dart.
II.
"But that I never may jealous live,
"Me thy careless childhood give,
"And, to secure unchanged delight,
"Share thy band, and veil my sight."
AIR by Mrs. CARGILL.
I.
Yes, I long for the comical sight;
Such a pair of odd Lovers to meet;
When they are wedded in Fortune's despigh
How I Will laugh at the pleasant deceit!
II.
O but once let the knot be fast joined,
Low I Will curtsey and wish you both joy;
She by chance, such a treasure to find,
You, by art, such a prize to decoy.
QUARTETTO.
Mr. BANNISTER, Mrs. WRIGHTEN, Mr. SUETT, and Mrs. CARGILL. LUCIO. By example
be taught, rash Lover beware,
Look at me -- look at her -- then wed if you dare.

FRANCISCA. How pevish -- ill-natured! I tell you never sear --
He Is quarrelsome, scolding, contancrous, severe.

PIANO. Oh! how pleasant and lively a tender dispute!
I like it -- it is sprightly -- my temper 'twill suit.
I Am not to be frightened.

LUCIO. Stay 'till wedlock you have tried


FRANCISCA. Yet he sees its worst daugers.


LUCIO. That cannot be denied.

Trust to me, trust to me, trust to me, trust to me.

ACT II.
AIR by Miss PHILLIPS.
I.
Ah! think me not unfeeling Love;
If still from thee I hide each pain,
It Is but that thou may better prove
The fancied peace I strive to feign.
II.
I would not have thy generous breast
Pierced with a pang beyond its own;
'Twou'd point thy griefs were mine confessed
Ah! leave me then to weep alone.
AIR by Miss PHILLIPS.
I.
The gentle primrose of the vale,
Whose tender bloom rude winds assail,
Droops its meek leaves, and scarce sustains
The night's chill snow and beating rains.
II.
It Is past -- the morn returns -- sweet spring
Is come -- and hills and valleys sing --
But low the gentle Primrose lies;
No more to bloom, no more to rise!
DUET By Miss PHILLIPS and Mr. DUBELLAMY.
MELVILLE. "Still, ah! still in accents sweet,
"The soft vows of Truth repeat;
"Breathe, that gentlest balm of care,
"Sighs that sooth the griefs they share.

EMILY. "Let thy own fond heart reveal,
"All that equal love can seel:
"Let each hope, each fear it knows,
"My responsive cares disclose.

BOTH. "O mutual Love, thy gentle smile
"Can Fortune's rudest frown beguile;
"Even parting sighs with thee delight;
"Sweet are the sorrows that unite."

DIALOGUE SONG.
CHARLES. Hence with dull intruding sorrow,
Hence with Wisdom's cold delay;
They alone should dread tomorrow,
Who want Love to bless today.

MARINETTA. Yes, too swiftly passes Pleasure,
Not to seize her fleeting joy,
But, to guard so dear a treasure,
Let not Doubt the bliss destroy.

CHARLES. Chide no more the jealous lover,
With fond hopes and fears possessed;
They who tenderest griefs discover,
Tenderest pleasure cherish best.

MARINETTA. Let not wayward fancy joining,
Strive our fondness to improve,
Leave to Grandeur's vain refining,
All that Nature trusts to love.

CHARLES. Meet me thus with cheerful smiles,
Meet me thus, we'll never repine.

MARINETTA. The frowns of Fortune, Love beguiles.
Love, that dreads no frown but thine.

AIR by Mr. PARSONS.
I.
This is a Petit-maitre's day --
Awake at noon,
Or scarce so soon,
See him to his sofa creep,
Sipping his tea -- half-asleep --
Curse the vapors!
Reach the papers --
What Is the opera? -- Them the play.
II.
Air my boots, I think I Will ride --
Though rot it, no!
It shakes one so --
Let them bring the vis-a-vis:
Lounging there, his Lordship see,
With vacant air,
And sullen stare,
Born of dullness, raised by pride!
III.
Stop at Betty's! -- What Is the news? --
A battle they say --
Have you pines today? --
Yes, my Lord -- We Have beat the Dutch.
Ha -- some ice -- I thought as much:
What, and nothing more?
That Is a monstrous bore! --
Well, drive to Issachar the Jews.
IV.
Last at Brookes's -- deep at play;
Issachar's debt,
At Faro set,
Win or lose, serenely sad,
Calm he sits, nor vexed, nor glad;
'Till half alive,
He cuts at five --
This is a Petit-maitre's day.
AIR by Mrs. WRIGHTEN.
What a Lover is he that has nothing to give,
But a look, and a vow, and a sigh!
Silly maid, take my word, you should know how to live,
Before you're so ready to die.
How stupid a pair are the Bridegroom and Bride,
Who wed but for cooing and billing;
Oh, how dull will they be, as they sit side by side,
If it happens they are not worth a shilling.
At first, by good luck, every hour of the day,
It Is my darling, my soul's dearest pleasure;
But at last, says the wife, I want money to pay,
Come, give it, my heart's richest treasure!
"But I have it not, sweeting!" -- This theme may breed strife --
"Come let us be cooing and billing" --
Go, barbarous Husband -- Go, termagant Wise --
So it happens when not worth a shilling.
TRIO and CHORUS. By Miss PHILLIPS, Mr. DUBELLAMY, Mr. WILLIAMS, etc.
VALENTIO. Now, when bashful day-light's gone,
And night that hides a blush comes on,
With tender awe that dreads those eyes,
Thy secret lover breathes his sighs.

MELVIL. Not for the gloom her shades impart,
Does Evening glad my faithful heart,
But that her still and gentle air
May waft each sigh our bosoms share.

EMILY. Welcome that well-known voice
That sings of love and truth.

VALENTIO. Another claims thy choice.


EMILY. It Is vain, mistaken youth.


VALENTIO. Love is sportive, fond of wiles.


MELVIL. Yet on faithful ardour smiles.


VALENTIO. Love rewards the boldest swain.


EMILY. Not with joy that others pain.


VALENTIO. Fly swiftly, ye hours -- fly swiftly away.
'Till the tender delusions confessed.

MELVIL. Fly swiftly, ye hours -- fly swiftly away,
'Till truth with fond rapture is blessed.

ACT III.
AIR by Mrs. CARGILL.
I.
Young Lubin was a shepherd boy,
Fair Rosalie a rustic maid;
They met, they loved; each others joy,
Together over the hills they strayed.
II.
Their parents saw, and blessed their love,
Nor would their happiness delay;
Tomorrow's dawn their bliss should prove,
Tomorrow be their wedding day.
III.
When as at eve, beside the brook,
Where strayed their flocks, they sat and smiled,
One luckless lamb the current took,
'Twas Rosalie's -- she started wild.
IV.
Run, Lubin, run, my favorite save;
Too fatally the youth obeyed:
He ran, he plunged into the wave,
To give the little wanderer aid.
V.
But scarce he guides him to the shore,
When faint and sunk, poor Lubin dies:
Ah Rosalie! for ever more,
In his cold grave thy Lover lies.
VI.
On that lone bank -- Oh! still be seen,
Faithful to grief, thou hapless maid;
And with sad wreaths of cypress green,
For ever sooth thy Lubin's shade.
TRIO. By Mrs. CARGILL, Mr. DODD, and Mr. BANNISTER.
CHARLES. Merrily pass the hours of youth,
Blessed with joys unceasing;
The heart is light that honors truth,
Where love is still increasing.

MARINETTA. To distant shores though Love invite,
We often shall think of you,
And still, to win life's true delight,
Thy cheerful words renew.
Merrily, etc.

LUCIO. Each sweetest joy of love be yours,
Of faithful love, its own reward,
And all that bliss, which most endures,
When most its generous vows you guard.

AIR by Mr. SUETT.
O! the little God of Love is a roguish Elf!
He makes us all as childish and blind as himself!
Against sixty-two,
O luckless lot!
His bow he drew,
At me he shot.
Twang went the string,
Whizz flew the dart,
On a gray goose wing,
To an old man's heart.
But I Will be merry,
Hey down derry;
Dull sorrow I Will drown,
Derry down down,
Or laugh at them all,
Tol de roll lol.
AIR by Mrs. WRIGHTEN.
O! never be one of those sad silly fellows,
Who always are snappish, suspicious, and jealous,
Who live but to doubt,
To pine and to pout,
To take one to task,
Examine, and ask
A hundred cross questions, to pick something out.
O! never, etc.
If by chance he should come,
And not find her at home,
It Is, "Madam, why so late?
"Where the Devil could you wait?
"What Is been done? what is been said?
"Zounds! I feel it on my head."
O! never, etc.
AIR by Miss PHILLIPS.
Lost in the brightness of returning joys,
Each grief recedes, each sorrow fades away,
As open into smiles the darkened skies
Before the rosy promise of the day.
(CARNIVAL MUSIC.)
TRIO of PEASANTS. What joy, from rustic toils at rest,
Thus the Peasant's heart to cheer!
What joy, with varying pleasures blessed,
Thus to crown the circling year!
AIR.
Lords and ladies, lads and lasses,
Gayly now each moment passes.
It Is Carnival!
It Is Carnival!
The merry hours are glad and gay,
Laugh and frolic, sport and play.
DIALOGUE.
First Shewman. My masters -- here is the lion great,
The pride of all creation;

Second. And here the dwarf and giant wait,
The wonder of the nation.

Mountebank. But here is the doctor, lord of fate,
Stands first in reputation.

First Shewman. He Is a quack.


Second. Drive him back.


Mountebank. Envious rogues, you fear me.


First Shewman. Best be civil.


Second. Why? the Devil!


All. Let the people hear me.


CHORUS.
Now with song and dance rejoice,
All be mirth and gay delight;
Every heart and every voice
Join to greet the festive night.
FINIS.
