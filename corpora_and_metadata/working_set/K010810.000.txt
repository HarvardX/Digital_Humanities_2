A HERMIT'S TALE: RECORDED BY HIS OWN HAND, AND FOUND IN HIS CELL.

There often is found an Avarice in Grief;
And the wan Eye of Sorrow loves to gaze
Upon the secret Hoard of treasured Woes.

RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, Esquire.
SIR,
EQUALLY induced by a just admiration of your talents, and a grateful sense of
the distinction your praise has given to those you were pleased to find in me,
permit me to solicit your further indulgence to this little production; and be
assured, its greatest value in my eyes is, that it serves to convey those
acknowledgments, with which I have the honor to remain,

SIR, Your most obliged, Obedient humble servant, SOPHIA LEE.

A HERMIT's TALE.
I.
FROM prime of youth to hoary age
In this lone cell I Have dwelt;
Here sought, by tracing Nature's page,
To soothe the pangs I felt.
II.
The moss-wove oaks that near my cave
In sullen grandeur stand,
And over its broken summit wave,
Were acorns in my hand.
III.
Those time-shook towers, which all forsake,
Erect, and gay, I Have seen;
And half of yon translucent lake,
A flow'r-enamell'd green.
IV.
When shall my penitence and prayers
Obtain the boon I crave?
When shall my thorny bed of cares
Become my peaceful grave?
V.
Oh worshipped relics! holy book!
Detain my mental eye;
Nor let it ever backward look
To trace sad memory.
VI.
Or thou! memorial cross of God,
My whole attention seize!
And bow my heart upon the sod,
Worn daily by my knees.
VII.
Alas! not Piety can heal
The soul convulsed with guilt;
Nor all her fountains cleanse the steel
Which human blood has spilt.
VIII.
Ah! let me ease it then, and speak
The long, long treasured tale;
What bitter griefs first bade me seek
The silence of this vale.
IX.
Near Cheviot Hills I drew the air
On Aran's pleasant plain;
My mother was of presence fair,
Her sire an aged swain.
X.
To tend the flocks was my employ,
Nor ever heaved my breast,
When my fond mother blessed her boy,
At rising, and at rest.
XI.
Yet often with tears and smiles she strove,
And as I bent my knee,
She Would cry, "be juster to thy love,
Than mine has been to me."
XII.
Yet little note of this I took,
Unskilled in worldly harms,
And more admired my flow'r-bound crook,
Than her unequalled charms.
XIII.
The lowly cot, and shepherd's life,
Each night, each morn, she praised;
And when they spoke of warlike strife,
With terror on me gazed.
XIV.
For now the wars of Palestine
Brave Coeur de Lion fought;
While all admired the zeal divine,
And with his deeds were fraught.
XV.
The glorious talk to me was good;
And as it filled my ear,
I seemed to cleave the founding flood,
Or grasp a fancied spear.
XVI.
When, lo! the neighboring Scots, a band
Rough as their native rocks,
Rushed like a whirlwind over the land,
And swept away our flocks.
XVII.
By many an art my mother tried
My vengeance to restrain;
But anger argument defied,
And even her tears were vain.
XVIII.
Each swain I bade renounce his crook;
Each swain obeyed my voice;
The ravagers we soon o'ertook,
And left them not a choice.
XIX.
No parle did either party use,
Impelled by fierce disdain;
One sought as men who'd all to lose,
The other to regain.
XX.
Day faintly purpled over the sky
When the fell fight began;
But ere our stubborn foes would fly,
The Sun his course had ran.
XXI.
Thus we retrieved our fleecy store,
So late bewailed as lost,
And seemed, I ween, to love them more,
For all the blows they cost.
XXII.
Not Richard's self his warriors led
More proudly over the deep,
Than I for Aran's pastures sped,
Surrounded by my sheep.
XXIII.
As nigh I drew, the clouds did roll
A crimson over the night;
The valley flamed -- and my full soul
Died in me at the fight.
XXIV.
Another band of those who roam
Our hamlet had destroyed:
And while we fought to guard our home,
Had made that home a void.
XXV.
A while I wept, and duteous sought
My parents dear remains;
At length my heart, with vengeance fraught,
An useless grief disdains.
XXVI.
I roused the swains who yet deplored
Each desolated field;
I turned my sheep-hook to a sword,
My scrip into a shield.
XXVII.
The savage Scots I swore t'annoy
With ever-loud alarms,
And from a simple shepherd-boy,
Became renowned in arms.
XXVIII.
Between both lands strong towers I rear
With captive ensigns bright:
One nation gazed on them with fear;
The other with delight.
XXIX.
Around I station'd many a band,
Who dubious stragglers sought;
And ah! one day, by love's command,
A matchless beauty brought.
XXX.
Her mien majestic seemed to speak
The unsullied soul within;
No rose like that on her pure cheek
Blooms over the face of sin.
XXXI.
Oh! not in grace the mountain pine
With her slight form could vye,
The blue that paints the arch divine
Was faint to her bright eye.
XXXII.
Like a rich group of yellow sheaves,
In ringlets wild, her hair
Played on her breast -- so Autumn leaves
Hang on the lily fair.
XXXIII.
Awe-struck, my soul imbibed a flame
As virtuous as sincere;
Nor dared I boldly ask the name,
I most desired to hear.
XXXIV.
Unconscious of her beauty's blaze,
She drew away the shade;
With dignity endured my gaze,
And thus to speak essayed.
XXXV.
"Although by force I hither bend
"The captive of thy sword,
"From brutal hands I seek a friend,
"Nor need I own a Lord.
XXXVI.
"Of English blood thy servant came,
"Not from a hostile line,
"Lord Ethel is my Father's name,
"And Ethelinda mine.
XXXVII.
"To Scotland with my Mother sent,
"A Grandsire's eyes to close,
"Her sum of days like his are spent,
"With him she finds repose.
XXXVIII.
"Even now on silver Severn's side
"My Father anxiously
"Forgets the day my Mother died,
"To look in vain for me.
XXXIX.
"By Knighthood's holy laws, oh Youth!
"I therefore claim your gage,
"That you yield him with care, and truth,
"The darling of his age.
XL.
"So may the peace to him you give
"With large increase return;
"So crowned with conquest may you live,
"And glory crown your urn!"
XLI.
"Be safe," I cried, "thou lovely Maid;
"By warlike Richard's throne,
"Never shall she vainly ask my aid,
"Whom truth and honor own.
XLII.
"By Knighthood's holy laws I swear,
"And give the unquestioned gage,
"To yield thy Sire, with truth, and care,
"The darling of his age.
XLIII.
"To horse, to horse, each vassal knight,
"Prepare your burnished arms;
"Diffuse around a dazzling light,
"To hide, and guard, these charms.
XLIV.
"A Nymph beyond even Helen fair,
"Bestows a nobler trust;
"A Youth her beauty well might snare,
"Is Man, in love -- yet just."
XLV.
And soon my warriors over the waste
In gay profusion roll;
The Lady in the center placed,
Irradiated the whole.
XLVI.
Still as we journied on, I sought,
With love's unconscious art,
TO impress myself on every thought,
'Till I had won her heart.
XLVII.
And now my fears would often hint
Her Sire might prove unkind,
And wiser 'twere our trust to stint,
But duteous was her mind.
XLVIII.
"Ah doubt not, Edmund," -- she would say,
"Thy worth must all engage;
"Nor dare I scorn a father's sway,
"Nor dare I grieve his age.
XLIX.
"His silvered head, as lilies bow,
"Declining now appears;
"Alike his frame does tremble now,
"With tenderness and years.
L.
"And sure a fearful joy she knows
"Who unpermitted loves;
"While doubly hallowed are the vows
"A parent's voice approves."
LI.
"More fondly draws the heart's dear chain,
"When watching his decay;
"Oh! the sad charm, to know his pain
"In blessings melts away!"
LII.
Filled with her love, soothed with her hope,
The present hour I blessed;
And gave luxuriant fancy scope,
Who more enriched the rest.
LIII.
When now we reached fair Severn's side,
Where 'mid her fairest bowers,
A mountain swelled with verdant pride,
Crowned with Lord Ethel's towers.
LIVE.
As to the height we gaily wound,
From apprehension free,
Surpised we heard the drum's fierce sound,
Proclaim an enemy.
LV.
Like shining swarms of bees, in arms
The Knights now multiply;
And pleasure's notes, and war's alarms,
Our mingling trumpets cry.
LVI.
When proud I did the Lady show, --
Who bade all discord cease;
More radiant than the vernal bow,
Heavens own bright pledge of peace,
LVII.
Her name, in various accents cried,
Was borne away within,
While the vast portals opening wide,
Increased the joyful din.
LVIII.
Forth rushed, tumultuous as the wind,
Knights who no longer frowned;
But marching with their spears declined,
A mute obedience owned.
LIX.
At once, dividing to each side,
Like waves the train retire;
And as the swan floats with the tide,
Slow came the reverend Sire.
LX.
The gift of health, an aged bloom,
His manly cheek confessed;
And white his locks, as erst the plume,
That quiver'd over his crest.
LXI.
The Maid oppressed with tender pain,
And, than the heart more fleet,
Now graceful shot along the plain,
And panted at his feet.
LXII.
Have you not seen the fragile rose,
Droop with the gems of morn?
So fair the kneeling Virgin shows,
A Parent's tears adorn.
LXIII.
Have you not seen the purple vine
With Autumn hoar embost?
Youth with such loveliness divine,
Glows wrapped in age's frost.
LXIV.
"Oh most beloved!" her father cried,
And fast his tears would fall,
"My youth's delight, my age's pride,
"My little earthly all!
LXV.
"Thy safe return in peace, and health,
"Does all my griefs assuage:
"Thy safe return does spare my wealth,
"And ah! does spare my age."
LXVI.
He said, and turning to a Knight,
Upon whose brow serene,
Sat grace attemper'd with delight,
While valor marked his mien.
LXVII.
"See, Baron," added he, "thy Bride;
"My child, behold the Son,
"Allotted for thy Lord, and guide,
"When thy fond father's gone.
LXVIII.
"Ah venerate that hallowed shield,
"Upon whose orb the cross,
"Declares, in many a well-fought field,
"The Saracens vast loss.
LXIX.
"With grateful love accept the hand,
"But for whose aid, forlorn,
"And fatherless, thou now might stand,
"Nor I hail thy return."
LXX.
My soul, as with an ague shook,
At once both froze and burned;
When she, not deigning him a look,
All tearful to me turned.
LXXI.
"Behold," she faltering said, "the sword
"Which set thy daughter free;
"Approve a heart where I Am adored --
"Where I alone would be. --
LXXII.
"Could I from duty have been won,
"His honor to reward,
"I should have called this Knight thy son,
"And claimed a like regard.
LXXIII.
"Oh! think, though fortune freed his will,
"With reverence he wooed;
"Oh! rise above the thought of ill --
"Remember gratitude. --
LXXIV.
"That claim I never will disown;
"Your power may bid me weep --
"But tears, like falling drops on stone,
"The heart's-wound wear more deep." --
LXXV.
The Baron's eyes blazed through the snow
Of age, with Hecla's fire;
And red his haughty blushes glow,
While thus he speaks his ire.
LXXVI.
"And who then art thou, nameless Youth?
From whence derived that flood,
"Which dies thy cheek with nature's truth,
"And vies with Ethel's blood?
LXXVII.
"Where are the honors of thy line?
"Unblazon'd on thy arms;
"Which thou presum'st to blend with mine,
"Vain of ignoble charms. --
LXXVIII.
"Know thou, the spoils of many a Knight
"Descend to me alone?
"Know thou the lands within thy sight,
"This Maid will one day own?
LXXIX.
"Learn, Youth, to ask some fit reward,
"Which with thy rank agrees;
"And fame, and wealth, and high regard,
"Thy anger shall appease."
LXXX.
"Hold, Lord," I cried, "nor meanly boast,
"Degraded ancestry;
"Thy honors in thyself are lost,
"While mine begin in me.
LXXXI.
"But let us prove this vaunted blood,
"This elevated line;
"And see if Edmund's humble flood,
"Nerve not his arm like thine.
LXXXII.
"For while firm youth shall brace his hand,
"And love his ardent heart,
"The matchless Maid he will demand,
"Who forms its dearest part.
LXXXIII.
"Come then, ye knights, your well-tried arms
"In deadly wrath produce,
"While ours, unwrought for such alarms,
"Gain strength alone from use."
LXXXIV.
Alost I waved my sword of power,
The spiral luster run,
And like the Guard of Eden's bower,
Flamed to the noonday sun.
LXXXV.
While thus we met, with equal ire,
Before my sorrowing eyes,
The proud inexorable Sire
Bore off the beauteous prize.
LXXXVI.
Oh! if ye ever knew to melt
In passion's tender glow,
I need not paint the pangs I felt,
At this extreme of woe.
LXXXVII.
Oh! if ye ever yet have raged,
Oppressed by savage power,
Ye well will guess the war we waged,
The fierceness of that hour.
LXXXVIII.
The sun unheeded veiled his head,
While many a casque was riv'n;
And that last darkness seemed to spread,
Which mingles earth with heaven.
LXXXIX.
Yet still in mortal conflict joined,
No respite we allow,
'Till often, by heaven's wild fires, we find
A friend slain for a foe.
XC.
Humanity at length over pride
Prevailed, and soothed this heat;
We deemed, 'till daylight should decide,
'Twere valor to retreat.
XCI.
But on the morn, at Ethel's word,
Lord-marcher of the land,
Indignant thousands on us poured,
Nor could we more withstand.
XCII.
My Knights, despoiled of armor, peace
Accepted as a boon;
My sword alone they dared not seize;
How useless when alone!
XCIII.
What then was all my early fame!
The wealth by valor given!
What then, alas! even virtue's flame!
The united gifts of heaven!
XCIV.
Lost to my heart its only joy,
Extinct at once its flights;
Sad images my days employ,
And sadder still my nights.
XCV.
The bridal feast approached, the vests
To many a fair were shown,
Full was the Baron's hall of guests,
Myself forbid alone.
XCVI.
All hope now lost, I wild arose,
And soon within the bound,
Where piety adores the cross,
My feet unconscious found.
XCVII.
Impelled by destiny, I past
When struck the vesper bell, --
A dreary eye around I cast,
And owned it as my knell.
XCVIII.
When lo! approaching fast, the tread
Of warlike steps I heard,
I turned, and as by justice led,
My Rival there appeared.
XCIX.
With wonder, blessing every shrine,
I drew the well-worn blade,
"One moment yet," I cried, "is mine --
"Deserve, or lose the Maid."
C.
Impetuous love each sinew strung,
As we by turns assailed;
And long the victory doubtful hung,
But oh! my fate prevailed.
CI.
At length, between the ill-jointed mail,
My sword a passage found,
Fast rushed the stream of life, and pale
He dropped upon the ground.
CII.
While sighs of rage from his proud breast
Impelled the vital flood,
A thousand pangs his eye confessed,
Beyond the waste of blood.
CIII.
"Ignoble Lord," I cried, "she is mine,
"On holy land you lie --
"Call to your aid the power divine,
"Repent, before you die."
CIV.
"Ah, say thou?" groaned he, " holy land!
"'It Was there my sins began;
"For thither, heedless of command,
"In early youth I ran."
CV.
"Broke too the unacknowledg'd tie
"An humble love had made;
"And left the charm of every eye
"In infamy to fade.
CVI.
"Alas! perhaps on Aran's plain
"She yet exists forlorn!
"With Albert's heir, a fancied swain,
"From lineal honors torn.
CVII.
"To Basil's daughter, my true bride,
"This ring restore again. --
"To Basil's daughter!" I replied,
"What, Emma of the plain?"
CVIII.
He groaned assent -- through all my frame
Did cold convulsions run --
"You see," I falter'd, "void of name,
"That miserable son --
CIX.
"The murdered Emma's only joy" --
He bent to earth his head:
"Oh do not more than kill me, boy!"
All-agoniz'd he said.
CX.
"Yet while I Have strength the truth to groan,
"To yonder convent run,
"Bid here the Monks, that I may own
"In you, my heir, my son."
CXI.
Already did the unwonted sound
The vesper rites restrain;
And forth the holy Fathers wound,
A venerable train.
CXII.
With consecrated lights they star
The bosom of the earth,
And list with hallowed zeal afar,
The blessing of our birth.
CXIII.
Before the cross the dying Lord,
With penitential awe,
In silence first his God adored,
And mourned his broken law:
CXIV.
Then raising to the Monks his eyes,
Where life's last luster played,
"Suspend these sacred rites," he cries,
'Till I deserve your aid. --
CXV.
"If struggling thus with shame and death,
"I dare avow a truth,
"Confirmed by my expiring breath,
"Oh vindicate this Youth!
CXVI.
"Inform my Liege, that led by pride,
"Yet by fond passion won,
"In early youth I chose a bride,
"I ever scorned to own.
CXVII.
"With impious zeal, the band I joined
"He led to Palestine,
"And with false glory fired my mind,
"TO elude the wrath divine.
CXVIII.
"With him I every danger dared,
"Which marked the proud crusade;
"With him a prison's gloom I shared,
"Nor selt my soul upbraid. --
CXIX.
"While in our Northern wilds was born
"This Youth, whose energy
"Has from its seat that being torn,
"Which gave him first to be --
CXX.
"Since justly then, in flower of health,
"I expiate thus my pride,
"Oh may he give my heir my wealth,
"My name -- alas, my Bride!
CXXI.
"Unhappy Boy! if for thy fire
"These streaming sorrows flow,
"To save his soul from endless fire,
"Perennial prayers bestow."
CXXII.
He died -- nor had I time to think
On all I Would lost, or won, --
I hovered on creation's brink,
And clung to love alone.
CXXIII.
The busy Monks removed the corse,
The arms alone remained;
When fraud effected, what nor force,
Nor supplication gained.
CXXIV.
Encumbered with Lord Albert's mail,
A desperate hope I tried,
And soon the hostile mountain scale,
Where now the gates flew wide.
CXXV.
The high-arch'd halls I safely past,
Through lucid heraldry,
Where echo to the midnight blast
Sighed wild, and loud as me.
CXXVI.
'Till the lone gallery now appeared
Enriched with ponderous mail,
Where many a banner, time-endear'd,
Slow rustled to the gale.
CXXVII.
Upon its gilded sides portrayed,
Magnificently old,
Each ancestor's distinguished shade
Gave luster to the gold.
CXXVIII.
The snowy plumes appear to wave,
And arms, and forms divine,
Defend the honors which they gave,
Or deify the line.
CXXIX.
On me all seem to turn their eyes
Prophetic with my doom,
Then, like the rainbow's transient dies,
They melt into a gloom.
CXXX.
Beyond -- all open -- silent -- dim --
The lengthening rooms extend,
Where tapers shed a quivering gleam,
Each moment strove to end.
CXXXI.
With bold despair I thither past,
My sate's extremes to prove;
'Till entering, with rude step, the last,
I saw my long-lost love.
CXXXII.
Careless she viewed those arms so famed,
Nor once removed her eyes;
"Rests Ethelinda," I exclaimed,
"While ruined Edmund dies?
CXXXIII.
"Or tired of having thus withstood,
"Resolves she on a crime?
"But Hymen's torch is quenched in blood,
"And yielded up to time."
CXXXIV.
"By miracle since thou art come,"
She falter'd out, "to attest
"With heaven my melancholy doom,
"I trust to that the rest.
CXXXV.
"Unjust and cruel -- if you knew --
"What, doubt my passion yet?
"Edmund, this heart, forever true,
"Could break, but not forget.
CXXXVI.
"Each blush which deepen'd on my cheek,
"Declared my love's excess;
"Oh learn to think that passion weak,
"Which language can express --
CXXXVII.
"And when the last fond crimson flies
"With my expiring breath,
"Then, then, allow the sacrifice,
"And own my love -- in death.
CXXXVIII.
"Alas! even now that hour is come --
"For think not I would be,
"While herbs afford a mortal bloom,
"A Bride, and not to thee."
CXXXIX.
While yet she spoke, the roseate hue,
Which on her soft cheek played,
And her bright eyes celestial blue
Began apace to fade.
CXL.
Over her transparent tender skin
An icy polish spread;
A nerveless torpor crept within,
As she even then were dead.
CXLI.
More cold, and cold, that heart now grew,
Which gave such rich supplies;
More slow, and slow, her breath she drew,
'Till it was naught but sighs.
CXLII.
And now, beyond the grief of thought --
And now devoid of bloom --
She seemed a beauteous statue, wrought
To grace her own sad tomb.
CXLIII.
Astounded -- hopeless -- reckless -- lost --
Over the fair form, though dead,
Fond fancy's wish, vain reason's boast,
My heart in silence bled --
CXLIV.
No voice its solitude could break --
No object win my eye --
Not even her sire's complaints could wake
A keener agony.
CXLV.
Alas! to him who caused the grief,
Relenting fortune gave
A sudden, and a long relief,
In Ethelinda's grave.
CXLVI.
The Monks Lord Albert's will assert --
The King allowed my claim --
When did they know a breaking heart
Revive upon a name?
CXLVII.
Impatient of the proud control,
And thankless for each care,
To all these comforters my soul,
Sighed only out -- despair --
CXLVIII.
Of every human hope forlorn,
All-desolate I ran,
Wild as these woods, in them to mourn
The miseries of Man.
CXLIX.
Often on the hill, the hunters hear
The sadly vocal gale,
And turn aside with holy fear,
Nor dare the copse assail.
CL.
Even the wild deer, with look profound,
My sorrows seem to share,
And every groaning tree around
But echoes my despair --
CLI.
'Till sometimes, thought's aerial brood,
A wan, and numerous train,
Fantastic sons of solitude,
Catch life from my wild brain. --
CLII.
Full threescore times the frosts have bound
All streams but from these eyes,
Since here my care-worn limbs first found
A refuge from the skies.
CLIII.
Years upon years thus slowly roll,
Nor comfort bring to me,
Since even in sleep my active soul
Lives over her misery.
CLIV.
Dim are my days, and near the hour
When death at length is mine;
Which only can my bliss restore,
Or bid me never repine.
CLV.
Ye generous poor, who send me bread,
When on my rushy couch,
Your little offspring find me dead,
With pious hearts approach --
CLVI.
Hide me in earth, and consecrate
With tears this simple tale,
So may you ever 'scape the fate
Of Edmund of the Vale.
THE END.
