PREFACE.
THE following Synopsis was originally intended for private amusement, and as
an Index, for the more ready turning to any particular animal in the voluminous
history of quadrupeds by M. DE BUFFON: But as it swelled by degrees to a size
beyond my first expectation, in the end I was determined to fling it into its
present form, and to usher it into the world.

THE Synopsis of our illustrious countryman Mr. RAY has been long out of print;
and though from his enlarged knowledge and great industry one might well suppose
his Work would for some time discourage all further attempts of the same sort,
yet a republication of that Synopsis would not have answered our present
design: For, living at a period when the study of Natural History was but
beginning to dawn in these Kingdoms, and when our contracted. Commerce deprived
him of many lights we now enjoy, he was obliged to content himself with giving
descriptions of the few Animals brought over here, and collecting the rest of
his materials from other Writers. Yet so correct was his genius, that we view a
systematic arrangement arise even from the Chaos of Aldrovandus and Gesner.
Under his hand the indigested matter of these able and copious Writers assumes
a new form, and the whole is made clear and perspicuous.

FROM this period every Writer on these subjects proposed his own method as an
example; some openly, but others more covertly, aiming at the honor of
originality, and attempting to seek for fame in the path chalked out by Mr.
RAY; but too often without acknowleging the merit of the Guide.

MR. KLEIN, in 1751, made his appearance as a Systematic Writer on Quadrupeds,
and in his first order follows the general arrangement of Mr. RAY; but the
change he has made of separating certain animals, which the last had
consolidated, are executed with great judgment. He seems less fortunate in his
second order; for, by a servile regard to a method taken from the number of
toes, he has jumbled together most opposite animals; the Camel and the Sloth,
the Mole and the Bat, the Glutton and Apes; happy only in throwing back the
Walrus, the Seal, and the Manati, to the extremity of his system: I suppose, as
animals nearly bordering on another class.

M. BRISSON, in 1756, favored the world with another system, arranging his
animals by the number or defect of their teeth; beginning with those that were
toothless, such as the Ant-eater, and ending with those that had the greatest
number, such as the Opossum. By this method, laudable as it is in many
respects, it must happen unavoidably that some Quadrupeds, very distant from
each other in their manners, are too closely connected in his System; a defect,
which, however common, should be carefully avoided by every Naturalist.

IN point of time, LINNAEUS ought to have the precedence; for he published his
first System in 1735. This was followed by several others, varying constantly
in the arrangement of the animal kingdom, even to the last edition of 1766. It
is therefore difficult to defend, and still more ungrateful to drop any
reflections on a Naturalist, to whom we are so greatly indebted. The variations
in his different Systems may have arisen from the new and continual discoveries
that are made in the animal kingdom; from his sincere intention of giving his
Systems additional improvements, and perhaps from a failing, (unknown indeed to
many of his accusers) a diffidence in the abilities he had exerted in his prior
performances. But it must be allowed, that the Naturalist runs too great a
hazard in imitating his present guise; for in another year he may put on a new
form, and leave the complying Philosopher amazed at the metamorphosis.

BUT this is not my only reason for rejecting the system of this otherwise able
Naturalist: There are faults in his arrangement of Mammalia Or animals which
have paps and suckle their young; in which class are comprehended not only all
the genuine quadrupeds, but even the cetaceous tribe.
, that oblige me to separate myself, in this one instance, from his crowd of
votaries; but that my secession may not appear the effect of whim or envy, it
is to be hoped that the following objections will have their weight.

I reject his first division, which he calls Primates, or Chiefs of the
Creation; because my vanity will not suffer me to rank mankind with Apes,
Monkies, Maucaucos and Bats, the companions LINNAEUS has allotted us even in
this his last System.

THE second order of Bruta I avoid for much the same reason: The most
intelligent of Quadrupeds, the half-reasoning Elephant is made to associate
with the most discordant and stupid of the creation, with Sloths, Ant-eaters
and Armadillos, or with Manaties and Walruses, inhabitants of another element.

THE third order of Ferae is not more admissible in all its articles; for it
will be impossible to allow the Mole, the Shrew, and the harmless Hedgehog, to
be the companions of Lions, Wolves and Bears: We may err in our arrangement,
Sed non ut placidis Coeant immitia, non ut
Serpents avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.


IN his arrangement of his fourth and fifth orders we quite agree, except in
the single article Noctilio, a species of Bat, which happening to have only two
cutting teeth in each jaw, is separated from its companions and placed with
squirrels, and others of that class.

THE sixth order is made up of animals of the hoofed tribe; but of genera so
different in their nature, that notwithstanding we admit them into the same
division, we place them at such distances from each other, with so many
intervening links and softening gradations, as will, it may be hoped, lessen
the shock of seeing the Horse and the Hippopotame in the same piece. To avoid
this as much as possible, we have flung the last into the back ground, where it
will appear more tolerable to the Critic than if they were left in a manner
conjoined.

THE last order is that of Whales; which, it must be confessed, have, in many
respects, the structure of land animals; but their want of hair and feet, their
fish-like form, and their constant residence in the water, are arguments for
separating them from this class, and forming them into another independent of
the rest.

BUT while I thus freely offer my objections against embracing this System of
Quadrupeds, let me not be supposed insensible of the other merits of this great
and extraordinary person: His arrangement of fish, of insects, and of shells,
are original and excellent; he has, in all his classes, given philosophy a new
language; has invented apt names, and taught the world a brevity, yet a
fullness of description, unknown to past ages; he has with great industry
brought numbers of synonyms of every animal into one point of view; and has
given a concise account of the uses and manners of each, as far as his
observation extended, or the information of a numerous train of traveling
disciples could contribute: His Country may triumph in producing so vast a
Genius, whose spirit invigorates science in all that chilly region, and
diffuses it from thence to climates more favorable, which gratefully acknowledge
the advantage of its influences.

LET us now turn our eyes to a Genius of another kind, to whom the History of
Quadrupeds owes very considerable lights: I mean M. de Buffon, who, in the most
beautiful language, and in the most agreeable manner, has given the amplest
descriptions of the economy of the whole four-footed creation For the
anatomical part in the province of M. D' Aubenton.
: Such is his eloquence, that we forget the exuberant manner he treats each
subject, and the reflections he often casts on other Writers; the creation of
his own gay fancy This is not advanced without reason: B^, (...) in our regard
to a Gentleman whose abilities we respect, (...) forbear producing our proofs;
not doubting, but when he (...) had time to recollect himself, he will, by a
recantation of a certain g^d* misrepresentation, convince the Public that his
candor is not inferior to his learning and genius.
. Having in his own mind a comprehensive view of every animal, he unfortunately
seems to think it beneath him to shackle his lively spirit with systematic
arrangement; so that the Reader is forced to wander through numbers of volumes in
search of any wished-for subject. The misunderstanding between these two able
Naturalists is most injurious to science. The French Philosopher scarce
mentions the Suede, but to treat him with contempt; Linnaeus, in return, never
deigns even to quote M. de Buffon, notwithstanding he must know what ample
lights he might have drawn from him.

I shall in a few words mention the plan that is followed in the present
distribution of quadrupeds, and at the same time shall clame but a small share
of originality.

I copy Mr. RAY, in his greater divisions of animals into hoofed, and
digitated; but, after the manner of Mr. KLEIN, form separate genera of the
Rhinoceros, Hippopotame, Tapiir and Musk. The Camel being a ruminating animal,
wanting the upper foreteeth, and having the rudiments of hoofs, is placed in
the first order, after the Musk, a hornless cloven-hoofed quadruped.

THE Apes are continued in the same rank Mr. RAY has placed them, and are
followed by the Maucaucos.

THE carnivorous animals deviate but little from his system, and are arranged
according to that of LINNAEUS, after omitting the Seal, Mole, Shrew and
Hedgehog.

The herbivorous or frugivorous quadrupeds keep here the same station that our
countryman assigned them; but this class comprehends, besides the Shrew, the
Mole and the Hedgehog. The Mole is an exception to the character of this
order, in respect to the number of its cutting teeth; but its way of life, and
its food, place it here more naturally than with the Ferae, as LINNAEUS has
done. These exceptions are to be met with even in the method Such as the
Trichechus Rosmarus, which has four distinct grinders in every jaw, the Phoca
Ursina and Leonina, the Mustela Lutris, and the Sus Hydrochaeris; and
particularly in the genus of Vespertilio, which consists of numbers of species,
many of which vary greatly in the number of their fore teeth.
of that able Naturalist; nor can it be otherwise in all human systems; we are
so ignorant of many of the links of the chains of beings, that to expect
perfection in the arrangement of them would be the most weak presumption. We
ought, therefore, to drop all thoughts of forming a system of quadrupeds from
the character of a single part: but if we take combined characters of parts,
manners and food, we bid much fairer for producing an intelligible system,
which ought to be the sum of our aim.

THE fourth section of digitated quadrupeds consists of those which are
absolutely destitute of cutting teeth, such as the Sloth and Armadillo.

THE fifth section is formed of those which are destitute of teeth of every
kind, such as the Manis and Ant-eater.

THE third and fourth orders, or divisions, are the Pinnated and the Winged
Quadrupeds; the first takes in the Walrus and the Seals, and (in conformity to
preceding Writers) the Manati. But those that compose this order are very
imperfect: Their limbs serve rather the use of sins than legs; and their
element being for the greatest part the water, they seem as the links between
the quadrupeds and the cetaceous animals.

THE Bats again are winged quadrupeds, and form the next gradation from this to
the class of Birds; and these two orders are the only additions I can boast of
adding in this Work.

SO far of System; the rest of my plan comprehends numerous Synonyms of each
Animal, a brief description, and as full an account of their place, manners, or
uses, as could be collected from my own observations, or the information of
others; from preceding Writers on the subject; from printed Voyages of the best
authorities, or from living Voyagers And it may be added, from the different
Museums at home and abroad, particularly from that matchless collection in the
British Museum; and, placed as it is under the direction of Gentlemen as much
distinguished for their politeness as their love of science, my access to its
contents, has been rendered, at all fit times, so easy, as to put this Work
under singular obligations to them.
. If it has the fortune to be any-ways useful to my Countrymen, in promoting
the knowledge of Natural History, my principal object will be answered: Let it
be treated with candor till something better appears; and when that time comes
the Writer will cheerfully resign it to oblivion, the common fate of antiquated
Systems.

H. with a long flowing mane; tail covered on all parts with long hairs.

Cultivated in most parts of the world. In a wild state, at present only in the
Tartarian deserts, and in S. America; the last from the European breed, escaped
from the owners and turned savage. Horses unknown in America before its
discovery by the Spaniards. The most generous and useful of quadrupeds, docil,
spirited yet obedient; adapted to all purposes the draught, the chase, the
race: its voice, neighing; its arms, hoofs and teeth; its tail of the utmost
use in driving off insects in hot weather. Subject to various diseases, many
from our abuse, more from our too great care of it. Its exuviae useful (...)
the skin for collars and traces; the hair of the mane for wigs; of the tail,
for the bottoms of chairs, and floor-cloths: Tartars feed on its flesh, and
drink the milk of mares.

H. with a short erect mane: tail furnished with long hairs at the end: whole
body beautifully striped from the back to the belly, with lines of brown, on a
very pale buff ground. The most elegant of quadrupeds.

Inhabits Africa, from Congo to the Cape of Good Hope, thence to Aethiopia.
Gregarious, useless, untameable, vicious: vastly swift: most probably known to
the Romans, being of the same country with the Giraffa, which had been early
introduced into their spectacula. Martial seems to hint at it by his pulcher
onager; Oppian particularly describes the stripes diverging from the black list
on the back.

Still found wild in small numbers, in the marshy forests of Poland and
Lithuania, and the eastern parts of Siberia. The Urus, Bonasus, and Bison, of
the ancients; the finest and largest tame cattle in Holstein and Poland; the
smallest in Scotland: most useful animals, every part serviceable, the horns,
hide, milk, blood, fat. More subject than other animals to the pestilence. Goes
nine months with young.

to drink out of; in amplissimis epulis pro poculis utuntur says Caesar: if,
according to Pliny, each horn held an urna, or four gallons, it was a goodly
draught. Gesner in his Icon. Anim. 34, says, he saw a horn, he supposes of an
Urus, hung against a pillar in the cathedral of Strasbourg, which was six feet
long.

long hairs: strikes with its head like a goat: is very unruly: found in the
country of the Calmucs, called by them Sarluk. Grunts like a hog.

In the Br. Museum, the tail of a cow from Tibet, covered with fine white silky

mentions this species; Rubruquis speaks of the same kind, which he says are
very strong, and draw the houses of the Tartars; and that they have a great
aversion to red.

if wounded, will turn on its enemy, and never fail of destroying him.

. Differ much in size, and in the form of their horns. Some very large, of a
reddish color: horns short and bending close to the neck: others very small,
with horns almost upright, bending a little forward. In Surat a minute kind,
not bigger than a great dog, which have a fierce look, and are used to draw
children in small carts.

In Celebes a small species, not larger than a middle sized sheep, called Anoa,
very fierce and wild, of a dark ash color, inhabiting the rocks. Mr. Loten,
when in India, put some of them into a paddock, and in one night's time they
killed 14 or 15 of his deer, by ripping open their bellies.

O. with large horns, strait for a great length from their base, then bending
inwards; not round but compressed, and one side sharp.

Found wild in many parts of Africa and India: but in both are domesticated:
serve for milking and producing cheese: are very common in Italy, originally
brought from India, into Lombardy, in the reign of King Agilulf, who reigned
from 591 to 616 Tunc primum caballi sylvatici et Bubali in Italiam delati,
Italia populis miraculo fuerunt. Warnefridi de gestis Longobardor. Lib. iv.
. They are said to be found wild in Apuglia; and to be very common in hot
weather on the sea shore, between Manfredonia and Barletta; serve for the
draught and for the saddle instead of horses; grow to an enormous size, twice
the bulk of our largest oxen, from which some call them Taurelephantes. A pair
of horns in the Br. Museum, probably of this kind: one is 6 feet 6 inches long,
weighed 21 lb. and the hollow contained five quarts of water. Lobo mentions
some that would hold more than ten. Dellon has seen some in India 10 feet long:
they are sometimes wrinkled, but oftener smooth and black: skin almost destitute
of hair, Misson's voy. iv. 392.
and black: eyes whitish: very common in Italy, especially the hotter parts,
introduced there originally from India: are very fierce when in a state of
nature: fond of wallowing in the mud: love the sides of rivers, and swim very
well.

Well described by Aristotle, under the title of wild oxen among the Arachotae,
notwithstanding Belon and M. de Buffon say it was unknown to him.

A. NAKED: a small sort exhibited in London some years ago, under the name of
Bonasus; of the size of a Welsh runt: hair on the body bristly, and very thin,
so that the skin appeared: the rump and thighs quite bare: the first marked on
each side with two dusky stripes pointing downward, the last with two tranverse
stripes: horns compressed sideways, taper, sharp at the point. East Indies.

and turning outward at their points; two feet round at the base, and vastly
prominent, rising just on the top of the forehead; length only two feet; very
sharp at the points: head and shoulders of the bull covered with very long
hairs, of a dark color: body naked behind: shoulders very high: flesh scents
strong of musk.

Common in the interior parts of N. America, in the Savanna's; fond of marshy
places: lodges amidst the high reeds: very fierce, but capable of being tamed:
will breed with the common kind: the only animal analogous to the domestic
creatures found in America by the Europeans: weighs from 1600 to 2400 lb. M. de
Buffon gives the figure of some horns of this species, which he thinks came
from the Cape of Good Hope.

O. with horns almost close at their base, broad and flat at the beginning:
receding in the middle, almost meeting at the points, and standing erect:
larger than a roebuck, less than a stag: compact, and well made in all its
limbs: hair shining, of a a tawny brown: legs short, neck thick, shoulders a
little elevated: tail terminated with long hairs, twice as coarse as those of a
horse.

The horns of this animal are in the Museum of the royal society, described by
Grew. p. 26. who mistakes the animal they belong to. M. de Buffon imagines his
Zebu xi. 439. tab. xlii. to be Belon's; but that as well as Mr. Edwards's
little Buffalo, plate 200, are only varieties of the Indian ox b. Perhaps the
Lant or Dant described by Leo Afri^nus, p. 340, may be of this kind, of whose
hide are made shields and targets, impenetrable by a bullet. He celebrates
their swiftness, says their hair is white, hoofs black as jet.

Subject to vast variety: its origin not certainly known. The Moufflon of M. de
Buffon, to be described hereafter, approaches nearest; but still has some
distinctions that makes it nearer allied to the goat and deer.

The sheep the most useful of the lesser animals; the source of wealth in
civilized nations. England once the envy of Europe for its vast commerce in the
products of this creature, now begins to be rivalled by others, through the
neglect, the luxury, the too great avidity of our manufacturers. The English
wool excellent for almost every purpose. The Spanish extremely fine; the
economy of the shepherds admirable, as is their vast attention to the
business; and their annual migrations with their flocks. The finest fleeces in
the world are those of Caramania Chardin's Travels in Harris's Coll. ii. 878.

excellent; and the Lamb-skins of Bucharia exquisite. Bell's Travels, I. 46.
These skins bear a great price, have a ^ne gloss and rich look.
.

The sheep in its nature harmless and timid; resists by butting with its horns:
threatens by stamping with its foot: drinks little: generally brings one at a
time, sometimes two, rarely three: goes about five months with young: is
subject to the ^ot; worms in its liver; the vertigo.

a kind from Spain, with two upright and two lateral horns: body covered with
wool: forepart of the neck with yellowish hairs, 14 inches in length: was alive
in London about three years ago: very mischievous and pugnacious: the horns the
same with those in Grew, tab. 2.: very different from the common sort of

Leo Africanus, 341. which he says furnishes the Lybians with milk and cheese;
is of the size of an ass, shape of a ram, with pendent ears. Della Valle tells

They are so long as to trail on the ground, and the shepherds are obliged to
put boards with small wheels under the tails to keep them from galling. These
tails are esteemed a great delicacy, are of a substance between fat and marrow,
and are eaten with the lean of the mutton. Some of these tails weigh 50 lb.

and have few knobs on the upper surface; bring one young, seldom two at a time
Ridinger.
. Inhabit the highest Alps of the Grisons country, and the Vallais; are also
found in Crete: are very wild and difficult to be shot, as they always keep on
the highest points. Their chase very dangerous: being very strong, they often
tumble the incautious huntsman down the precipices, except he has time to lie
down, and let the animals pass over him. Its blood much esteemed in pleurisies;
are said, not to be long lived.

The former is the stock from whence the tame species sprung; the horns of
these are smoother and freer from knots, and have a curvature outward toward
their ends. The colors of the tame goats vary; the hair in some is long, and
quite trails on the ground: others are smooth.

In Alpine countries is the substitute of the sheep; its flesh, milk and cheese
the food of the inhabitants: cannot bear excessive cold: loves temperate and
warm climates: is very lively, wanton, active: very libidinous: short lived:
its skin useful in many manufactures: the hair for making wigs: the milk
restorative in consumptive cases: brouzes more than it grazes: destructive to
trees: goes with young four months and a half: generally brings two at a time,
sometimes three, rarely four.

Found only near Angora, Beibazar and Cougna in Asiatic Turkey And according to
Nieuhoff, 232, at Gomron. Perhaps that exquisite hair taken from the breast of
a wild goat of the great Tibet, called Touz, may be of this kind. Vide
Bernier's voy. II. 94.
. Those of the last place brown or black; and the two first of a silky fineness
and silvery whiteness, in curled locks of eight or nine inches in length; the
basis of our fine camblets; the hair imported here in form of thread, for the
Turks will not suffer it to be exported raw, as the spinning gives employ to
multitudes of poor. This variety is confined to a district of two or three days
journey in extent; if they change climate, the hair grows coarser. The
Goat-herds are very attentive to them, perpetually combing and washing them;
are shorter than our goats and their horns less. Whether Strabo meant this
kind? as M. Tournefort conjectures, when he mentions those on the banks of the
Halys; very scarce, says he, in other places. The word Strabo uses is (...),
which signifies roebucks, not goats Lib. xii.

America; but certainly before its discovery by the Spaniards, the goat and
every other domestic animal was unknown there.

G. with slender black upright horns, hooked at the end: behind each a large
orifice in the skin: forehead white: along the cheeks a dusky bar: rest of the
body deep brown: tail short: hoofs long, and much divided.

Inhabits the Alps of Dauphine, Suitzerland, and Italy; the Pyroenean
mountains, Greece, and Crete: does not dwell so high in the hills as the Ibex,
and is found in greater numbers. They feed before sunrise and after sunset:
during winter lodge in hollows of the rocks to avoid the falls of the
Avelenches: during that season eat the slender twigs of trees, or the roots of
plants, or herbs which they find beneath the snow: are very timid and wa^hfull:
each herd has its leader, who keeps centry on some high place while the rest
are at food; and if it sees an enemy, gives a sharp sort of a hiss by way of
signal, when they instantly take to flight. They have a most piercing eye, and
quick ear and scent: are excessively swift and active: are hunted during winter
for their skins, which are very useful in manufactures, and for the flesh,
which is very well tasted. The chase is a laborious employ: they must be got at
by surprise, and are shot with riffl'd-ba^l'd guns: in their stomach is often a
hairy ball covered with a hard crust of an oblong form: are said to be long
lived: bring two, seldom three young at a time.

G. with large horns bending back, close at their base, distant at their
points, with circular rugae. These animals vary in size and color: the skin of
one the British Museum did me the favor of accepting was covered with pale
ferruginous hair: on the sides short. on the top of the neck longer, and a
little erect: along the lower side of the neck, and on the shoulders, the hair
was 14 inches long: beneath the hair was a short wool: on the knees a bare
spot, as if by kneeling to lie down: tail very short: horns 25 inches long, 11
in girth in the thickest place, one foot seven inches distant from point to
point. I think this skin came from one of the isles of the East Indies.

Those of Corsica are less: their color deep brown mixed with rust color, and a
certain hoariness: the hind legs, belly and rump, white: the horns of the
females are much less than those of the males.

Inhabit the north-east parts of Asia; Barbary, Sardinia, Corsica, and Greece:
live amidst the mountains, and run with vast swiftness among the rocks. Those
of Kamtchatka are so strong that ten men can scarce hold one, and the horns are
so large as sometimes to weigh 30 lb. and so capacious that young foxes often
shelter themselves in the hollow of such as by accident fall off in the
deserts: grow to the size of a young stag: propagate in autumn: bring one young
at a time, sometimes two.

Belon very judiciously styles this species the Tragelaphus, from the mixture
it seems to have of the goat and deer. Supposed by M. de Buffon to be the sheep
in a wild state: doubted by myself, since opportunity has been had of seeing
some of these animals from Sardinia and Corsica.

G. with short strait horns covered with hair, and truncated at the end and
tufted with hair: in the forehead a tubercle about two inches high resembling a
third horn: height from the crown of the head to the soles of the fore feet 17
feet: that from the top of the rump to the bottom of the hind feet only nine:
length of the neck seven: from the withers to the loins only six: the fore legs
not longer than the hind legs; but the shoulders of a vast length, which gives
the disproportionate height between the fore and hind parts: horns six inches:
head like that of a stag: neck slender and elegant, and on the upper side is a
short mane: ears large: tail long, with strong hairs at the end: color of the
whole animal a dirty white marked with large broad rusty spots.

Inhabits the forests of Aethiopia and other interior parts of Africa, is very
timid, but not swift: from the strange length of its fore legs, cannot graze
without dividing them to a vast distance; it therefore lives by brouzing the
leaves of trees: kneels like a camel when it would lie down; is a gentle
animal, and is very scarce. I saw the skin of a young one at Leyden well
stuffed, and preserved; otherwise might possibly have entertained doubts in
respect to the existence of so extraordinary a quadruped. Belon's figure very
good.

Known to the Romans in early times; appears among the figures in the
assemblage of eastern animals on the celebrated Praenestine Pavement, made by
the direction of Sylla, represented both grazing and brouzing in its natural
attitudes: exhibited at Rome by the popular Caesar among other animals in the
Circaean games. Finely and justly described by Oppian.

VI. ANTELOPE.
Annulated or twisted horns.

Eight broad cutting teeth in the lower jaw; none in the upper.

Body and limbs of a light and elegant form.

The several species that compose this genus, two or three excepted, inhabit
the hottest part of the globe; or at lest those parts of the temperate zone
that lie so near the tropics as to form a doubtful climate.

None therefore, except the Saiga Found between the Don and Dnieper; and, as I
have heard, even in Transylvania.
, are to be met with in Europe; and, notwithstanding the warmth of South
America, is suited to their nature, yet not a single species has ever been
discovered in any part of the new world. Their proper climates seems therefore
to be those of Asia and Africa, where the species are very numerous.

As there appears a general agreement in the nature of the species that form
this great genus, it will prevent a needless repetition to observe here, that
the ANTELOPES are animals of a most elegant and active make; of a restless and
timid disposition; extremely watchful; of great vivacity; remarkably swift;
remarkably agile; and most of their boundings so light, so elastic, as to
strike the spectator with astonishment. What is very singular, they will stop
in the midst of their course, for a moment gaze at their pursuers, and then
resume their flight Shaw's trav. 244.
.

As the chase of these animals is a favorite diversion with the eastern
nations, from that may be collected proofs of the rapid speed of the ANTELOPE
tribe. The Grehound, the fleetest of dogs, is unequal in the course; and the
sportsman is obliged to call in the aid of the Falcon, trained to the work, to
seize on the animal and impede its motions, to give the dogs opportunity of
overtaking it. In India, and in Persia, a sort of Leopard is made use of in the
chase: this is an animal that takes its prey not by swiftness of foot, but by
the greatness of its springs, by motions similar to that of the ANTELOPE; but
should the Leopard fail in its first essay, the game escapes Bernier's trav.
iv. 45. Voy. de Boullaye le Gouz. 248.
.

The fleetness of this animal was proverbial in the country it inhabited even
in the earliest times: the speed of Asahel Sam. I. ii. v. 18.
is beautifully compared to that of the Shaw's trav. suppl. 74. who informs us,
that this word should have been translated, the Antelope; not the Roe, as the
text has it.
Tzebi; and the Gadites were said to be as swift as the Roes upon the
mountains. The inspired writers took their similies from such objects that were
before the eyes of the people they addressed themselves to. There is another
instance drawn from the same subject: the disciple raised to life at Joppa was
supposed to have been called Tabitha, i. e. Dorcas, or the ANTELOPE, from the
beauty of her eyes; and this is still a common comparison in the East: Aine el
Czazel, or "You have eyes of an ANTELOPE," is the greatest compliment that can
be to paid a fine woman Pr. Alp. hist. Egypt. I. 232.
.

Some species of the ANTELOPES form herds of two or three thousands, while
others keep in small troops of five or six. They generally reside in hilly
countries; though some inhabit plains: they often brouze like the goat, and feed
on the tender shoots of trees, which gives their flesh an excellent flavor.
This is to be understood of those that are taken in the chase; for those that
are fattened in houses are far less delicious. The flesh of some species are
said to taste of musk, which perhaps depends on the qualities of the plants
they feed on.

This preface was thought necessary to point out the difference in nature
between this and the Goat kind, with which most of the systematic writers have
classed this animal: but the ANTELOPE forms an intermediate genus, a link
between the Goat and the Deer. They agree with the first, in the texture of the
horns, which have a core in them: and they never cast them: with the last, in
the elegance of their form, and great swiftness.

their sockets as to move with the lest touch. The male is covered with rough
hair like the he goat, and has a very strong smell. The female is smoother: the
hair on the bottom of the sides and the throat is long, and resembles wool:
that on the sides of the head and neck is hoary: the back and sides of a dirty
white: the breast, belly and inside of the thighs, of a shining white. The
females hornless and timid: if attacked by wolves or dogs, the males place them
in a circle, and stand round them, with their heads toward the enemy, and will
defend them stoutly: bleat like sheep: their common pace a trot: when they go
faster it is by leaps: are swifter than roebucks: feed by lifting up the upper
mandible and going backward. The skin is soft, and excellent for gloves, belts,
etc. Their best season is September: at other times, the skins are penetrated
by worms. The fat resembles that of mutton; in taste, like that of a buck: the
head is reckoned the most delicate part. Found between the Tanais and
Boristhenes, and as far as Astrachan, in flocks of 6 or 10,000; and seem to be
the same with those called by Le Brun Le Brun's Trav. I. 15.
, wild Sheep or Ablavos, which are met with among the Burattes, near lake

resembles the others, except that on the beam of each horn: about four inches
from the base is a branch, round and trifurcated* very different from a
brow-antler. It is the only one of the kind I ever saw; so, probably, is a mere
accident; for neither the many European Elks horns, or the two pair of American
Elk or Moose, I have examined, are furnished with brow-antlers. Those in
question seem to be the very pair which Mr. Dale describes and figures, Ph^.

. The largest I have seen is in the house belonging to the Hudson Bay company,
weighed 56 lb. length 32 inches; between tip and tip, 34; breadth of the palm
13. There is in the same place an excellent picture of an Elk, which was killed
in the presence of Charles XI. of Sueden, and which weighed 1229 lb. It is a
very deformed and seemingly disproportioned beast. A young female of I FEM

about a year old, was to the top of the withers 5 feet high, or 15 hands; the
head alone 2 feet long, length of the whole animal from nose to tail, about 7
feet: the neck much shorter than the head, with a short thick upright mane, of
a light brown color. The eyes small: the ears 1 foot long, very broad and
slouchihg: nostrils very large: the upper lip square, hangs greatly over the
lower, and has a deep sulcus in the middle, so as to appear almost bifid: nose
very broad: under the throat a small excrescence, from whence hung a long tuft
of coarse black hair: the withers very high: fore legs 3 feet 3 inches long:
from the bottom of the hoof to the end of the tibia 2 feet 4 inches: the hind
legs much shorter than the fore legs: hoofs very much cloven: tail very short;
dusky above, white beneath: color of the body in general a hoary black; but
more gray about the face than any where else. This was living last spring at
the marquis of R^ckingham's house, at Parson's-green. It seemed a mild animal;
was uneasy and restless at our pres^nce, and made a plaintive noise. This was
brought from North America, and was called From Musu, which in the Algonkin
language signifies an Elk. Vide Kalm iter. vol. III. 510. Germ. ed. de laet.

the Moose Deer. A male of this species, and the horns of others having been
brought over of late years, prove this, on comparison with the horns of the
European Elk, to be the same animal. But the accounts that Josselyn and Dudly
Josselyn's voy. New England, 88. New Engl. rarities, 19. Phil. Trans. ab^dg
vii. 447.
give of the size of the American Moose has all the appearance of being greatly
exaggerated; the first asserting, that some an^ found 12 feet or 33 hands high,
and the last make it only one foot lower; but Charlevoix, Diervill and
Lescarbot Charlevoix hist. nouvelle France, v. 185. Dierville vo^ L'Acadie 122.
Lescarbot hist. nouv. France 810. The French call it animal, Orignal.
, with greater appearance of probability, make it the size of a horse, or an
Auvergne mule, which is a very large species; and the informations also that I
have received from eye witnesses, make its height from 15 to 17 hands The
writers who speak of the European kind, confine its bulk to that of a horse.
Those who spea^ of the gigantic Moose, say, their horns are six fee^ high;
Josselyn makes the extent from tip to tip t^ be two fathom, and La Hontan Voy.
N. America, I. 57.
from hearsay pretends, that they weigh from 300 to 400 lb.; notwithstanding he
says that the animal which is t^ carry them is no larger than a horse. Thus
these writers vary from each other, and often are no^ consistent with
themselves. It seems then that Jo^selyn and Dudly have been too credulous, and
taken their evidence from huntsmen or Indians, who were fond of the mavelous;
for it does not appear tha^ they had seen it. The only thing certain is, tha^
the Elk is common to both continents; and tha^ the American having larger
forests to range in an^ more luxuriant food, grows to a larger size tha^ the
European. In America they are found, the rarely, in the back parts of New
England; in the peninsula of Nova Scotia, and in Canada; in Europ^ they inhabit
Lapland, Norway, Sueden and Russia; in Asia, the N. E. parts of Tartary and
Siberia; but in each of those continents inhabit only parts, where cold reigns
with the utmost rigor during part of the year.

They live amidst the forests for the convenience of browzing the boughs of
trees, for the great length of their legs and the shortness of their neck
prevents them from grazing with any sort of ease; they often feed on water
plants, which they can readily get at by wading; and M. Sarrasin Martyn's
abridg. mem. and hist. Acad. iv. 253.
says, they are so fond of the Anagyris foetida, or stinking b^^n trefoil, as
to dig for it with their feet, when covered with snow.

They have a singular gait; their pace is a high shambling trot, but they go
with vast swiftness; in old times these animals were made use of in Sueden to
draw sledges; but as they were frequently accessory to the escape of murderers
and other criminals, the use was prohibited under great penalties. In passing
through thick woods, they carry their heads horizontally, to prevent their horns
being entangled in the branches. In their common walk they raise their fore
feet very high; that which I saw stepped over a rail near a yard high with
great ease.

They are very inoffensive animals except when wounded, or in the rutting
season, when they become very furious, and at that time swim from isle to isle,
in pursuit of the females. They strike with both horns and hoofs; are hunted in
Canada during winter when they sink so deep in the snow as to become an easy
prey: the flesh is much commended for being light and nourishing, but the nose
is reckoned the greatest delicacy in all Canada: the tongues are excellent, and
are frequently brought here from Russia: the skin makes excellent buff leather
Numbers of the American Elk skins are sent from hence to Bayonne, where they
are dressed, and sold to the Gallegos, who make buff waistcoats of them.
: Linnaeus says it will turn a musket ball: the hair which is on the neck,
withers and hams, of the full grown Elk, is of great length and very elastic,
is used to make matresses: the hoofs were supposed to have great virtues in
curing epilepsics. It was pretended, that the Elk being subject to that
disease, cured itself by scratching its ear with its hoof.

The Elk was known to the Romans by the name of Alce and Machlis: they believed
that it had no joints in its legs; and, from the great size of the upper lip,
imagined it could not feed without going backward as it grazed.

Before I quit this subject it will be proper to take some notice of the
enormous horns that are so often found fossil in Ireland, and which have always
been attributed to the Moose Deer: I mean the Moose Deer of Josselyn; for no
other animal could possibly be supposed to carry so gigantic a head. These
horns differ very much from those of the European or American Elk; the beam, or
part between the base and the palm, is vastly longer: each is furnished with a
large and palmated brow antler, and the snags on the upper palms are longer.
The measurements of a pair of these horns are as follow: from the insertion to
the tips, 5 feet 5 inches; the brow antlers 11 inches; the broadest part of the
palm, 18; distance between tip and tip, 7 feet 9: but these are small in
comparison of others that have been found in the same kingdom. Mr. Wright, in
his Louthiana, tab. xxii. Book III. gives the figure of one that was eight feet
long, and fourteen between point and point. These horns are frequent in our
Museums, and at gentlemen's houses in Ireland: but the Zoologist is still at a
loss for the recent animal. I have been informed by a gentleman long resident
in Hudson's Bay, that the Indians speak of a beast of the Moose kind Called by
the Indians, Waskesseu.
, but far superior in size to the common one, which they say is found 7 or 800
miles S. W. of York Fort. If such an animal exists, with horns of the
dimensions just mentioned, and of proportionable dimensions in other parts,
there is a chance of seeing Josselyn's account verified: for if our largest
elks of seventeen hands high carry horns of scarce three feet in length, we may
very well allow the animal to be thirty-three hands high which is to support
horns of 3 or 400 lb. weight.

D. with large but slender horns bending forwards, the top palmated, with brow
antlers broad and palmated: horns on both sex; those of the female less, and
with fewer branches. A pair from Greenland was 3 feet 9 inches long, 2 -- 6
from tip to tip; weighed 9 lb. 12 oz. height of a full grown Rein, 4 feet 6;
space round the eyes always black; when it first sheds its coat, the hairs are
of a brownish ash color; after that changes to white; the hairs are very
closely set together; along the fore part of the neck are very long and
pendent: hoofs large: tail short. Inhabits the farthest north of any hoofed
quadruped; in America, Spitzbergen, and Greenland, but not further south than
Canada. In Europe, Samoidea, Lapland, Norway; in Asia, the north coast, as far
as Kamtzchatka, and the inland parts as low as Siberia; found in all these
places in a state of nature; is domesticated only by the Laplanders. Samoides
and Kamtzchatkans; is to the first the substitute of the horse, the cow, the
goat and the sheep; and is their only wealth; the milk of the Rein affords them
cheese; the flesh, food; the skin, clothing; the tendons, bowstrings; and when
split, thread; the horns, glue; the bones, spoons. During the winter it
supplies the want of a horse, and draws their sledges with amazing swiftness
over the frozen lakes and rivers; or over the snow, which at that season covers
the whole country. A rich Laplander is possessed of a herd of a thousand Reins.
In autumn they seek the highest hills to avoid the Lapland Gadfly Oest^ Tarandi
Faun Suec No. 1^31 Flor. Lap 360
, which at that time deposits its eggs in their skin; it is the pest of these
animals, and numbers die that are thus visited. The moment a single fly
appears, the whole herd instantly perceives it, they fling up their heads, toss
about their horns, and at once attempt to fly for shelter amidst the snows on
the loftiest Alps. In summer they feed on several plants; but during winter, on
the rein-liverwort Lic^en rangi^e^inus sp. pl. II. 1620. Fl. Lap. 331.
, which lies far beneath the snow; which they remove with their feet and
palmated brow antlers, in order to get at their beloved food. They live only
sixteen years.

Horns vary in size, and a little in form: one at Mr. John Hunter's, with two
broad four-furcated branches over the brow antlers, bending a little inwards:
the whole was stronger and broader, in proportion to the length, than common,
and of a dul^ deep yellow color.

D. with horns palmated at their ends and pointing a little forward, and
branched on the hinder side; two sharp and slender brow antlers, and above them
two small slender branches. Color of this deer various, reddish, deep brown,
white, spotted. Not so universal as the stag; rare in France and Germany. Found
in Greece, the Holy Land, and the North of China. In great abundance in
England; but, except on a few chases, at present confined in parks. M. de
Buffon says, that the fallow deer of Spain are almost as large as stags. None
originally in America. What are improperly called by that name will be
described hereafter. Are easily tamed: during rutting time, will contest with
each other for their mistress; but are less fierce than the stag: during that
season, will form a hole in the ground, make the female lie down in it, and
then often walk round and smell at her. Moore speaks of a species found on the
banks of the Gambia, in the interior parts of Africa, near Barracunda, called
Toncong, which he says differed not in form from the English fallow deer; only
that its size was equal to that of a small horse, and weighed 300 lb. it had
also on its neck an erect black mane four or five inches long Travels up the
Gambia, 205.

Scots, or 314 lb. horns of the American stags sometimes weigh 30 lb. and are
above four feet high.

Common to Europe, Barbary, North of Asia and North America. Lives in herds:
one male generally supreme in each herd. Furious and dangerous in rutting time.
Seeks the female with a violent braying. Rutting season in August. Begins to
shed its horns the latter end of February, or beginning of March: recovers them
entirely by July. Fond of the sound of the pipe; will stand and listen
attentively. The account of the Cervina Senectus Juvenal Sat. xiv. 251. Pliny
lib. viii. c. 33. Speaks of some that were taken about 100 years before his
time, with golden collars on their necks, which had been put on them by

, or vast longevity of the Stag, fabulous. Hinds go with young above eight
months, bring one at a time, seldom two: secure the young from the stag, who
would destroy it. Flesh of these animals coarse and rank: skin useful for many
purposes: from the horns is extracted the celebrated spirit of hartshorn; but
the horns of all other deer yield the same salt. The Hippelaphus Aristot. Hist.

of the ancients, only a large race of stags, with longer hair on the neck,
giving it the appearance of a mane. This is distinguished by the French with

same variety may be also brought the Tragelaphus; so called from being more
hairy than common Gesner quad. 296.

one of the common size, the other 14 hands high, and are called there Elks.

of a light color, a cinereous brown: tail longer than that of the English Buck:
a quite distinct species, and peculiar to America. Are found in vast herds.
Those near the shores are lean and bad, and subject to worms in their heads and
throats. Are very restless; always in motion: not fierce: their flesh dry; but
of the utmost importance to the Indians, who dry it for their winter provision.
The skins a great article of commerce, vast numbers annually imported from our
colonies. Feed during hard winters on the moss which hangs in long strings from

In the British Museum is a pair of large horns, of the same shape with the
former, and, like them, trifurcated; are very thick strong, and rugged; of a
whitish color; two feet nine inches long; two feet four inches between tip and
tip. There is not in any of the catalogues the lest hint of the place they come
from; or any history relating to them. From their general appearance, seem to

feet two inches; and about two inches higher behind: length of the tail eight
inches: body thick and clumsy: legs fine and slender: color on the upper part
of the neck, body and sides, brown; belly and rump, of a lighter color.

In possession of Lord Clive, brought from some part of India; called, from the
thickness of their body, Hog Deer.

notwithstanding it is mentioned by Charlevoix: unnoticed by Lawson and Catesby.
Frequent in the highlands of Scotland, but in no other part of Great Britain.

Fond of mountainous wooded countries, brouzes very much, and during winter

between point and point; trifurcated in the upper part; one erect snag about
two inches above the base: by accident subject to vary in the number of
branches: head large: neck thick: eyes large, and bright: about the size of the
European Roe: color of the hair reddish; when young, spotted with white.

Inhabits Mexico, Guiana, and Brasil; not only the internal parts of the
country, but even the borders of the plantations: the flesh inferior to that of
European venison. A species very distinct from the Roe of the old continent. An
accurate account of the hoofed quadrupeds, of the new continent, among the

horns of the Indian Roebuck: they are sixteen inches long, and the same
between tip and tip; are very thick, strong and rugged; near the base of each
is an upright forked branch; the ends bend forward, divide into two branches,
each furnished with numerous snags.

bright red color; but the penis so hid as scarce to be discovered.

Female less than the male: nose sharper: wants the two tusks, and has two
small teats.

Inhabits the kingdom of Tibet, the province of Mohang Meng in China, Tonquin,
and Bontan; about the lake Baikal, and near the rivers Jenesea, and Argun.
Found from Lat. 60 to 44 or 45; but never wanders so far south, except when
forced through hunger by great falls or snow, when they migrate south to feed on
corn and new-grown rice. Inhabit naturally the mountains that are covered with
pines: love solitude: avoid mankind. If pursued seek the highest summits,
inaccessible to m^n or dogs.

That noted drug the musk is produced from the male. It is found in a bag or
tumor of the size of a hen's egg on the belly of that sex only. It is furnished
with two small orifices; the largest is oblong, the other round; the one is
naked, the other covered with long hairs. The musk is contained in this, for
Mr. Gmelin tells us, that on squeezing the tumor, the musk was forced through the
apertures in form of a fat brown matter. The hunters cut of^ the bag and tie it
up for sale; but are very apt to adulterate the contents, by mixing other
matter with it to increase the weight. These animals must be found in great
plenty, for Tavernier says, that he bought in one journey 7673 musk bags. The
musk of Tibet is far superior to that of other places, and of course much
dearer. The flesh of the males is much infected with this drug, but is eaten by
the Russians and Tartars. It is strongest in rutting time.

Inhabits Guiana and Brasil; are excessively timid, and most remarkably active,
and swift; like goats they can stand with all their four legs placed together
on the point of a rock. They are frequently seen swimming the rivers, and at
that time are easily taken. The Indians hunt them, and their flesh is esteemed
very delicate. The French of Guiana call them Biches or Does, because
notwithstanding their likeness to deer, both sexes are without horns* M. de
Buffon accuses Seba of an error, in placing this animal in Surinam; but the
last is vindicated by several authorities, who have had ocular proof of its
existence in Guiana, etc.

about the neck, under the throat, and about the bunch: color of that on the
protuberance dusky: on the other parts a reddish ash color: tail long: the hair
on the middle soft: on the sides coarse, black and long: hoofs small: feet
flat, divided above, but not through: the bottom excessively tough yet pliant:
has six callosities on the legs, one on each knee, one on the inside of each
foreleg, on the upper joint; one on the inside of the hind leg, at the bottom
of the thigh, another on the lower part of the breast, the places that the
animal rests on when it lies down.

The riches of Arabia, from the time of Job to the present, the patriarch
reckoned 6000 camels among his pastoral treasures; the moderns estimate their
wealth by the numbers of these useful animals; without them great part of Asia
and Africa would be wretched; by them the sole commerce is carried through arid
and burning tracts, impassible but by beasts which providence formed expressly
for the scorched deserts. Their soles are adapted to the sands they are to pass
over, their toughness and spungy softness preventing them from cracking. Their
great powers of sustaining abstinence from drinking, enables them to pass over
unwatered tracts for seven or eight days without requiring the lest liquid; Leo
Africanus says for fifteen. They can discover water by their scent at half a
league's distance, and after a long abstinence will hasten toward it, long
before their drivers perceive where it lies.

Their patience under hunger is such, that they will travel many days fed only
with a few dates, or some small balls of bean or barley-meal; or on the
miserable thorny plants they meet with in the deserts.

The largest kind will carry a load of 1000 or 1200lb. weight. They kneel down
to be loaded; but rise the moment they find the burden equal to their
strength: they will not permit an ounce more to be put on: are most mild and
gentle, at all times, but when they are in heat: during that period, are seized
with a sort of madness, that it is unsafe to approach them: are not prevailed
on to quicken their pace by blows; but go freely if gent^y treated, and seem
enlivened by the pipe, or any music. In winter they are covered with long
hair, which falls off in the spring, and is carefully gathered, being wove into
stuffs, and also cloths to cover tents. In summer their hair is short. Before
the great heats the owners smear their bodies, to keep off the flies. The Arabs
are very fond of the flesh Athenaeus relates, that the Persian monarchs had
whole came served up to their table. Lib. iv. p. 130. as the Romans had was

of young camels. The milk of these animals is their principal subsistence; and
the dung of camels is the fuel used by the Caravans in the travels over the
deserts.

There are varieties among the camels. The Turkman is the largest and
strongest. The Arabian is hardy. What is called the Dromedary, Maihary, and
Raguahl, is very swift. The common sort travel about 30 miles a day. The last,
which has a less bunch, and more delicate shape, and also much inferior in
size, never carries burdens; but is used to ride on. In Arabia, they are
trained for running matches: and in many places, for carrying couriers, who can
go above 100 miles a day, on them; and that for nine days together, Leo Afr.

over burning deserts unhabitable by any living creature. The Chinese call
these swift camels, expressively, Fo^g Kyo to, or camels with feet of the wind.
The African camels are the most hardy, having more distant and more dreadful
deserts to pass over than any of the others, from Numidia to the kingdom of
Aethiopia. She Chin, a Chinese physician, says, tha^ camels are found wild N.

; white, gray and russet, disposed in spots. According to Hernandez, yellowish,
with a black line from the head along the top of the back to the tail, and
belly white. The spotted may possibly be the tame; the last, the wild Llamas.
The tail short: the height from four to four feet and a half: length, from the
neck to the tail, six feet. The carcass, divested of skin and offals, according
to the editor of Mr. Biron's voyage, weighed 200lb. in general the shape
exactly resembles a camel, only it wanted the dorsal bunch.

It is the camel of Peru and Chili; and before the arrival of the Spaniards,
was the only beast of burden known to the Indians. It is as mild, as gentle,
and as tractable. We find, that before the introduction of mules Ovalle 44.
, they were used by the Indians to plow the land; that at present they serve to
carry burdens of about 100lb. that they go with great gravity, and, like their
Spanish masters, nothing can prevale on them to change their pace. They lie
down to be laden; and when wearied, no blows can provoke them to go on.
Feuillee says, they are so capricious, that if struck, they instantly squat
down, and nothing but caresses can induce them to rise. When angry, have no
other method of revenging injuries than by spitting, and they can ejaculate
their saliva to the distance of ten paces; if it falls on the skin, it raises
an itching and a reddish spot. Their flesh is eaten, and said to be as good as
mutton. The wool has a strong disagreeable scent. They are very sure-footed;
therefore used to carry the Peruvian ores over the ruggedest hills and
narrowest paths of the Andes. They inhabit that vast chain of mountains, their
whole length, to the straits of Magellan; but, except where those hills
approach the sea, as in Patagonia, never appear on the coasts. Like the camel,
they have powers of abstaining long from drink, sometimes for four or five
days: like that animal's, their food is coarse and trifling.

As every domestic animal has, or had its stock or origin in a wild state, we
believe the Llama and the Guanaco to be the same. The Llama is described as the
largest of the two domestic animals the Peruvians have; for, except that, they
knew no other than the congenerous Pacos. We find two animals similar to these,
wild; the larger, or Guanico, may be supposed to be a savage Llama; the lesser,
or Vicunna, to be the Pacos in a state of nature: the brief descriptions we
have left us of each, give us little room to doubt but that the difference of
color and hair arises only from culture.

In a wild state they keep in great herds in the highest and steepest parts of
the hills; and while they are feeding, one keeps centry on the pinnacle of some
rock: if it perceives the approach of any one, it neighs; the herd takes the
alarm, and goes off with incredible speed. They outrun all dogs; so there is
no other way of killing them but with a gun. They are killed for the sake of
their flesh and their hair; for the Indians weave the last into cloth De Laet,
329.
. From the form of the parts of generation, in both sexes, no animal copulates
with such difficulty: it is often the labor of a day, Antequam actum ipsum

Are of the same nature with the preceding: ininhabit the same places, but are
more capable of supporting the rigor of frost and snow: they live in vast
herds; are very timid, and excessively swift: sometimes the Guanacoes associate
with them. The Indians take the Pacos in a strange manner: they tie cords with
bits of wool or cloth hanging to them, above 3 or 4 feet from the ground, cross
the narrow passes of the mountains, then drive those animals toward them,
which are so terrified by the flutter of the rags as not to dare to pass, but
huddling together, give the hunters opportunity to kill with their slings as
many as they please. The tame ones will carry Brewer 's voy. chile in

was young, and probably had not its full number of teeth; I imagine so, as the
head of a boar from Cape Verd, described by M. de Buffon; and jaws of another
preserved in the Ashmolean Museum, at Oxford, evidently of the same species
with this, had in the upper jaw two cutting teeth; and in the lower six; and in
each were six grinders, the farthest of them very large.

H. with four cutting teeth above, six below; tw^ tusks in each jaw; those in
the upper jaw pointin^ down, and little apparent when the mouth is short the
others hid: length from nose to the end of the rump about three feet: head not
so taper as in common swine: ears short and erect: body covere^ with bristles,
stronger than those of the Europea^ kind, and more like those of a hedgehog;
they ar^ dusky, surrounded with rings of white; those o^ the top of the neck
and back are near five inche^ long, grow shorter on the sides; the belly almos^
naked: from the shoulders to the breast is a band o^ white: no tail: on the
lower part of the back is ^ gland, open at the top, discharging a foetid
ichorous liquor; this has been mistakenly called a navel.

Inhabits the hottest parts of S. America, and some of the Antilles: lives in
the forests on the mountains: not fond of mire or marshy places less ^at than
the common hog: goes in great droves: are very fierce: will fight stoutly with
the beasts of prey: the Jaguar, or American leopard is its mortal enemy; often
the body of that animal is found with several of these hogs slain in combat.
Dogs will scarce attack it: if wounded will turn on the hunter. Feeds on fruits
and roots, on toads, and all manner of serpents, and holding them with the
fore-feet, skins them with great dexterity. Is reckoned very good food; but all
writers agree that the dorsal gland must be cut out as soon as the animal is
killed, or the flesh will become so infected as not to be eatable. The Indian
name of this species is Paquiras Gumilla.
, from whence seems to be derived that of Pecary.

H. with four cutting teeth in the upper, six in the lower jaw; ten grinders to
each jaw; in the lower jaw two tusks pointing toward the eyes, and standing
near eight inches out of their sockets; from two sockets on the outside of the
upper jaw, two other teeth, twelve inches long, bending like horns, their ends
almost touching the forehead: ears small, erect, sharp pointed: along the back
are some weak bristles: on the rest of the body only a sort of wool, such as is
on lambs: the tail long, ends in a tuft, and is often twisted: the body plump
and square; not of the elegant form that Bontius and Nieuhoff give it; as
appears by an original drawing Mr. Loten favored me with.

Inhabits Buero, a small isle near Amboina: it is also found in Celebes, but
neither on the continent of Asia, or Africa; what M. de Buffon takes for it, is
the Ethiopian boar. Is sometimes kept tame in the Indian isles: live in herds:
have a very quick scent: live on herbs and leaves of trees; never ravage
gardens like other swine: their flesh well-tasted: when pursued and driven to
extremities, rush into the sea, swim very well, and even dive, and pass thus
from isle to isle: in the forests often rest their head, by hooking their upper
tusks on some bough The natural history of this animal is taken from Valentin's
hist. of the East Indies, from a translation Mr. Loten was so obliging to
communicate to me.

Rh. with a single horn, placed near the end of the nose, sometimes three feet
and a half long, black, and smooth: the upper lip long, hangs over the lower,
ends in a point, is very pliable, and serves to collect its food, and deliver
it into the mouth: the nostrils placed transversely: the ears large, erect,
pointed: eyes small and dull: the skin naked, rough, or tuberculated, lying
about the neck in vast folds; there is another fold from the shoulders to the
forelegs; another from the hind part of the back to the thighs: the skin so
thick and so strong as to turn the edge of a scymeter, and resist a musket
ball: slender, flatted at the end, covered on the sides with very stiff thick
black hairs: the belly hangs low: the legs short, strong and thick: the hoofs
divided into three parts, each pointing forward.

Those which have been brought to Europe have been young and small: Bontius
says, that in respect to bulk of body, they equal the elephant, but are lower
on account of the shortness of the legs.

Inhabits Bengal, Siam, Cochin-China, Quangsi in China, the isles of Java, and
Sumatra, Congo, Angola, Aethiopia, and the country as low as the Cape* loves
shady forests, the neighborhood of rivers, and marshy places: fond of
wallowing in mire like the hog; is said by that means to give shelter in the
folds of its skin to scorpions, centipes, and other insects. Is a solitary
animal: brings one young at a time, very sollicitous about it: quiet and
inoffensive; but provoked, furious: very swift, and very dangerous: I knew a
gentleman who had his belly ripped up by one, but survived the wound. Is dull
of sight; but has a most exquisite scent: feeds on vegetables, particularly
shrubs, broom, and thistles: grunts like a hog: is said to consort with the
tiger; a fable, founded on their common attachment to the sides of rivers, and
on that account are sometimes found near each other. Are said when it has flung
down a man, to lick the flesh quite from the bone with its rough tongue; this
very doubtful; that which wounded the gentleman retired instantly after the
stroke.

Its flesh is eaten; Kolben says it is very good: the skin, the flesh, hoofs,
teeth, and very dung, used in India medicinally; the horn is in great repute as
an antidote against poison It was not every horn that had this virtue: some
were held very cheap, while others take a vast price.
, especially that of a virgin Abbada; cups are made of them. Found sometimes
with Hamilton, in his voyage to the East Indies, I. 8. says, that he saw
brought from Natal, in Africa, three horns growing from one (...): the longest
18, the next 12, and the third 8 inches long.
double horns: Martial alludes to a variety of this kind by his Ursus cornu
gemino.

Is the unicorn of HOLY WRIT, and of the ancients; the Oryx and Indian ass of
Aristotle Hist. An. lib. II. c. 1.
, who says it has but one horn; his informers might well compare the clumsy
shape of the Rhinoceros to that of an ass, so that the philosopher might easily
be induced to pronounce it a whole footed animal. This was also the bos
unicornis and fera monoceros of Pliny Lib. viii. c. 21.
; both were of India, the same country with this animal; and in his account of
the monoceros, he exactly describes the great black horn and the hog-like tail.
The unicorn of HOLY WRIT has all the properties of the Rhinoceros, rage,
untameableness, great swiftness, and great strength.

It was known to the Romans in very early times: its figure is among the
animals of the Praenestine pavement. Augustus introduced one into the shows
Dion. Cassius, lib. 51.
, on his triumph over Cleopatra; and there is extant a coin of Domitian, with a
double-horned Rhinoceros on it P^. Tr. xi. 913.

H. with four cutting teeth in each jaw; those in the lower jaw strait and
pointing forward, the two middlemost the longest: four tusks; those in the
upper jaw short; in the lower, very long and truncated obliquely: head of an
enormous size: its mouth vastly wide: the ears small and pointed, lined within
very thickly with short fine hairs: the eyes and nostrils small, in proportion
to the bulk of the animal: on the lips are some strong hairs scattered in
patches here and there: the hair on the body is very thin, of a whitish color,
and scarce discernible at first sight: there is no mane on the neck, as some
writers feign; only the hairs on that part are rather thicker: the skin is very
thick and strong, and of a dusky color: the tail is about a foot long, taper,
compressed and naked: the hoofs are divided into four parts: but
notwithstanding it is an amphibious animal, are unconnected by membranes: the
legs short and thick.

In bulk, it is second only to the Elephant: the length of a male has been
found to be seventeen feet; the circumference of its body fifteen; its height
near seven; the legs near three; the head above three and a half; its girth
near nine. Hasselquist says, its hide is a load for a Camel.

Inhabits the rivers of Africa, from the Niger to the Cape of Good Hope. Found
in none of the African rivers which run into the Mediterranean, except the
Nile, and even there only in the upper Egypt Dr. Shaw says, that the present
race of Egyptians are not even acquainted with this animal; none ever
appearing below the cataracts of the Nile. It was not so formerly; for Radzivil
relates, that he saw and shot at four near Damietta. Hasselquist confirms the
account of our countryman.
, and in the fens and lakes of Aethiopia, which that river passes through: is a
mild and gentle animal, unless it be provoked: inhabits equally the land and
the water: during night, leaves the rivers to graze, and does great damage to
the sugar canes and plantations of rice and millet: it also feeds on the roots
of trees, which it loosens with its great teeth; and will prey on small fish:
it is a clumsy animal on the land, walks slowly; but when pursued, takes to the
water, plunges in and sinks to the bottom, and is seen walking there at full
ease: it often rises to the surface, and remains with its head out of water,
frequently making a bellowing noise that may be heard at a vast distance: if
wounded, will rise and attack boats or canoes with great fury, and often sink
them by biting large pieces out of the sides, and frequently people are drowned
by them; for they are as bold in the water, as they are timid on land: are most
numerous high up the rivers; very rarely found near their mouths: sleep on
shoals of sand in the midst of the stream.

They are capable of being tamed. Belon says, he has seen one so gentle, as to
be let loose out of a stable, and fed by its keeper, without attempting to
injure any one. They are generally taken in pit falls, and the poor people eat
the flesh. In some parts, the natives place boards, full of sharp irons, in the
corn grounds; which these beasts strike into their feet, so become an easy
prey. Sometimes they are struck in the water with harpoons fastened to cords;
and ten or twelve canoes are employed in the chase Purchas's Pilgr. II. 1544.
Hasselquist gives a strange account of another method of taking them. The
natives lay a great heap of peace in the places the Hippopotame frequents: it
eats greedily; then growing thirsty, drinks immoderately; the peace in its belly
swell, the animal bursts, and is found dead. p. 188. Engl. Ed.
. The teeth are most remarkably hard, even harder than ivory, and much less
liable to grow yellow. Des Marchais II. 149.
says, that the dentists prefer them for the making of false teeth. The skin,
when dried, is used to make bucklers, and is of an impenetrable hardness.

A herd of females has but a single male: they bring one young at a time, and
that on the land, but suckle it in the water. Among other errors related of
them, that of their enmity with the Crocodile, an eyewitness declaring he had
seen them swimming together without any disagreement Purchas's Pilgr. II. 1544,
1568.
.

Is the Behemoth of Job: known to the Romans: Scaurus treated the people with
the sight of five Crocodiles and one Hippopotame Plinii lib. viii. c. 26.
, during his adileship; and exhibited them in a temporary lake. Augustus
produced one at his triumph over Cleopatra Di^n. Cassius, lib. 51.
. An ancient writer asserts, that Vide Gesner Pisc. 419.
these animals were found in the Indus; which is not confirmed by any modern
traveller.

T. with the nose extended far beyond the lower jaw; slender, and forming a
sort of proboscis; capable of being contracted or extended at pleasure; the
sides sulcated; the extremities of both jaws ending in a point; ten cutting
teeth in each; between them and the grinders, a vacant space: in each jaw ten
grinders: ears erect: eyes small: body formed like that of a hog: the back
arched: legs short: hoofs small, black and hollow: tail very small: grows to
the size of a heifer half a year old: the hair is short: when young, spotted
with white; when old, of a dusky color.

Inhabits the woods and rivers of the eastern side of South America, from the
Isthmus of Darien to the river of Amazons: sleeps, during day, in the darkest
and thickest forests adjacent to the banks: goes out in the nightime in
search of food: lives on grass, sugarcanes, and on fruits: if disturbed, takes
to the water; swims very well; or sinks below, and, like the Hippopotame, walks
on the bottom as on dry ground. The Indians shoot it with poisoned arrows: they
cut the skin into bucklers, and eat the flesh, which is said to be very good:
is a salacious, slow-footed, and sluggish animal: makes a sort of hissing
noise. Gumilla says, it will make a vigorous resistance if attacked, and scarce
fails slaying the dogs which it can lay hold of.

Dampier and Bancroft give very faulty descriptions of this beast, imagining it
to be the same with the Hippopotame.

Inhabits the same countries with the preceding: lives in the fenny parts not
remote from the banks of great rivers: runs slowly: swims and dives remarkably
well, and keeps for a long time under water: feeds on fruits and vegetables: is
very dexterous in catching fish, which it brings on shore and eats at its ease:
it sits up, and holds its prey with its fore feet, feeding like an ape: feeds
in the night, and commits great ravages in gardens: keeps in large herds, and
makes a horrible noise like the braying of an ass: grows very fat: the flesh is
eaten, is tender, but has an oily and fishy taste: is easily made tame Muratori

are seven feet long, and weigh 152 lb. each: the eyes small: ears long, broad
and pendulous: back much arched: legs thick and very clumsy and shapeless: feet
undivided; but the margins terminated by five round hoofs: tail like that of a
hog: color of the skin dusky, with a few scattered hairs on it.

The largest of land animals: there are certain accounts of their attaining the
height of twelve feet; others are said to have been three feet higher

Inhabits India and some of its greater islands Cochin-China, and some of the
provinces of China; abounds in the southern parts of Africa from the river
Senegal to the Cape, and from thence as high as Aethiopia on the other side:
found in greatest numbers in the interior parts, where there are vast forests,
near the sides of rivers: are fond of marshy places, and love to wallow in the
mire like a hog: swim very well: feed on the leaves and branches of trees: do
great damage to the fields of corn, and to plantations of Coco Palms, tearing
up the trees by the roots to get at their tops.

Often sleep standing; are not incapable of lying down as is vulgarly believed:
are very mild and harmless, except wounded, or during the rutting time, when
they are seized with a temporary madness: are said to go one year with young,
bring one at a time: live 120 or 130 years Tavernier's voy. part II. 96.
; are 30 years before they arrive at their full growth. Drink by means of their
trunk, sucking water up it, and then conveying it into the mouth; are very
careful of the trunk, conscious that their existence depends on it; is to them
as a hand; is their organ of feeling and of smell, both which senses it has in
the most exquisite degree: notwithstanding its bulk is exceedingly swift: its
strength matchless; the tame elephants carry small pieces of artillery, small
towers, with numbers of people in them, and also vast loads: is not at present
domesticated in Africa, only in the more civilized continent of Asia; they are
much more numerous in Africa, in some parts swarm, so that the negroes are
obliged to make their habitations under ground for fear of them. Are killed and
eaten by the natives; the trunk said to be a delicious morsel: caught in
pit-falls, covered with branches of trees; sometimes chaced and killed with
lances, are instantly killed by a slight wound in the head, behind the ears.
All the teeth are brought from Africa; frequently picked up in the woods;
uncertain whether shed teeth, or from dead animals: the African teeth Delion's
voy. 74.
which come from Mosambique are 10 feet long; those of Malabar only 3 or 4; the
largest in Asia are those of Cochin-China, which even exceed the elephants of
Mosambique ^orri, 795.
. The skin is thick, and when dressed, proof against a musket ball: the flesh,
the gall, the skin. The bones, according to Shi Chin, are used in medicine Du

Is, notwithstanding the great dullness of its eye and stupidity of its
appearance, the most docil and most intelligent of animals: tractable and most
obedient to its master's will: sensible of benefits, resentful of injuries:
directed by a slight rod of iron hooked at one end: are in many parts of India
the executioners of justice; will with their trunks break every limb of the
criminal, or trample him to death, or transfix him with their tusks, according
as they are directed: are so modest as never to permit any one to see them
copulate: have a quick sense of glory. In India, they were once employed in the
launching of ships: one was directed to force a very large vessel into the
water; the work proved superior to his strength: his master, with a sarcastic
tone, bid the keeper take away this lazy beast and bring another: the poor
animal instantly repeated his efforts, fractured his scull, and died on the
spot Ludolph. Com. in hist. Aethiop. 147.
. In Delli, an Elephant passing along the streets, put his trunk into a
taylor's shop, where several people were at work; one of them pricked the end
with his needle: the beast passed on, but in the next dirty puddle filled his
trunk with water, returned to the shop, and spurting every drop among the
people who had offended him, spoilt their work.

An Elephant in Adsmeer, which often passed through the Bazar or Market, as he
went by a certain herb-woman, always received from her a mouthfull of greens:
at length he was seized with one of his periodical fits of rage, broke his
fetters, and running through the market, put the crowd to flight; among others,
this woman, who in haste, forgot a little child she had brought with her. The
animal recollecting the spot where his benefactress was wont to sit, took up
the infant gently in his trunk and placed it in safety on a stall before a
neighboring house.

Another, in his madness, killed his Cornac or Governor: the wife seeing the
misfortune, took her two children and flung them before the Elephant, saying,
Now you have destroyed their father, you may as well put an end to their lives
and mine. It instantly stopped, relented, took the greatest of the children,
placed him on its neck, adopted him for its Cornac, and never afterward would
permit any body else to mount it.

At the Cape of Good-Hope, it is customary to kill those animals, for the sake
of their teeth, by the chase. Three horsemen, well-mounted and armed with
lances, attack the Elephant alternately, each relieving the other as they see
their companion pressed, till the beast is subdued. Three Dutchmen (brothers)
who had made large fortunes by this business, determined to retire to Europe,
and enjoy the fruits of their labors; but resolved, before they went, to have a
last chase by way of amusement: they met with their game, and began the attack
in the usual manner; but unfortunately one of their horses fell down and flung
its rider: the enraged animal instantly seized the unhappy man with its trunk,
flung him up to a vast height in the air, and received him on one of its tusks;
then turning toward the two other brethren, as if it were with an aspect of
revenge and insult, held out to them the impaled wretch wreathing on the bloody
tooth V^age de la Caille, 160.
.

The Indians have from very early times employed the elephant in their wars:
Porus opposed the passage of Alexander, over the Hydaspes Q^^ut Curtius, lib.
viii. c. 42.
, with eighty-five of these animals; M. de Buffon very justly imagines that it
was some of the elephants taken by that monarch, and afterward transported
into Greece, which were employed by Pyrrhus against the Romans. From the time
of Solomon, ivory has been used in ornamental works; it was one of the imports
of his navy of Tharshish, whose lading was gold and silver, ivory, apes, and
peacocks Kings I. 10.
.

The teeth of this animal is often found in a fossil state; some years ago two
great grinding teeth, and part of the tusk of an elephant were given me by some
miners, who discovered them at the depth of 42 yards in a lead-mine in
Flintshire; one of the strata above them was limestone, about 8 yards thick;
the teeth were found in a bed of gravel in the same mine; the grinders were
almost as perfect as if just taken from the animal; the tusk much decayed,
soft, and exfoliating.

The grinders and tusks of the Mammouth, so often found fossil in Siberia, must
be referred to this animal, as is evident from the account and figures of those
in the Ph. Tr. abridg. ix. 87. by Mr. Breynius Who has given very accurate
figures of the entire head, the molares, the tusk and the thigh bone.
. The Molares differ not in the lest from those recent; but the tusk has a
curvature far greater than those of any elephant I have seen; whether this was
accidental or preternatural, cannot be determined from a single specimen;
Strablenberg says they are somewhat more crooked Hist. Russia, 402. Also Bell's
Travels, II. 165. Le Brun's Travels, I. 63.
than elephants teeth commonly are; and others relate that a pair weighed
400lb. which exceeds the weight of the largest recent tusks: there are also
found with them fossil grinders of 24lb. weight; but since, in all other
respects, those grinders resemble those of the living elephants; and one being
found lodged in the skeleton of the same head with the tusks, we cannot deny
our assent to the opinion of those who think them to have been once the parts
of the animal we have just described.

These are found lodged in the sandy banks of the Siberian rivers; sometimes
entire skeletons are found: the tusks are made use of as ivory, formed into
combs, and used to inlay cabinets. The Tartars have many wild notions about the
Mammouth, such as its being a subterraneous animal, etc. etc. Linnaeus Syst.
Not. 49.
says it is the skeleton of the Walrus flung on shore.

63. AMERICAN.
An animal only known in a fossil state, and that but partially; from the
teeth, some of the jaw-bones, the thigh bones and vertebrae, found with many
others five or six feet beneath the surface, on the banks of the Ohio, not
remote from the river Miame, seven hundred miles from the sea coast.

Some of the tusks near seven feet long, one foot nine inches in circumference
at the base, and one foot near the point; the cavity at the root or base
nineteen inches deep: the tusks of the true elephant have sometimes a very
slight lateral bend, these have a larger twist or spiral curve toward the
smaller end; but the great and specific difference consists in the shape of the
molares or grinders, which are made like those of a carnivorous animal, not
flat and ribbed transversely on their surface life those of the recent
elephant, but furnished with a double row of high and conic processes, as if
intended to masticate, not to grind their food.

A third difference is in the thigh bone: which is of a great disproportionable
thickness to that of the elephant, and has also some anatomical variations.

The tusks have been cut and polished by the workers in ivory, who affirmed,
that in texture and appearance they differed not from the true ivory: the
molares were indurated to a great degree. Specimens of these teeth and bones
are deposited in the British Museum, that of the Royal Society, and in the
cabinet of Doctor Hunter Who has obliged the world with an ingenious essay on
the subject, vide Ph. Tr. Vol. LVIII. 34. The late worthy (...) Collinson, in
the preceding volume, gave us other notices of those bones.
. I should have been less accurate in this description, had not that gentleman
favored me with his observations on some particulars, which otherwise might
have escaped my notice.

These fossil bones are also found in Peru, and in the Brazils: as yet the
living animal has evaded our search; it is more than probable that it yet
exists in some of those remote parts of the vast new continent, unpenetrated
yet by Europeans. Providence maintains and continues every created species; and
we have as much assurance, that no race of animals will any more cease while
the Earth remains, than seed time, and harvest, cold and heat, summer and
winter, day or night.

To this may properly be added a very obscure animal, mentioned by Nieuhoff
Nieuhoff's voy. in Churchill's coll. II. 360.
, and called by the Chinese of Java, Sukotyro. It is of the size of a large ox:
has a snout like a hog: two long rough ears; and a thick bushy tail: the eyes
placed upright in the head, quite different from other beasts: on the side of
the head, next to the eyes, stand two long horns, or rather teeth, not quite so
thick as those of an elephant. It feeds on herbage, and is but seldom taken.

resemblance of their actions, resulting from the structure of their parts only,
not from any superior sagacity to that of most others of the brute creation.
.
XV. APE.
Four cutting teeth in each jaw, and two canine. Each of the feet formed like
hands, generally with flat nails, and, except in one instance, have fou^
fingers and a thumb.

Eyebrows above and below.

A most numerous race; almost confined to the torrid zone: fills the woods of
Africa, from Senega to the Cape, and from thence to Aethiopia: a single species
is found beyond that line, in the province of Barbary: found in all parts of
India, and its islands; in Cochin-China, in the S. of China, and in Japan; and
one kind is met with in Arabia: they swarm in the forests of S. America, from
the isthmus of Darien, as far as Paraguay.

Are lively, agile, full of frolic, chatter and grimace: from the structure of
their members, have many actions in common with the human kind: most of them
are fierce and untameable; some are of a milder nature, and will show a degree
of attachment; but in general are endowed with mischievous intellects: are
filthy, obscene, lascivious, thieving: feed on fruits, leaves and insects:
inhabit woods, and live in trees: in general are gregarious, going in vast
companies: the different species never mix with each other, always keep apart
and in different quarters: leap with vast activity from tree to tree, even when
loaded with their young, which cling to them. Are the prey of leopards, and
others of the feline race; of serpents, which pursue them to the summit of the
trees, and swallow them entire. Are not carnivorous, but for mischiefs sake
will rob the nests of birds of the eggs and young: in the countries where apes
most abound, the sagacity of the feathered tribe is more marvellously shown in
their contrivances to fix their nest beyond the reach of these invaders Indian
Zoology p. 7. tab. viii.
.

Apes and parrots (the apes of birds) are more numerous in their species than
any other animals; their numbers and their different appearances made it
necessary to methodize and subdivide the genus; accordingly Mr. Ray first
distributed them into three classes: Simiae, APES, such as wanted tails.
Cercopitheci, MONKIES, such as had tails. And from the last he formed another
division, viz. Papiones, BABOONS, those with short tails: to distinguish them
from the common monkies, which have very long ones.


From this Linnaeus formed his method; M. de Buffon followed the same; but
makes a very judicious subdivision of the long-tailed apes, or the true
monkies, into such which had prehensile tails Animals with this kind of tail
can lay hold of any thing with it, for it serves all the uses of a hand; they
can twist it round the branch of a tree, and suspend themselves by it, or keep
them secure in their seat, while their feet are otherwise employed. This
faculty is common to some Monkies, to Macaucos and one species of Porcupine.
Vide plates of yellow Macauco, and Brasilian Porcupine.
, and such which had not. I shall endeavor in this genus no other reform in
the system of our countryman, than what that gentleman has made; in respect to
the trivial names of the species, I have in general invented such as I supposed
congruous, or in a few instances retained those of M. de Buffon.

fore-parts: face and paws swarthy: buttocks covered with hair.

Inhabits the interior parts of Africa, the isles of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.
Are solitary, and live in the most desert places: grow to the height of six
feet: has prodigious strength, will overpower the strongest man. The old ones
are shot with arrows; only the young can be taken alive: live entirely on
fruits and nuts: will attack and kill the negroes who wander in the woods: will
drive away the elephants, and beat them with their fists, or pieces of wood:
will throw stones at people that offend them: sleep in trees; make a sort of
shelter from the inclemency of the weather: are of a solitary nature, grave
appearance, and melancholy disposition, and even when young not inclined to
frolic: are vastly swift and agile: go erect: sometimes carry away the young
negroes These accounts are chiefly taken from Andrew Battle, an English sailor,
who was taken prisoner 1589, and lived many years in the inner parts of Congo;
his narrative is plain, and seems very authentic, it is preserved in Purchas's
collection.
.

When taken young are capable of being tamed; very docil, are taught to carry
water, pound rice, turn a spit. The Chimpanzee shown in London, 1738, was
extremely mild, affectionate, good-natured; like the satyr of Pliny, mitissima
natura; very fond of the people it was used to: eat like a human creature: lay
down in bed like one, with its hand under its head: fetch a chair to sit down
on: drink tea, pour it into a saucer if too hot: would cry like a child; be
uneasy at the absence of its keeper. This was only two feet four inches high,
and was a young one: that described by Doctor Tylon Orang outang, sive homo

Inhabits many parts of India, Arabia, and all parts of Africa, except Egypt,
where none of this genus are found. A few are found on the hill of Gibraltar,
which breed there: probably from a pair that had escaped from the town; for I
never heard that they were found in any other part of Spain.

Are very ill-natured, mischievous and fierce; agreeing with the character of
the ancient Cynocephali: are a very common kind in exhibitions: by force of
discipline, are made to play some tricks; otherwise, are more dull and sullen
than the rest of this genus: assemble in great troops in the open fields in

A. with a nose and head fourteen inches in length* the nose of a deep red,
face blue, both naked: black eyebrows: ears like the human; on the top of the
head a long upright tuft of hair; on the chin another: two long tusks in the
upper jaw: fore feet exactly resembling hands, and the nails on the fingers
flat: the hind feet have the thumbs less perfect, and the nails imbricated: the
fore part of the body, and the inside of the legs and arms, naked: the outside
covered with mottled brown and olive hair; that on the back dusky: the buttocks
red, and bare: length, from the nose to the rump, three feet two inches.

A species of disgusting deformity; very fierce and falacious; went on all
fours; but would sit up on its rump, and support itself with a stick: in this
attitude would hold a cup in its hand, and drink out of it: its food was fruits.

Aristotle barely mentions another species of ape under the title of (...),
simia Porcaria. M. de Buffon imagines it to be the baboon; but since the
Philosopher expressly says, that his (...), or apes, had no tails, we cannot
assent to its being the baboon. I rather think it a species we have not at
present knowledge of. Among my drawings is the copy of one in the British
Museum, with a nose exactly resembling that of a hog, which possibly may be
Aristotle's animal; but there is no account attending the painting to enable us
to trace its history.

B. with a long naked nose compressed sideways, of a purple color, and ribbed
obliquely on each side: on the chin a short picked orange beard: tail very
hairy, about two inches long, which it carries erect: buttocks naked: hair
soft, dusky mottled with yellow: length, from nose to tail, about two feet.

Inhabits Guinea. Those I have seen sat erect on their rump, but walked on all
fours: were good-natured, but not sportive.

By the rude figure in Gesner P. ^60. Papio, a barbarous name: from whence, the
English, (...); Italian, Babbuino, and French, Babouin.
, this seems to be the animal he intended, by his Papio: (the Simia Sphinx of
Linnaeus, 35.) but it must be observed, that able Naturalist here makes a great
mistake, in thinking it the Hyaena of the Ancients; but his description is
taken from a drawing, not from nature.

Linnaeus places this among the simiae cauda elongata, and applies to it some
of the synonyms of the ^^d species: but his description agrees with this so
exactly, that there can be no doubt but that it is his Simia maimon.

This animal is well described by M. de Buffon, Mr. (...), Linnaeus, and M.
Brisson; and indeed every Naturalist, except M. de Buffon, has copied Gesner:
but we think the first ought to have applied the name of Baboon to this
species, instead of that described by him, p. 133. the one having the character
of this section, the other having a length of tail, that constitutes that of
the monkey.

The animal called, by Barbot and Bosman Barbot's Guinea, 212. Bosman's Guinea,
242.
, SMITTEN, is a large species to be referred to this genus: it is described
with a great head, short tail, and of a mouse color; that it grows to the size
of five feet, is very fierce, and will even attack a man.

The mandrill mentioned by Smith, in his voyage to Guinea, is another kind;
probably only a variety of the Smitten. He says it grows to a vast size: the
body as thick as that of a man: the teeth large and yellow: head vastly large:
face broad and flat, wrinkled, and covered with a white skin: nose always
running: body covered with long black hair like a bear. M. de Buffoon makes
this last synonymous with his mandrill; but both the size and length of hair,
and greatness of the head, show them to be of a very different species.

The Tretretretre of Madagascar is another animal of this kind; described to be
of the size of a calf of two years old; to have a round head, visage and ears
of a man, feet of an ape, hair curled: a solitary species: the natives are
greatly afraid of it, and fly its haunts as it does theirs Flacourt hist.

Inhabits the hottest parts of Africa and Asia: keep in vast troops: are very
fierce and dangerous: rob gardens: run up trees when passengers go by; shake
the boughs at them with great fury, and chatter very loud: are excessively
impudent, indecent, lascivious: most detestable animals in their manners, as
well as appearance. Mr. Edwards communicated to me an account and a fine print
Engraven by himself, but never published. I should suspect this to be the
Smitt^n of Barbot, did he not expressly say it had a very short tail.
of one, which was shown in London some years ago: it came from Moco, in the
Persian gulf; was above five feet high; very fierce, and untameable; so
strong, as easily to master its keeper, a strong young man: its inclinations to
women appeared in the most violent manner. A Footman, who brought a girl to see
it, in order to teize the animal, kissed and hugged her: the beast, enraged at
being so tantalized, caught hold of a quart pewter pot, which he threw with
such force, and so sure an aim, that had not the man's hat and wig softened the
blow, his scull must have been fractured; but he fortunately escaped with a
common broken head.

M. with the nostrils divided, like those of a hare: nose thick, flat, and
wrinkled: head large: eyes small: teeth very white: body thick, and clumsy:
buttocks naked: tail long: color varies; sometimes like that of a wolf; but
others, are brown, tinged with yellow, or olive: the tail is rather shorter
than the body, and is always carried arched.

Inhabits Guinea and Angola: is full of frolic, and ridiculous grimaces.

Le Malbrouck of M. de Buffon, xiv. 224. tab. xxix. so much resembles this
species, that I place it it here as a variety. That able Zoologist suspected
the same; but separates them, on account of some trifling distinctions, and the
difference of country: this being a native of India, the other of Africa: but
since those very distinctions may arise from the last cause, it seems better to
unite them, than to multiply the species already so numerous. A few years ago,
one that seemed of this species was shown in London, equal in size to a small
greyhound.

tail very long: is a species of a middle size.

Inhabits Guinea and Congo, according to Marcgrave: the Congese call it
Exquima. M. de Buffon denies it to be of that country: but, from the
circumstance of the curl in its tail, in Marcgrave's figure, and the
description of some voyagers, he supposes it to be a native of South America.

Linnaeus describes his S. Diana somewhat differently: he says it is of the
size of a large cat; black, spotted with white: hind part of the back
ferrugineous: the hairs on the forehead erect, forming the shape of a crescent:
beard pointed; black above, white beneath; placed on a fattish excrescence:
breast and throat white: from the rump, cross the thighs, a white line: tail
long, strait, and black: face, ears, and feet, of the same color: canine teeth,

Inhabits different parts of Africa: keep in great flocks, and live in the
woods: are scarce discernible when among the leaves, except by their breaking
the boughs with their gambols, in which they are very agile and silent: even
when shot at, do not make the lest noise; but will unite in company, knit their
brows, and gnash their teeth, as if they meant to attack their enemy Adanson's

Inhabits Java: fawn on men, on their own species, and embrace each other; play
with dogs, if they have none of their own species with them: if they see a
monkey of another kind, greet him with a thousand grimaces: when a number of
them sleep, they put their heads together; make a continual noise during night.

upper part of the body of a most beautiful and bright bay, almost red, so
vivid as to appear painted: the lower parts ash-color, tinged with yellow: tail
not so long as the body: whose length is about one foot six inches.

M. de Buffon gives a variety of this species, tab. xxvi. with a white band
cross the face, which he calls Le Patas a bandeau blanc.

Inhabits Senegal: is less active than the other kinds: very inquisitive: when
boats are on their passage on the river, will come in crowds to the extremities
of the branches, and seem to admire them with vast attention: at length, will
become so familiar, as to throw pieces of sticks at the crew: if shot at, will
raise hideous cries; some will throw stones, others void their excrements in
their hands, and fling them among the passengers De Beue, as quoted by M. de
Buffon.

Inhabits Ceylon: keep in great troops: rob the gardens of fruit, and fields of
the corn: the natives are obliged to watch the whole day; yet these monkies are
so bold, that, when drove from one end of the field, will immediately enter at
the other, and carry off with them as much as their mouth and arms can hold.
Bosman Vey. Cuinea, 243.
, speaking of the thefts of the monkies of Guinea, says, that they will take in
each paw one or two stalks of millet, as many under their arms, and two or
three in their mouth; and thus laden, hop away on their hind legs; but if
pursued, fling away all, except what is in their mouths, that it may not impede
their flight: they are very nice in their choice of the millet, examine every
stalk, and if they do not like it, fling it away; so this delicacy does more
harm to the fields than their thievery.

Inhabits Barbary, Aethiopia, and other parts of Africa: is the kind which
gives the name of Monkey to the whole tribe, from the African word Men; or
rather its corruption, Monichus. M. de Buffon supposes it to be the (...) of
Aristotle: but the Philosopher says no more, than that the Cebi are apes
furnished with tails.

Inhabits the woods of Brasil and Guiana in vast numbers; and makes a most
dreadful howling: sometimes one mounts on a higher branch, the rest seat
themselves beneath; the first begins as if it was to harangue, and sets up so
loud and sharp a howl as may be heard a vast way, a person at a distance would
think that a hundred joined in the cry; after a certain space, he gives a
signal with his hand, when the whole assembly joins in chorus; but on another
signal, is silent, and the orator finishes his address A singular account, yet
related by Marcgrave and several other writers. Marcgrave is a writer of the
first authority, and a most able naturalist, long resident in the Brasils, and
speaks from his own knowledge.

particularly fond of this; Europeans will also eat it, especially in those

Inhabits the neighborhood of Carthagena, Guiana, Brasil, and De Buffon, xv.
21.
Peru: associate in vast herds: scarce ever are seen on the ground. Dampier Vox
II. 60.
describes their gambols in a lively manner: There was, says he, a great
company, dancing from tree to tree over my head, chattering and making a
terrible noise, and a great many grim faces and antic gestures; some broke
down dry sticks and flung them at me, others scattered their urine and dung
about my ears; at last one bigger than the rest came to a small limb just over
my head, and leaping directly at me, made me leap back, but the monkey caught
hold of the bough with the tip of his tail, and there continued swinging to and
fro, making mouths at me. The females with their young ones are much troubled
to leap after the males, for they have commonly two, one she carries under her
arm, the other sits on her back, and claps its two fore paws about her neck:
are very sullen when taken; and very hard to be got when shot, for they will
cling with their tail or feet to a bough, as long as any life remains; when I
have shot at one, and broke a leg or arm, I have pitied the poor creature to
see it look and handle the broken limb, and turn it from side to side.

They are the most active of monkies, and quite enliven the forests of America:
in order to pass from top to top of lofty trees, whose branches are too distant
for a leap, they will form a chain, by hanging down, linked to each other by
their tails, and swinging in that manner till the lowest catches hold of a
bough of the next tree, and draws up the rest Wafer's voy. in Dampier, III. 330.
and sometimes they pass Ulka. I^ 113.
rivers by the same expedient.

Are sometimes brought to Europe: are very tender, and seldom live long in our
climate: Mr. Brooks had one or two, which, as long as they continued in
health, were so active, and played such tricks, as to confirm the account of
voyagers.

limbs of a reddish brown: hands and feet covered with a black skin: tail longer
than the head and body, and often carried over the shoulders; the hair on it
very long, of a deep brown color, and appears very bushy from beginning to end:
is a species that varies a little in colors, and in the different length of the
hair, which induced Linnaeus to form three species out of this one.

Inhabits Guiana, not Ceylon, as Seba asserts: is a lively species; but
capricious in its affections in a state of captivity, having a great fondness
for some persons, and as great a hatred to others.

larger than the last.

Inhabits Madagascar: very fierce in a wild state; and make so violent a noise
in the woods, that it is easy to mistake the noise of two for that of a
hundred: when tamed are very gentle and good-natured. The hind thighs and legs
of these three species are very long, which makes their pace sideling, and
bounding.

toes to each foot, separated and standing all forward: claws large, a little
hooked, and of a flesh color: the hairs short, soft, glossy, closely set

belly is a broad dusky list, ending at the tail; and another from the head
along the middle of the back to the tail: tail of a bright tawny, mixed with
black; is round, and has the same prehensile faculty as some of the monkies
have: length from the nose to the tail nineteen inches; of the tail seventeen:
very good-natured and sportive; would catch hold of any thing with its tail,
and so suspend itself: lay with its head under its legs and belly.

M. with a long head: small mouth and teeth: small ears, round and membranous:
from the neck to the hands, thence to the hind feet, extends a broad skin, like
that of a flying squirrel; the same is also continued from the hind feet to the
tip of the tail, which is included in it: the body and outside of this skin is
covered with soft hairs, hoary, or black and ash color: the inner side of the
extended skin appears membranous, with little veins and fibers dispersed through
it: the legs are clothed with a soft yellow down: five toes on each foot: the
claws slender, very sharp, and crooked, by which it strongly adheres to
whatsoever it fastens on: the whole length of this species is near three feet:
the breadth the same: the tail slender; a span long.

Inhabits the country about Guzarat, the Molucca isles, and the Philippines:
feeds on the fruits of trees: a species very distinct from the bat, and flying
squirrel; but from ignorance of the form of its teeth, its genus very
doubtful: placed here on the authority of Linnaeus.

110. FAITHFUL.
D. with its tail bending toward the left: a character common to the whole
species, first observed by Linnaeus.

Not originally in a wild state: the praedominant passion of the whole race
toward an attachment to mankind, prevented these animals from separating
themselves from us; till deserted, or by some accident left in places where
there was no possibility of reunion: it seems beyond the power of ill usage to
subdue the faithful and constant qualities inherent in them. Found in great
numbers wild, or rather without masters, in Congo, Lower Aethiopia, and toward
the Cape of Good Hope Churchill's coll. voy. V. 486. Kolben's hist. Cape, II.
106, 107.
: are red haired: have slender bodies, and turned up tails, like grehounds;
others resemble hounds. Go in great packs: attack lions, tigers, and elephants,
but are often killed by them: the sight of these dogs pleasing to travelers,
who suppose they have conquered the wild beasts, and secured their journey, by
driving then away: chase all sort of animals: when they have run down a beast,
still preserve that sort of respect to mankind, as to permit part of it to be
taken from them without growling: attack the sheep of the Hottentots, and
commit great ravages among them.

like rabbet holes Narrative of the distresses of Isaac Morris, etc. belonging
to the Wager Storeship belonging to Commodore Anson's squadron, p. 27

to mankind: nor will they ever join themselves to the wild dogs; or desert
their masters: these have not forgot to bark The same, p. 37.
, as Linnaeus says: look like a grehound As appears from a drawing communicated
to me by Mr. Greenwood, painter, who took it from one that followed an Indian
to Surinam from the inland part of the country.
: have erect ears: are very vigilant; excellent in the chase.

The dog unknown in America before it was introduced there by the Europeans:
the Alco of the Peruvians, a little animal, which they were so fond of, and
kept at a lap dog, too slightly mentioned by A-Costa for us to determine what
it was: the figure given by Hernandez 466.
too rude to form any judgment of: the other animal described by Fernandez is
a large species, he calls it Xoloizicuinlli, the same name that is given by the
first to the Mexican wolf Hernandez, 479.
; as it is certain that the dog of N. America, or rather its substitute, on its
first discovery by the English, was derived from the Smith's hist. Virginia, 27.
wolf, tamed and domesticated; so it is reasonable to imagine that of S.
America had the same origin: these substitutes cannot bark, but betray their
savage descent by a sort of howl: want the sagacity of a true dog; serve only
to drive the dear into corners: the wolfish breed to this day detested Catesby
Carolina, II. App. xxvi.
by European dogs, who worry them on all occasions, retaining that dislike
which it is well known all dogs have to the wolf: this reclaimed breed commonly
white: have sharp noses, and upright ears.

The dog subject to more variety than any other animal; each will mix with the
other, and produce varieties still more unlike the original stock: M. de
Buffon, who with great ingenuity has given a genealogical table of all the
known dogs, makes the Chien de Berger, the shepherds dog, or what is sometimes
called Le chien-loup, or the wolf dog, the origin of all, because it is
naturally the most sensible; becomes, without discipline, almost instantly the
guardian of the flocks; keeps them within bounds, reduces the stragglers to
their proper limits, and defends them from the attacks of the wolves. We have
this variety in England; but it is small and weak. Those of France and the
Alps, are very large and strong; sharp-nosed, erect, and sharp-eared; very
hairy, especially about the neck, and have their tails turned up or curled; and
by accident, their faces often show the marks of their combats with the wolf.

I shall follow M. de Buffon, in the catalogue of dogs; but add some few
remarks, with the synonyms or a few other writers, to each variety.

Its varieties, or nearest allies, are,

a POMERANIAN Dog, Le Chien Loup de Buffon. tab. xxix. Notwithstanding M. de
Buffon denies the junction of the wolf and bitch, yet there has been lately an
instance to the contrary. Mr. Brook, animal-merchant, in Holborn, turned a wolf
to a Pomeranian bitch in heat: the congress was immediate, and as usual between
dog and bitch: she produced ten puppies. I have since seen one of them that had
very much the resemblance of a wolf, and much of its nature; being slipped at a
weak deer, instantly caught at the animal's throat and killed it.

The most faithful of animals: is the companion of mankind: fawns at the
approach of its master: will not suffer any one to strike him: runs before him
in a journey; often running backward and forward over the same ground: on
coming to cross ways, stops and looks back: very docil: will find out what is
dropped: watchful by night: anounces the coming of strangers: guards any goods
committed to its charge: drives cattle home from the field: keeps herds and
flocks within bounds: protects them from wild beasts: points out to the
sportsman the game, be virtue of its acute sense of smelling: brings the birds
that are shot to its master: will turn a spit: at Brussels and in Holland draws
little carts to the herb market: in Siberia draws a sledge with its master in
it, or laden with provisions: sits up and begs The French Academicians record
a mavelous tale of a dog that could speak and call for tea, coffee and
chocolate.
: when it has committed a theft slinks away with its tail between its legs:
ears enviously with oblique eyes: is master among its fellows: enemy to
beggars: attacks strangers without provocation: fond of licking wounds: cures
the gout and cancers: howls at certain notes in music, and often urines on
hearing them: bites at a stone flung at it: is sick at the approach of bad
weather: gives itself a vomit by eating grass: is afflicted with tape-worms:
spreads its madness: grows blind with age: saepe gonnorhaea infectus: driven as
unclean from the houses of the Mahometans; yet the same people establish
hospitals for them, and allow them a daily dole of food: eats flesh, carrion,
farinaceous vegetables not greens: fond or rolling in carrion: dungs on a
stone; its dung the greatest of Septics: drinks by lapping: makes water
side-ways, with its leg held up; very apt to repeat it where another dog has
done the same: odorat anum alterius: menstruans catulit cum variis; mordet illa
illos; cohaeret copula junctus. Goes 63 days with young; brings from four to
ten; the males like the dog, females like the bitch: its scent exquisite: goes
obliquely: foams when hot, and hangs out its tongue: scarce sweats: about to
lie down, often goes round the spot: its sleep attended with a quick sense of
heating: dreams.

they prowl by night in vast droves through villages, and destroy any persons they
meet: such that once get the taste o^ human blood, give it the preference: such
were the wolves of the Gevaudan, of which so many strange tales were told: the
French peasants call this Loupgarou, and suppose it to be possessed with some
evil spirit: such was the Were Wulf of the old Saxons Verstegan's Antiq. 236.
. The wolf preys on all kind of animals; but in case of necessity will feed on
carrion: in hard weather assemble in vast troops, and join in dreadful
howlings: horses generally defend themselves against their attacks; but all
weaker animals fall a prey to them: throughout France the peasants are obliged
nightly to house their flocks: wolves are most suspicious animals; sally forth
with great caution: have a fine scent; hunt by nose: are capable of bearing
long abstinence: to allay their hunger will fill their bellies with mud: a
mutual enmity between dogs and them: are in heat in winter, followed by several
males, which occasions great combats: goes with young ten weeks: near her time
prepares a soft bed of moss, in some retired place: brings from five to nine at
a time: the young born blind: teeth of the wolf large and sharp: its bite
terrible, as its strength is great: the hunters therefore cloth their dogs,
and guard their necks with spiked collars: wolves are proscribed animals,
destroyed by pit-falls, traps or poison: a peasant in France, who kills a wolf,
carries its head through the villages, and collects some small reward from the
inhabitants: the Kirghis-Khaissacks take the wolves by the help of a large sort
of hawk called Berkut, which is trained for the diversion, and will fasten on
them and tear out their eyes Pa^^^eff Topog. Oreub. I. 282.

space between marked with broad tawny spots: the head ash colored, striped
transversely with bending dusky lines: neck fat and thick, covered with a loose
skin, marked with a long tawny stroke: on the breast is another of the same

Inhabits the hot parts of Mexico, or New Spain: agrees with the European wolf
in its manners: attacks cattle, and sometimes men. No wolves found farther

COMMON FOX inhabits all Europe, the cold and temperate parts of Asia In great
numbers in the Holy Land, especially in the season of grapes; their ravages
among the vines mentioned in the Song of SOLOMON, II. 15.
, Barbary, but not the hotter parts of Africa; abounds in N. America; and are
also found in S. America Gare^lasso de la Vega says, that the foxes of Peru are
much less than those of Spain, and are called Atoc. p. 331.
: in all countries have the same cunning disposition; the same eagerness after
prey; and commit the same ravages among game, birds, poultry, and the lesser
quadrupeds: are very fond of honey; attack the wild bees, and nests of wasps,
for sake of the magots: will eat any sort of insects: devour fruit; and are
very destructive in vineyards: bury what they cannot eat: fond of basking in
the sun.

Lodge under ground; generally making use of a badger's hole, which they
enlarge, adding several chambers, and never neglecting to farm another hole to
the surface to escape at, in cases of extremity: prey by night: females in heat
in winter; bring five or six at a time; if the young are disturbed, will remove
them one by one to a more secure place: their voice a yelp, not a bark: their
bite like that of the wolf, is very hard and dangerous: their scent excessively
strong; the chase in that account more keen, more animating: when chased first
attempt to recover their hole, but finding that stopped generally fly the
country.

hair, somewhat woolly; short legs: toes covered on all parts, like that of a
hare, with fur: tall shorter than that of the common fox, and more bushy: of a
bluish gray, or ashcolor; sometimes white: the young of the gray are black
before they come to maturity: hair much longer in winter than summer, as usual
with animals of cold climates.

Inhabits the countries bordering on the frozen sea; Kamtschatka, the isles
between it and America, and the opposite parts of America discovered in Captain
Bering's expedition, 1741; is again found in Greenland, Iceland, Spitzbergen,
Nova Zembla, and Lapland: burrows under ground; forms holes many feet in
length; strews the bottom with moss: in Greenland and Spitzbergen, lives in the
cliffs of rocks, not being able to burrow, by reason of the frost: two or three
pair inhabit the same hole: are in heat about Lady Day; during that time
continue in the open air; afterward take to their holes: go with young nine
weeks: like dogs continue united in copulation: bark like that animal; for
which reasons the Russians call them Peszti Or dogs, Strahlenberg hist. Russia,
363.
: have all the cunning of the common fox: prey on the young of geese, ducks,
and other water fowl, before they can fly; on grouse of the country, and hares,
on the eggs of birds; and in Greenland (through necessity) on berries, shell
fish, or any thing the sea flings up; but their principal food in the North of
Asia, and in Lapland, is the Leming No. 202.
, or Lapland Marmot: those of the countries last mentioned are very migratory,
pursuing the Leming, a very wandering animal: sometimes these foxes will desert
the country for three or four years, probably in pursuit of their prey; for it
is well known that the migrations of the Leming is very inconstant, appearing
in certain countries only once in several years: the people of Jenesea suspect
they go to the banks of the Oby: are taken in traps: oft-time the glutton and
great owl destroys them, before the hunter can take them out: the skins of
small value: the great rendezvous of these animals on the banks of the frozen
sea, and the rivers that flow into it, being found there in greet troops.

Inhabits Carolina, and the warmer parts of N. America: differs from the arctic
fox in form; and in nature of its dwelling: agrees with the common fox in the
first, varies from it in the last: never burrows; lives in hollow trees: gives
no diversion to the sportsman, for after a mile's chase takes to its retreat:
has no strong smell: feeds on poultry, birds, etc. easily made tame: their
skins, when in season, made use of for muffs.

Inhabits all the hot and temperate parts of Asia; is found in Barbary, and
other parts of Africa, as low as the Cape of Good Hope. They go in packs of 40,
50, even of 200, and hunt like hounds in full cry, from evening to morning

gardens, near towns, and will even destroy children Russel's Aleppo, 60.

that happen to be unprotected: they will enter stables and outhouses, and
devour skins, and any thing else formed of that material: there is scarce an
animal they will leave unmolested: in default of living prey, will feed on
roots, fruits, and the most infected carrion: will greedily disinter the dead
Boullaye-le-Gouz, 254.
, and feed on the putrid corpses; for which reason, in many countries, the
graves are made of a great depth, and well secured against their attacks: they
attend caravans, and follow armies, in hopes that death will provide them a
banquet: their howls and clamors are dreadful, and so loud that people can
scarce hear one another speak: during day they are silent, and retire to their
dens. Dellon says that they are sometimes tamed, and kept among other domestic
animals.

This animal is vulgarly called the Lion's provider, from an opinion that it
rouzes the prey for that bad nosed quadruped. The fact is, every creature in
the forest is set in motion by the fearful cries of the Jackals; the Lion, and
other beasts of rapine, by a sort of instinct, attend to the chase, and seize
such timid animals that betake themselves to flight at the noise of this
nightly pack. Described by Oppian Cyneg. III. 296.
under the name of (...), or yellow wolf; who mentions its horrible howl. It is
strange, that an animal so common in the Levant, should never have been brought
over to be described by any modern Naturalist. The descriptions yet remain very
obscure; and there is still great uncertainty, whether the Jackal, and the
Adive of M. de Buffon, are the same, or different animals. A stuffed skin of one
in the Ashmolean Museum (in very ill preservation) had none of that brilliant
color ascribed to it by Belon.

May, as M. de Buffon conjectures, be the (...) of Aristotle Hist. An. lib. II.
c. 17. lib. ix. c. 44.
, who mentions it with the wolf, and says that it has the same internal
structure as the wolf, which is common with congenerous animals. The Thoes of
Pliny may also be a variety of the same animal; for his account of it agrees
with the modern history of the Jackal, except in the last article Thoes,

black: size of a large dog, but very strongly made.

Inhabits Asiatic Turkey, Syria, Persia, and Barbary: like the jackal violates
the repositories of the dead, and greedily devours the putrid contents of the
grave; like it, preys on the herds and flocks; yet, for want of other food,
will eat the roots of plants Shaw's Travels, 246.
, and the tender shoots of the palms; but contrary to the nature of the former,
is an unsociable animal; (...) solitary, and inhabits the chasms of the rocks.
The superstitious Arabs, when they kill one, carefully bury the head Shaw's
Travels, 246.
, least it should be applied to magical purposes; as the neck was of old by the
Thessalian sorceress.

Viscera non Lyneis, non dirae nodus Hyaena Defuit Lucan, lib. vi. 672. The
ancients believed that the neck of the Hyaena consisted of one bone without any
joint.
. The ancients were wild in their opinion of the Hyaena: they believed that it
changed its sex, imitated the human voice; that it had power of charming the
shepherds, and as it were rivetting them to the place they stood on: no wonder
that an ignorant Arab should attribute to its remains preternatural powers.

They are cruel, fierce, and untameable animals, with a most malevolent aspect:
have a sort of obstinate courage, which will made them face stronger
quadrupedsthan themselves; Kaempfer relates that he saw one which had put two
lions to flight, regarding them with the utmost coolness, Their voice is
hoarse, a disagreeable mixture of growling and roaring.

Inhabits Guinea, Aethiopia, and the Cape: lives in holes in the earth, or

kills two or three sheep: devours as much as it can, and carries away one for a
future repast: will attack mankind; scrape open graves, and devour the dead. M.

common jackal. Has, till the present time, been undistinguished by naturalists.

An inhabitant of all parts of Africa; and the hot parts of Asia, such as India
and Persia, and a few are still met with in the deserts between Bagdat and
Bassorah, on the banks of the Euphrates; but they are found in greatest numbers
in the torrid zone, where their size is the largest, and their rage more
tremendous, being enflamed by the influence of a burning sun, on a most arid
soil. In the interior parts of Africa Leo Afr. 342.
, amidst the scorched and desolate deserts of Zaara, or Biledulgerid, they
reign sole masters; they lord it over every beast, and their courage never
meets with a check, where the climate keeps mankind at a distance: the nearer
they approach the habitations of the human race, the less their rage, or rather
the greater is their timidity Purchas's Pilg. II. 809.
; they have often experienced the unequal combat, and finding that there exists
a being superior to them, commit their ravages with more caution: a cooler
climate again has the same effect; for in the burning deserts, where rivers and
fountains are denied, they live in a perpetual fever, a sort of madness fatal
to every animal they meet with: the author of the economy of nature gives a
wonderful proof of the instinct of these animals in those unwatered tracts.
There the Pelican makes her nest; and in order to cool her young ones, and
accustom them to an element they must afterward be conversant in, brings from
afar, in their great gular pouch, sufficient water to fill the nest; the lion,
and other wild beasts, approach and quench their thirst, yet never injure the

to the authorities themselves. Lions are capable of being tamed: the monarch
of Persia, full of savage state, has, on days of audience Bell's travels, I.
102.
, two great ones chained on each side of the passage to the room of state, led
there by keepers, in chains of gold. As they have been so far subdued, why may
we not credit the story of their being harnessed for the triumphal car of the
conqueror Bacchus?

The lion preys on all kinds of animals: as his scent is bad, his peculiar and
tremendous roar strikes terror into every beast of the desert, and sets them in
motion, in open view; he then selects his object, and takes it not so much by
pursuit, as by a vast bound, striking it with his talons, and tearing it to
pieces: in inhabited countries he invades the folds, leaps over the fences with
his prey; and such is his strength, that he can carry off a middling ox with
the utmost ease La Caille, 204.
: in many places it takes its prey by surprise, lurking in the thickets, and
springing on it: oft-times mankind falls a victim to his hunger, but then it is
rather through necessity than choice. The Arabs have a notion of his sparing the
tender sex, but Doctor Shaw informs us Travels, 244.
that they make no distinction in these days: the same writer acquaints us,
that the flesh of the lion is often eaten in Barbary, and it resembles veal in
taste.

color, beautifully marked with long stripes of black from the back, pointing to
the belly, with others cross the thighs: the tail shorter by a third than the
body; annulated with black: often superior in size to a lion; that called the
Royal Dellon. voy. 78.
Tiger of a tremendous bulk. M. de Buffon mentions one that was (tail included)
fifteen feet long. Du Halde II. 254, says, that the Chinese tigers vary in
color, some being white, striped with black and gray.

The tiger is peculiar to Asia M. de Buffon says they are found in the South of
Africa. I can meet with no authority for it; the animals so called by Ludolphus
and K^lben, being only Panthers, or Leopards, which are generally confounded
with the Tiger by most voyagers.
; and is found as far North as China, and Chinese Tartary; it inhabits mount
Ararat, and Hyrcania of old, famous for its wild beasts; but the greatest
numbers, the largest, and the most cruel, are met with in India, and its
islands; they are the scourge of the country; they lurk among the bushes, on
the sides of rivers, and almost depopulate many places: they are insidious,
blood thirsty, and malevolent; and seem to prefer preying on the human race
preferable to any other animals: they do not pursue their prey, but bound on it
from their ambush, with an elasticity, and from a distance that is scarce
credible: if they miss the object, they make off; but if they succeed, be it
man, or be it beast, even one as large as a Buffalo Bontius, 53. Strabo. lib.
xv. relates much the same of the Tigers of the country of the Prasii.
, they carry it off with such ease, that it seems not the lest impediment to
their flight: if they are undisturbed, they plunge their head into the body of
the animal up to their very eyes, as if it were to satiate themselves with
blood, which they exhaust the corpse of before they tear it to pieces Bontius,
53.
: there is a sort of cruelty in their devastations, unknown to the generous
lion; as well at a poltronery in their sudden retreat on any disappointment. I
was informed, by very good authority, that in the beginning of this century,
some gentlemen and ladies, being on a party of pleasure, under a shade of
trees, on the banks of a river in Bengal, observed a tiger preparing for its
fatal spring; one of the ladies, with amazing presence of mind, laid hold of
an umbrella, and furled it full in the animal's face, which instantly retired,
and gave the company opportunity of removing from so terrible a neighbor.

Another party had not the same good fortune: a tiger darted among them while
they were at dinner, (...) on one gentleman, and carried him off, and (...) was
more heard of. They attack all sorts of animals, even the lion; and it has been
known that both have perished in their combats: there is in some parts of India
a popular notion Bont^us, 53.
, that the rhinoceros and the tiger are in friendship, because they are often
found near each other: the fact is, the rhinoceros, like the hog, loves to
wallow in the mire; and on that account frequents the banks of rivers; the
tiger, to quench its raging thirst, is met with in places contiguous to them.

Pliny has been frequently taken to task by the moderns, for calling the tiger,
animal tremendae ve^^tatis Plinii. lib. viii. c. 18.
; they allow it great agility in its bounds, but deny it swiftness in pursuit:
two travelers of authority, both eyewitnesses, confirm what Pliny says; the
one indeed only mentions, in general its vast fleetness; the other saw a trial
between one and a swift horse, whose rider escaped merely by getting in time
amidst a circle of armed men. The chase of this animal was a favorite diversion
with the great CAM-HI, the Chinese monarch, in whose company our countryman,
Mr. Bell, that faithful traveller; and the Pere Gerbillon, saw these proofs of
the tiger's speed ^^ll's Travels, II. 91. Du Halde, II. 343.

They are said to roar like a lion; but those I have seen in captivity, emitted
only a surly growl.

C. with short smooth hair, of a bright tawny color: the back, sides, and
flanks elegantly marks with black spots, disposed in circles from four to five
in each, with a single black spot in the center of each: on the face and legs
single spots only: on the top of the back is a row of oblong spots; the longest
next the tail: the chest and belly white; the first marked with transverse
dusky stripes: the belly and tail with large irregular black spots: ears short
and pointed: end of the nose brown: limbs very strong: the skin of one I
measured, was, from the end of the nose to the origin of the tail, six feet ten
inches; the tail near three.

Inhabits Africa, from Barbary to the remotest parts of Guinea Shaw's Travels,
244. des Marchais, I. 204. the last mistakenly calls them Tigers.
. This species is next in size to the tiger; next to it in cruelty, and in its
general enmity to the animal creation: it is to Africa what the former is to
Asia, with this alleviation, that it prefers the flesh of brutes to that of
mankind; but when pressed with hunger, attacks every living creature without
distinction: its manner of taking its prey is the same with that of the tiger,
always by surprise, either lurking in thickets, or creeping on its belly till
it comes within reach: it will also climb up trees in pursuit of monkies, and
lesser animals; so that nothing is secure from its attacks: it is an untameable
species, always retains its fierce, its malevolent aspect, and perpetual growl
or murmur.

The ancients were well acquainted with these animals; these and the leopards
were the Variae, and Pardi of the old writers: one should think that the Romans
would have exhausted the deserts of Africa, by the numbers they draw from
thence for their public shows: Scaurus exhibited at one time 150 Panthers;
Pompey the great 410; Augustus 420 Plinii, lib. viii. c. 17.
: probably they thinned the coasts of Mauritania of these animals, but they
still swarm in the Southern parts of Guinea.

Oppian describes two species of Panthers; a large species and a small one; the
first of which has a shorter tail than the lesser, and may possibly be this
kind.

An animal of this species is found in Buckharia, called there Babr; is seven
^eet long; very destructive to horses, and even camels: the skin is fine, and
valued in Russia at 1l. sterling Ritchkoff Orenb. Topogr. I. 28. In China is a
most beautiful kind, called there Louchu, whose skins sell for six pounds,
sterling, a^ce. Muller Russ. Samlung. III. 549, 608. I must here observe, that
there are, in the Furriers shops in London, skins in most respects resembling
those of the Panther; which, they have assured me, came from the Spanish
settlements in the West Indies: These skins equaled those of the old continent,
in beauty and size. Notwithstanding M. de Buffon denies this animal to be a
native of America, yet I cannot help thinking, that the same, or a variety at
lest, inhabits the hot parts of that country. 1. The figure of the species,
described by Faber hist. An. Nov. Hisp. 408, under the name of Tigr^ Mexicana,
agrees exactly with that of the Panther; as does the description in general,
given p. 507. 2. Every other animal of this genus, which has been yet
discovered in America, is far inferior in size and strength to this; whose
common height, Faber says, is four or five feet, and whose prey is wild cattle,
horses, etc. M. Condamine V^y. 81.
, and Le Pere Cajetan Cattaneo Vide three very entertaining Letters added to
M^ratori's Missions of Paraguay, 259.
, speak of the Tigers ( i. e. the Panthers) of America, as equal, and even
superior, in size, to those of Africa; and the color as bright as gold; and
Ulloa Vol. I. 56.
describes them as big as little horses. 3. Notwithstanding the venders of furs
are not entirely to be relied on, as to the countries their goods come from;
yet the general opinion of the whole trade, that these skins were the product
of Spanish America, is a further proof of their being common to both continents.

But the new world, especially the part possessed by the jealous Spaniards, is
still very imperfectly explored: sufficient space is still left for the
conquest of the naturalist; so at present he had no reason to weep, like
Alexander, for want of other globes.

spots, disposed in circles, and placed pretty closely together: the face and
legs marked with single spots: the breast and belly covered with longer hairs
than the rest of the body, of a whitish color: the spots on the tail large and
oblong: the length of this species, from nose to tail, four feet; the tail two
and a half.

Inhabits Senegal and Guinea; spares neither man nor beast: when beasts of
chase fail, descends from the internal parts of Africa in crowds, and makes
great havoke among the numerous herds that cover the rich meadows of the lower
Guinea: it tears its prey to pieces with both claws and teeth; is always thin,
though perpetually devouring. The Panther is its enemy, and destroys numbers of
them. The Negresses make collars of their teeth, and attribute to them certain
virtues. The Negroes take these animals in pit-falls, covered at the top with
slight hurdles, on which is placed some flesh as a bait. The Negroes made a
banquet of these animals, whose flesh is said to be as white as veal, and very
well tasted. The skins are often brought to Europe, and reckoned very valuable.

small kind of wagon, chained and hoodwinked, till it approaches the herd: when
first unchained does not immediately make its attempt, but winds along the
ground, stopping and concealing itself till it gets a proper advantage, then
darts on the animals with surprising swiftness; overtakes them by the rapidity
of its bounds: but if it does not succeed in its first efforts, consisting of
five or six amazing leaps, misses its prey: losing its breath, and finding
itself unequal in speed, stands still: gives up 1 HUNTING LEOPARD No. 125. II

Inhabits the hottest parts of S. America, from the isthmus of Darien to Buenos
Airs: fierce and destructive to man and beast. Like the tiger it plunges its
head into the body of its prey, and sucks out the blood before it devours it:
makes a great noise in the night, like the howling of a hungry dog: is a very
cowardly animal: easily put to flight; either by the shepherds dogs, or by a
lighted torch, being very fearful of fire: it lies in ambush near the sides of
rivers: there is sometimes seen a singular combat between this animal and the
crocodile; when the Jaguar comes to drink, the crocodile, ready to surprise any
animal that approaches, raises its head out of the water, the former instantly
strikes its claws into the eyes of this dreadful reptile, the only penetrable
part, who immediately dives under the water, pulling his enemy along with it,
where they commonly both perish Condamine's voy. 81.

of Mr. Brooks's exhibitions, and found it the same with the animal described by
Hernandez. M. de Buffon supposes the male to be the animal described by that
author under the title of Tigris Mexicana, p. 208. but whoever examines that
description will be of opinion it is of a species very nearly agreeing with the
European Panther.

black on the outside, gray within: from the nose to the eye, on each side, a
black line; above and beneath each eye a white one: sides of the mouth white,
marked with four rows of small black spots: from the hind part of the head, to
the back and shoulders, ran some long, narrow, hallow stripes: along the top of
the back two rows of oval black spots: the marks on the sides long, hollow, and

of America; fierce and ravenous to the highest degree: swims over the broad
rivers, and attacks the cattle, even in the enclosures; and when pressed with
hunger, spares not even mankind. In N. America their fury seems to be subdued
by the rigor of the climate; the smallest cur, in company with its master,
makes them seek for security, by running up trees: but then they are equally
destructive to domestic animals, and are the greatest nu^sance the planter has:

spotted, nor had the two which were shown in London some years ago any spots on

. The brown bears are sometimes carnivorous, and will destroy cattle, and eat
carrion; but their general food is roots, fruits, and vegetables: will rob the
fields of pease; and when they are ripe, pluck great quantities up; beat the
pease out of the husks on some hard place, eat them, and carry off the straw:
they will also, during winter, break into the farmer's yard, and make great
havoke among his stock of oats: are particularly fond of honey. The bears of
America are small and black; and confine themselves entirely to vegetables, and
are remarkably greedy of Mayz and Potatoes; they will even reject animal food,
though pressed by hunger Du Pratz Louisiana. II. 56.57.
: neither of these varieties will attack mankind, unless wounded, or when they
have their young: they strike with their fore feet like a cat; seldom or ever
use their mouths in fighting, but seizing the assailant with their paws, and
pressing him against their breast, almost instantly squeeze him to death.

The females after conception retire into the most secret place; least, when
they bring forth, the males should devour the young: it is affirmed for fact,
that out of the several hundred bears that are killed in America, during
winter, (which is their breeding season) that scarce a female is found among

only two females were found, and those not praeg^ Lawson, 117.
them; so impenetrable is their retreat during their pregnancy: they bring two,
rarely three young at a time: the cubs are deformed, but not a shapeless mass,
to be licked into shape, as the ancients pretended H^ sunt candida informisque
caro, paulo muribus major, sine oculis, (...) tantum prominent: hane lambendo
paulatim figurant. (...) lib ^iii. c. 3^.
. The flesh of a bear in autumn, when they are most excessively fat, by feeding
on acorns, and other mast, is most delicate food; and that o^ the cubs still
finer; but the paws of the old bear are reckoned the most exquisite morsel: the
fat white and very sweet: the oil excellent for strains, and old pains.

The latter end of autumn, after they have fattened themselves to the greatest
degree, the bean withdraw to their dens, where they continue for a great number
of days in total inactivity, and abstinence from food, having no other
nourishment than what they get by sucking their feet, where the fat lodges in
great abundance: their retreats are either in cliffs of rocks; in the deepest
recesses of the thickest woods; or in the hollows of ancient trees, which they
ascend and descend with surprising agility: as they lay in no winter
provisions, they are in a certain space of time, forced from their retreats by
hunger, and come out extremely lean: multitudes are killed annually in America,
for the sake of their flesh, or skins; which last makes a considerable article
of commerce.

B. with long head and neck: short round ears: end of the nose black: vast
teeth: hair long, soft, white, tinged in some parts with yellow: limbs of great
size and strength: grow to a vast size; the skins of some are thirteen feet
long.

This animal is confined to the coldest part of the globe: it has been found as
far as navigators have penetrated northwards above lat. 80. The frigid climates
only seem adapted to its nature; for we do not learn from any authority that it
is met with farther south than Newfoundland. Its bounds in respect to longitude
are also very limited; being an animal unknown except on the shores of Hudson's
Bay, Greenland, and Spitzbergen, on one side, and those of Nova Zembla on the
other; for such as have appeared in other parts, have been brought there
involuntarily Horrebow Iceland, 42.
on floating islands of ice; so that the intermediate countries of Norway and
Iceland are acquainted with them but by accident. We cannot trace them farther
East than Nova Zembla; though the frozen sea, that is continued from thence as
far as the land of Tschukschi, that lies above Kamtschatka, is equally suited
to their nature. The late histories of those countries are silent in respect to
them.

During summer the white bears are either resident on islands of ice, or
passing from one to another: they swim admirably, and can continue that
exercise La Hontan, I.
six or seven leagues; and dive with great agility. They bring two young at a
time: the affection between the parents and them is so strong, that they would
die rather than desert one another. Their winter retreats are under the snow
Egede. 60.
, in which they form deep dens, supported by pillars of the same.

They feed on fish, seals, and the carcasses of whales; and on human bodies,
which they will greedily disinter: they seem very fond of human blood; and are
so fearless as to attack companies of armed men, and even to board small
vessels: when on land they live on birds, and their eggs; and, allured by the
scent of the seals flesh, often break into, and plunder the houses of the
Greenlanders: their greatest enemy in the brute creation is the Morse Egede
Greenl. 60.83.
, with whom they have terrible conflicts, but are generally worsted, the vast
teeth of the former giving it a superiority.

The flesh is white, and said to taste like mutton: the fat is melted for train
oil, and that of the feet used in medicine; but the liver is very unwholesome,
as three of Barentz's sailors experienced, who fell dangerously ill on eating
some of it boiled.

One of this species was brought over to England a few years ago: it was very
furious, almost always in motion, roared loud, and seemed very uneasy, except
when cooled by having pail-fulls of water poured on it.

Callixenus Rhodius As quoted by Athenaeus, lib. v. p. 201.
, in his description of the pompous procession of Ptolemoeus Philadelphus at
Alexandria, speaks of one great white Bear, (...), among other wild beasts that
graced the show: notwithstanding the local situation of this species at
present, it is possible that Ptolomy might procure one; whether men could
penetrate, in those early times, as far as the present residence of these
Arctic animals, I will not venture to affirm, nor to deny; but since my friend,
the Hon. Daines Barrington Phil. Trans. vol. LVIII. p. 58.
, has clearly proved the intense cold that in former ages raged in countries
now more than temperate, it is most probable that in those times they were
stocked with animals natural to a rigorous climate; which, since the
alteration, have necessarily become extinct in those parts: the Polar Bear
might have been one, but that it was the species meant by Callixenus is clear
to me, by the epithet (...), or Great, which is very applicable to it; for the
white Tartarian land bear (which Ptolomy might very easily procure) differs not
in size from the black or brown kind, but the bulk of the other is quite
characteristic.

which passes in form of a band quite over the hind part of the back, above the
tail: on the throat a white spot: on the breast a white mark, in form of a
crescent: legs very strong, thick and short, of a deep black: five toes on each
foot Mr. Edwards observed only four toes on the fore feet of the animal he
describes. My description is taken from an entire skin, in very fine
preservation, communicated to me by Mr. Ashton Blackburne, of Orford
Lancashire, now resident in North America, who, with indefatigable industry and
great judgment, annually enriches the cabinets of his friends with the rarest
natural productions of that continent: as this work has profited so greatly by
that gentleman's labors, it would be ungrateful to omit my acknowlegements.
, not deeply divided: on the fore foot of that I examined were some white
spots: the bottom of the feet covered very thickly with hair: rests like the
bear on its foot, as far as the first joint of the leg: claws strong and sharp,
white at their ends: tail clothed with long coarse hairs; those at the base
reddish, at the end black; some of the hairs are six inches long: length from
nose to tail twenty-eight inches: length of the trunk of the tail seven inches,
but the hairs reach six beyond its end: the whole body is covered with very
long and thick hair, which varies in color, according to the season.

Inhabits Hudson's-Bay, and Canada, as far as the straits of Michilimakinac: is
found under the name of the GLUTTON in the N. parts of Europe, and Asia, being

A most voracious animal: slow of foot, so is obliged to take its prey by

come out of their houses, and sometimes breaks into their habitations, and
devours them: often l^rks on trees, and falls on the quadrupeds, that pass
under; will fasten on the horse, elk, or stag, and continue eating a hole (...).

its eyes (...) Kamts^^atka, 99, 100.
: no force can disengage it, yet sometimes the deer, in their agony, have been

: devours the Isatis, or white fox; searches for the traps laid for the
sables, and other animals, and often is before hand with the huntsmen, who
sustain great losses by the glutton: authors have pretended, that it feeds so
voraciously, that at length it is in danger of bursting; and that it is obliged
to ease itself of its load, by squeezing it out between two trees.

In a wild state is vastly fierce; a terror to both wolf and bear, which will
not prey on it when they find it dead, perhaps on account of its being so very
foetid, smelling like a pole-cat: makes a strong resistance when attacked, will
tear the stock from the gun, and pull the traps it is caught in to pieces:
notwithstanding this, is capable of being tamed, and of learning several tricks

with small scales; the half next the body black, the rest white: it has a
disagreeable appearance, looking like the body of a snake, and has the same
prehensile quality as that of some monkies: body round, and pretty thick: legs
short: on the lower part of the belly of the female is a large pouch, in which
the teats are lodged, and where the young shelter as soon as they are born. The
length of one I examined was seventeen inches; that of the tail fourteen.

Inhabits Virginia, Louisiana, Mexico, Brasil, and Peru: is very destructive to
poultry, and sucks the blood without eating the flesh: feeds also on roots and
wild fruits: is very active in climbing trees: will hang suspended from the
branches by its tail, and, by swinging its body, fling itself among the boughs
of the neighboring trees: hunts eagerly after birds and their nests: walks very
slow: when pursued and overtaken, will feign itself dead: not easily killed,
being as tenacious of life as a cat: when the female is about to bring forth,
she makes a thick nest of dry grass in some close bush at the (...) of a tree,
and brings four, five, or six young at a time.

As soon as the young are brought forth, they take shelter in the pouch, or
false belly, and fasten so closely to the teats, as not to be separated without
difficulty: they are blind, naked, and very small when newborn, and resemble
foetuses: it is therefore necessary that they should continue there (...) they
attain a perfect shape, strength, sight and hair; and are prepared to undergo
what may be called a second birth: after which, they run into this pouch as
into an asylum, in time of danger; and the parent carries them about with her.
During the time of this second gestation, the female shows an excessive
attachment to her young, and will suffer any torture rather than permit this
receptacle to be opened, for she has power of opening or closing it by the
assistance of some very strong muscles.

The flesh of the old animals is very good, like that of a sucking pig: the
hair is eyed by the Indian women and wove into garters and girdles: the skin is
very foetid.

This genus is not confined to America, as M. de Buffon supposes; who combats
the opinion of other naturalists on this subject with much warmth: but the
authority of Piso, Valentyn, and of Le Brun En Indiis orientalibus, idque
solum, quantum hactenus constat. Amboina, similis Bestia (Carigueya) frequens
ad' selis magnitudi^^^ accidens, mactata ab incolis comeditur, si rite
preparetur, nam alias (...) nomen illi Cous cous inditum. Piso Brasil, 323. Le
Brun, in his voyag^ to the East Indies, describes it under the name of
Filander, I. 347* tab. 213.
, who have seen it both in Java and in the M^llucca isles, and of numbers of
collectors in Holland, who receive it frequently from those places, are
sufficient to satisfy me, that a species of the genus, perhaps only a variety
of the kind just described, inhabits the Indian isles, as well as the continent
of America.

O. with long broad ears rounded at the end, thin and naked: eyes encompassed
with black: face, head, and upper part of the body, of a tawny color: the belly
yellowish white: the feet covered with short whitish hair: toes formed like
those of the preceding: tail slender, covered with minute scales to the very
rump: length, from nose to tail, about six inches and a half; tail of the same
length: the female wants the false belly of the former; but, on the lower part,
the skin forms on each side a fold, between which the teats are lodged.

This species varies in color: I have seen one from Guiana, brown above, white
beneath.

Inhabits the hot parts of South America: agrees with the others in its food,
manners, and the prehensile powers of its tail: it brings from ten to fourteen
young at a time; at lest, in some species, there are that number of teats: the
young affix themselves to the teats as soon as they are born, and remain
attached, like so many inanimate things, 'till they attain growth and vigor to
shift a little for themselves.

about seven inches and a half; of the tail, more than eleven.

Inhabits the mountains of Mexico: lives in trees, where it brings forth its
young: when in any fright, they embrace their parent closely: the tail is
prehensile, and serves instead of a hand.

retreat, about two y^rds in length, generally terminating under the roots of
some large tree; sometimes forms its lodge under hay-ricks, and in barns:
brings five or six young at a time: preys on poultry, game, and rabbets: in
winter frequents houses, and will rob the dairy of the milk. This animal is
excessively foetid; yet the skin is dressed with the hair on, and used as other
furs, for tippets, etc. and is also sent abroad to line clothes.

Inhabits Siberia, Kamtschatka, and some of the Kurilski isles, which lie
between Kamtschatka, and Japan: a few are also found in Lapland Scheffer Lapl.

.

Sables live in holes in the earth, or beneath the roots of trees: sometimes,
like the martin, form nests in the trees, and will skip with great agility from
one to the other: are very lively, and much in motion during night: sleep much
in the day: one that was kept tame, would, on sight of a cat, sit up on its
hind legs: excrements most excessively foetid: prey, during summer, on ermines,
weesels, and squirrels, but above all on hares; in winter, on birds; in autumn,
on hurtleberries, cranberries, and the berries of the service tree: but during
that season their skins are at the worst, that diet causing them to itch, and
to rub off their fur against the trees: they bring forth at the end of March,
or beginning of April, and have from three to five at a time, which they suckle
for four or five weeks Hist, Kamtschatka, 109, etc.
.

Their chase was, in the more barbarous times of the Russian empire, the
employ, or rather the tasks of the unhappy exiles into Siberia: as that country
is now become more populous, the sables have in great measure quitted it, and
retired farther North and East, to live in desert forests, and mountains; they
live near the banks of rivers, or in the little islands in them Av^il's
Travels, 140.
: on this account they have, by some, been supposed to be the (...), of
Aristotle, Hist. An. lib. viii. c. 5; which he classes with the animals
conversant among waters.

At present the hunters of sables form themselves into troops, from 5 to 40
each; the last subdivide into lesser parties, and each chooses a leader, but
there is one that directs the whole: a small covered boat is provided for each
party, laden with provision, a dog and net for every two men, and a vessel to
bake their bread in: each party also has an interpreter for the country they
penetrate into: every party then sets out according to the course their chief
points out. they go against the stream of the rivers, drawing their boats up,
till they arrive in the hunting country; there they stop, build huts, and wait
till the waters are frozen, and the season commences: before they begin the
chase, their leader (...) them, they unite in a prayer to the Almighty (...)
success, and then separate: the first sable they take is called GOD's sable,
and is dedicated to the church.

They then penetrate into the woods, mark the trees as they advance, that they
may know their way back; and in their hunting quarters, form huts of trees, and
bank up the snow round them: near these they lay their traps, then advance
farther, and lay more traps, still building new huts in every quarter, and
return successively to every old one, to visit the traps, and take out the game
to skin it, which none but the chief of the party must do: during this time
they are supplied with provisions by persons who are employed to bring it on
sledges, from the places on the road, where they are obliged to form magazines,
by reason of the impracticability of bringing quantities through the rough
country they must pass. The traps are a sort of pitfall, with a loose board
placed over it, baited with f^^h or flesh: when sables grow scarce, the hunt^rs
trace them in the new fallen snow, to their holes, place their nets at the
entrance, and sometimes wait, watching two or three days for the com^^g out of
the animal: it has happened that these poor people have, by the failure of
their provisions, been so pinched with hunger, that, to prevent the cravings of
appetite, they have been reduced to t^ke two thin boards, one of which they
apply to the pit of the stomach, the other to the back drawing them tight
together by cords placed at the ends B^ll's Travels, I. 245.
: such are the hardships our fellow creature^ undergo, to supply the wantoness
of luxury.

The season of chase being finished, the hunters re-assemble, make a report to
their leader of the number of sables each has taken; make complaints of
offenders against their regulations; punish delinquents; share the booty; then
continue at the head quarters 'till the rivers are clear of ice; return home,
and give to every church the dedicated furs.

COMMERCIAL HISTORY.
The following is the commercial history of this fur trade, which Mr. J. R.
Forster was so obliging as to translate for me, from Muller's Samlung Russ.
Geschichte III, 495 to 515, being an abstract from above 20 pages.

"SABLE, SOBOL in Russian; ZOBEL in German: their price varies, from 1 l. to 10
l. sterling, and above: fine and middling sable skins are without bellies, and
the coarse ones are with them: forty skins make a collection calle^ Zimmer: the
finest sables are sold in pairs, perfectly similar, and are dearer than single
ones of the same goodness; for the Russians want those in pairs for facing
caps, cloaks, tippets, etc. the blackest are reputed the best. Sables are in
season from November to February; for those caught at any other time of the
year are short hair'd, and then called Nedosobo^^: the hair of sables differs
in length and quality: the long hairs, which reach far beyond the inferior
ones, are called Os; the more a skin has of such long hairs, the blacker they
are, and the more valuable is the fur; the very best have no other but those
long and black hairs: Motchka is a technical term in the Russian fur trade,
expressing the lower part of the long hairs; and sometimes it comprehends
likewise the lower and shorter hairs: the above mentioned best sable furs are
said to have a black Motchka: below the long hairs are, in the greater parts of
sable furs, some shorter hairs, called Podosie, i. e. Under-Os: the more
Podosie a fur has, the less valuable: in the better kind of sables the Podosie
has black tips, and a gray or rusty Motchka: the first kind of Motchka makes
the middling kind of sablo furs; the red one the worst, especially if it has
but few Os: between the Os and Podosie is a low wooly kind of hair, called
Podsada; the more Podsada a fur has, the less valuable, for the long hair will,
in such case, take no other direction than the natural one; for the character
of sables is, that notwithstanding the hair naturally lies from the head
toward the tail, yet will lie equally in any direction, as you strike your
hand over it: the various combinations of these characters, in regard to Os,
Motchka, Podosie, and Podsada, make many special divisions of the goodness of
furs: besides this, the furriers attend to the size, preserving always caeteris
paribus the biggest, and those that have the greatest gloss: the size depends
upon the animal being a male or female, the latter being always smaller: the
gloss vanishes in old furs: the fresh ones have a kind of bloomy appearance, as
they express it; the old ones are said to have done blooming: the died sables
always lose their gloss, become less uniform, whether the lower hairs have
taken the dye or not, and commonly the hairs are somewhat twisted or crisped,
and not so strait as in the natural ones: some fumigate the skins, to make them
look blacker, but the smell, and the crisped condition of the long hair,
betrays the cheat; and both ways are detected, by rubbing the fur with a moist
linen cloth, which grows black in such cases."

"The Chinese have a way of dying the sables, so that the color not only
lasts, (which the Russian cheats cannot do) but the fur keeps its gloss, and
the crisped hairs only discover it: this is the reason that all the sables,
which are of the best kind, either in pairs or separate, are carried to Russia;
the rest go to China: the very best sables come from the environs of Nertchitsk
and Yakutsk; and in this latter district, the country about the river Ud
affords sometimes sables, of whom one single fur is often sold at the rate of
60 or 70 rubles, 12 or 14 l. The bellies of sables, which are sold in pairs,
are about two fingers breadth, and are tied together by forty pieces, which are
sold from 1 to 2 l. sterling: tails are sold by the hundred; the very best
sable furs must have their tails, but ordinary sables are often cropped, and a
hundred sold from 4 to 8 l. sterling: the legs or feet of sables are seldom
sold separately: white sables are rare, and no common merchandise, but bought
only as curiosities: some are yellowish, and are bleached in the spring on the
snow."

Inhabits N. America: notwithstanding its name, is not amphibious: preys on all
sorts of lesser quadrupeds By a letter from Mr. Peter Collinson, who received
the account from Ba tram, of P^nsylvania.
: by the number of skins imported, is not an uncommon animal; not less than 580
being brought in one season from New York and Pensylvania: seems to be the
animal, called by Josselyn Josselyn's voy. 87.
, the SABLE; which, he says, is perfectly black. I have seen many of the skins,
which vary in color: yet, from the agreement in form and colors in general with
the true SABLE, I cannot help thinking them the same animal. Such numbers of
quadrupeds are found common to the N. of Europe, or of Asia and o^ America Viz.

W. with bright flame-colored eyes: small rounded ears, almost naked: nose long
and slender: body thicker than that of others of this genus: tail very thick at
the base, tapering to a point: legs short: the hair is hard and coarse: color
various in different animals, from different countries; in some, alternately
barred with dull yellowish brown and white; in others, pale brown and
mouse-colored; so that the animal appears mottled: throat and belly of a
uniform brown: beneath the tail is an orifice not unlike that of a badger:
differs in size: from twenty-four to forty-two inches in length, from the tip
of the nose to the end of the tail: the specimen in the Ashmolean Museum was
thirteen inches and a half long to the origin of the tail; the tail eleven: the
Egyptian variety is the largest.

Inhabits Egypt, Barbary, India, and its islands: a most useful animal; being
an inveterate enemy to the serpents and other noxious reptiles which infest the
torrid zone: attacks without dread that most fatal of serpents the Naja, or
Cobra di Capello; and should it receive a wound in the combat, instantly
retires; and is said to obtain A fact, as yet, not well established: Botanists
are not yet agreed about the species of this sanative plant, whose use, it is
pretended, this weesel pointed out to mankind: those who have seen the combats
between the Ichneumon and Naia, never could discover it: Kaempfer, a writer of
the first authority, who visited India, and who had a tame Ichneumon, and been
witness to its battles with the serpent, says no more than that it retired and
eat the roots of any herb it met with. It is from the Indians he received the
account of the root, whose veracity he speaks most contemptuously of. Amaen.
Exot. 576. Rumphius never saw the plant growing; but describes it from a
specimen sent him from Java; for he says the Indians would persuade him, that
it had no leaves. Vide Herb. Am^^n App. 71. All that seems certain, is, that
the Indians have a plant, of whose alexipharmic virtues they have a high
opinion, and are said to use it with success against the dreadful macassar
poison, and the bite of serpents. Kaempfer says he had good success with one
species, in putrid fevers, and found it infallible for the bite of a mad dog.
As there is no doubt but a most useful plant of this nature ^oes exist in the
Indies, it is to be hoped that strict enquiry will be made after it. In order
to direct their searches, they are referred to Garcia ab Horto's Hist. Aromatum

an antedote from a certain herb, after which it returns to the attack, and
seldom fails of victory: is a great destroyer of the eggs of crocodiles, which
it digs out of the sand; and even kills multitudes of the young of those
terrible reptiles: it was not therefore without reason, that the ancient
Egyptians ranked the Ichneumon among their Deities: is at present do^
mesticated and kept in houses in India and i^ Egypt; for it is more useful
than a cat, in destroying rats and mice: grows very tame: is very active
springs with great agility on its prey; will glid^ along the ground like a
serpent, and seem as i^ without feet: sits up like a squirrel, and eats with
its fore feet: catches any thing that is flung to it: is a great enemy to
poultry: will feign itself dead, til^ they come within reach: loves fish: draws
its prey, after sucking the blood, to its hole: its excrements very faetid:
when it sleeps, brings its head and tail under its belly, appearing like a
round ball, with two legs sticking out. Rumphius observes how skilfully it
seizes the serpents by the throat, so as to avoid receiving any injury: and
Lucan beautifully describes the same address of this animal, in conquering the
Egyptian Asp.

breast: is carnivorous, and preys on the lesser creatures: very playfull:
drinks its own urine: when discontented, makes a noise like the barking of a

W. with a short slender nose: short ears and legs: black body, full of hair:
tail long, of a black and white color: length, from nose to tail, about
eighteen inches.

Inhabits Mexico, and perhaps other parts of America. This, and the four
following species, remarkable for the pestiferous, suffocating, and most foetid
vapor, they emit from behind, when attacked, pursued, or frightened: it is
their only means of defense: some turn Wood's voy. in Dampier, iv. 96. the rest
of the account is taken from Cateshy and Kalm.
their tail to their enemy, and keep them at a distance by a frequent crepitus;
and others ejaculate their urine, tainted with the horrid effluvia, to the
distance of eighteen feet: the pursuers are stopped with the terrible stench:
should any of this liquid fall into the eyes, it almost occasions blindness; if
on the clothes, the smell will remain for several days, in spite of all
washing; they must even be buried in fresh soil, in order to be sweetened. Dogs
that are not true bred, run back as soon as they perceive the smell; those that
have been used to it, will kill the animal; but are often obliged to relieve
themselves by thrusting their noses into the ground. There is no bearing the
company of a dog that has killed one, for several days.

Professor Kalm was one night in great danger of being suffocated by one that
was pursued into a house where he slept; and it affected the cattle so, that
they bellowed through pain. Another, which was killed by a maid servant in a
cellar, so affected her with its stench, that she lay ill for several days: all
the provisions that were in the place were so tainted, that the owner was
obliged to throw them away.

Notwithstanding this, the flesh is reckoned good meat, and not unlike that of
a pig: but it must be skinned as soon as killed, and the bladder taken
carefully out. The Virginian species is capable of being tamed, and will follow
its master like a dog: it never emits its vapor, except terrified.

It breeds in hollow trees, or holes under ground, or in clefts of rocks:
climbs trees with great agility: kills poultry; eats eggs, and destroys young
birds.

male; for his description does not agree with the Yzquiepatl, which he makes
synonymous.

: the famous drug musk, or civet, is produced from an overture between the
privities and the anus, in both sexes, secreted from certain glands. The
persons who keep them procure the musk by scraping the inside of this bag twice
a week with an iron spatula, and get about a dram each time; but it is seldom
sold pure, being generally mixed with suet or oil, to make it more weighty: the
males yield the most; especially when they are previously irritated: they are
fed, when young, with pap made of millet, with a little flesh or fish; when
old, with raw flesh: in a wild state prey on fowl.

Inhabits all parts of Europe, N. and N. E. of Asia, even as far as
Kamtschatka; abounds in North America, particularly in Canada, where the most
valuable furs of this kind are produced: dwells in the banks of rivers;
burrows, forming the entrance of its hole beneath the water; works upwards
toward the surface of the earth, and makes a small orifice, or air hole, in
the midst of some bush: swims and dives with great ease; very destructive to
fish: if they fail, makes excursions on land, and preys on lambs and poultry:
sometimes breeds in sinks and drains; brings four or five young at a time:
hunts its prey against the stream; frequents not only fresh waters, but
sometimes preys in the sea; but not remote from shore: is a fierce animal; its
bite hard and dangerous: is capable of being tamed, to follow its master like a
dog, and even to fish for him, and return with its prey.

; possibly a large variety of otter Mr. Banks, on his return from Newfoundland,
was so obliging as to communicate to me the following account of some animals
seen by a gentleman who went on that voyage, which I take the liberty of
inserting here, as they bear some relation to the Otter in their way of life.
He observed, sitting on a rock, near the mouth of a river, five animals, shaped
like Italian grehounds, bigger than a fox, of a shining black color, with long
legs, and long taper tail. They often leaped into the water and brought up
trouts, which they gave to their young which were sitting with them. On his
appearing, they all took to the water, and swam a little way from shore, kept
their heads out of the water, and looked at him. An old Furrier said, that he
remembered the skin of one sold for five guineas; and that the French often see
them in Hare Bay.

O. with roundish ears: white chin: top of the head hoary; in some tawny: body
tawny and dusky; the short hairs being yellowish; the long hairs black: the
feet broad, webbed and covered with hair: tail dusky, and ends in a point: of
the form of an otter, but thrice as small.

Inhabits Poland, and the N. of Europe; and is found on the banks of all the
rivers in the country N. of the Yaik; lives on fish; frogs, and water insects:
its fur very valuable, next in beauty to that of the sable; caught in Bashkiria
with dogs and traps: is most excessively foetid.

The Minx of N. America is the same animal with this. The late worthy Mr. Peter
Collinson By letter dated June 14, 1764. Lawson also gives some account of it,
p. 122, hist. Carolina: He says it is a great enemy to the Tortoises, whose
eggs it scrapes out of the sand and devours: eats fresh water muscles, whose
shells are found in great abundance at the mouth of their holes, high up in the
rivers, in whose banks they live: may be made domestic: is a great destroyer of
rats and mice. La Hontan. I. 232. seems to mean the same animal, by his
Foutereaux, an amphibious sort of little Pole-cats.
favored me with the following account he received from John Bartram, of
Pensylvania: The Minx, (says he) frequents the water like the Otter, and very
much resembles it in shape and color, but is less; will abide longer under the
water than the musk quash, musk rat, or little beaver: yet it will leave its
watery haunts to come and rob our hen roosts; bites off their heads and sucks
their blood: when vexed it has a strong loathsome smell: so may be called the
water pole cat: its length, from nose to tail, twenty inches; the tail four: is
of a fine shining dark brown color.

From the conformity between the names this animal goes by, in America and
Sueden, (Minx and Maenk) it seems as if some Suedish colonist, who had seen it
in his own country, first bestowed the name it now goes by, a little changed
from the original: the skins are often brought over to England.

up hill than on even ground: when started, immediately endeavors to run up
hill: escapes the hounds by various artfull doubles: lies the whole day on its
seat: feeds by night: returns to its form by the same road that it had taken in
leaving it: does not pair: the rutting season is in February or March, when the
male pursues the female by the sagacity of its nose: breeds often in the year;
brings three or four at a time: are very subject to fleas: the Dalecarlians
make a cloth of the fur, which preserves the wearer from their attacks: the fur
is of great use in the hat manufacture: many thousands of the skins are for
that use annually imported here from Russia: feeds on vegetables: fond of the
bark of young trees: great lover of birch, parsley and pinks: was a forbidden
food among the Britons: the Romans, on the contrary, held it in great esteem.

Europe; but is less by a third: the legs are shorter in proportion; and the fur
has a tinge of cinereous: when pursued, takes refuge in a hollow tree:
frequents marshes and meadows: very destructive to the turnip and cabbage
fields.

: in great plenty in the North: a few are yet found in the Rhone Ibid.
, the Gardon, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Vistula: met with in abundance in
the Russian A^^^tic dominions; but no where in equal multi^^des, than in North
America.

The most industrious of animals: nothing equals the art with which they
construct their dwellings. They choose a level piece of ground with a small
riv^let running through it. This they form into a ^^nd, by making a dam across;
first, by driving into the ground stakes five or six feet long, placed rows,
wattling each row with pliant twigs, and filling the interstices with clay,
ramming it down close The side next the water is sloped; the other
perpendicular. The bottom is from ten to twelve fee^ thick; but the thickness
gradually diminishes to the top, which is about two or three. The length o^
these dams is sometimes not less than a hundred feet*

Their houses are made in the water collected by means of the dam, and are
placed near the edge of the shore. They are built on piles; are either round or
oval; but the tops are vaulted; so that their inside resembles an oven, the top
a dome. The walls are two feet thick; made of earth, stones and sticks, most
artificially laid together; and the walls within as neatly plaistered as if
with a trowel. In each house are two openings; one into the water, the other
toward the land. The height of these houses above the water is eight feet.
They often make two or three stories in each dwelling, for the convenience of
change, in case of floods. Each house contains from two to thirty beavers; and
the number of houses in each pond is from ten to twenty-five. Each beaver forms
its bed of moss; and each family forms its magazine of winter provision, which
consists of bark and boughs of trees. This they lodge under water, and fetch it
into their apartments as their wants require. Lawson says they are fondest of
the sassafras, ash, and sweet-gum. Their summer food is leaves, fruits, and
sometimes crabs and craw-fish; but they are not fond of fish.

To effect these works, a community of two or three hundred assembles; each
bears his share in the labor: some fall by gnawing with their teeth trees of
great size, to form beams or piles; others roll the pieces along to the water;
others dive, and with their feet scrape holes, in order to place them in; while
others exert their efforts to rear them in their proper places: another party
is employed in collecting twigs, to wattle the piles with; a third, in
collecting earth, stones and clay; a fourth is busied in beating and tempering
the mortar; others, in carrying it on their broad tails to proper places, and
with the same instrument ram it between the piles, or plaster the inside of
their houses. A certain number of smart strokes with their tail is a signal
given by the overfeer, for repairing to such or such places, either for mending
any defects, or at the approach of an enemy; and the whole society attend to it
with the utmost assiduity. Their time of building is early in the summer; for
in winter they never stir but to their magazines of provisions, and during that
season are very fat. They breed once a year, and bring forth, the latter end of
the winter, two or three young at a birth.

Besides these associated beavers, is another sort, which are called Terriers;
which either want industry or sagacity to form houses like the others. (...)
burrow in the banks of rivers, making their (...) beneath the freezing depth of
the water, and (...) up for a great number of feet. These also (...) their
winter stock of provision.

Beavers vary in their colors: the finest are black; (...) the general color is
a chestnut brown; more or less dark: some have been found, but very rarely,
white. The skins are a prodigious article of trade; being the foundation of the
hat manufactory. In 1763 were sold, in a single sale of the Hudson's Bay
Company, 54,670 skins. They are distinguished by different names. Coat Beaver
is what has been worn as coverlets by the Indians. Parchment Beaver, because
the lower side resembles it. Stage Beaver is the worst, and is that which the
Indians kill out of season, on their stages or journies. The valuable drug
Castoreum The Russian Castoreum is so much better than the American, that we
give two guineas a pound for that, and only 8s. 6d. for the last* the first
being less waxy and pulverises readier. Notwithstanding we take this drug from
Russia, we export there vast numbers of Beaver skins. The flesh is reckoned
good eating, being preserved, after the bones are taken out, by drying it in
the smoke. M. S. hist. Hudson's Bay.
is taken from the inguinal glands of these animals. The ancients had a notion
it was lodged in the testicles, and that the animal, when hard pressed, would
bite them off, and leave them to its pursuers, as if conscious of what they
wanted to destroy him for.

small round aedifices, covered with a dome, formed of herbs and reeds cemented
with clay: at the bottom are several pipes, through which they pass in search of
food; for they do not form magazines like the beavers: during winter, their
habitations are covered many feet deep with snow and ice; but they creep out
and feed on the roots that lie beneath: they quit their old habitations
annually, and build new ones: the f^r is soft, and much esteemed: the whole
animal, during summer, has a most exquisite musky smell; which it loses in
winter: perhaps the scent is derived from the Calamus Aromaticus, a favorite
food of this animal. Lescarbot says they are very good to eat.

Inhabits Lapland, Russia, the banks of the rivers Volga and the Yaick: never
wanders far from the sides: is very slow in its pace: makes holes in the cliffs
with the entrance far beneath the lowest fall of the water; works upwards, but
never to the surface, only high enough to lie beyond the highest flow of the
river: feeds on fish: is devoured by the Pikes and Siluri, and gives those fish
so strong a flavor of musk, as to render them not eatable; has the same scent
as the former, especially about the tail; out of which is expressed a sort of
musk very much resembling the genuine kind Schober's Memorabilia Russ. Afiat.

small spines: top of the head, back, sides and base of the tail, covered with
spines; the longest on the lower part of the back and tail, are three inches in
length, very sharp, white, barred near their points with black; adhere closely
to the skin, which is quite naked between them; are shorter and weaker as they
approach the belly: on the breast, belly and lower part of the legs, are
converted into dark brown bristles: feet divided into four toes: claws very
long: on the place of the thumb a great protuberance: tail eighteen inches
long, slender and taper toward the end; the last ten inches is almost naked,
having only a few hairs on it; has, for that length, a strong prehensile
quality.

Inhabits Mexico and Brasil: lives in the woods: preys not only on fruits, but
poultry: sleeps in the day, preys by night: makes a noise with its nostrils I

: grows very fat: its flesh white, and very good: climbs trees, but very
slowly; in descending, twists its tail round the branches, for fear of falling:
is no more capable of shooting its quils than the first: may be tamed. Piso
says there is a greater and lesser kind.

This species is very rarely brought into Europe. I had opportunity of
describing it from a specimen some time in possession of Mr. Greenwood; who was
so obliging as to permit me to have a drawing made of it* from which a very
faithful figure is here given. M. de Buffon Under the name of Le Coendou, xii.
421. tab. live.
has made an article of this animal in his work; and M. Daubenton describes and
figures one so different from this, and so like that of North America, that it
seems to be the same with the species he describes under the name of L'Urson;
for he gives both of them four toes before, five behind, and neither of them a
tail half so long, and that covered with hairs and quils: each circumstance
agreeing with the following species; neither with this.

P. with short ears, hid in the fur: head, body, legs and upper part of the
tail, covered with soft, long, dark brown hair: on the upper part of the head,
back, body and tail, numbers of sharp strong quils; the longest on the back,
the lest toward the head and sides; the longest three inches; but all are hid
in the hair: intermixed, are some stiff straggling hairs, three inches longer
than the rest, tipped with dirty white: under side of the tail white: four toes
on the fore feet, five behind, each armed with long claws, hollowed on their
underside: the form o^ the body is exactly that of a beaver; but is not half
the size: one, which Mr. Banks brought from New-foundland, was about the size
of a hare, but more compactly made: the tail about six inches long.

Inhabits N. America, as high as Hudson's Bay: makes its nest under the roots
of great trees, and will also climb among the boughs, which the Indians cut
down when one is in them, and kill the animal by striking it over the nose: are
very plentiful near Hudson's Bay, and many of the trading Indians depend on
them for food, esteeming them both wholesome and pleasant: feed on wild fruits
and bark of trees, especially juniper: eat snow in w^nter, drink water in
summer* but avoid going into it: when they cannot avoid their pursuer, will
sidle toward him, in order to touch him with the quils, which seem but weak
weapons of offense; for, on stroking the hair, they will come out of the skin,
sticking to the hand. The Indians stick them in their noses and ears, to make
holes for the placing their earrings and other finery: they also trim the
edges of their deer-skins habits with fringes made of the quils, or cover with
them their bark-boxes.

much more red and of a brighter hue: four toes before, five behind: tail pretty
full of hair: length, from nose to tail, about sixteen inches; tail six: body
thick.

Inhabits the Alps, Poland, Ukraine, and Chinese Tartary: feeds on insects,
roots and vegetables: while they are at food place a sentinel, who gives a
whistle on seeing any sign of danger, on which they instantly retire into their
holes: form holes under ground with three chambers of the shape of a Y, with
two entrances; line them well with moss and hay; retire into them about
Michaelmas, and stopping up the entrances with earth, continue in a torpid
state till April: when taken out remain insensible, except brought before a
fire, which revives them: they lodge in society from five to a dozen in a
chamber: will walk on their hind feet: lift up their meat to their mouth with
their fore feet, and eat it sitting up: bring three or four young at a time:
are very playfull: when angry, or before a storm, make a most strange noise; a
whistle so loud and so acute, as quite to pierce the ear: grow very fat about
the backs: are sometimes eaten; but generally taken in order to be shown,
especially by the Savoyards: grow very soon tame, and will then eat any thing:
are very fond of milk, which they lap, making at the same time a murmuring
noise, expressive of their satisfaction: very apt to gnaw any clothes or linen
they find: will bite very hard.

The inhabitants of Ukraine take them in May and June, by pouring water into
the holes, which forces them into nets placed et the entrance.

In Chinese Tartary are the propagators of Rhubarb Bell's Travels, I. 337.
which grows among their burrows: the manure they leave about the roots
contributes to its increase; and the loose soil they fling up, proves a bed for
the ripe seed; which, if scattered among the long grass, perishes without ever
being able to reach the ground.

fore feet; five behind: about nine inches long; tail three.

Inhabits Austria, Silesia, and many parts of Germany, Poland, and Ukraine:
very destructive to corn; eating great quantities, and carrying still more to
its winter's hoard: within its cheeks are two pouches, receptacles for its
booty, which it fills till the cheeks seem ready to burst: they live under
ground; first form an entrance, burrowing down obliquely: at the end of that
passage the male sinks one perpendicular hole; the female several: at the end
of these are formed various vaults, either as lodges for themselves and young,
or storehouses for their winter food; each young has its different apartment;
each sort of grain its different vault; the first they line with straw or
grass: these vaults are of different depths, according to the age of the
animal; a young Hamster makes them scarce a foot deep; an old one sinks them to
the depth of four or five; and the whole diameter of the habitation, with all
its communications, is sometimes eight or ten feet.

They begin to lay in their provisions in August; and will carry grains of
corn, corn in the ear, and peace and beans in the pods, which they clean in
their holes, and carry the husks carefully out: the pouches abovementioned are
so capacious as to hold a quarter of a pint English. As soon as they have
finished their work, they stop up the mouth of their passage carefully. In
winter, the peasants go what they call a Hamster-nesting; and when they
discover the re-retreat, dig down till they discover the hoard, and are
commonly well paid; for, besides the skin of the animals, which are valuable
furs, they find commonly two bushels of good grain in the magazine. These
animals are very fierce; will jump at a horse that happens to tread near them,
and hang by its nose so that it is difficult to disengage them: they make a
noise like the barking of a dog: breed twice or thrice a year, and bring five
or six at a time: in some seasons, are so numerous as to occasion a dearth of
corn. Pole-cats are their greatest enemies; for they pursue them into their
holes and destroy numbers. It is remarkable, that the hair sticks so close to
the skin, as not to be plucked off without the utmost difficu^ty Great part of
their history is taken from the account given by (...) to M. de Buffon.

Appear in numberless troops at very uncertain periods in Norway, and Lapland:

before them, and spread universal desolation: they infect the very ground, and
cattle are said to perish which taste of the grass which they have touched:
they march by myriads, in regular lines: nothing stops their progress, neither
fire, torrents, lake or morass; they bend their course strait forward, with
most amazing obstinacy; they swim over the lakes; the greatest rock gives them
but a slight check, they go round it, and then resume their march directly on,
without the lest deviation: if they meet a peasant, they persist in their
course, and jump as high as his knees in defense of their progress: are so
fierce as to lay hold of a stick, and suffer themselves to be swung about
before they quit their hold: if struck, they turn about and bite, and will make
a noise like a dog: are the prey of foxes, lynxes, and ermines, who follow them
in great numbers: at length they perish, either through want of food, or by
destroying one another, or in some great water, or in the sea: they are the
dread of the country: in former times spiritual weapons were exerted against
them, the priest exorcised, and had a long form of prayer to avert the evil

believed, that these animals were generated in the clouds, and fell in showers
upon the ground: Per tempestates et repentinos imbres e caelo decidant,

nubibus faeculentis natae deferantur. Ol^i Magni de Gent. Septentr. 358.
: happily it does not occur frequently, once or twice in twenty years: it seems
like a vast colony of emigrants, from a nation over-stocked; a discharge of
animals from the great Northern hive, that once poured out its myriads of human
creatures upon Southern Europe. Where the head quarters of these quadrupeds
are, is not very certainly known: Linnaeus says, the Norwegian and Lapland
Alps; Pontoppidan seems to think, that Kolens rock, which divides Nordland from
Sueden, is their native place; but wherever they come from, none return. their
course is praedestinated, and they pursue their fate.

of corn, nuts, etc. for its winter food: sits up like a squirrel when it eats.
By Gmelin's account, some inhabit the fields in Siberia, others penetrate into
the grainaries; the first form holes under ground with a double entrance, and
sleep during winter in the center of their lodge: those which inhabit the
grainaries, are in motion during the whole cold season; they couple the
beginning of May, and bring from five to eight young, which they bring up in
their burrows and cover with hay: whistle like the marmot: are very irascible,

with milk-white tails.

Inhabits Europe and North America, the northern and the temperate parts of
Asia; and a variety is even found as far south as the Isle of Ceylon: is a
neat, lively, active animal: lives always in woods: in the spring, the female
is seen pursued from tree to tree by the males, feigning an escape from their
embraces: makes its nest: of moss and dried leaves, between the fork of two
branches: brings three or four young at a time: has two holes to its nest:
stops up that on the side the wind blows, as Pliny lib. viii. c. 38.
justly remarks: lays in a hoard of winter provision, such as nuts, acorns,
etc. in summer, feeds on buds and young shoots: is particularly fond of those
of fir, and the young cones: sits up to eat, and uses its fore-feet as hands:
covers itself with its tail: leaps to a surprising distance: when disposed to
cross a river, a piece of bark is its boat; its tail the sail Rzaczinski,

about the upper par^s of the river Obi, in the district of Kuznetsk, and is
called T^le^t^cy^ belia, or the squirrel of the Tele^tian Tartars: it is as

; are very numerous in N. America, do incredible damage to the plantations of
Mayz, run up the stalks, and eat the young ears; descend in vast flocks from
the mountains, and join those that inhabit the lower parts; are proscribed by
the provinces, and a reward of three pe^ce per head for every one that is
killed; such a number was destroyed one year, that Pensylvania alone paid in
rewards 8000 l. of its currency.

Make their nests in hollow trees with moss, straw, wool, etc. Feed on the mayz
in the season, and and on pine cones, acorns, and mast of all kinds. Form holes
under ground, and there deposit a large stock of winter provision. Descend from
the trees and visit their magazines when in want of meat; are particularly busy
at the approach of bad weather; during the cold season keep in their nests for
several days together; seldom leap from tree to tree, only (...) up and down
the bodies; their hoards often destroyed by swine; when covered with deep snow,
the squirrels often perish for want of food; are not easily shot, nimbly
changing their place, when they see the gun levelled; have the actions of the
common squirrel; easily tamed; their flesh esteemed very delicate. The furs
which are imported under the name of petit-gris are valuable, and used as
linings to cloaks.

body and tail, of a reddish brown; the tail the darkest: breast and belly
white: nose and feet pale red: eyes full.

Inhabits the North of Asia; but found in the greatest abundance in the forests
of North America: they never run up trees except pursued, and find no other
means of escaping: they burrow, and form their habitations under ground with
two entrances, that they may get access to the one, in case the other is
stopped up. Their retreats are formed with great skill, in form of a long
gallery, with branches on each side, each of which terminates in an enlarged
chamber, as a magazine to store their winter provision in; in one they lodge
the acorns, in another the mayz, in a third the hickery nuts, and in the last,
their favorite food the chinquapin chestnut. They very seldom stir out during
winter, at lest as long as their provisions last; but if that fails, they will
dig into cellars where apples are kept, or barns where mayz is stored, and do a
great deal of mischief; but at that time the cat destroys great numbers, and is
as great an enemy to them as to mice.

During the mayz harvest, these squirrels are very busy in biting off the ears,
and filling their mouths so full with the corn, that their cheeks are quite
distended. It is observable, that they give great preference to certain food;
for if, after filling their mouths with rye, they happen to meet with wheat,
they fling away the first, that they may indulge in the last. They are very
wild, bite severely, and are scarcely ever tamed: the skins are of little use;
but are sometimes brought over to line cloaks.

Inhabits Finland, Lapland, Poland, Russia, North America, and New Spain Where
it is called Quimichpatlan. Fernandez. Nov. Hisp. 8.
: lives in hollow trees: ^^eeps in the day: during the night very lively: is
gregarious, numbers being found in one tree: leaps from bough to bough
sometimes at the distance of t^n yards: this action improperly called flying,
for the animal cannot go in any other direction than forward; and even then
cannot keep an even line, but sinks considerably before it can reach the place
it aims at: sensible of this, the squirrel mounts the higher, in proportion to
the distance it wishes to reach: when it would leap it stretches out the
forelegs, and extending the membranes, becomes specifically lighter than it
would otherwise be; and thus is enabled to spring further than other squirrels
that have not this apparatus. When numbers leap at a time, they seem like
leaves blown off by the wind. Their food the same as the other American
squirrels: are easily tamed: bring three or four young at a time.

fore feet performing the office of hands: runs fast; and when pursued, jumps
five or six feet from the ground: burrows like rabbets: keeps close in the day,
lively during night: feeds on vegetables: has great strength in its fore feet.

where it is called Alagtaga: like the former, very active: digs holes in the
ground with vast agility with its fore feet: tears the roots with its teeth,
and flings back the earth with its hind feet; if pursued, and finds it cannot
escape by leaping, attempts to make a new hole: the burrows, in some places, so
thick, as to be dangerous to travelers, the horses perpetually falling in
them: provides against winter: cuts grass, and leaves it in heaps a foot square
to dry, and afterward carries it into the burrow.

from nose to tail, seven inches; tail near eight.

Inhabits most parts of Europe of late, the numbers much lessened, and in many
places extirpated by the next species: very destructive to corn, furniture,
young poultry, rabbets and pigeons: will gnaw the extremities of infants when
asleep: breeds often in a year: brings six or seven young at a time: makes its
nest, in a hole near a chimney, of wool, bits of cloth, or straw: will destroy
and devour one another: its greatest enemy is the weesel. First introduced into
America by the Europeans; into S. America Garcilasso de la Vega, 384.

flesh-color: fore feet furnished with four toes, and a claw instead of the
fifth: length, from nose to tail, nine inches; tail the same: weight eleven
ounces: is stronger made than the last.

Inhabits most parts of Europe; but was a stranger to that continent 'till the
present century: came into Great Britain about forty years ago: not known in
the neighborhood of Paris half that time. The same animal with what is called
in the East Indies a Bandicote, a large rat, which burrows under ground; so
probably the species was brought from thence in some of the Indian ships This
may be the species found in Guinea, called by Barbot, 214, Field Rats; which,
he says, are as big at cats. Bosman calls them wild rats. Barbot also mentions
another, as long, but slender^^ than the former; which the Negroes cat, and
call Boul^^^, which do great damage to their corn.
^ has reached Prussia, but not the opposite side of the Baltic; for Linnaeus
takes no notice of it.

Burrows like the water rat on the sides of ponds and ditches: swims well, and
dives readily: lives on grain and fruits, and will destroy rabbets, poultry and
game: increases fast; brings from fourteen to eighteen young at a time: is very
bold and fierce; will turn when close pursued, and fasten on the stick or hand
of those who offer to strike it: has destroyed the common black rat in most
places.

us with. Linnaeus places this and our radiated mole in his class of SOREX, or
SHREW, on account of the difference of the teeth; but as these animals possess
the stronger characters of the MOLE, such as form of nose and body, shape of
feet, and even the manners, we think them better adapted to this genus than to

Inhabits most parts of the eastern side of South America: the most sluggish
and most slow of all animals; seems to move with the utmost pain; makes a great
progress if it can go a quarter of a league in a day Gumilla Orenoque, II. 13.
: ascends trees, in which it generally lives, with much difficulty: its food is
fruit, or the leaves of trees; if it cannot find fruit on the ground, looks out
for a tree well loaded, and with great pains climbs up: to save the trouble of
descending, flings off the fruit, and forming itself into a ball, drops from
the branches; continues at the foot till it has devoured all; nor ever stirs,
till compelled by hunger Ulloa's voy. I. 103.
: its motion is attended with a most moving and plaintive cry, which at once
produces pity and disgust; is its only defense; for every beast of prey is so
affected by the noise, as to quit it with horror Ibid.
: its note, according to Kircher, is an ascending and descending hexachord
Kircher's Musurgia, as quoted by Mr. Stilling fleet, in his miscellaneous
tracts, p. 100.
, which it utters only by night: its look is so piteous as to move compassion;
it is also accompanied with tears, that dissuade every body from injuring so
wretched a being: its abstinence from food is remarkably powerful; one that
had fastened itself by its feet to a pole, and was so suspended cross two
beams, remained forty days without meat, drink or sleep Kircher.
: the strength in its feet is so great, that whatsoever it seizes on cannot
possibly be freed from its claws. A dog was let loose at the abovementioned
animal, when it was taken from the pole; after some time the Sloth laid hold
of the dog with its feet, and held him four days, till he perished with hunger

red above, cinereous below; in others, of a yellowish white below, cinereous
brown above. Length of that in the British Museum eleven inches: I believe a
young one; no tail.

Inhabits S. America and the isle of Ceylon. The last is strenuously denied by
M. de Buffon, who has fixed the residence of this genus to America only: but,
besides the authority of Seba, who expressly says his specimen was brought from
Ceylon, a gentleman, long resident in India, and much distinguished in the
literary world, has informed me he has seen this animal brought from the
Paliacat mountains that lie in sight of Madrass; which satisfies me that it is
common to both continents.

There is reason to think that it is met with also in Guinea, or at le^t some
species of this genus; for Barbot and Bosman describe an animal by the name of
Potto, to which they give the attributes of the former, and describe as being
gray when young, red, and covered with a sort of hair as thick set as flocks of
wool. Both these writers were sensible men, and though not naturalists, were too
observant of the animals of Guinea to mistake one whose characters are so
strongly marked as those of the Sloth Bosman, 237. Barbot, 212.

A. with short but broad rounded ears: the crust on the head, back and rump,

The whole genus inhabits S. America: the manners of all much the same: burrows
under ground; the smaller species in moist places, the larger in dry, and at a
distance from the sea; keeps in its hole in the day, rambles out at night; when
overtaken, rolls itself into the form of a ball, which it does by means of the
pliant bands on its middle, and thus becomes invulnerable; when surprised, runs
to its hole, and thinks itself secure if it can hide its head and some part of
its body. The Indians take it by the tail, when the animal fixes its claws in
the earth so strongly that there is no moving it till the Indian tickles it
with a stick: is hunted with little dogs, who give notice to their master of
its haunts by barking, who digs it out; to take it out incautiously is very
dangerous, on account of the snakes that commonly lurk in the burrows: feeds on
potatoes, melons and roots, and does great damage to plantations: drinks much:
grows very fat, and is reckoned very delicious eating when young; but when old,
has a musky disagreeable taste: is very numerous, breeds every month, and
brings four at a time: is very inoffensive The authorities for the natural

woods and marshy places: feeds on ants, which it takes by laying its long
tongue cross their paths, that member being covered with a sticky saliva, so
the insects that attempt to pass over it cannot extricate themselves: walks
very slowly: would be the prey of every ravenous beast, had it not the power of
rolling itself up, and opposing to its adversary a formidable row of erected
scales. In vain does the Leopard attack it with its vast claws, for at last it

marked above the feet with a black spot: the tail is clothed with very coarse
black hairs a foot long: length, from nose to tail, about three feet ten
inches; the tail two and a half.

Inhabits Brasil and Guiana: runs slowly: lives on ants; as soon as it
discovers their nests, overturns them, or digs them up with its feet; then
thrusts its long tongue into their retreats, and penetrating all the passages
of the nest, withdraws it into its mouth loaded with prey: is fearful of rain,
and protects itself against wet by covering its body with its long tail. The
flesh has a strong disagreeable taste, but is eaten by the Indians.
Notwithstanding this animal wants teeth, it is fierce and dangerous; nothing
that gets within its fore feet can disengage itself. The very Panthers of
America Gumilla Orenoque, III. 232.
are often unequal in the combat; for if the Ant-eater once has opportunity of
embracing them, it fixes its talons in their sides, and both fall together, and
both perish; for such is the obstinacy and stupidity of this animal, that it
will not extricate itself even from a dead adversary Piso Brasil, 320.

There is a fourth species found at the Cape of Good Hope and in Ceylon; but
being described from a mere faetus Pallas Miscel. Zool. 64.

feet and pendulous ears, which distinguishes it from other kinds. Kolben Hist.

describes their manners particularly, and says they have long heads and
tongues, and are toothless; and that they sometimes weigh 100 lb. As quoted by
Dr. Pallas; I suppose from the Dutch edition.
That if they fasten their claws in the ground, the strongest man cannot pull
them away: that they thrust out their clammy tongue into the ants nest, and
draw it into their mouth covered with insects. Mr. Strachan, in his account of
Ceylon Phil. Trans. abridg. V. 180.

is not therefore to be doubted, but that these animals are common to the old

: are very fierce; if wounded in the water, they attempt to sink the boat,
either by rising under it, or by striking their great teeth into the sides;
roar very loud, and will follow the boat till i^ gets out of sight: numbers of
them are often see^ sleeping on an island of ice; if awoke, fling themselves
with great impetuosity into the sea; a^ which time it is dangerous to approach
the ice, least they should tumble into the boat and overset it: d^ not go upon
the land till the coast is clear of ice* At particular times, they land in
amazing numbers the moment the first gets on shore, so as to lie dry it will
not stir till another comes and forces it forward by beating it with its great
teeth; this is served in the same manner by the next, and so i^ succession till
the whole is landed, continuing tumbling over one another, and forcing the
foremost for the sake of quiet, to remove further up. The method of killing
them on the Magdalene isles, in the gulf of St. Laurence, as I am informed, is
thus: CHASE.
The Hunters watch their landing, and as soon as they find a sufficient number
for what they call a cut, go on shore, each armed with a spear sharp on one
side like a knife, with which they cut their throats: great care must be taken
not to stand in the way of those which attempt to get again to sea, which they
do with great agility by tumbling headlong; for they would crush any body to
death by their vast weight. They are killed for the sake of their oil, one
Walrus producing about half a tun. The knowledge of this chase is of great
antiquity; Octher, the Norwegian, about the year 890, made a report of it to
King Alfred, having, as he says, made the voyage beyond Norway, for the more
commodity of fishing of horse-whales, which have in their teeth ^^nes of great
price and excellency, whereof he brought some at his return unto the King
Ha^^ayt's coll. Voy. I. 5.
. In fact, it was, in the northern world, in early times, the substitute to
ivory, being very white and very hard. Their skins, Octher says, were good to
cut into cables. I do not know whether we make any uses of the skin; but M. de
Buffon says, he has seen braces for coaches made of it, which were both strong
and elastic.

They bring one, or at most two young Barentz voy. 4.
at a time: feed on sea herbs and fish; also on shells, which they dig out of
the sand with their teeth: are (...) also to make use of their teeth to ascend
rocks (...) pieces of ice, fastening them to the cracks, and drawing their
bodies up by that means. Besides mankind, they seem to have no other enemy than
the white Bear, with whom they have terrible combats; but generally come off
victorious, by means of their great teeth.

There are three marine animals, which keep a particular situation, and seem
divided between the N. E. of Asia, and N. W. of America, in the narrow seas
between those vast continents. These are what are called the Sea Lion and Sea
Bear, and the Manati The Sea ^ear seems a local animal: the Sea Lion is not
seen again nearer than the isle of Juan Fernandez, 233 degrees. 40 min. south of
the ^quator, and the Manati is quite unknown in every other part of the Pacific
Ocean.
. They inhabit, from June to September, the isles that are scattered in the
seas between Kamtschatka and America, in order to copulate, and bring forth
their young in full security. The accurate and indefatigable naturalist Steller
was the first who gave an exact description of them; he and his companions, in
the Russian expedition of 1742, were in all probability the first Europeans who
gave them any disturbance in those their retreats. In September, these animals
quit their stations, vastly emaciated; some return to the Asiatic, others to
the American shores; but like the Sea Otters, are confined in those seas
between lat. 50 and 56.

The Ursine Seal, a name we substitute for the Sea Bear, leads, during the
three months in summer, a most indolent life: it arrives at the islands vastly
fat; but during that time they are scarce ever in motion, confine themselves
for whole weeks to one spot, sleep a great part of the time, eat nothing, and,
except the employment the females have in suckling their young, are totally
inactive: they live in families; each male has from eight to fifty females,
whom he guards with the jealousy of an eastern monarch; and though they lie by
thousands on the shores, each family keeps itself separate from the rest, and
sometimes, with the young and unmarried ones, amount to a hundred and twenty.
The old animals, which are destitute of females, or deserted by them, live
apart, and are excessively splenetic, peevish and quarrelsome: are excessively
fierce, and so attached to their old haunts, that they would die sooner than
quit them. They are monstrously fat, and have a most hircine smell. If another
approaches their station, they are rouzed from their indolence and instantly
snap at it, and a battle ensues; in the conflict, they perhaps intrude on the
seat of another: this gives new cause of offense, so in the end the discord
becomes universal, and is spread through the whole shore.

The other males are also very irascible: the causes of their disputes are
generally these. The first and the most terrible is, when an attempt is made by
another to seduce one of their mistresses, or a young female of the family.
This insult produces a combat, and the conqueror is immediately followed by the
whole seraglio, who are sure of deserting the unhappy vanquished. The second
reason of a quarrel is, when one invades the seat of another: the third arises
from their interfering in the disputes of others. These battles are very
violent; the wounds they receive are very deep, and resemble the cuts of a
sabre. At the end of a fight they fling themselves into the sea, to wash away
the blood.

The males are very fond of their young; but very tyrannical toward the
females: if any body attempts to take their cub, the male stands on the
defensive, while the female makes off with the young in her mouth; should she
drop it, the former instantly quits his enemy, falls on her, and beats her
against the stones, till he leaves her for dead. As soon as she recovers, she
comes in the most suppliant manner to the male, crawls to his feet, and washes
them with her tears: he, in the mean time, stalks about in the most insulting
manner; but in case the young one is carried off, he melts into the deepest
affliction, and shows all signs of deep concern. It is probable that he feels
his misfortune the more sensisibly, as the female generally brings but one at a
time; never more than two.

They swim very swiftly, at the rate of seven miles an hour. If wounded, will
seize on the boat, and carry it along with vast impetuosity, and oftentimes
fink it. They can continue a long time under water. When they want to climb the
rocks they fasten with the fore paws, and so draw themselves up. They are very
tenacious of life, and will live for a fortnight after receiving such wounds as
would immediately destroy any other animal.

DESCR.
The male of this species is vastly superior in size to the female. The bodies
of each are of a conic form, very thick before, and taper to the tail. The
length of a large one is eight feet; the greatest circumference five feet; near
the tail, twenty inches. The weight 800 lb. The nose projects like that of a
pug dog, but the head rises suddenly: nostrils oval, and divided by a septum:
the lips thick; their inside red and serrated: whiskers long and white.

The teeth lock into each other when the mouth is closed: in the upper jaw are
four cutting teeth, each bifurcated; on both sides is a small sharp canine
tooth bending inwards; near that another, larger: the grinders resemble canine
teeth, and are six in number in each jaw: in the lower jaw are also four
cutting teeth and two canine: but only four grinders in each jaw: in all,
thirty-six teeth.

Tongue bifid: eyes large and prominent: iris black, pupil smaragdine: the eyes
may be covered at pleasure with a fleshy membrane: the ears are small,
sharp-pointed; hairy without, smooth and polished within.

The length of the forelegs is twenty-four inches, like those of other
quadrupeds, not immersed in the body like those of seals: the feet are formed
with toes as those of other animals, but are covered with a naked skin, so that
externally they seem a shapeless mass, and have only the rudiments of nails to
five latent toes: the hind legs are twenty-two inches long, are fixed to the
body quite behind, like those of seals, but are capable of being brought
forward, so that the animal makes use of them to scratch its head: these feet
are divided into five toes, each divided by a great web, and are a foot broad:
the tail is only two inches long.

The hair is long and rough; beneath which is a soft down, of a bay color: on
the neck of the old males the hair is erect, and a little longer than the rest.
The general color of these animals is black, but the hairs of the old ones are
tipped with gray. The females are cinereous. The skins of the young, cut out of
the bellies of their dams, are very useful for clothing, and cost about 3s.
4d. each; the skin of an old one, 4s.

The fat and flesh of the old males is very nauseous; but the flesh of the
females resembles lamb, and the young ones roasted are as good as sucking pigs.

Inhabits the seas between Kamtschatka and America; in the last, not higher
than lat. 56 N. are not found again nearer than the isle of Juan Fernandez, S.
lat. 33 -- 40. Are seen in great numbers, in June and July, the breeding
season, on the islands, which they resort to for the purpose of suckling their
young on shore. Couple in August and September, and bring two at a time. The
male show little attachment to its young, but the female is excessively fond of
it: the former will The female, during that time, is very fierce. One of Lord
Anson's sailors was killed by the en^aged dam of a whelp he had robbed her of.
Anson's voy. 124.
suffer it to be killed before his face without showing any resentment. Toward
evening, both male and female swim a little way to sea, the last with the young
on its back, which the male will push off, as if to teach it to swim.

They arrive on the breeding islands very fat and full of blood: when they are
in motion they seem like a great skin full of oil, from the tremulous movement
of the blubber, which has been found to be a foot thick. The Spaniards
therefore call them Lobos de Aceyte Ulloa's voy. II. 227.
, or wolves of oil. One has been known to yield a but of oil; and so full of
blood, that what has run out of a single animal Anson's voy. 123.
has filled two hogsheads. The flesh is eatable; Lord Anson's people eat it
under the denomination of beef, to distinguish it from that of seal, which they
called lamb.

The old animals have a tremendous appearance, yet are excessively timid,
except at the breeding season, when they seem to lose their apprehensions, and
are less disturbed at the sight of man. At other times, they hurry into the
water; or, if awakened out of their sleep by a loud noise, or by blows, fall
into vast confusion, tumble down, and tremble in every part, through fear: but if
once they find it impossible to escape Hist. Kamtschatka, 121.
, grow desperate, roar dreadfully, and attack their enemy with great fury. The
Kamtschatkans either kill them in their sleep with lances, or shoot them with
poisoned arrows. They cut the skin into cords, or make shoes of it: they esteem
the blubber and flesh very palatable; but the feet makes a jelly, which the
Kamtschatkans think a great delicacy.

These animals associate in families like the former, but not in such great
numbers: the males show equal jealousy about their mistresses, and have bloody
combats on their accounts: oftimes there is one of superior courage to the
rest, and procures by dint of valor a greater number of females than the
others. In the Kamtschatkan seas, they generally choose some insulated rock for
their station, where they roar so loud as to be heard at two miles distance:
the young bleat like sheep. They are of a very lethargic disposition, fond of
wallowing in miry places, and will lie like swine on one another, grunting like
those animals, and sometimes snorting like horses in full vigor. They are very
inactive on land: to prevent a surprise, each herd places a sentinel, who gives
certain signals of the appearance of danger: during the breeding season they
Hist. Kamtschatka, 123. Wood ^ogers's voy. 137.
abstain from food, and before that is elapsed become very lean: at other
times, they feed on seals, sea-otters, and fish Hist. Kamtschatka, 123.

This animal, in nature, so nearly approaches the cetaceous tribe, that it is
merely in conformity to the systematic writers, that I continue it in this
class: it scarce deserves the name of a biped; what are called feet are little
more than pectoral fins; they serve only for swimming; they are never used to
assist the animal in walking, or landing; for it never goes ashore, nor ever
attempts to climb the rocks, like the walrus and seal. It brings forth in the
water, and, like the whale, suckles its young in that element: like the whale,
it has no voice; and like that animal, has an horizontal broad tail, without
even the rudiments of hind feet.

Inhabits the shores of Kamtschatka, and of the opposite coast of America, and
of the intervening islands. Is found again on that of Mindanao Dampier's voy.
I. 321.
, one of the Philippine islands, and on the coast of New Holland The same, 33.
; on that of the isle of France Voy. de la Caille, 229.
, and on that of Senegal Adanson's voy. 259.
; on the Mosquito shore, in the river of Orenoque, and the lakes formed by it;
and lastly, in the river of Amazons Dampier saw them in quantity on the
Mosquito shore, I. 33. Gumella, in the river Orenoque, II. 43, and Condamine,
p. 77, in that of (...) Amazons. It is brought from the last in great
quantities, salted, to Cayenne. Churchill's coll. voy. V. 562, 563.
; but in no other part of the Atlantic Ocean.

They live perpetually in the water, and frequent the edges of the shores; and
in calm weather swim in great droves near the mouths of rivers: in the time of
flood they come so near the land that a person may stroke them with his hand:
if hurt, they swim out to sea; but presently return again. They live in
families, one near another; each consists of a male, a female, a half-grown
young one, and a very small one. The females oblige the young to swim before
them, while the other old ones surround, and, as it were, guard them on all
sides. The affection between the male and female is very great; for if she is
attacked he will defend her to the utmost, and if she is killed will follow her
corpse to the very shore, and swim for some days near the place it has been
landed at.

They copulate in the spring, in the same manner as the human kind, especially
in calm weather, toward the evening. The female swims gently about; the male
pursues; till tired with wantoning she flings herself on her back, and admits
his embraces The Leonine and Ursine seals copulate in the same manner, only,
after sporting in the sea for some time, they come on shore for that purpose.
. Steller thinks they go with young above a year: it is certain that they bring
but one young at a time, which they suckle by two teats placed between the
breast.

They are vastly voracious and gluttonous, and feed not only on the fuci that
grow in the sea, but such as are flung on the edges of the shore. When they are
filled they fall asleep on their backs. During their meals, they are so intent
on their food, that any one may go among them and choose which he likes best.
Peter Martyr gives an instance of one that lived in a lake of Hispaniola for
five and twenty years, and was so tame as to come to the edge of the shore on
being called; and would even perform the part of a ferry, and carry several
people at a time on its back to the opposite shore As quoted by Purchase, V. 888.
.

Their back and their sides are generally above water, and as their skin is
filled with a species of louse peculiar to them, numbers of gulls are
continually perching on their backs and picking out the insects.

They continue in the Kamtschatkan and American seas the whole year; but in
winter are very lean, so that you may count their ribs. They are taken by
harpoons fastened to a strong cord, and after they are struck it requires the
united force of thirty men to draw them on shore. Sometimes when they are
transfixed they will lay hold of the rocks with their paws, and stick so fast
as to leave the skin behind before they can be forced off. When a Manati is
struck its companions swim to its assistance; some will attempt to overturn the
boat by getting under it; others will press down the rope, in order to break
it; and others will strike at the harpoon with their tails, with a view of
getting it out, which they often succeed in. They have not any voice, but make
a noise by hard breathing, like the snorting of a horse.

DESCR.
They are of an enormous size; some are 28 feet long, and 8000 lb. Those of the
West Indies, and other hot climates, do not exceed 1200 lb. in weight, and few
arrive at that size. Probably they are (...) suffered to live their full time
in those countries, being perpe^^ally persecuted by the Mosquito and other
Indians, who are very ^exterous in striking them. Vide Dampier, I. 35, 36.
in weight. The head, in proportion to the bulk of the animal, is small,
oblong, and almost square: the nostrils are filled with short bristles: the
gape, or rictus, is small: the lips are double: near the junction of the two
jaws the mouth is full of white tubular bristles, which serve the same use as
the laminae in whales, to prevent the food running out with the water: the lips
are also full of bristles, which serve instead of teeth to cut the strong roots
of the sea plants, which floating ashore are a sign of the vicinity of these
animals. In the mouth are no teeth, only two flat white bones, one in each jaw;
one above, another below, with undulated surfaces, which serve instead of
grinders.

The eyes are extremely small, not larger than those of a sheep: the iris
black: it is destitute of ears, having only two orifices, so small that a quill
will scarce enter them: the tongue is pointed, and but small: the neck is
thick, and its junction with the head scarce distinguishable; and the last
always hangs down: the circumference of the body near the shoulders is twelve
feet, about the belly twenty, near the tail only four feet eight: the head
thirty-one inches: the neck near seven feet: and from these measurements may be
collected the deformity of this animal: near the shoulders are two feet, or
rather sins, which are only two feet two inches long, and have neither fingers
nor nails; beneath are concave, and covered with hard bristles: the tail is
thick, strong, and horizontal, ending in a stiff black fin, and like, the
substance of whalebone, and much split in the fore part; the end slightly
divided.

The skin is very thick, black, and full of inequalities, like the bark of oak,
and so hard as scarce to be cut with an ax, and has no hair on it: beneath the
skin is a thick blubber, which taste like oil of almonds. The flesh is coarser
than beef, and will not soon putrify. The young ones taste like v^^l. The skin
used for shoes, and for covering the sides of boats.

Besides these, Mr. Steller saw on the coast of (...)
(...) Hist. Kamtschatka, 136.
another very singular animal, which he (...) Sea Ape: it was five feet long*
the head like (...); ears sharp and erect; eyes large; on both (...) of beard;
the form of its body thick and (...) thick^^t near the head, tapering to the
tail, (...) ^^^^urcated, the upper lobe the longest; (...) covered with thick
hair, gray on the back, red on the belly. Steller could discover neither feet
nor paws. It was full of frolic, and played a thousand monky tricks; sometimes
swimming on one side, sometimes on the other side of the ship, looking at it
with great amazement. It would come so near the ship that it might be touched
with a pole; but if any body stirred, would immediately retire. It often raised
one-third of its body above the water, and stand erect for a considerable time;
then suddenly dart under the ship, and appear in the same attitude on the other
side; and would repeat this for thirty times together. It would frequently
bring up a sea plant not unlike the bottle gourd, which it would toss about and
catch again in its mouth, playing numberless fantastic tricks with it.

BELUGA.
Another obscure animal of this class is the Beluga Beluga, or white fish, from
the color of its skin: must be distinguished from a species of sturgeon of the
same name, taken in the Wolga, Don, etc.
, found in the gulf of Ochotsk, or the sea between Kamtschatka and Tartary; in
that between Kamtschatka and America, opposite to the river Anadir, and in the
frozen sea near the mouth of the Jenesei. It is 15 or 20 feet long, and three
or four thick: it agrees with the seal in its feet and tail: its teeth are like
a cow's: on the neck are two holes, through which it spouts water: there is
hair on the body, but so thin that the white skin appears through it: lives on
fish: is gregarious: carries its young on its back: shuns shallow places;
seldom goes near the shore, or up rivers: yet the celebrated Witsch, in his
book called Norden op Tartarye, says that it goes and returns with the tide up
and down the rivers Mesen and Jesma; where the fishermen take them in nets of
ropes and kill them with spears, and each yields two vats and a half of train
oil; so that if the capture is lucky a ship of 200 tuns may be loaded in two
tides Muller's Kamtschatkan expedition. German ed. p. 253. Purchas's Pilgrims,

B. with large canine teeth: four cutting teeth above, the same below: sharp
black nose: large naked ears: the tongue is pointed, terminated by sharp
aculeated papillae: exterior toe detached from the membrane: the claw strong,
and hooked: five toes on the hind feet: talons very crooked, strong, and
compressed sideways: no tail: the membrane divided behind quite to the rump:
head of a dark ferruginous color: on the neck, shoulders, and underside, of a
much lighter and brighter red: on the back the hair shorter, dusky and smooth:
the membranes of the wings dusky: varies in color; some entirely of a reddish
brown; others dusky. This now described was one foot long: its extent from tip
to tip of the wings four feet; but they are found vastly larger.

These monsters inhabit Guinea, Madagascar, an^ all the islands from thence to
the remotest in the Indian ocean. They fly in flocks, and perfectly obscure the
air with their numbers: they begin their flight from one neighboring island to
another immediately on sunset, and return in clouds from the time it is light
till sunrise Dampier's voy. I. 381.
. They live on fruits* and are so fond of the juice of the palm tree, that they
will intoxicate themselves with it till they drop on the ground Museum Hafniae.

. It is most likely, from the size of their teeth, they are carnivorous. Mr.
Edwards relates, that they will dip into the sea for fish. They swarm like
bees, hanging by one another from the trees in great clusters Argensola Philip.
isles, 158. des Marchais, II. 261.
. The Indians eat them, and declare the flesh to be very good: they grow
excessively fat at certain times of the year. The French, who live in the Isle
de Bourbon, boil them in their Bouillon, to give it a relish Voy. de la Caille,
233.
. The Negroes have them in abhorrence des Marchais, ibid.
. Many are of an enormous size: Beckman Voy. to Borneo, 39.
measured one, whole extent from tip to tip of the wing was five feet four
inches; and Dampier I. 381.
another, which extended further than he could reach with stretched-out arms.
Their bodies are from the size of a pullet to that of a dove: their cry is
dreadful; their smell rank; their bite, resistance and fierceness great when
taken.

The ancients had some knowledge of these animals. Herodotus (...). Lib. iii.
mentions certain winged wild beasts, like bats, that molested the Arabs, who
collected the Cassia to such a degree that they were obliged to cover their
bodies and faces, all but their eyes, with skins. It is very probable, as M. de
Buffon remarks, it was from such relations the Poets formed their fictions of
Harpies.

Linnaeus gives this species the title of Vampyre, conjecturing it to be the
kind which draws blood from people in their sleep. M. de Buffon denies it,
ascribing that faculty to a species only found in S. America: but there is
reason to imagine, that this thirst after blood is not confined to the bats of
one continent, nor to one species; for Bontius and Nieuhoff inform us, that
they of Java Bontius India, 70. Nieuhoff, 255. These writers say that this kind
is as big as a pigeon. I suspect that the species just descrbed is common to
India and S. America; Mr. Greenwood, painter, long resident at Surinam,
informing me that there is in that colony a fox-colored bat, whose extent of
wings is above four feet.
seldom fail attacking those who lie with their feet uncovered, whenever they
can get access; and Gumilla Hist. Orenoque, III. 100.
, after mentioning a greater and lesser species, found on the banks of the
Orenoque, declares them to be equally greedy after human blood. Persons thus
attacked have been known to be near passing from a sound sleep into eternity.
The Bat is so dexterous a bleeder as to insinuate its aculeated tongue into a
vein without being perceived, and then suck the blood till it is satiated; all
the while fanning with its wings, and agitating the air, in that hot climate,
in so pleasing a manner, as to fling the sufferer into a still sounder sleep
Ulloa's voy. I. 61.
. It is therefore very unsafe to rest either in the open air, or to leave open
any entrance to these dangerous animals: but they do not confine themselves to
human blood; for M. Condamine Voy. S. America, 85.
says, that in certain parts of America they have destroyed all the great
cattle introduced there by the missionaries.

b. LESSER. B. with head like a grehound: large teeth like the former: ears
long, broad, and naked: whole body covered with soft short hair of a straw
color: shaped like the other in all respects: length, eight inches three
quarters; extent, two feet two inches. Place unknown to the gentleman who
favored me with it.

nose to the rump seven inches and an half.

Inhabits South America: lives in the palm trees: grows very fat: called
Vampyre by M. de Buffon, who supposes it to be the species that sucks human

dusky, very thin: fur on the head and back brown; on the belly, cinereous:
length, from the nose to the end of the membrane, above five inches; extent of
wings, twenty.

Inhabits Peru and the Mosquito shore: the last was given me by John Ellis, Esquire
F. R. S. It differed from the former in size, being less; in all (...) respects
agreed.

Linnaeus, carried away by love of system, places this, on account of its
having only two cutting teeth in each jaw, among the Glires, next to the
squirrels, under the name of Noctilio Americanus. But such is the variety in
the number and disposition of the teeth in the animals of this genus, that he
might form almost as many genera out of it as there are species. But as the
Bats have other such striking characters, it is unnecessary to have recourse to
the more latent marks to form its definition. The same may be said of several
other animals.

Queen's College, Cambridge, in one night, one hundred and eighty-five; the
second night sixty-three; the third night two; and that each that was measured

B. with ears above an inch long, thin, and almost pellucid: body and tail only
one inch three quarters long. This and all other Bats, except the Ternate and
the Horse-shoe, have a lesser or internal ear, serving as a valve to close the
greater when the animal is asleep.

Inhabits Europe, and is found in Great Britain. Bats appear abroad in this
country early in the spring; sometimes are tempted by a warm day to sally out
in winter; fly in the evenings; live on moths and other nocturnal insects; skim
along the water in quest of gnats; fly by jerks, not with the regular motion of
birds, for which the ancients mistake them; frequent glades and shady places;
will go into larders, and gnaw any meat they find: bring two young at a time,
which they suckle at their breast: retire at the end of summer into caves, the
eaves of houses, and into ruined buildings, in vast multitudes, where they
generally remain torpid, suspended by the hind legs, enveloped in their wings:
are the prey of owls: their voice weak. Ovid takes notice both of that and the
origin of the latin name: Minimam pro corpore vocem
Emittunt; peraguntque leves stridore querelas.
Tectaque, non sylvas celebrant: lucemque perosae
Nocte volant: seroque trahunt a vespere nomen.
