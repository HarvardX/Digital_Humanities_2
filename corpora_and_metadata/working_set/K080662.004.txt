The Heron is one of the most common birds that inhabit this kingdom: and there
is scarcely any part of the globe that has been visited by travelers, in which
it has not been noticed. In Britain it was formerly held in high estimation,
not only because its flesh was accounted a delicacy at the tables of the
nobility It appears from a curious book, entitled The Regulations of the
Household of the Fifth Earl of NORTHUMBERLAND, begun in 1512, that Herons were
valued at the same price as Bytters (Bitterns), Fessaunts (Pheasants), Curlewes
(Curlews), and Peacockes (Peacocks).

"At PRINCIPAL FEASTS. -- Item, it is thought in likewyze that HEARONSEWYS be
bought for my Lordees own mees; so that they be at xiid. a piece." The price of
the Crane was 16d. at the same time, and the Goose 3d. or at most 4d. --
Partridges 2d. Woodcocks 1 or 1.; and Snipes three for a penny.


: but because Heron Hawking was a favorite diversion, insomuch that laws were
enacted for the preservation of the species, and any person by destroying the
eggs incurred a penalty of twenty shillings.

The plumage of the male bird is remarkable for its elegance; perhaps we could
with less propriety use the same expression, if speaking of its general
appearance and proportions. Nature has not provided it with webbed feet to swim
after its prey, which is almost wholly of the aquatic kind, but has furnished
it with very long legs to wade after it, and these give it rather an awkward
appearance when standing on the land. The neck also is long and slender, but
when it stands on the side of a stream or river waiting for the passing of a
fish, its neck and head are drawn between the shoulders: in flying its neck is
also crouched down, and the head almost concealed between the shoulders. The
male is chiefly distinguished from the female by having a fine crest of black
feathers; two in particular, in some specimens, are eight inches in length. Mr.
Latham believes that this appendage is found only in males of a full age, or
perhaps very old birds. Mr. Pennant says that the long soft black feathers on
the sides were used in old times as egrets for the hair, or ornaments to the
caps of knights of the garter; and the crests of the males are now used as
ornaments in the East.

The female has only a very short plume of dusky greyish feathers, and the
loose feathers that hang over the breast are very short, while those of the
other sex are long. This has been generally supposed a distinct kind: the
accurate Linneus described it as another species, under the specific name
cinerea, and many other naturalists have been of the same opinion, as appears
by the synonyms: Mr. Pennant observes this was formerly supposed; "but later
observations prove them to be the same." Mr. Latham adopts precisely the
opinion of Mr. Pennant, but in neither of their accounts can we find the
authority on which that opinion is founded. It is worthy of remark that Albin,
who lived at a time when Heronries were far more numerous than at present
(though even now they are very common in some parts "At Cres^^ Hall, near
Gos^er^^ in Lincolnshire, I have counted eighty nests in one tree." Pennant.
), in the first volume of his Birds, has figured the male, and in the third
volume the female, yet gives not the smallest reason to conclude that he did
not consider them as distinct species.

In the breeding season they unite in large societies, and build on the highest
trees. The nest is made of sticks, and lined with rushes, wool, feathers, etc.
They lay four, five, or six eggs, of a pale green color. They desert the nests
in the winter, and are then found on the banks of rivers, or marshy places.

The length is about three feet: breadth five feet; weight exceeds three pounds.

The length of this species is commonly about ten inches: breadth twenty-four:
weight two ounces and a half. The male is known by a white spot under the chin.
Mr. Latham mentions a variety, (Var A) in which the lower part of the breast,
belly, thighs, under wing coverts and vent are white; and in some specimens of
the common kind the white at the vent is spread toward the thighs. The webs of
the feet are depressed, and form a crescent: the color of the legs seem to
vary; our bird had scarcely any of the red tinge in the black color.

These birds frequent our shores in summer. Latham says they are observed on
the coasts of Kent in a few days after the other terns; and, as they differ
somewhat in their manners, do not associate. They are found during spring and
summer in vast numbers in the fens of Lincolnshire. The eggs are three or four
in number, of a greenish or olive color, spotted with black, and have also a
band of the same color about the middle. These eggs are deposited among the
reeds in fens and other marshy places. The food is insects and small fish,
which it procures by hovering over the water, and darting on its prey in the
same manner as most other birds of the same genus.

It is an inhabitant of most of the northern countries of Europe: very common
in Siberia, and about the salt lakes of the deserts of Tartary. It is also
supposed to be the species which was seen by Kalm in vast flocks, beyond lat.
41. north, long. 47. W. He says, "It was rather darker than the common
sea-swallow; the flocks consisted of some hundreds, and sometimes settled on
the ship Vide Kalm. Travels in North America, etc. translated by J. R. Forster,

The length of this species is commonly about sixteen inches; breadth
twenty-seven, and weight twelve ounces; but they are liable to considerable
variation in weight and size, as well as color: sometimes they do not even
exceed seven ounces.

It is very generally met with in Europe, and extends to Asia and America. Mr.
Latham says at Hudson's Bay it is known by the name of Wasawuckapeshew. These
Birds are found in England in the fens amongst the Ruffs and Reeves one part of
the year, but continues with us the whole winter, frequenting the open sands
like the Curlew, and feeding on Insects.


PLATE LXXVI. ALAUDA OBSCURA. DUSKY LARK. PASSERES.
Bill conic, pointed, Nostrils oval, broad, naked.

It seems undetermined whether we ought to consider this as a distinct species,
or only as a variety of the Sky Lark. Mr. Latham, in his Synopsis, considers it
a variety, and observes that he is aware of this and other Birds becoming black
by feeding on Hemp Seed, as was the case with a Goldfinch and House Sparrow. It
appears also liable to much variation of colors in different specimens. One in
the British Museum is of a full deep black throughout, and that from which the
figure in our plate is copied, is of a lighter color in many parts than that
seems to have been from which Albin engraved his plate. The account which this
Author has given is curious: "This Lark," says he, "was taken with a clap net
by one of the Bird-catchers in a field near Highgate, and brought to me by Mr.
Davenport, which I have taken care to draw exactly from the Bird, neither
adding nor diminishing in the draught or coloring. This being a curiosity, I
was desired by one of my subscribers to make a plate of it."

The name Albin has given it is scarcely justified by this description which he
has added. "The bill of this Bird was of a dusky yellow; the irides of the eyes
yellowish: it was all over of a dark reddish brown, inclining to black,
excepting the hind part of the head, on which was some dusky yellowish
feathers; likewise some feathers with whitish edges on the belly."

Our specimen was shot in Scotland by Mr. Agneau, Gardener to the late Duchess
of Portland, several years ago. Its length rather exceeds seven inches.


PLATE LXXVII. LARUS HYBERNUS. WINTER GULL. ANSERES.
Bill obtuse, covered with a thin membrane, broad, gibbous below the base,
swelled at the apex. Tongue fleshy. Feet webbed, or finned.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill strong, strait, bending near the end; an angular
prominency on the lower mandible. Nostrils linear. Tongue cloven. Leg and back
toe small, naked above the knee.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. General color white. Head and neck marked
with dusky spots. Back gray. Scapulars gray, spotted with brown. A black bar
across the end of the tail.

The length of this bird is eighteen inches: breadth three feet six inches;
weight seventeen ounces. It is a common bird in England, and frequents the
inland rivers, fens, and moist meadows many miles distant from the sea shore in
winter.

Mr. Pennant observes, that the gelatinous substance, known by the name of Star
Shot, or Star Gelly, owes its origin to this bird, or some of the kind; being
nothing but the half digested remains of Earthworms, on which these birds
feed, and often discharge them from their stomachs.

Mr. Morton in the Not. Hist. Northampt. has given also the following curious
observation: -- "In the course of my correspondence with the late Mr. J. Platt
of Oxford, I recollect his having mentioned, that once meeting with a lump of
this star-jelly, on examination he found the toes of a Frog or Toad still
adhering, and undissolved; and from thence concluded it to be the remains of
one of these, having been swallowed whole by some bird, and the indigestible
parts brought up in the condition he found it."


PLATE LXXVIII. COLYMBUS SEPTENTRIONALIS. RED THROATED DIVER. ANSERES.
Bill obtuse, covered with a thin membrane, broad, gibbous below the base,
swelled at the apex. Tongue fleshy. Legs naked. Feet webbed, or finned.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill strait, pointed. Upper mandible longest; edges of each
bending in. Nostrils linear. Tongue pointed, serrated near the base. Legs thin,
flat. Exterior toe longest: back toe joined to the interior by a small
membrane. Tail short, and consists of twenty feathers.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Above dusky, marked with a few white spots.
Beneath white. Throat dull red.

This species breeds on the borders of lakes in the northern parts of Scotland,
and very rarely migrates to the southward but in severe winters. It is an
inhabitant of many cold countries, such as Russia, Siberia, Kamtschatka,
Iceland, and Greenland; and is also found about the rivers in Hudson's Bay. It
breeds in Greenland in June. The nest is composed of moss and grass, and is
placed amongst the rushes near the water: it contains two eggs of a more
elongated form than those of the common Hen: they are of an ash color, and are
marked with a few black spots.

These birds are more frequent about fresh waters than those of the sea, and
are injurious to the fishermen by diving among the nets and devouring the fish;
but they often entangle themselves, and are by that means taken.

The weight of this Diver is three pounds, and the length two feet five inches.


PLATE LXXIX. PARUS ATER. COLEMOUSE. PASSERES.
Bill conic pointed. Nostrils oval, broad, naked.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill strong, a little compressed, sharp pointed. Bristles
at the base. Tongue blunt and terminated by three or four bristles. Toes
divided to the origin; back toe very large.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Head black. Breast and Belly dirty, or white
inclining to ash color. Back and Wings greenish.

It has been supposed by some authors that the Parus Ater, and Parus Palustris
Marsh Titmouse.
of Linnaeus were not distinct species, but merely the two sexes of one kind;
and others have thought the latter only a variety of the first. Willughby is
the first author worthy of consideration who has noticed the precise difference
between the two birds. He says the Marsh Titmouse differs from the Colemouse in
these particulars: 1st, that it is bigger: 2d, that it wants the white spot on
the head: 3d, it has a larger tail: 4th, its under side is white: 5th, it has
less black under the chin: 6th, it wants the white spot on the covert of the
wings. Mr. Pennant observes on this account given by Willughby, that the last
distinction does not hold in general, as the subject figured in the British
Zoology had those spots; yet wanted that on the hind part of the head.

The opinion of Mr. Latham in this particular deserves attention also; he says,
"it is much to be feared that the Marsh Titmouse is not a distinct species;
most probably a mere variety of the Colemouse." Genesis Syn. vol. 4.

In the Supplement to the General Synopsis of Birds, Mr. Latham has added the
following account under the head MARSH TITMOUSE. "In my Synopsis it has not
appeared clear to me, whether the Colemouse and this were different species. I
find it to be the opinion of Sepp, that they form but one, being both figured
in the same plates as male and female. In one of them is a spot of white on the
hind head, and the sides of the head are white: the throat black. The other has
the top of the head wholly black, and the black spot of the throat wanting. The
nest seems here composed of sedge, mixed with large cat's-tail, lined with down
and feathers: furnished with five white eggs, mottled with red brown.

The Colemouse appears to be less injurious in gardens and orchards than others
of the same genus: it is also less numerous, and generally inhabits woods. The
length is four inches. It is found throughout Europe and in America.

The Nutcracker is so extremely rare in this Country, that Mr. Pennant has
added it to his British Zoology, in the third plate of the Appendix of Vol. II.
And as we are indebted to his authority for ascertaining its being an English
species, we have transcribed his account of it.

"The specimen we took our description from, is the only one we ever heard was
shot in these kingdoms: it was killed near Mostyn, Flintshire, October 5, 1753."

"It was somewhat less than the Jackdaw: the bill strait, strong, black: the
color of the whole head and neck, breast and body, was a rusty brown: the
other parts marked with triangular white spots: the wings black: the coverts
spotted in the same manner as the body: the tail rounded at the end, black,
tipped with white: the vent-feathers white: the legs dusky."

Mr. Latham mentions a second instance: he saw the mutilated skin of one that
was shot in Kent.

It appears from different authors, that this bird is most frequent in the pine
forests in Russia, Siberia, and Kamtschatka: it is also found in Germany, where
it is more common than in any other part of Europe, though it inhabits the
mountainous parts of Sweden and Denmark: it sometimes visits France in flocks.
Found also in North America.

In its manners it is said to greatly resemble the Jay. It feeds on the kernels
of the pine, wild berries, and insects; and makes its nest in the holes of
trees.

The Nuthatch is a small bird: it weighs about one ounce, and is five inches
and three quarters in length. The female differs from the male only in size;
the weight seldom exceeding five or six drams.

It breeds in the hollows of trees, and lays six or seven eggs, of a dirty
white color, dotted with rufous; these are deposited on the rotten wood, mixed
with a little moss. If the entrance to the nest is too large, it closes up part
of it with clay, leaving only a very small hole to creep through. The nest of
this bird is seldom disturbed, or the eggs taken away, when the female, is
sitting, for her hissing so nearly resembles that of a snake, that few would
venture to put their hands into the hole to search for them; and it is said,
that the female will suffer her feathers to be plucked off rather than desert
her eggs or young. The male also shows the greatest tenderness for them and its
mate, during the time of incubation.

It feeds on all kinds of insects, as well as nuts: of the latter, it lays up a
considerable hoard in the hollows of trees, and brings them out when other food
is scarce. The manner of its cracking the nut is curious, and has been noticed
by several authors, and particularly Willoughby: he says, "It is a pretty sight
to see her fetch a nut out of her hoard, when, placing it fast in a chink, she
stands above it, with the head downwards, and, striking it with all her force,
breaks the shell, and catches up the kernel."

In its manners, it is not unlike the Woodpecker tribe. It is not supposed to
sleep perched; for, when confined in a cage, it would creep into a corner at
night to sleep. Dr. Plott says, "this bird, by putting its bill into a crack in
the bough of a tree, can make such a violent sound as if it was rending
asunder, so that the noise may be heard at least twelve score yards."

It is not migratory, but changes its situation in winter. Pennant observes,
that it makes a chattering noise in Autumn. Latham says, he has been informed,
that it has, at times, a whistle like that of a man.

This pretty species is very common in the summer. It is migratory; visiting
this country in the spring, and departing again in autumn; but does not leave
the warmer parts of Europe so early. The nest is usually made in the hollows of
broken walls, or old trees: it is composed of moss, with a lining of hair and
feathers; and contains four, sometimes five eggs, of a light blue color; and
in other respects resembling those of the Hedge Sparrow, except that they are
rather more elongated at the smallest end. This bird is so very shy that if the
eggs are only touched it forsakes the nest entirely.

The Redstart is rather smaller than the Redbreast; measuring about five
inches. The male is known by the chin, cheeks, and throat being black: in the
female the chin is white; and the red color of the breast is paler than in the
male. It has one very peculiar habit, when it shakes its tail it does not move
it up and down like the Wag-tail, but horizontally, or sideways, like a Dog
when he is fawning. Its note is soft and pleasing; but it will not bear
confinement in a cage, unless when reared from nestlings, when it requires the
same treatment as the Nightingale. In the wild state it feeds on every kind of
Insects.

The Wryneck is the only species of the genus (Yunx) yet described by any
author; and seems to have given Linnaeus some trouble to determine to what
genus he should assign it; for though it has the tongue of the Woodpecker, as
well as the situation of the toes, the bill is too weak for that genus.
Linnaeus, in the former edition of the Fauna Suecica, placed it with the
Cuckoo; but it appears to be the opinion of later naturalists that it should
form a distinct genus, his new genus having been generally adopted. The Jyngi
Congener Le Torcol raye of Brisson.
of Aldravendus is certainly no other than a variety.

The colors are altogether very plain, but are so beautifully varied and
pencilled, that, as Mr. Pennant observes, Nature has made ample amends for
their want of splendour. The colors are paler in the female than the male.

This bird builds in hollow trees: Latham says they make no nest, but lay the
eggs on the bare rotten wood. Pennant says it makes the nest of dry grass. The
eggs, according to Buffon, are as white as ivory; and Pennant adds, that they
are so thin that the yolk may be seen through them. The number of eggs seldom
exceed nine.

The Wryneck is supposed to be a Bird of passage, appearing in the spring eight
or ten days earlier than the Cuckoo. It feeds on Insects, and seems
particularly fond of Ants; these the extreme length of the tongue enables it to
pick out of the cracks where they are concealed. It takes its name from a habit
it has of turning its head back to the shoulders when alarmed or terrified: it
can also erect the feathers of the head like those of a Jay. -- Weight of this
Bird is one ounce and a quarter: length seven inches: breadth eleven.

This Bird is found throughout Europe, and in many other parts of the world.

We have only three species of Butcher-birds, or Shrikes, in this country: the
Great, Red-backed, and Wood Chat. The first is very scarce: the second is not
common; and the last is extremely rare: so that we have little opportunity to
notice the singular manners of this tribe. Nature seems to have allotted more
than an ordinary share of courage to these little creatures: they equal the
eagle in the fierceness of their attacks on smaller birds, and defend
themselves against those they cannot overcome with the greatest vigor and
resolution. Though in this respect they imitate the larger carnivorous birds,
they have not, like them, claws strong enough to tear their prey to pieces,
but, to supply this defect, they fasten it on a thorn and pull it asunder with
their bill. Even when confined in a cage, it is said that they treat their food
in a similar manner, sticking it against the wires before they eat it.

We now speak of the manners generally peculiar to the tribe: how far those of
the Wood Chat accord with them, we can only presume from being of the same
genus; no English naturalist having yet been so fortunate as to meet with it
since Willoughby and Ray. Pennant has not given a figure of it in the British
Zoology; and it is a fact well known, that both Lewin and Walcot have given
figures of it drawn from mere descriptions: this is the more to be regretted as
no specimen of it was either in the Leverian or British Museums: and that
eminent ornithologist, Mr. Latham, with his accustomed candor acknowledges, in
his account of it, that he has never seen it. "Mr. Pennant," says he, "does not
describe this bird from his own inspection; and I must confess that it has
never come under mine." -- He also, says Buffon, does not speak of it as
uncommon, but gives it, as his opinion, that the red-backed Shrike is a variety
of this species, as well as some other kinds he mentions; and adds, that from
his own observation he cannot deny the fact. We have compared them, and do not
hesitate to give them as two distinct species.

It is only the male bird that we have in our possession. We must own ourselves
indebted for the following description of the female to Pennant and Latham; nor
are we certain that our specimen was shot in England, but rather suspect that
it came from Germany. -- The length is seven inches and three quarters. The
female differs from the male: the upper part of the head, neck and body are
reddish, striated transversely with brown: the lower parts of the body are of a
dirty white, rayed with brown, marked near the end with dusky, and tipped with
red.

This is not a very common bird in England. It is of the migratory kind and
never builds here: is sometimes seen in large flocks, or in company with the
Chaffinches. The colors of the female are not so bright as in the male: in
some specimens of the latter the throat is black. Length rather exceeds six
inches. They are found in vast abundance in France according to Buffon; and are
said to breed about Luxemburg, making the nest on the tall fir-trees, composed
of long moss without, and lined with wool and feathers within. The eggs are
four or five in number, yellowish, and spotted: the young are fledged at the
end of May. They are also found in the Pine forests of Russia and Siberia.

edit. 10? LESSER WHITE THROAT. Lath. Suppl. n. 186.
This species has not been described by Pennant in his British Zoology, nor is
it certain that any preceding author has noticed it as a British species. The
Rev. Mr. Lightfoot found it near Bulstrade, in Buckinghamshire, in May and
June, and it is from a specimen found by him, and presented to the late Duchess
of Portland, that our figure is taken. The nest on which the bird is placed is
composed of dry bents mixed with wool, and lined with a few hairs of some
animal, probably of a Cow. There is at present only one egg in the nest Mr.
Latham says there were three in that which came under his inspection.
; it is of a pale color, with small irregular spots of brown.

It was the opinion of Mr. Latham, to whose inspection Mr. Lightfoot submitted
this bird, that it was perhaps the Motacilla Sylvia of Linnaeus; or that
certainly it differed very little from it. Mr. Pennant also seems undetermined
whether the White Throat was the M. Sylvia of Linnaeus; though Berkenhout
Outlines of Not. Hist.
gives it as that species without hesitation. The opinion of Mr. Latham is of
the most importance; and, if it does not positively confirm our bird being the
true M. Sylvia of Linnaeus, it proves, at least, that the White Throat is not
that bird as has been generally supposed "That Linnaeus's bird is not our White
Throat, I believe is manifest, both from size and colors. That author
expressly says, that the size scarcely exceeds that of the Yellow Wren, and
that it bears great affinity to the Sedge Bird. But that the bird in question
is neither the Yellow Wren, not Sedge Bird, I am clear, as I have all the three
before me."

Lath. Suppl. Genesis Syn. r. 186.
.

The male and female are very much alike. The size is that of the Yellow Wren,
length less than five inches.

We have quoted the specific definition of M. Sylvia for this bird with
diffidence, for it clearly appears that the tail in our specimen does not
exactly agree with his character of that bird.

The Great Cinereous Shrike is uncommon in England. It is of the migratory
kind, coming in May and departing in September. We learn from Buffon that it is
not scarce in France. It is found in Germany, Russia, and North America. In
Russia it is trained to catch small birds; and the peasants value it because
they believe that it destroys the rats, mice, and other vermin.

The savage peculiarities of this carnivorous tribe of birds have been already
noticed in the account of the Wood Chat and Red-Back Shrike: it is only
necessary to add that this is the largest kind found in this country, and is
inferior to very few from foreign countries either in size or courage. Its
conflicts with larger birds are sometimes severe; but the smaller kinds it
seizes by the throat and strangles: from this circumstance it is called, in
Germany, the Warchangel, or Suffocating Angel. -- The female differs from the
male chiefly in the color and markings of the breast, that part being of a
dusky white, and marked with a number of transverse, semicircular brown lines.
She lays six eggs, of a dull olive color, spotted at the thickest end with
black. The nest is composed of heath and moss, lined with wool. In North
America, at Hudson's Bay, it is said to build its nest half way up a Pine, or
Juniper-tree, in April, and that the hen fits fifteen days Lath. Suppl. 51.

This is rather smaller than the House Sparrow. The female is duller in color
than the male; and has not the black marks on the side of the head and throat.
In some specimens the brown color is more intermixed with black, or dark
shades, than our bird; this change of color has been often noticed in the
House Sparrow, which is sometimes quite black.

We must consider this as a local species; common in Lancashire, Lincolnshire,
and Yorkshire on^^, in this country. It is very common in many parts of Europe:
(...) Siberia it is more common than the House Sparrow. It frequents trees,
and, according to Sepp, builds its nest in a hollow. It is composed of bents,
mixed with feathers; and contains five eggs of a pale brown, with spots of a
darker color.

Albin scarcely knew this species, from which we may infer, that it has seldom
been taken near the metropolis; he says, "This bird delights in mountainous
woody places, not frequented. It was shot by a gentleman in the country, and
sent in a letter to me, by the name of the Mountain Sparrow." Vol. III. p. 62.

This noble bird was formerly an inhabitant of the woody and mountainous parts
of Scotland B^^bi^us. -- Descr. Regni S^^tiae.
and Ireland Giraldus Cambrimfis. Topogr. Hibern. 706.
. At this time it is supposed to be extinct in Ireland; and in Scotland is
found only in the Highlands north of Inverness Rossshire. Sutherlandshire.
. Mr. Latham says, the last bird of this kind found in Scotland was in
Chicholm's great forest, in Strathglass.

Albin gave a figure of it in his Ornithology, published sixty years since, and
then he seems not to have known that it was a British species; he calls it the
Mountain Cock from Muscovy. From this we may infer that the breed was nearly
extirpated half a century ago.

According to most authors it thrives best in cold countries. It is found in
Italy, but only in the higher regions, where the air is bleak. In Russia it is
not uncommon, particularly in the Asiatic part of that empire. There is a
variety of this species much smaller than the common sort, which is probably
owing to the severe cold of the climate in which it lives, being found in
Lapland and Norway, the farthest extreme of Europe toward the Icy Sea.

The male of this species is two feet nine inches in length, breadth four feet,
and is as large as a Turkey In Scotland it is known by the name of Capercalze,
Aver-calze, and in the old law books Caperkally: the last signifying the horse
of the woods. In Germany it is called Aur-han, or Urus, Wild Ox Cock. --
Pennant.
. The female is smaller, twenty six inches in length. The bill is dusky, throat
red, neck and back marked with transverse bars of red and black: a few white
spots on the breast, the lower part of an orange color, belly barred with pale
orange and black, the tips of the feathers white; the feathers of the back and
scapulars black, the edges mottled with black and pale reddish brown: the
scapulars tipped with white, the inner webs of the quills dusky; the exterior
mottled with pale brown: the tail of a deep rust color, barred with black and
tipped with white.

These birds feed on many kinds of plants, and particularly on the tender
shoots and seeds of the Pine and Fir trees, which are in the greatest plenty in
the forests they frequent. The males never associate with the females, except
from the beginning of February till the end of March: when the male perches on
a tree, with his tail spread, the quills lowered to the feet, the neck
protruded, and the feathers of the head ruffled. In this posture it makes a
loud and shrill noise, like the whetting of a scythe, and this it repeats till
the females discover its haunts. They lay from eight to sixteen eggs, of a
white color, spotted with yellow, and larger than those of the common hen:
these are deposited upon moss, on the ground Mr. Latham says of the last bird
of this kind shot in Scotland, "I am well informed that the nest was placed on
a Scotch Pine."
. The females only, sit the whole time of incubation, and cover the eggs with
dry leaves when she is compelled to leave them. The young run after the mother
as soon as hatched.

The flesh of the Wood Grous is much esteemed, except when it feeds on the
berries of Juniper which communicates a very unpleasant taste to it.

The Little Owl appears to be no where a common bird; in this country it is
scarce, and in France, Buffon informs us, it is also rare. It is very seldom
found in the woods, which others of the same tribe inhabit, but frequents
ruined edifices, caverns in rocks, and other such gloomy and solitary places.
It lays five eggs, spotted with white and a yellowish color. In England it has
been chiefly found in Yorkshire and Flintshire.

This bird seems liable to much variation in color. Buffon mentions one from
St. Domingo which had less white on the throat, and brown bands on the breast
instead of longitudinal spots; and another variety from Germany, with the
plumage darker than usual and black irides. Frisch has a figure of this bird
with irides of a dark blue color. The length of this species is eight inches.
Albin's figure is quoted in the Synonyms, but it is much more slender in its
form than our specimen.

of this bird; but that if it hovers over them, they will remain motionless on
the ground while the fowler draws a net over them.

We find on comparing the different descriptions given by authors of this bird,
with specimens that have fallen under our observation, that few birds vary
more, in the colors of their plumage, than the Hobby: in some the back is
reddish, or deep brown; in others almost black with a bluish cast. Again, we
find some with the back throughout of a very deep lead color; and others with
the edges of the feathers of a pale yellow-brown. The breast is generally of a
pure white with dark spots; but these also vary: the white is tinged with a
faint dirty-brown in some; and the spots incline to brown, instead of black, in
others. The irides are brown of every shade in different birds: one author M.
Brisson.
says they are yellow. Some of these variations, we must presume, depend on the
age of the bird; but one circumstance has been noticed in adult specimens that
deserves particular notice, the vent and thighs, which are generally
ferruginous or rufous, are sometimes white. Mr. Latham, speaking of this
variation, says he has a specimen, in which the thighs are dusky white,
longitudinally marked with brown; and the vent of a plain white: one of our
specimens also precisely agrees with this account.

The length of the male bird is twelve inches, breadth two feet and three
inches, weight seven ounces: the female is larger.

The Stone-Chat is a constant inhabitant of this country. In Summer it
frequents heaths and commons: in Winter it retires to the marshes, being the
only places in which its favorite food, Insects, is found in abundance.

The length of this bird is four inches and three quarters. The head of the
female is ferruginous color spotted with black; that of the male is entirely
black: they differ very little in other respects, except that the colors of
the former are more obscure than in the other sex.

Most authors agree that this is a noisy and restless creature, incessantly
flying from bush to bush, and always carefully concealing the place where its
nest is deposited; never alighting on the same spot, but creeping to it on the
ground in an artful manner. The nest is placed at the bottom of some bush, or
under a stone, and usually contains five or six eggs, of a pale greenish color
with marks of rufous.

The trivial English name of this bird has been accounted for by Mr. Latham in
a very curious manner; he says, he cannot find it remarked any where for its
having any song. Buffon compares its note to the word ouistrata frequently
repeated; but he has ever thought it exactly imitated the clicking of two
stones together, one being held in each hand. If others, says he, have thought
the same, it will easily account for the reason of its being called the
Stone-Chatter.

Mr. Latham has given this species a place in his list of the Birds of Great
Britain; and we cannot surely incur disapprobation by following his example. If
the authority of Mr. Latham is unsupported by the opinion of Mr. Pennant, we
must recollect that the Zoology of the latter author appeared many years before
the Synopsis of Mr. Latham; and probably the species was not so generally
diffused and domesticated in this country before the British Zoology was
published, as since that period. It is impossible that we can account otherwise
for what reason he excluded it, since he has given the Peacock, Pheasant,
Guinea Hen, and other domesticated Birds of foreign extraction, which certainly
had no better claim to his attention, in that work, than the beautiful Bird
before us.

This species is a native of Africa, particularly of the Cape of Good Hope:
from the latter place vast numbers have been brought to this country; and the
climate favoring their increase, the kind is not uncommon in many parts of the
kingdom. It is rather an ornamental than useful species, and is generally kept
in Gentlemen's ponds for pleasure.

Albin published a figure and description of this Bird from a specimen reared
in this country sixty years ago: he says it fed on grass and corn like other
Geese, and thus concludes his observations on the two sexes, "The difference
between the cock and hen could not be distinguished neither by the colors or
shape, but only by the cock's running to the hen with open wings, clasping or
embracing her round with them. I could not find any other name for them from
the Poulterers but that of Ganser. This bird comes nearest to Mr. Willoughby's
Gambo Goose, the span in the wings excepted, page 360. tab. 71." -- Vide Albin.

Mr. Pennant, and other writers on the Zoology of this country, supposed the
Merlin never bred here, till Dr. Heysham met with two nests in Cumberland: they
were placed on the ground like that of the Ringtail; and in each were four
young. The egg, formerly in the Portland Museum, was of an uniform purplish
brown color, roundish, and one inch and a quarter in length. The Merlin
appears in England when the Hobby disappears, which happens in October.

This species, like the Hobby, seems to vary exceedingly in color in different
specimens; in some the back and wings are bluish ash color A specimen in the
Leverian Museum answers to this description.
, in others ferruginous: the bars of clay-colour and dusky on the tail, are
from thirteen to fifteen in most birds; but Mr. Pennant says, one he examined
had only eight; our specimen has twelve bars across.

The length of the Merlin is twelve inches: though small, it was formerly
trained for hawking, particularly for taking partridges, which some authors
say, it could kill by a single stroke on the neck. The Merlin flies low,
frequents the sides of roads, and skims from one part to another in search of
prey. It is described as a bird wanting neither cunning nor spirit. It is at
this time very scarce in England, and seems to be uncommon in every part of
Europe.

The beautiful combination of vivid glosses with which the plumage of this
common bird is enriched, has been so little attended to in paintings of it,
that we are afraid we shall be accused of flattering its appearance, by a gaudy
introduction of unnatural tints in the annexed figure: to avoid such imputation
we have strictly observed, and accurately expressed the colors from a
specimen, in our collection, that had been taken in a state of nature. We are
aware that the colors will vary in different specimens of every species, but
by correctly representing one that is perfect, it will convey a better idea of
the bird than any of the mutilated creatures kept in cages for amusement.

The tail of the Magpie is particularly remarkable: its colors are more
splendid than any other part of the bird: its form is like a wedge; the two
middle feathers eleven inches long, the rest decrease gradually, the outermost
being only five inches and an half. The principal color produced by reflection
on the black part of the body is fine blue, or purple; the first tint is very
vivid on the wings. The finest green is the predominant color of the tail,
which changes in the folds to reddish yellow, with a gilded hue, fine brown,
blue, purple, and shades of glossy black throughout. These colors cannot be
seen at a distance, because they are produced only by the light falling in a
particular direction, and all the bright glosses assimilate with the blacker
hues when the bird is removed far from the eye of the spectator.

It would be tedious to enlarge on the pecular habits of a bird, that is
familiar to every rustic inhabitant in the kingdom. In all its actions it
discovers a degree of instinct superior to most birds. In many respects it
resembles the crow; like that creature, it feeds indiscriminately on every kind
of food, Insects, grain, small birds, or their eggs, carrion, and even young
poultry. Sometimes it procures its food by stratagem, at others by annoying
larger animals when it has no danger to apprehend from them. It is often seen
perched on the back of a Sheep or a Cow, picking off the Insects that infest
them. In this respect we allow them to be useful; but if they relieve the poor
animals from their smaller enemies, they subject them to their own
uncontrollable insolence, and sometimes pick out the eyes of animals that
attempt to resist them. In a domestic state it is often taught to repeat words,
or sentences. It does not imitate the human voice with the same facility and
propriety as the parrot, but sufficiently distinct to be understood.

Its great share of instinct is clearly demonstrated by the situation and
manner in which the nest is built: it is placed conspicuously on the top of
some tree, or in a hawthorn bush, but is always fenced below by brambles and
other thick bushes, that make it difficult of access. The nest is composed of
thorny twigs well interwoven, and has the thorns sticking outward: it is lined
with wool, feathers and roots, and is plaistered within with fine mud. It is
defended above by a thorny covering, and has an entrance just large enough to
admit the bird. The Magpie lays six or seven eggs of a greenish color, spotted
with black.

Five species of this tribe of birds are natives of this country, if we include
the Brown Tern mentioned by Mr. Latham as a doubtful kind, and not noticed by
Mr. Pennant. The three Terns described in the British Zoology are the Greater
or Common Sterna Hiru^d^.
, Black Sterna Fissipes.
, and Lesser Terns: the two former being in the early part of this work we deem
it unnecessary to describe them in this place: the latter, which is the subject
represented in the annexed plate, is rather smaller than the Brown Tern: the
body is considerably less; but the wings are nearly as long, measuring between
the tips when expanded twenty inches: the length is about eight inches and an
half.

The haunts and manners of this bird are nearly the same as those of the Common
Tern; it feeds on small Fish and Insects, lives on the sides of rivers, or on
the sea coast, and breeds amongst the rushes. The egg is about an inch and a
half in length, of an olive color with reddish blotches. They leave their
breeding-places at the approach of winter. This bird is found also in the
southern parts of Russia, and in America.

Albin has given this species and the Black Tern, or a variety of it, as male
and female, in Plate 89 and 90, Vol. II.

The Black Cock, like the Cock of the Wood, is seldom found, except in northern
countries; in those near the south, which it sometimes inhabits, it prefers the
coldest situations amongst woods and mountains: it feeds on the birch trees and
mountain fruits. In Russia and Siberia, they are very abundant, as they were
formerly in Scotland, Wales, and the north of England; at present they are much
diminished in this country, and, perhaps, may become as scarce as the Cock of
the Wood is at present, the flesh being much esteemed, and therefore eagerly
sought for.

It seems to partake greatly of the habits of the Cock of the Wood; it
frequents the same situations, and subsists on the same kind of food. It never
pairs with the females; but, in the spring, the male ascends some eminence,
crows, and claps his wings, and the females, attentive to his note, resort to
the spot.

The female is much smaller than the male. Its length is eighteen inches,
weight two pounds; the colors are red, black, and dusky white, which are
disposed in alternate bars and spots, in different directions. The most
remarkable part of the male bird is the tail, which consists of sixteen
feathers; the exterior ones curve very much outward, and give it a forked
appearance; but when the tail is expanded, it resembles a large fan. Length of
the male is twenty-one inches.

The female lay six or eight eggs, of a yellowish color, speckled with
ferruginous, and blotched at the small end with the same color. The young
males leave the female parent in the beginning of winter, and keep in flocks,
of six or eight, till spring. They are very quarrelsome, and fight like
game-cocks.

Amongst the number of curious and elegant species that have been extirpated in
this country, the English Naturalist will most regret the loss of this bird. It
was formerly very common, and its flesh much admired. It formed a part of many
of the old English feasts; and, amongst others, that recorded by Leland, which
was given by George Nevell, archbishop of York, in the reign of Edward the
Fourth, alone included "one thousand Egrittes." At this time it is considered
such a rarity, that Mr. Pennant observes, in his Appendix to the British
Zoology, "We once received out of Anglesea the feathers of a bird shot there,
which we suspect to be the Egret; this is the only instance, perhaps, of its
being found in our country." The same author adds, in another part, "We have
never met with this bird, or the Crane, in England, but formed our descriptions
from specimens in the elegant cabinet of Dr. Mauduit, in Paris."

In some foreign countries it is still very common: is found in several parts
of Europe and Asia: it is also said to be found in Africa, and on the American
continent.

The weight of this bird is one pound, the length about eleven inches; the
appendage of loose feathers, which is situated on the back, and hang over the
rump, were anciently used to decorate caps, or head pieces; and hence the
ornament to a cap, in later times, was called an aigrette.

The Imber Diver inhabits the seas about the Orkney and Ferroe Islands, and
never visits the southern parts of Great Britain, except in severe winters.
Living chiefly at sea, it is taken with much difficulty. If pursued when
swimming, it dives under the water, and does not appear again till it is at a
considerable distance from its pursuers. It is often caught under water by a
hook, baited with small fish. Willoughby says, they are sometimes taken in this
manner sixty feet under water.

Being rarely seen on land, it has been believed that it never quitted the
water, and that it hatched its young in a hole formed by nature under the wing.
Naturalists have discovered its nest among reeds and flags in the water, where
it is kept continually wet, as in some of the Grebe genus.

This species is larger than the common goose: the length is about twenty-five
inches. The male is said to be distinguished by a few brown specks on the side
of the neck, and by having the colors throughout more defined than in the
female: some authors have, however, considered the supposed females as birds
not in an adult state.

The Kingsfisher is seven inches in length; its weight is one ounce and a
quarter. It is almost needless to remark, that this bird is esteemed the most
beautiful of the feathered race that inhabits the south of Europe. In its form
it is rather inelegant; but its colors are fine throughout: the azure of its
back is exceedingly bright; and when the creature is hovering in the air, in a
fine day, it appears resplendent in the highest degree.

The absurd fictions that poets, in the vigor of their imagination, have
formed concerning this bird, have particularly inclined naturalists to examine
its manners of life with attention. The poets placed it in a floating nest,
during the time of incubation, and endowed it with power to calm the adverse
winds and seas. Aristotle and Pliny tell us, that this bird is most common in
the seas of Sicily: that it sat only a few days, and those in the depth of
winter, and during that period the mariner might fail in full security, for
which reason they were styled Halcyon days Pennant.
. Among the moderns, its flesh has been thought unperishable, and capable of
preserving woollen and other vestments from decay; and it has also been
supposed to turn its breast to the north when hung up dead.

Specimens of this bird are brought from almost every part of the world: in
England it is not uncommon: it frequents the sides of running streams, and
takes its prey, which consists entirely of fish, by darting on it in the water.
It makes no nest, but lays seven or more, beautiful transparent white eggs, in
a large hole in the bank of a river or stream.

ADDRESS.
IMPELLED by grateful sentiments, the Author cannot conclude the Fourth Volume
of this Work without expressing his sincere acknowledgments to the Public for
the favorable manner in which it has been received. From the encouragement
which has attended it in the course of publication, he presumes that the
expectations of the Subscribers have not been disappointed in any part of it;
and it is particularly pleasing to find, the concluding numbers have given the
utmost satisfaction.

The Author would have been happy if he could have promised, at the
commencement of this Work, to present a complete History of British
Ornithology; but, being aware of the difficulty of procuring some of the rare
Aborigines of the Country, and fearful of displeasing many Subscribers, by
introducing others that are familiar to every one, he conceived it would be
most advisable to select only those which were particularly interesting to the
English Naturalist, or Country Gentleman; these, including all the Birds
formerly known in Great Britain, together with those rare migratory Species
that are sometimes found even in the interior of the Country.

As far as the prescribed limits of the Work would admit, the Author hopes he
has fulfilled this promise to the Public. If he has excluded some fine Birds,
such as the Goldfinch, the Bullfinch, the Pheasant and its varieties, with
others no less beautiful, it was to reserve a place for some that were scarcely
known to exist in the Country. The Rose-coloured Ouzel, Roller, Little Bittern,
and Golden Oriole, are of this description; and to these we may add the Egret,
Cock of the Wood, Black Cock, Black Woodpecker, and Waxen Chatterer. The Wood
Chat, which English authors have figured from mere descriptions, sufficiently
mark the attention of the Author to render this Work no less respectable than
useful. The Red-necked Grebe, Northern Diver, Water Ouzel, Dartford Warbler,
Dusky Lark, Long-legged Plover, with many others, equally rare and interesting,
having been procured purposely for this Work, evidently prove, that no expense
has been spared to make it complete.

Since the one hundred Plates have been engraved, some rare Birds have come
into the Author's possession; but rather than incur the imputation of
trespassing on the public favor, he declined adding them to the Work, until it
appeared to be the wishes of the Subscribers to have a Supplement: that being
to be added, at their request, the Public may be persuaded that every exertion
will be made to render it worthy of their approbation.

The distinguished manner in which Works of Natural History are encouraged at
this period, leads us to a few reflections, which, it is presumed, are not
entirely inapplicable to the present Work, and may be some apology for the
different publications of that description, which the Author has lately
submitted to the Public.

It is a noble sentiment of the British Nation, to be no less respected for
their learning than admired for their valor, by other nations; yet it is a
truth which national pride dare not conceal, that several sciences, and those
especially of Natural History, have been more successfully cultivated by our
continental neighbors than by ourselves. The study of those sciences unfold
too many advantages to civilized society to be entirely overlooked in any
country; and some of its branches have ever found admirers in courts, and
patrons in princes; but it is not in every country that a number of less
exalted individuals are disposed to afford them that encouragement, which alone
can evince the general taste of a nation.

The devastations of war have, indeed, materially checked many learned
enquiries in other countries, whilst the English nation, by its fostering
protection, have contributed much to their improvement. This may ultimately
excite a laudable emulation in this country, to equal, or excel others, in the
knowledge of those sciences; for, surely, it is not to our credit, that learned
foreigners are well acquainted with the natural productions even of our
country, while we remain ignorant of them.

The Author of this Work had formerly conceived, that an Epitome at least of
the Natural History of Great Britain, would be acceptable to many; and this is
now in forwardness to completion. Botany, the most useful and pleasing branch,
has been, in part, illustrated already, in a manner that reflects honor on its
Authors. The mineral, fossil, and marine productions, are, probably, less
generally known. The Insects and Birds, the Author has endeavored to
illustrate, and he hopes his exertions have not been unsuccessful.

The inimitable beauty and variety, both of structure and colors, which
distinguish the natural productions of warmer regions, will always obtrude on
the attention of European Naturalists, and agreeably diversify a study, that
without such auxiliary aid, might seem less interesting: yet we may observe,
that, to become well acquainted with exotic Natural History, it is necessary to
examine that of Europe. In England, like other northern countries, Nature
assumes a grave aspect, but yet presents an unbounded source of amusement and
information to the intelligent mind; and must merit the inquiries of learned
men, who are inclined to promote knowledge, or feel an interest in the credit
of the country.

Whoever has devoted much leisure to the study of Natural History, will be
surprised at the inconsiderable number of learned works on that subject that
are in the English language; and of those it may be said, as Edwards in 1760
Essays on Natural History.
remarks, that what we have are mostly translations from other languages. This
is not, however, the only blame; the artists of our country have been condemned
for pirating their figures from the works of foreign authors; and it must be
owned, this has been too frequently practiced. Since Edwards wrote his book,
Botany and Ornithology have undergone great improvements; and the latter in
particular, by the writings of Pennant; but more especially by Latham, who
having added the information of preceding authors to a correct description of
each Bird, seemed to leave little wanting of a complete British Ornithology,
but a series of accurately colored Figures of the different Species. To supply
this deficiency in particular, has been the aim of the Author of this Work; and
he trusts the Selection of rare Species that he has included in it, will
facilitate the study of that important and amusing branch of Natural History.
