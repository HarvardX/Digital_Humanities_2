TO Mr. GRAY, ON HIS ODES.
I.
REPINE not, GRAY, that our weak dazzled Eyes
Thy daring heights and brightness shun,
How few can track the Eagle to the skies,
Or like Him, gaze upon the Sun!
II.
The gentle Reader loves the gentle Muse,
That little dares, and little means,
Who humbly sips her Learning from Reviews,
Or flutters in the Magazines.
III.
No longer now from Learning's sacred Store
Our Minds their health and vigor draw;
HOMER, and PINDAR are revered no more,
No more the Stagyrite is Law.
IV.
Though nursed by these, in vain thy Muse appears,
To breath her ardors in our Souls;
In vain to sightless Eyes, and deaden'd Ears
The Lightning gleams, and Thunder rolls!
V.
Yet droop not, GRAY, nor quit thy Heaven-born Art,
Again thy wondrous Powers reveal,
Wake slumbering Virtue in the Briton's Heart.
And rouse Us to reflect, and feel!
VI.
With ancient Deeds our long-chill'd Bosoms fire,
Those Deeds, which mark ELIZA's reign!
Make Britons, Greeks again -- Then strike the Lyre,
And PINDAR shall not Sing in vain.
