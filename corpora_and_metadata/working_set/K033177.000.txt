THE CAMPAIGN, etc.
ACT I.
CHORUS. -- Officers. LET the voice of triumph rise,
To hail with songs of joy this happy morn;
On conquest's purple pinions borne,
The martial sound shall reach the skies.
Where the sun points his sloping ray,
The burnished helm and spear with transient gleam,
Glittering to the orient beam,
With brighter radiance gild the day.
CHORUS. -- Officers. When glory invites us,
No danger alarms,
When honor excites us,
No pleasure has charms;
Though beauty enthralls us,
Her raptures we fly,
When bright glory calls us
To conquer or die.
His country requiring, nor wit, wine, nor love,
The heart of a soldier from honor can move.
Though beauty may charm him, his bold deeds proclaim,
Who sighs for his nymph, yet will bleed for his fame.

SONG. -- Lucy. WHEN hope to raise the drooping heart,
With flattering prospects points the scene,
Weak is the bliss she can impart,
For hope is ever mixed with pain.
II.
Around the couch with roses spread,
Where the sweet nymph reclines her head;
Still her pale sisters doubt and fear,
With trembling pinions flutter near.

SONG. -- Maria. YET know that pity's tender sighs
Can this softened bosom swell,
For when one faithful lover dies,
Thus I ring his knell:
Farewell, farewell,
Ding, ding, dong, bell.
But when another swain appears,
Doomed to fill the vacant place,
I dry my eyes, for constant tears
Serve but to spoil the face.

SONG -- Lucy. HARK ye, my dear, but don't tell,
Though my Daddy may try to persuade,
La, la, la, la!
I Will never lead apes in hell,
La, la, la, la!
As I must if I die an old maid.
II.
Coy maids often frown and deny,
When the youth of their hearts speak his mind;
Yet maids they wish not to die,
La, la, la, la!
And that truth perhaps shortly you will find.

SONG -- Farquahar. IN Carlow town there lived a maid,
More fair than flowers at daybreak;
Their vows contending lovers paid,
But none of marriage dared speak.
Still with a sigh,
'Twas Oh, I die!
Each day my passion's stronger:
When sprightly Nancy straight would say,
You Will die, dear sir, the Irish way,
To live a little longer.
II.
At length grown jealous, Venus cries,
This pride is past all bearing;
And straight sent Mars down from the skies
In form of Captain Daring.
First with a sigh,
He cried I die --
The god found passion stronger:
And sprightly Nancy still did say,
You Will die, dear sir, the Irish way,
To live a little longer.
III.
At length, like soldier bold he pressed,
And quickly saw by Nancy
The snow was thawed all in her breast,
A soldier caught her fancy:
With downcast eye,
She breathed a sigh,
Her passions still grew stronger;
'Till Nancy was obliged to say,
I Will die myself the Irish way,
To live a little longer.

SONG. -- Saib. SWEET is the blackbird's whistled note,
Sweet the thrush's mellow song;
While the wood-lark's liquid throat
Pours the warbled strain along,
Sweet the music of the vocal grove,
Sweeter the voice of her I love.

SONG. -- Susan. PRAY what has a promise in it,
If the heart be not sincere?
Bubble of the present minute,
Melting soon in empty air.
II.
Men still strive to overreach us,
When we cheat the silly elves;
Since we practice, what they teach us,
Let them only blame themselves.

SONG. -- Gregory. KEEP off if you vex a woman,
'Till she gives her passion vent;
In her fury she spares no man,
But her tongue goes click and clack;
Click, click, clack; and ticka, ticke, tack,
'Till her rage in noise is spent.
II.
Women, when the fidgets seize 'em,
Ride one like a foundered nag:
They are gentle, 'till you teize 'em;
Then their tongue goes, click and clack;
Click, click, clack; and ticka, ticke, tack,
'Till it can no longer wag.

SONG. -- Saib. FLATTERING hope, no more deceive (...),
Wherefore will you haunt thy breast?
Fond deluder, leave, Oh, leave me,
I can never more be blessed.
II.
Ah! Sweet Siren, lull no more
My senses with thy magic strain;
The fancied dream of bliss is over,
And now I wake to real pain.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SONG. -- Saib. A Breast cold to love, is no where to be found,
The grave and the gay all alike feel the wound;
In vain the sweet poison we'd shun, or we'd hide,
It ebbs and it flows in the heart like a tide.
Oh love, sooth my heart.
II.
Doubt and fear are the guards that still wait upon love,
In absence what pains two fond bosoms must prove!
But the moment the cloud is removed from the sight,
It Is a whole year of sunshine, for one single night.
Oh love, sooth my heart.
II.
The sun over our heads, that in glory now shines,
Ripes the di'mond and gold, in rich India's sweet mines;
But a gem lights the bosom of her I adore,
Which will sparkle when di'monds and gold are no more.
Oh love, sooth my heart.

SONG. -- Howitzer. WOMEN's tongues in motion,
Are restless as the ocean;
For when their clack
Begins to crack,
No mortal can the blow shun.
II.
Female truth's a fable,
The widow in her fable
Never sighs in bed,
For husbands dead,
But those alive and able.
III.
Woman's heart's a riddle,
With men they toil and fiddle;
Then here they skip,
And there they trip
Like geese upon a griddle.
IV.
Maids when with lads they spark it,
Would still the golden mark hit:
The fairest toast
Asks, who bids most,
Like cattle brought to market.

DUETT. -- Susan and Gregory. Greg. SUSAN, will you love me?

Sus. No, no, no.
Surely you have impudence, all impupudence exceeding.

Greg. You must kiss me, Susan,

Sus. No, no, no.
Marry set you up, Sir, I prithee let me go,
Think not that one of my breeding
Ever will descend so low.

Greg. Stay my dear, you must not go,
Come this anger's all pretending;
Sure I know you, love me.

Sus. No, no, no.
You Will see Mr. Simpleton what it will end in.

Greg. Let us kiss and friends then.

Sus. No, no, no,
Never, never, Lord how can you teaze a body so?

SONG. -- Susan. Wherefore languish,
Pale with anguish?
Though she swears she will never be kind,
Don't believe her,
Maids are ever
Gently forced to change their mind.
II.
Then take courage,
Mind not her rage,
Though she frowning answer no!
If she is tender,
She Will surrender,
If she is tough, even let her go.

SONG, (Drill) and CHORUS. COME hither, all ye lads,
Who lead unhappy lives,
Whom bailiffs hunt, or duns molest,
Or scolding wives.
To the standard all advancing,
Drink in plenty, singing dancing;
The drum calls away,
My lads no longer stay.
To the standard etc.
II
All ye to cruel masters
Bound in servile chains,
Who make you work
Like Jew or Turk,
And starve you for your pains.
To the standard, etc.

SONG. -- Rifle. MERRILY rolls the soldiers life;
Come, my brave boys, all fill your glasses;
Joy succeeds to toil and strife,
Fill to the brim a health to our lasses.
While jovial thus we laugh and sing,
The circling hours new pleasures bring:
Merrily, merrily, frolic and play,
And sport the cares of life away.
Laughs.
SONG. -- Gregory. THOUGH to eating and sleeping a stranger,
He gives me no thanks but a blow or a kick,
Tied up like a dog in a manger;
But my collar I Have slipped and I Will play him a trick:
His house but a cage is,
His beggarly wages,
Sour crout and sausages,
I pitch to old Nick.
II.
Though I work like a mule or a neger,
Till my heart like my coat to tatters is rent;
My visage pale, hollow and meagre,
My stomach and guts still doomed to keep lent:
Though toiling and drudging,
Yet sour and in dudgeon,
The cross old curmudgeon
Is never content.

SONG. -- Susan. THOUGH now you saucy and proud are,
You sot, too late you will find,
When food for ball and powder,
You Have left your brains behind.
You fool, when hunger pinches,
You Will rot and die by inches,
Glad for a morsel to beg,
Though now you saucy and proud are,
Propp'd on a wooden leg!

SONG. -- Gregory. ZOUNDS! do not lay so hard on!
Pox take you all; unhand me, oh!
Good sir, I ask your pardon,
I Will do as you command me, oh!
Hold, hold, sir,
Behold, sir,
My sides all black and blue are grown;
Your ferkins,
And jerkins,
Would wear me soon to skin and bone.
You Have beat me to a jelly,
My heart with those disasters
Is sunk into my belly.
Hold, hold, etc.

SONG. -- Maria. 'TWAS not his shape or air,
So smart and debonair,
That stole my heart away;
Wit, or speaking eyes,
Vows, or melting sighs,
'Twas something, I knew not what;
'Twas neither this or that;
Something I cannot say.

SONG. -- Farquar. OH, chide not, my charmer, nor think me a rover,
A Soldier, of course, is a general lover;
With a row dow, stand clear all,
Ye beauties, both high and low;
Oh, in love still I must fall,
Sweet creatures, wherever I go.
II.
One day I bow down to the toasts of the city,
And next am in love with a bar-maid, if ptetty.
With a row dow, etc
III.
Those eyes, and those lips like two ripe budding roses,
To temptation still my heart it exposes.
With a row dow, etc.
IV.
I meet beauties like you, and my fancy they bother,
And make me adore your sweet self in another.
With a row dow, etc.

SONG. -- Saib. FROM tree to tree, from flower to flower,
The inconstant Zephyr strays;
Not even the sweetest rose has power
To fix his wandering breeze.
II.
The faithful stream that round yon hill
Its winding current leads,
In Its first channel murmurs still,
Nor roves to distant meads.
III.
Ah, heedless youth, behold in these
The emblems of our flame;
Thine, rover, is the wandering breeze,
And mine the faithful stream.

DUETT. -- Lucy and Saib. IF you would know what pain it is to part,
Ask, ask, this bleeding heart,
That almost breaks when I must leave thee!
To you I Will still prove true till death,
And then I Will spend my latest breath
In sighs, my love, that I must leave thee.

END OF ACT SECOND.
ACT III.
SONG. -- Sulphur. FAR hence away
Banish care and sorrow;
Laugh and sing today,
Death may come tomorrow;
Let Us drink then while we may,
It Is wine that makes us brisk and gay.
CHORUS. It Is wine, etc.
II.
Far. Should Cupid's dart
Your lover wound and teaze you,
From the cruel smart
No power on earth can ease you,
'Till Bacchus aid impart;
It Is wine that chears and warms the heart.
CHORUS. It Is wine, etc.
III.
Flag. No bliss sincere
The gods on earth have granted;
Love brings despair,
And wealth by care is haunted.
True pleasure would you share,
In wine are joys unmixed with care.
CHORUS. In wine, etc.

SONG. -- Lucy. THE dawn its pure blushes spreads over the ground,
While nature breathes fresh all the fragrance around,
The goldfinch and linnet sing blythe from the thorn,
And the lark sweetly carols his hymn to the morn.
II.
But the goldfinch and linnet now warble in vain,
And joyless to me is the sun-gilded plain;
Nor the sweet breathing morn, nor the songs of the grove,
Can soothe the fond bosom that is tortured by love.

QUARTETTO. Farquar, Saib, Lucy, Maria. WITH mirth and good humor, a dance,
and a song,
Let the eve like the morn glide with pleasure along,
And night from our bosoms all cares shall remove,
But the sweetest of cares, the soft tumults of love.

SONG. -- Rifle. IF you would learn to be a soldier,
Cock your hat fiercely and march wiih a bold air,
Fill all your thoughts with bloodshed and battle,
And make the air ring when your firelocks you rattle.
CHORUS. Fall, lal, lal, etc.
II.
Squeeze back your shoulders, and thrust out your craw, Sir,
And strut to and fro like a stately jack-daw, Sir,
Look well all around you and cry to each stranger,
Answer, "who goes there?" or your life is in danger.
CHORUS. Fall, lal, lal, etc.

AIR. -- Gregory. (The words by Mr. O'Keeffe.) YE serving-men both great and
small,
Of high and low degree,
As I stand here see my downfall,
And warning take by me.
Too late I find that to my cost,
Preferment all is vain,
I willingly resign my post,
To get my place again!
With a cut, slash, dash, and a gravy sop,
Hob, nob,
Tingle, gingle,
Then to wash the way down with a chirping drop.
II
Men I must kill with my firelock,
Who never a man could lick,
And never killed but once a cock,
And that was with my stick.
To such I never would turn my back,
So much I Will safely boast,
No drum need beat to the attack,
Of either boiled or roast.
With a cut, etc.
III.
You never shall say, away I ran
In such a glorious work;
I am a valiant trencher-man --
My weapons, knife and fork.
A rush I care not for the French;
What Is Tippoo Saib to me?
Sweet Susan come, kind rosy wench!
My captain you shall be.
With a cut, etc.

SONG. -- Gregory. I NOW am a slave and a tool,
Afraid of the stick and the rod;
No schoolboy ever trembled at school
As I do at Corporal Squad.
II.
I thought him as great as the King,
When he gave me a shilling, ecod!
But soon I will caper and sing,
And Old Nick may take Corporal Squad.
FINALE. PEACE, mild peace, on seraphs wings,
Wafted over the distant main,
Every bliss propitious brings,
Pleasure sporting in her train.
War and frantic discord cease,
Cease to spread destruction round;
Drums redouble, trumpets sound,
To the welcome voice of peace.

THE END.
