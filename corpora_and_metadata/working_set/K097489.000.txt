THE Way to be Rich and Respectable.
ADDRESSED TO MEN of small FORTUNE.
THE great degree of luxury to which this country has arrived, within a few
years, is not only astonishing but almost dreadful to think of. Time was, when
those articles of indulgence, which now every mechanic aims at the possession
of, were enjoyed only by the Lord or Baron of a district. Men were then happy
to be the vassals or dependants of that Lord, and prided themselves in little
but their submission and allegiance. This was the state of things during feudal
government: but as, on the increase of trade, riches increased; men began to
feel new wants, they became gradually less hardy and robust, grew effeminate as
their property accumulated, and sighed for indulgences they never dreamed of
before. -- Methods of conveying these indulgencies from one part of the kingdom
to another were then studied; roads were made passable, and carriages invented.

For many ages coaches were so great a luxury, that none but old families were
seen in them; and if they attempted, once in a dozen years, to travel a few
miles in one, perhaps, in the course of the journey, a whole village with their
teams were called in aid, to drag the heavy vehicle out of the clay, and set it
on its wheels again: -- riding on horseback being the only means of visiting a
neighbor, beyond the reach of a walk, and that only in the summertime. And it
is but a very few years since, that ladies went about, from place to place,
upon a pillion. Made roads were then unknown, and so little desire had the
people to stir, beyond the bounds of their parish, that even mending them was
never thought of.

On the establishment of posts, a general communication was opened between all
parts of the kingdom, and people received intelligence of every little
improvement that was made: a desire to inspect those improvements, gave men an
excentric turn; they were eager to see what was doing at some distance from
home, and rambled wide for that purpose. The inconvenience, and indeed
impossibility of traveling, but at certain seasons of the year, led the way to
the making of roads; making of roads drew thousands abroad, and a wish to be
thought opulent by those whom they visited, led them into luxury of dress. The
homespun garb then gave way to more costly attire, and respectable plainness
was soon transformed into laughable frippery.

In a few years, refinements took place in manners, and well had it been, were
they merely refinements; but the misfortune is, they soon spread into
extravagancies, and from being commendable, became objects of censure. In the
reign of Charles I. luxuries were every where seen, and though the Civil Wars
for some time smothered them, they broke out afresh in the reign of Charles II.
Wealth then poured in upon the nation; gentlemen vied with each in the
appearance they made; many by these means were ruined, estates changed their
possessors, a fluctuation of property began, and every succeeding year gave
birth to fresh wants and new expenses. Luxury however had not then gained its
present footing: it is true, the profligacy of the capital made some inroads
upon the country, but the inhabitants of the country looked on it with dread
and astonishment. Some of the nobility and principal gentry, at this time,
spent part of their winter in London, but the rest of the year they lived
amongst their tenants with their usual hospitality. The expenses of this age
were confined to the education of their children, to their houses, their
buildings, their furniture, their attendants and their entertainments; and
their tenants and neighbors were considerably the better for it: the more they
circulated their property within their own estates, the richer their estates
became, and the more powerful and respectable they grew. Effeminacy of manners
was then seen only in cities; balls and assemblies were scarcely known, and
equipages far from being general.

Matters however rested not here. Things gazed at with astonishment quickly
grew familiar: the infection of the first class soon spread among the second,
and what they formerly censured, they presently approved. Gentlemen of small
estates began annually to visit the capital; they gradually made their visits
longer and longer, till, at last, it became the fashion to reside only in the
country, when the heat made it intolerable in town. Stagecoaches were
established, the communication between London and the country became more and
more open, a taste for elegancies spread itself through all ranks and degrees
of men, and an equipage was considered as a necessary of life.

What is the case now? Are things otherwise than they were? No; expenses are
yet increasing, and we are still refining upon luxuries. The several cities and
large towns of this island catch the manners of the metropolis, and are vicious
and extravagant, in proportion to the wealth and number of their inhabitants.
Scarce a town now, of any magnitude, but has its Theater Royal, its concerts,
its balls, and its card-parties. The notions of splendor and amusement that
prevail in the Capital are eagerly adopted; the various changes of the fashion
exactly copied, and the whole manner of life studiously imitated. Flys and
machines pass from city to city; great towns become the winter residence of
those whom slenderness of fortune will not carry to London, and the country is
every where deserted.

If I might presume to dictate to the world, I would venture to say, that a man
of landed property is never so respectable as when refident on his estate; when
improving his lands and enriching his tenants; when his beneficence may be read
in the looks of the poor; when his house is open, not with the stiffness of a
public day, that tells the neighborhood he would not be perplexed at another
time, but with all the hospitality of an ancient Baron.

Gentlemen of very extensive property may act as they please; the dissipation
and expenses of a capital can no other ways injure them than in the opinion of
their neighbors; but as to men of small fortune, the less they see of London
the better. Look round among the families we know, and we can easily trace the
infection of the metropolis; the more they pay their visits there, and the
longer they continue, the more visible are their follies, and not only their
follies, but their failings and their vices. The honest frankness of the
country gentleman is obliterated by the equivocal politeness of the courtier,
and the open sincerity of the good neighbor lost in the artifice and deceit of
the man of fashion.

For many years a country squire has been an object of ridicule: but, why? No
other reason can be given, but that want of polish that too often characterizes
the fops of the age. If we divest ourselves of prejudice, he will not appear in
so contemptible a light: it is true, he may want taste and politeness, but he
may possess qualities infinitely superior. Honest unadorned freedom is
preferable to studied and fashionable deceit. The country squire lives upon his
estate, spends his patrimony among his tenants and his neighbors, (which form,
as it were, but one family around him) and a spirit of hospitality opens his
doors to every comer; while the fine gentleman visits his domain, perhaps, but
once in the summer, stays there as little as he can help, disdains any
familiarity with his neighbors, neglects his grounds, and leaves his tenants
at the mercy of his steward, In short, an effeminate life emasculates the fine
gentleman, and renders him unfit for any thing but sipping of tea, and dealing
the cards; whilst the robust and manly exercises of the squire keep him healthy
and hardy, and, inured to hunger, danger and fatigue, enable him, when called
upon in the public cause, to be of real service to his country.

But it is to be lamented, that the true country gentleman is seldom to be
found. The luxuries and effeminacies of the age have softened down the hardy
roughness of former times; and the country, like the capital, is one scene of
dissipation. If there be any economy in their expenses, it is merely the saving
of necessaries, to waste on superfluities: the private gentleman with three or
four hundred pounds a year must have his horses, his dogs, his pictures, his
carriages, his parties of pleasure, equally with him of five times his fortune:
dress, show and entertainment engross his attention; his lands are unimproved;
debts accumulate upon him; he mortgages his estate; and, when he has lived to
the end of his fortune, he either puts a dreadful period to his existence, or
wears out the remainder of his life, a beggar.

However alarming this picture may be, it is nevertheless a just one. As I take
it, the happiness of life consists in health, ease, and competency, which is as
much within the reach of a gentleman of three hundred pounds a year, as one of
three thousand. If the articles of living are dearer than they were some few
years back, (and they certainly are, a hundred per cent.) it ought to quicken
the industry of every one, to increase his income, if possible, or reduce his
expense in proportion to his fortune.

It is not in the power of men, who have the income only of a small estate to
support them, to increase their revenues; but they may decrease their expenses,
or lay out their money to advantage. Frugality and economy have put many upon a
footing with men of larger fortunes; and often made them far more respectable.
-- Nothing gives superiority in life, but independency. Whilst we are at the
command of another, we are in a state of subordination: it is being master of
one's self only, that makes a man free; and it is independency that makes him
great.

Now, be our fortune as great as it will, we are never independent, whilst we
are in debt; and can a man be said to be free, while it is in the power of his
tailor or his shoemaker to confine him? A mistaken notion, that a reduction in
our way of living is disgraceful, has led many a man to his ruin. Retrenching
our expenses, when we have lived too fast, is a proof of good sense; it
declares an abhorrence of our follies, and a determination to be in future
free. It is highly degrading to make a figure at the expense of others.
Villains of every denomination have done it; an honest man therefore will
despise the thought; and, if his connections have insensibly led him on, from
one expense to another, till he finds himself involved, he will pursue the
earliest and the readiest means to discharge his debts and set himself at
liberty.

Such is the absurdity in life, that men are rated in worth, according to the
appearance they make. "Keep up appearances," -- said a dissipated poet, Keep up
appearances: there lies the test!
The world will give thee credit for the rest.


This idle notion has brought on the destruction of thousands. In this
luxurious age, wealth is the only object of admiration; and to wear the
appearance of wealth, we become expensive and extravagant in our manner of
living. Thus we go on, 'till we exhaust the little property we possess; and,
when we can keep ourselves no longer afloat, on what is called Credit, we sink
into beggary and contempt.

He who lives within his income, may be truly called a rich man. It is this
that gives the Hollanders the reputation of being wealthy. They never live to
the extent of their fortunes; and, of course, are able to do a deal of good. A
family estate with them is seldom put up to sale; whereas with us, inheritances
are ever at market. A Dutchman contributes as largely and as cheerfully to the
exigencies of the state, or to the erection of a public building, as he would
to the repairs of his house, or the decoration of his garden.

To be respectable, it is not necessary to live in a certain line of life. --
Every man may be considered as the center of a circle; some of a larger, some
of a smaller; and, in this light, he is of greater or of less importance,
according to the character he bears. -- He who has fewest wants, and is most
able to live within himself, is not only the happiest, but the richest man; and
if he does not abound in what the world calls Wealth, he does in independency.
-- Though he may not be a Peer of his own country, he is a Lord of the
creation; may fill his station equal to the first of men; and look down with
pity and contempt on the tinselled sycophant, though covered with an ermined
robe, and parading with a ducal coronet.

I will allow, it is rather mortifying to see a neighbor of less pretensions
than ourselves, living in a degree of splendor which we cannot reach. If his
fortune be large enough, to admit of it, it is well; if not, he is an object of
contempt. But, be it as it may, whilst we have sufficient to command the
necessaries and indulgencies of life, (wanting the superfluities) and do
absolutely enjoy them, we are in a situation equal to any man; and if we keep
but a pair of horses, and pay for that pair, we are far more respectable, in
the eyes of sensible people, than he who is drawn in a coach and six, but his
gate everlastingly crowded with importunate creditors.

Persons with circumscribed fortunes, or whose family increases upon them,
would do well to retrench their expenses in time; or retire from towns, and lay
out their money with economy. It is wonderful to think what an appearance in
life a person may make for a little money, who resides wholly in the country,
and makes the most of what he possesses. I speak not to persons in trade, as
the scheme may be impracticable with them, but to gentlemen of small fortune,
who, in a rural retreat, with a few acres of land, may live as well on three or
four hundred pounds a year, as many do, on three times the sum. The occupier of
a middling farm enjoys all the necessaries and conveniences of life, and many
of its superfluities. Where shall we meet with better health, than where
temperance and exercise enliven our minds, invigorate our bodies, and give a
constant flow of spirits? A country life is commonly a cheerful one; we there
meet few of those rubs that embitter the hours of other men, and are the too
constant attendants on ambition and vanity. It is there only that true
happiness and independency can be found; where honesty and the best of manners
mark the man; and where employment exempts from the ill effects of luxury

The following then is an estimate whereby, a gentleman, with a wife, four
children, and five servants, living in the country, may, with frugality, save
2500l. in the course of twenty years, keep two of his children at a
boardingschool, drink wine every day at his table, keep a carriage and four
horses, and make an appearance equal to 1000l. a year, for half the money; and
may, with the further addition of a small farm, live equally well for
considerably less.

THE FAMILY ESTIMATE.
Annually. L. s. d. Rent of a house, with about 35 acres of land Of these 35
acres, about 22 should be grass. If so much pasture land cannot be got, shift
must be made by laying down lands with artificial grasses, such as clover,
lucerne, saintsoin, etc. The additional produce of which will sufficiently
atone for the expenses attending them. Many houses may be procured for this
price, and geateel once, even within 20 miles of London; if further off, for
much loss.
60 0 0 Taxes and tithes Supposing the house and land rated at 40l. a year, and
the house to pay for 20 windows. I allow 2 s. per acre for tithe, but nothing
for the highway rate, which is 1l. 7s. per annum. as the horses may do the
statute duty.

week, or 6 10 0 Candles, 6 lb. per week, at 7s. 8d. per dozen Mould and common
candles may be bought together, at the price of common ones. Wax candles in the
parlour occasionally, will not make 20 shillings ayear difference in the
expense, they burning double the time of tallow.

Port wine, half made wine. Port wine, if a pipe, is bought between two or three
friends, and bottled at home, will not cost the buyer more than 1s. 5d. per
bottle; the made wine half the price, together, 5s. 3 d. What is saved in wine,
may be expended in brandy or rum.
13 16 0 Threads, tapes, and all sorts of haberdashery, 1s. 9d. per week, or 4

The following book will assist upon this business, price One Shilling, pasted
in marble paper, and not bigger than a pocket almanac, sold by J. BELL in the
Strand, the Garden-Companion for gentlemen and ladies; or, a Calendar, pointing
out what should be done every month, in the green-house, flower, fruit, and
kitchen garden: With the proper seasons for sowing, planting, etc. (with the
time when the produce may be expected) so as to have a regular succession of
flowers and vegetables throughout the year. To which are added, a complete lift
of the flowers and shrubs that blow each month. With some curious observations.

With the help of this book, any country servant may be instructed to look
after a small piece of ground at a very little expense; make that ground go a
great way, and supply their tables with every thing in season. The ladies also
are here instructed how to dispose their flowers to the best advantage, and to
procure a general bloom throughout the year.


and footman 12 0 0 Carried forward 214 3 8

wages, but clothed from his master's old wardrobe This boy to drive the plough
occasionally, or ride and drive when the carriage is used as a post-charse, or

of a four-wheeled carriage, 5 0 0 Wear and tear of ditto, and harness By
applying to some coach-makers, you may change your set of wheels every year for
a strong second-hand set at 1l. the set, which will reduce the expenses of this
article. A good fashionable second-hand carriage may be frequently met with for
about 20l. which, when fresh painted, at about the expense of 6l. will look as
well as new.

years, in order to leave each child and a widow, if there should be one, 500 l.

OBSERVATION.
It may not be unnecessary to remark, that 15 or 20 per cent. may be saved by
paying ready money for what we buy; besides preventing things being charged the
family never had. Buy your grocery and such things, as country shopkeepers
have from London, always in London; and such things they purchase at distance
from town, endeavor to get at the first hand in the country.

OBSERVATIONS.
N. B. The crops on the lands should be changed every year, but this will not
alter the real product.

In cultivating these 35 acres of land, the horses will be employed only about
52 days in the year, which, on an average, is only one day in the week: of
course your farming servant will often be at liberty to thresh your corn, and
do many other things: this will save much of the money I have charged for
labor.

I have allowed a fourth horse in this estimate, as, should the gentleman be
fond of riding, he may keep one for that purpose. The other three I would
recommend should match in color and size, and should have nag tails; as,
should one fall lame, another is ready to supply its place; besides they may
occasionally be used as saddle-horses; or were the whole four to match, with a
very little extra-expence in the harness, and an additional jacket to lay by,
they might all be put to the carriage at times.

No. 3 The Meat-Estimate.
Twelve porkers should be killed yearly, that is, about one a-month, and 4 hogs
for bacon, thus, Twelve porkers, at 7 stone each, or 56 lb. give of meat 672
lb. Four hogs One sow is sufficient to supply the family with sixteen hogs
yearly.
for bacon, at 25 stone each, or 100 lb. gives 800 lb. 1472

1472 lb. of meat is about 28 lb. weekly, equal to four days provision for 9
persons, Lest living on swine's fresh four days in a week should be thought
improper, it may be observed, that your butcher will occasionally take a side
of pork and give other meat in exchange, thus you need eat pork only two days
in the week and the other two, bacon or ham with poultry.
and

Fowls, ducks, turkeys, pigeons and geese, will give the fifth day's provision
for the same number.

The expense of the above is included in the farm. All that is necessary then
to be paid for meat, is the provision of a days: thus L. s. d. 9 lb. beef or
mutton, at 5 d. 0 3 9 5 lb. fish Salt fish, bought of a wholesale dealer, will
not cost more than 3 d. per lb. which will allow more to be paid for fresh
fish: besides, if near a river, some kinds of fish may be caught occasionally.
at 6 d. 0 2 6 Per week, 0 6 3 Or per year, L. 16 5 0

No. 4. The Horse-Estimate.
Horses may be turned out to grass from about may 20, to October 20, they then
should be taken into the stable and straw-fed, with corn, till about February
20; after this they should be fed with hay and corn till May 20 again.

Now it will require of grass to feed 4 horses through the summer, with the
addition of lattermath and turning into stubble, 4 Acres. When fed with hay,
each horse will eat about 5 trusses per week; Brought on but I allow 6 trusses
to afford for hay cut into chaff; this amounts to about two loads for each
horse; 8 for the four. 4 Acres. If a pair of these horses are used often in the
carriage, they should never be kept upon straw; of course, while the other two
are fed on straw, these will eat about 5 loads more of hay; this, with the 8
loads reckoned above, will be the produce of 9 Acres 13

I allow each horse half a peck of oats a day, from Oct. 20 to May 20; that is,
3 quarters, 2 bushels, 1 peck, which, for the four, is about 13 quarters; but
it may be necessary to give the carriage horses the same quantity all the
summer, which in the whole consumes 17 quarters and a half. The other two
horses need no corn in the summer, unless; very hard worked.

N.B. To save grass and oats, green clover might be given to horses in the
stable, till near the middle of October; for while they feed on this, corn is
not necessary.

L. s. d. Horses should have as much chaff as they will cat. Besides the chaff
of the corn, give each a bushel of cut chaff daily (hay and straw mixed) which
will cost a halfpenny per bushel cutting, and that for the time he is in the
stable will be 210 bushels, etc. 0 8 9 Shoeing, once in six weeks, at 1s. and

No. 5. The Cow-Estimate,
Acres. Supposing a cow to be dry three months in the year, during which time
she may be fed upon straw, there will require only 9 months good feed. Now, one
acre and a half of grass will feed her well from the time you lay your pastures
up for hay; suppose from the middle of April to the middle of October (six
months) with the occasionally turning them on the common and into the stubbles.
The spring grass of those pastures, before laid up for hay, will keep her from
the middle of February to the middle of April (one month) so that there are but
two months to feed her on hay, and she will, in three months, allowing a little
for waste, eat about two loads, that is at the rate of 40 lb. per day. Thus the
three cows will eat six loads, the produce of 4 Acres. And also the grass in
summer of 4 8

A cow, with this keeping, will yield milk and cream for the family, and on an
average, about 132 lb. of butter and 215 lb. of cheese, but in order to this
they must be young cows.

Three cows then will yield annually 396 lb. or about 7 lb. and a half per
week, enough for the family.

Also 645 lb. of cheese annually, that is about 12 lb. per week, enough for the
family.

The skimmed milk will go a great way toward keeping the pigs; and three
calves annually will serve to meet other little expenses not thought of. Care
must be taken to have two of these cows always in milk.

L. s. d. The decline in value of these cows will be annually, about 2 10 0

IF a gentlemen, by way of amusement, or lessening his expenses, will add about
fifty acres of land more to his thirty-five, he may, with the same number of
servants, excepting a little assistance at harvest, reap the following
advantages, with this difference only, that it will require a little more of
his own attention, and leave his men and horses less at leisure to wait upon
him. He must then send the produce of his farm to market, and, instead of
keeping a horse merely for the saddle, he must admit him to draw occasionally:
But even here, he may have his horses for his pleasure, on an average, two or
three days in the week.

These fifty acres I will suppose to be arable, and as land will produce more
one year than another, I will give a course of crops for seven years, and show
the annual profits on an average. The course then shall be, supposing the
ground to be tolerably good, 1 Turnips 2 Wheat 3 Barley 4 Clover 5 Clover 6
Beans 7 Oats


Although it will be necessary to have some of each kind every year, the
amount, at the year's end, with good management, will be the same.

leaves 305 l. 10 s. the total expenses of keeping the family, etc.

OBSERVATIONS.
All lands will not yield the same course of crops, but the produce in seven
years will be nearly the same.

I have supposed the ground to be tolerably good, and a particular attention to
be paid in keeping it clean, well dressed, and in good tilth: for this purpose
no straw is to be sold off the farm but wheat straw. It is all to be converted
into fodder and dung.

If the farming servant can be spared at times, he may thresh much of the grain
himself; this will be a saving: and there are still many advantages to be
reaped, if a man will enter into the spirit of farming, from a neighboring
common, in breeding sheep, bringing up heifers, etc. and keeping geese.

In short, a tolerable good farm will, upon an average, produce, with good
management, 30 s. or 40 s. per acre, free of all expenses.

The price that corn bears, will often make an alteration in the profits of a
farm, but I have set it a medium price.

If you wish to keep dogs, I will suppose the game you kill, to pay the expense
of them.

To such as wish to keep a few sheep, the following estimate will be acceptable.

Fine large ewes with lamb, may be bought in at Michaelmas, at about 22 s.
each, which in the July following will sell again for L. s. d. 1 1 0 The lamb
will then sell for 1 7 0 The wool of the two, shorn before sold, will sell for
about 0 4 6 2 12 6 Deduct the first cost 1 2 0 Leaves profit 1 10 6

OBSERVATIONS.
It will take about an acre of grass to fatten five sheep; but, where grass is
not plentiful, they may be fed on stubble till Christmas, then on turnips till
May Day; next on rye, and then on clover till sold. No meadows will do for
sheep in the winter, that are wet enough to let them sink up to the first joint
of their legs; it will rot them.

Note. An acre of turnips will feed 100 for the space of ten days, or about
eight sheep from Christmas Day to May Day.

N. B. Dung of sheep, when folded upon land, for the richness of the manure, is
equal in value to the profits arising from the sale of them.

The principle Implements necessary for a small Farm, are A wagon, and a
harness for ditto. A broad-wheeled cart, and a harness for ditto, A plough. A
pair of large harrows. Ditto smaller. A roller. A winnow. A seed kit.


Shovels, rakes, measures, sacks, sieves, etc. and the whole may be bought new
for about 60 l.

If a gentleman does not understand farming, he may soon acquire the knowledge
from a clever servant.

The following estimate will serve to show into what expenses some persons run,
for want of produce and economy, expending that on a carriage, which would
maintain a family comfortably and elegantly.

he is obliged to buy his Provender.

L. s. d. Brought on 111 4 0 Farrier, on an average, a set of shoes to each
horse once in about six weeks 3 15 0 Hay, about 7 trusses per week, or about 11
loads per year, at 3l. 10s. 38 10 0 Oats, a peck a day for each horse, that is,
about 46 quarters, at 18s. per quarter Beans are not necessary, unless the
horses are very hard worked.
26 8 0 Straw, about 6 loads, or 4 trusses per week, at 25s. per load 7 10 0
Wear and tear, and new painting once in two years This estimate supposes the
equipage to be kept up with a degree of elegance.
36 0 0 Decline in value of the horses Horses of about 40l. value each.
24 0 0 Every additional horse for the saddle will cost as follows, and indeed
there is no coach and four to be kept without five horses, lest one should fall

and a half 1 17 6 Decline in value of the horse 6 0 0 Wear of saddles, etc.
about 0 13 6 287 14 6

Note. These expenses may be reduced, but not to make a genteel appearance. No
allowance is here made for the occasional death of a horse, nor for waste of
hay and corn.

N. B. There are turnpikes, and sundry charges, when out, that ought to be
considered also as part of the expense of keeping a carriage.

FINIS.
