THE CARPENTER; Or, the DANGER of EVIL COMPANY.
THERE was a young West-country man,
A Carpenter by trade;
A skilful wheelwright too was he,
And few such Wagons made.
No Man a tighter Barn could build,
Throughout his native town,
Through many a village round was he,
The best of workmen known.
His father left him what he had,
In sooth it was enough;
His shining pewter, pots of brass,
And all his household stuff.
A little cottage too he had,
For ease and comfort planned,
And that he might not lack for ought,
An acre of good land.
A pleasant orchard too there was,
Before his cottage door;
Of cider and of corn likewise,
He had a little store.
Active and healthy, stout and young,
No business wanted he;
Now tell me reader if you can,
What man more blessed could be?
To make his comfort quite complete,
He had a faithful Wife;
Frugal and neat and good was she,
The blessing of his life.
Where is the Lord, or where the Squire.
Had greater cause to praise,
The goodness of that bounteous hand,
Which blessed his prosperous days?
Each night when he returned from work,
His wife so meek and mild,
His little supper gladly dressed,
While he caressed his child.
One blooming babe was all he had,
His only darling dear,
The object of their equal love,
The solace of their care.
O what could ruin such a life,
And spoil so fair a lot?
O what could change so kind a heart,
All goodness quite forgot?
With grief the cause I must relate,
The dismal cause reveal,
'Twas EVIL COMPANY and DRINK,
The source of every ill.
A Cooper came to live hard by,
Who did his fancy please;
An idle rambling Man was he,
Who often had crossed the seas.
This Man could tell a merry tale,
And sing a merry song;
And those who heard him sing or talk,
Never thought the evening long.


But vain and vicious was the song,
And wicked was the tale;
And every pause he always filled,
With cider, gin, or ale.
Our Carpenter delighted much,
To hear the Cooper talk;
And with him to the Alehouse often,
Would take his evening walk.
At first he did not care for drink,
But only liked the ^un;
But soon he from the Cooper learnt,
The same sad course to run.
He said the Cooper's company,
Was all for which he cared;
But soon he drank as much as he,
To swear like him soon dared.
His hammer now neglected lay,
For work he little cared;
Half finished wheels, and broken tools,
Were strewn about his yard.
To get him to attend his work,
No prayers could now prevail:
His hatchet and his plane forgot,
He never drove a Nail.
His cheerful ev'nings now no more,
With peace and plenty smiled;
No more he sought his pleasing Wife,
Nor hugged his smiling child.
For not his drunken nights alone,
Were with the Cooper past;
His days were at the Angel spent,
And still he stayed the last.
No handsome Sunday suit was left,
Nor decent holland shirt;
No nosegay marked the Sabbath day,
But all was rags and dirt.
No more his Church he did frequent,
A symptom ever sad;
Where once the Sunday is misspent,
The week days must be bad.
The cottage mortgaged for its worth,
The favorite orchard sold;
He soon began to feel the effects
Of hunger and of cold.
The pewter dishes one by one,
Were pawned, till none was left;
And wife and babe at home remained
Of every help bereft.
By chance he called at home one nigh^
And in a surly mood,
He bade his weeping wife to get
Immediately some food.
His empty cupboard well he knew
Must needs be bare of bread;
No rasher on the rack he saw,
Whence could he then be fed?
His wife See B^rquin's Gardener.
a piteous sigh did heave,
And then before him laid
A basket covered with a cloth
But not a word she said.
Then to her husband gave a knife
With many a silent tear;
In haste he tore the cover off,
And saw his child lay there.
"There lies thy babe, the mother said,
"Oppressed with famine sore;
"O kill us both -- 'twere kinder far,
We could not suffer more."
The Carpenter, struck to the heart,
Fell on his knees straitway;
He wrung his hands -- confessed his sins,
And did both weep and pray.
From that same hour the Cooper more,
He never would behold;
Nor would he to the Alehouse go,
Had it been paved with gold.
His Wife forgave him all the past,
And soothed his sorrowing mind,
And much he grieved that ever he wronged
The worthiest of her kind.
By laboring hard, and working late,
By industry and pains,
His Cottage was at length redeemed,
And saved were all his gains.
His Sundays now at Church were spent,
His home was his delight.
The following verse himself he made,
And read it every night:
The Drunkard Murders Child and Wife,
Nor matters it a pin,
Whether he stabs them with his knife,
Or starves them by his gin.
