We have several species of the Papilio tribe, which are highly valued in
England either for their beauty or scarcity; the P. Lathonia is little, if by
any means, inferior to the most beautiful; and as a rare Insect is esteemed an
invaluable acquisition.

The upper side is only a plain orange or brown color, with spots of strong
black, and does not in general appearance differ materially from the greasy
Fritillary Butterfly, which is very common in most situations; but the
underside is entirely unlike every other English Insect: the bright silver
splashes on the under wings are singular in their form, and so beautifully
relieved by the orange ground color, and variegation of black between, as to
form a delightful contrast of the most pleasing colors.

Whether this species was originally a native of this country, may be doubtful;
we certainly have the most respectable testimonies of its being taken alive in
different parts of the kingdom, but it might have been introduced by accident
in the larva, or more probably in the pupa state: it has been seen at Bath; and
either Moses Harris, or some of his friends, bred it from the caterpillar.
"Queen of Spain Fritillaria changed into chryfalis April, appeared in the
winged state May 10th. -- Gambling Gay wood, near Cambridge."

It has also been taken near London; Mr. Honey, of Union-street, in the
Borough, took one a few years since in his garden. I requested the favor of
whatever information he could communicate respecting this circumstance, and
received a note with these words: --

September 9th, 1785.
-- I took the Queen of Spain Butterfly in my garden.

Fig. 4.
The Linnaean description of the Curculio Betulae, so nearly corresponds with
that of C. Populi, that if we allow for the variation of color to which all
Insects are subject, a line can scarcely be drawn between the two species; the
most material distinction is the underside of C. Betulae being of the same
color as the back; but the underside of C. Populi is purple, and smaller.

The description which Linnaeus has given of our species is, longirostris,
corpore viridi aurato subtus concolore; and Degeer has described it in similar
words. It is evident that Linnaeus had reason to suspect some difference of
color between the two sexes, but perhaps he never imagined the C. Purpureus
Berkenhout, in his Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain, says, C.
Purpureus. Glossy Purple. Snout very long. Petiver found this at Epsom.
, which he had before described, was also one sex, or a variety of the same
Insect.

Geoffroy says, "Rhinomacer totus viridi coeruleus;" and Fabricius adds, Variat
saepius color omnino coeruleo. Alter sexus thoracem antrorsum spinosum gerit.
How those different descriptions may be reconciled, so as to be descriptive of
the two sexes of C. Betulae, will appear more clearly on farther observation.

Late in May, this season, being at Darent-Wood, Dartford, I met with one of
the green kind, and one of a dark blue color, with a shade of green on the
elytra; I could not be deceived, they were male and female; as a farther
corroboration, I met with a second pair, in a similar situation; and on the day
following a third: the blue one of this last pair had not the shade of green as
on the former, but was of a rich glossy blue purple; and I am greatly mistaken
if it is not the C. Purpureus of Linnaeus, or the Insect which is arranged in
English Cabinets for that species.

I communicated the circumstance of meeting with those two Insects, which have
always been considered as distinct kinds, to a person who also was collecting
Insects in the wood, on the same day, and he informed me that he had just
before discovered them in the same situation. I have examined them very
carefully, but cannot discover any spines on the thorax of the green and gold
kind, though I have five of them, but the three purple specimens are all
spinous, as described by authors. I am of opinion, that the bright colored
specimens are all females, and those which are purple, I imagine, are males.

I mentioned the circumstance to an eminent Entomologist, and he at first
suspected they might be mule Insects, generated between the C. Betulae and the
C. Purpureus, but that could not be the case, as they were all in copulation
when taken.

We have been the more minute in this account, as we consider the confounding
of one species with another should ever be avoided, with as much care as the
separation of varieties into distinct species; both tend to confuse, or subvert
that truth which should be the guide of every enquirer into nature.

I have received a letter from my respectable friend T. Marsham, Esquire Sec. L. S.
accompanied with a specimen of the green kind of C. Betulae, that is spinous on
the thorax; together with one of the blue or purple kind, which is spinous
also: he informs me, that though his purple specimen has spines, he is very
certain he has had one without; hence it appears to me that they admit of great
variation; indeed it would afford the most presumptive argument, that there are
males and females of both colors. Among the purple specimens which I took,
there was a considerable difference in their colors, but of the five green
specimens scarcely two exactly agreed; one in particular partook so much of a
vivid crimson that it might easily have been mistaken by a cursory collector
for the Curculio Bachus.

This species is by far the most common of the Notonecta genus in England. It
is an aquatic Insect, undergoes its several changes in the water, and in the
last state is furnished with wings for flight.

In the daytime it may be observed on the surface of still waters; it always
swims on its back, with its legs extended. In the evening it flies in the air.
Found during most of the summer months. Most authors have described the upper
shells as being of a brown color, variegated with clouds of black; but this
appearance is not constant in every specimen; they lose much of that color
after being taken out of the water, or if the wings are expanded.


PLATE LXXVI. PHALAENA FUNALIS. FESTOON MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings, when at rest,
generally contracted. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Upper wings orange, rather inclining to brown; with a
black line nearly of a triangular form on each; when the wings are expanded the
lines resemble a festoon. Under wings orange, clouded and frosted with black;
margin pale.

We are happy to present our Subscribers with the figure of a Moth which is
scarcely known among the English Collectors, and we may venture to assert on
the best authority has not a place in any cabinet of Insects in this
metropolis, except that of the Author; indeed the only person who appears to
have been so fortunate as to meet with it except himself, is Mr. Lewin, who
formerly resided at Dartford; he considered it as such an invaluable rarity,
that had not a figure of it been discovered in Roesel, it would no doubt have
been published in the Transactions of the Linnaean Society; it must, however,
be observed, that the Insect Roesel has figured is a foreign specimen.

On the communication of Mr. JONES, of Chelsea, we presume that this Insect was
formerly known among the English Collectors, and received from them the
appellation Festoon Moth, but it must have been extremely rare even at that
time, as it does not appear in Harris's List of English Moths, nor has a single
specimen, or its remains, been found among the old Collections, which have been
handed down to the Entomologists of the present day.

On the 16th of August, 1793, I shook the Caterpillar from one of the high
branches of an oak-tree, in Darent wood, Kent; it remained motionless for some
time when in the net, and I concluded that it might have sustained an injury by
its fall; but I soon after discovered that it was naturally a sluggish,
inactive creature, and had received no damage; it remained several days in the
Caterpillar state, but as it was almost ready to change into Chrysalis, I had
only an opportunity of being convinced that oak was its proper food.

This Caterpillar is a most singular creature; at one time it would flatten
itself, and be considerably extended in breadth, or length; at another time it
would gather itself up like an hedgehog, or become almost round, and in a few
minutes after it would be flat again; and frequently the orange color on the
back would be obliterated; sometimes it so nearly resembled the Caterpillars of
several of the Papilio tribe, that I suspected it to be one of the Hair-streak
Butterflies, or rather the Caterpillar of a new species. On the 23d of August
it began to spin, and in a short time after its case was completed.

The case in which it passed to the Pupa state, was very firmly constructed,
and precluded an opportunity of observing the different symptoms of change,
which would otherwise have been visible. This case, which was exactly in the
form of an egg, was at first of a pale flesh color, but in the course of a few
days it had heightened to a very fine sanguineous, and after to a scarlet, or
nearly vermilion color; this color it retained for several months, but as the
time for the emancipation of the Moth within approached, the brightness of red
somewhat abated, though even after the Fly came forth, much of the original
color remained.

The manner in which it bursts open the case is rather singular; it does not
force an opening in an irregular form, as most Insects which spin a case, but
describes an exact circle within at one end; after this it divides its case
according to that circle, only leaving a small portion to act as an hinge; when
it has extricated itself from the Chrysalis, it forces the top of the case
back, as shown in our Figure, and thereby a free passage is opened for its
delivery.

The inside of the case is perfectly smooth, and appears as if polished by art;
it is of a pale blue color, the Chrysalis within is brown.

The Fly came forth on the 12th of July, 1794.


PLATE LXXVII.
FIG. I. and FIG. II. PHALAENA CRISTALANA. DARK-BUTTON MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings, in general contracted
when at rest. Fly by night.

TORTRIX. SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Upper wings yellow-brown, with dark shades; a
broad irregular white mark, and a tuft or button, on the center of each. Head
and thorax white clouded. Lower wings pale brown.

This singular Moth is very rarely met with; it has been taken in Coombe-wood,
Surry, and in Kent, but even in those places it is very uncommon.

It is distinguished by the unusual form of the white markings on the upper
wings, and particularly by the tuft or button which is situated in an upright
position near the center of each; those tufts appear only slightly feathered on
the upper parts to the naked eye, but when one of them is examined with a
microscope, or even common magnifier, it presents the appearance of a bundle of
fibers, enclosed within a thin membrane; narrow at the base, increasing in bulk
near the middle, and expanding at the summit into a number of shoots, in the
form of a crest: several other tufts are dispersed near the extremities of the
upper wings, but they are not conspicuous to the naked eye.

I have seen an Insect which corresponds in every respect with this specimen,
except that it had a line of a dull ochre color along the posterior margins of
the upper wings; but I suspect it to be either a variety, or perhaps only the
difference of sex.

Linnaeus has not described this insect, neither can we discover any
description of it in the writings of Fabricius; and I have no doubt of its
being a nondescript species.

The singular crested tufts, with the white markings on the upper wings,
furnish such an ample specific distinction, that we have named it Cristalana.

Found early in the month of August.

Fig. I. represents the natural size. Fig. II. its magnified appearance.

FIG. III. and FIG. IV. PHALAENA RADIATELLA. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA. TINEA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. First wings, buff, with shades of orange; striped or rayed
with a very dark purple from the base to the apex of each; a white stripe near
to, and parallel with the posterior margin, and two spots of the same color
near the center of each wing. Second wings lead color, deeply fringed.

This insect also appears to be a nondescript species; we have called it
Radiatella, or rayed, from the form of the dark stripes which rise from the
base, and spread in the form of rays to the apices of the upper wings. It is
very liable to change after death, and particularly the buff color, which
appears very bright when the insect is fresh, but is sometimes so altered in
appearance when placed in the cabinet, that an intermixture of that color can
be scarcely distinguished between the rays of purple; we mention this
circumstance, as very few small lepidopterous insects are subject to such
alteration.

It is found about the same time as the Phalaena Cristalana, and I believe is
equally scarce.

GRYLLUS BIGUTTULUS. HEMIPTERA.
Shells, or upper wings, semi-crustaceous, not divided by a straight future,
but incumbent on each other. Beak curved downward.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Head maxillous, and with palpi. Antennae filiform, or

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Head and thorax dark brown, marked with lines of white.
Wings pale brown edged with yellow, and several whitish marks near their

Though few insects require more elucidation to be well understood than those
of the Gryllus genus, no part of the science has been less regarded even by
systematic writers, who certainly appear to have been most interested to obtain
a satisfactory knowledge of them: the present species is continued by
Fabricius, in his Species Insectorum, under the Linnaean genus, and specific
name GRYLLUS BIGUTTULUS.

All of the Grylli are very liable to variations in color, and particularly
after death; green changes to brown of various hues, the light colors become
dark, and the dark colors fade, so that no just idea of the true appearance
can be formed except from the living insects.

The larva, and pupa, of most species of the Gryllus genus, scarcely differ in
appearance from the perfect insect, except that in the two first states they
are apterous, or without wings, and either leap or walk; but in the last state
they are furnished with four membranaceous wings.

The subject of our present description is not an unfrequent species near
London; it is taken in the perfect state in the month of August.

LOCUSTA VARIA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae very long. Thorax green, with a longitudinal line
of yellow. Anterior wings membranaceous, green. Posterior wings very delicate
pale green. Body pale green, with the three last joints pale black.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Superior wings red brown; a black dot near the center of

the space of the wings; in others the rose color is predominant.
. Abdomen, rose color with a chain of black spots down the center, and a row
of dots on each side.

The leaves of Alder or Birch, the Turnip, Mustard, and Ragwort, with many
other vegetables, are noticed by different authors, as being proper food for
the Ruby Tiger Moth in the larva state; I have observed that they prefer the
leaves of the Ragwort or Groundsel.

The Caterpillars are small in the month of May, in June they pass to the pupa
form, and early in the month following, appear in the winged state In a forward
season like the present, the time of their appearance in the different states
may vary considerably, especially as some may have two, or even three broods in
one summer. I have a Moth from a second brood, which passed to the pupa form
the 25th of July, and came forth the 10th of August, 1794.
.

This species is less frequent than the Cream Spot Tiger Moth Ph. Villica.

PLATE LXXXI. LIBELLULA DEPRESSA. NEUROPTERA.

transverse lines. A dark spot on the exterior margin of the wings. Body rather
depressed; that of the female, bright brown with yellow marks on each division;

The Male Insect of the Libellula Depressa, differs so very materially in
color from the female of that species, that we cannot imagine it will be
improper to give a figure of the former in our present Number, though the
latter is already represented in the early part of the Work.

We have nothing particular to add to our former account of its history. In the
larva and pupa state, it is found crawling at the bottoms of pools or ditches,
and subsists on the larvae of Gnats and other Insects; but in the last state,
it leaves its aquatic abode, and subsists on small winged insects, especially
Moths; it is not uncommon to see one of this species stop short in its flight,
dart down like a Hawk upon a Moth or Butterfly, and tear it to pieces in an
instant; or fly with it in its mouth, to some more convenient place to devour
it.


PLATE LXXXII. PHALAENA USTULARIA. EARLY THORN MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general contracted
when at rest. Fly by night.

* Geometrae.

Antennae of the male feathered; of the female setaceous, or like a bristle.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings angulated, indented, light brown varied with shades
of a scorched color. Three waves of dark brown across each superior wing;
together with a spot of orange or bright brown color, at the base, and another
nearly of the same color on the exterior margin of each.

Among the several Moths of the Geometrae division of Phalenae which are known
to the English Collectors by the trivial distinction, Thorn Moths, our present
Insect is neither the most conspicuous, or rare; it is however a beautiful
creature when taken immediately from the Pupa case, but rarely fine, when
caught in the fly state, in the fowling-net; the down being of such an
exquisite texture that the slightest touch must inevitably damage its
appearance.

The Pupa is marked with a brown color at every annulation immediately after
the Caterpillar has passed to that state, but as the creature within becomes
more perfect, that brown is gradually changed to a dark, or black color.

I have observed much variation in the colors of different specimens of this
species; of three male Insects which I have bred this season, one only
corresponded with the annexed figure, one inclined much more to a red brown,
and the other to a dull purple.

I met with the Caterpillars on the oak, and they always preferred that food to
any other. The Caterpillars are small in July, they pass to the Pupa state in
Autumn, and the Moths are to be taken about the middle of March.

Although, as we have just observed, this Insect does not particularly claim
our regard as a rarity, it does not appear to have been described by Linnaeus,
or even by Fabricius in his Species Insectorum; and no account of it is
included in Berkenhout's Outlines, in Harris's Catalogue of English Insects, or
any other work we have had an opportunity of perusing.

In its manners, the Caterpillar is not more singular than in its form; when
young it is very active and in continual motion; but as it grows larger it
becomes more sluggish in its disposition: it will sometimes affix itself by its
hind feet to one of the extreme branches of the tree on which it feeds, in the
same manner as shown in our plate, and will remain in that posture several
hours without the least apparent signs of life.

The Cicada Cornuta is a native of Germany and other parts of Europe, as well
as of England; with us it is by no means common. It is met with in the month of
May, or June; Berkenhout says it is found on trees, ferns, etc. I have taken
two specimens this season, one at Coombe-wood, Surrey, the other at Dartford;
they were both concealed on the under sides of some dock leaves.

At Fig. I. the creature is represented of the natural size, with the wings
expanded; at Fig. II. one is given in a standing position; and at Fig. III. the
front of the head and singularly constructed thorax is shown as they appear
before the speculum of an opaque microscope.

Fabricius has placed this Insect in a division of the seventh Class of his
Genera Insectorum, RYNGOTA Membracis.

This is the rarest species of the Leptura genus we have in England; it is
found among rotten wood. May.

Fabricius having separated the Lepturae of Linnaeus, and arranged them under
three distinct generic divisions, as Callidium, Donacia, and Leptura, it will
be proper to observe, that the CALLIDIUM Arcuatum, Class I. ELEVTERA, Fab.
Spec. Ins. is the LEPTURA Arcuata of Linnaeus; to this we must also add that
the LEPTURA Arcuata, figured in the seventh Number of Panzer's Faunae
Insectorum Germanicae Initia, is a very different species to our specimen, is a
native of Austria, and received its name from Hellwig.

This Insect is very common in England during the early part of summer; it
lives on aquatic vegetables, and runs with much celerity when disturbed. It has
also been found among the decayed wood of willow trees.

Fabricius has altered its specific, as well as its generic title; it stands in
his System as DONACIA crassipes.

FIG. IV. LEPTURA ELONGATA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae with black and brown spots alternately. Head and
thorax black. Shells yellow, tipped at the extremity with black; also two
transverse bands and two spots of the same color. Thighs and part of the legs
light brown. Feet black.

Nearly as rare as the Leptura Arcuata in this country; it is taken in dry
sandy places, or among loose chalk; the soil of Dartford and some other parts
of Kent is particularly favorable to the increase of those creatures. Met with

The Puss Moth appears in the winged state about the latter end of May, or
early in June.

The Caterpillar, from which it is produced, is of a very extraordinary form,
and has rather the appearance of a formidable or venomous creature, than the
larva of a Moth: it feeds on Willows and Poplars, and is generally found in
great plenty where those trees grow, in the month of July. The two tails, or
crimson filaments at the extremity of the body, are protruded or concealed
within their base at the creature's pleasure; when protruded they have a
continual writhing or vibratory motion.

It passes to the Pupa state in August.

The Caterpillar of this Insect feeds on the wood of Willows, and is concealed

Sphinx Apiformis Plate XXV. of this Work.
, and Sphinx Tipuliformis Ibid.
, are concealed within the wood of the Poplar, and stalks of Current bushes.

Fabricius describes the Caterpillar, green with a lateral line of yellow;
spine at the end of the body red. Harris observes, that in the winged state the
fly is found in Gardens, on flowers, in May; Fabricius writes on the
Honey-suckle, etc.

It is very rare; one specimen has been taken this season on Epping-Forest.

The manners of the common Humble Be are too well known to require
elucidation; its dwelling is formed very deep in the earth; it comes forth when
the sun shines to extract the melliferous moisture of flowers, and is perfectly
harmless unless when irritated. Linnaeus describes the Anus of the Apis
Terrestris white, but I find this is not always constant; I have several
specimens that agree with the one represented in the annexed plate.

I have compared them with the specimen in the Linnaean Cabinet; they perfectly
agree in every respect except in the brown or yellow color of the extreme part
of the Abdomen: they are certainly only varieties.

In the Linnaean Cabinet, (now in the possession of Dr. Smith) I find under the
name Apis Lapidaria two insects, so very different in size, that it certainly
will admit some doubt whether they ought to be considered as the same species:
Linnaeus does indeed, notice this dissimilarity of their size in his
description, and says one is three times larger than the other, etc. whence we
may conclude that it was after mature deliberation he had ventured to place the
smallest as a variety of the other "Varietas triplo minor, vix distincta."
. -- I do not know whether the largest has ever been taken in England; the
specimen of it, in the Linnaean Collection, is a Swedish Insect: the smallest
(which we have figured) is well known as a native of this country.

It is not found so frequently as most other species of the Apis genus; it
lives among heaps of loose stones; its honey is strong.

FIG. III. TENTHREDO VITELLINAE: HYMENOPTERA.

The Larva of this species is found on the Alder, Osier and Willow; it is

When it first appears from the Chrysalis very little of the black of the
Thorax and Abdomen can be seen, those parts being at that time thickly clothed
with long brownish hairs.

The Papilio Antiopa is found in every part of Europe; in Germany particularly
it is very common; it is as frequent in America as in Europe, and is esteemed
as a rarity only in this country: it is, indeed, sometimes found in abundance
with us, but as its appearance is neither annual nor periodical, it is
generally valued by English Collectors.

There have been several instances of this Insect being found in different
parts of the country in mild seasons, as plenty as the Peacock, or Admirable,
Butterflies; in the summer of 1793 particularly, they were as numerous in some
places as the common garden White Butterfly is usually near London.

But as a proof that its appearance does not altogether depend on the
temperature of the weather, we need only adduce, that not a single specimen has
been taken this season, although it has been one of the most favorable for all
kinds of Insects that can be recollected; and many species of Moths and
Butterflies, which have not been seen for several years before, have been taken
at Combe-Wood, Darn-Wood, and similar adjacent parts, during summer, in plenty.

It is from the uncertainty of its appearance that we have such different, and,
seemingly, irreconcilable accounts of the abundance and scarcity of this
Butterfly; it was certainly well known as a native of this country to former
Collectors, yet it received only a few years since the new name Grand Surprise;
this name, which was given by Moses Harris, or by some of the company of
Aurelians, of whose society he was a member, was evidently intended as a
significant expression of their admiration, not of the beauty of the Insect,
but of the singular circumstance of the species remaining so long in those very
places where the most diligent researches of preceding Collectors had been made
in vain; of their unwearied industry they were well persuaded, and were
therefore unable to account for the appearance of a numerous brood of large
Insects, which must have remained concealed many years, or been lately
transported to those places.

Harris, in his Aurelian, calls it the Camberwell Beauty, though in his list of
English Butterflies Hawk-Moths, and Moths, he uses the name Grand Surprise: we
mention this circumstance, as it appears very inconsistent that the new name he
adopts in one work, and the old one he should have discarded in the other, are
equally and indiscriminately used in the several editions of both; we still
find it in the Aurelian, "Camberwell Beauty," in the other, "Grand Surprise,"
from which it might be readily inferred, that he meant two distinct Insects,
were it not for the addition of the Linnaean name Pap. Antiopa.

In the general description of this Insect in the Aurelian, Harris does not say
that it was scarce at that time (1775), which he certainly would if it had been
so; but Berkenhout, in his outlines of Natural History, (1789) adds, after its
specific character, that it is very rare in this kingdom. To reconcile those
accounts, we can only observe, that no Insect is more uncertain as to the time
of its appearance; that though found in abundance in one season, it may not be
seen in the next, or even for several successive years; it will then appear in
small or large quantities, for one, two, or more seasons, and again disappear
for many years as before.

The English specimens differ from those of other countries in the color of
the light exterior border of the wings; in the former, that part is of a very
pale yellow brown, inclining to a dirty white; in the latter, it is of a deep
yellow, marked and spotted with brown. Fabricius notices this difference, and
says they are varieties.

The Caterpillars feed on the Willow, and are generally found on the highest
branches; they cast their skin early in July, and pass to the Chrysalis, as
represented in the plate. The underside of the Butterfly is of a black brown,
with irregular dark streaks; the yellowish border is visible on that side.

Phal. Tab. 10. Fig. 6.
This little Moth has great affinity with the Phal. Forskahliana of Linnaeus,
the wings are indeed more angulated, but the form of the XX on the upper wings
are nearly the same, and in the general colors both of the upper and under
wings they perfectly agree.

Phal. Loeflingiana is found in the greatest abundance on the Oak, in the month
of April and May, in the Caterpillar state, and in July every Tree that will
afford them a moist retreat during the heat of the day, conceals numbers in the
winged state; morning and evening they are on the wing, they come forth at day
break, sport about the bushes till after sunrise. and then retire among the
thickest Oak boughs; a little before sunset they come forth again, but conceal
themselves as before about twilight.

The Caterpillars are of a fine green color, beset with black specks, the head
is shining black, a collar of the same color passes round the first joint, or
annulation of the body next the head, but a narrow belt of white passing
between, separates the black of the head from the shoulders. It is a brisk
creature, and the thread which it spins is of a very strong texture.

It passes to the Chrysalis state in the leaf of the Oak, as shown in the plate.

The Sphinx Euphorbiae, considered as a native of this country, is without
exception the rarest species of the genus we have: and if we omit the Sp.
Porcellus, Lineata, Atropos, with a very few others, we have no indigenous
species that can by any means be compared with it as a rare, or, we may add,
beautiful Insect.

Drury has given a figure of the Sphinx without its changes among his rare
Insects, but as a native of a foreign country: and before the time of Harris it
was frequently an object of discussion among Aurelians, whether it ever had
been taken in England; Harris in his work, expresses himself thus, It has been
long in dispute whether the Spotted Elephant was a native of this island; but
it is now past a doubt, as I have had the good fortune to find a Caterpillar of
this Moth in marshy ground at Barnscray, near Crayford in Kent, about the
middle of August 1778.
; it was better than three inches long, of a dark brown color; the horn at the
tail part, which was about half an inch long, appeared long and glossy. The
head was nearly the size of a small pea, of a lightish yellow, brown, or tan
color. I tried various herbs to bring it to feed, but my attempts were
fruitless, and it died for want It seeds on plants of the Euphorbia genus, as
its specific name indicates.
. The Chrysalis in the plate was sent me from Belleisle in France; and the Moth
was produced from it about the beginning of June. -- Harris's Aurelian, plate
44.

We are not informed of more than two similar circumstances that may place its
existence in this country beyond dispute; a damaged specimen of the Fly has
been taken at Bath, and is in our cabinet; and Mr. Curtis, author of the Flora
Londinensis, etc. found four of the Caterpillars last summer in Devonshire.

In the Caterpillar state it frequently changes its skin, and appears as
frequently to alter its appearance; we cannot else account for the
dissimilarity that prevails among all the colored representations of the
Insect in that state that have come under our inspection; in Roesel's Hist.
Ins. we find a figure of the Caterpillar apparently in the last skin, that very
nearly corresponds with our specimen; but that figured by Harris does not agree
with either, in the form or number of the spots. At an early stage of its
growth the Caterpillar, according to Roesel, is bright yellow, with black
patches, and minute white specks.

The figure in plate XCII. is copied from a most perfect specimen of the
Caterpillar, and which is now in our possession; but as we cannot assure our
Subscribers that it was found in England, we have been careful to add it in a
separate plate, that so it may either be included in the volume with the Sphinx
and Pupa, or be excluded with propriety.

Linnaeus never described this Insect, or he would have placed it in the
Cerambyx genus. Fabricius has described it in his Species Insectorum under the
specific name Bifasciatum; but he has separated it from the Linnaean genus, and
given it the new generic title Rhagium: the Cerambyx Inquisitor, C. Cursor and
C. Noctis of Linnaeus, our present species, and R. Ornatum, are the only
Insects Fabricius has included in the new genus Rhagium.

The Rhagium Bifasciatum is rare in this country; it is more frequent in France
and Germany. It is generally found in putrid flesh.

some the Purple is the most vivid, and again in others the colors are so
blended as to appear altogether of a dull brown. They feed on the soft wood of
willow trees; are very plenty in most places in summer, and emit a very
powerful musk-like odor.

The Caterpillar of the Ph. Neustria are found in June, either on the
white-thorn, black-thorn, or briar; sometimes on fruit trees: they pass to the
Chrysalis state in July, and the Moths appear in August.

The female deposits her eggs with such particular care and regularity, that a
cluster of them forms one of the most pleasing objects for microscopical
investigation; they are crustaceous, of a light gray or bluish color,
elegantly marked at the broadest end; they are disposed with the greatest
symmetry around the small branches of the thorn, and are so cemented together
that they cannot readily be separated. -- The appearance of a cluster is
represented in our plate.

The eggs are laid in autumn, though they are not hatched till the ensuing
spring. When the young Caterpillars burst forth, they form into societies,
sometimes of thirty or forty individuals, sometimes of a much greater number;
they immediately commence the formation of a spacious web, and if the weather
be fine in two or three days, their work is completed; as however they increase
in bulk, it is necessary to enlarge their dwelling, and this they manage either
by adding new external coverings, or increasing and extending the windings
within. They seldom pass to the Pupa form in those nests, but separate in
search of a more convenient place for that purpose when they have attained
their full size.

The Caterpillar, when preparing for its next state, weaves a large silky case;
within which it forms another somewhat smaller; and thus enveloped by its
double cone, it changes to the Pupa form. The Pupa is black, and may be just
discerned through the two cases, as represented in our plate.

The figure of the perfect Insect is copied from a female specimen; the male is
rather darker, and has the Antennae more feathered.

We have several species of this genus that so nearly resemble each other, as
scarcely to be distinguished on the most accurate investigation from the E.
Sputator. They are found in great abundance in summer.


PLATE XCVII. PHALAENA LUCIDATA. DARTFORD EMERALD MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general contracted
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Fine lucid green, two white waves across the upper, and
one across the under wings.

This species we have ever found peculiar to the woods about two or three miles
beyond Dartford (Kent), particularly on the skirts of Darnwood, and near the
banks of the river Thames at Queenhithe; it has probably never been taken
elsewhere, or the name Dartford Emerald would not have been so generally
adopted by Collectors.

It is not very frequent even in those local situations, nor can we learn that
its larva and pupa state has been ascertained before; the species has neither
been described by Linneus nor Fabricius; Harris does not mention it in his
catalogue of English Moths, nor has a figure of it been given in any preceding
publication that have come under our inspection.

The specific name is intended to express the lucid or transparent appearance
of the Insect.

I am not certain whether in the larva state it feeds on the Convolvulus,
although I found it on a plant of that kind; as its climbing stalks and
tendrils were so intricated with branches of white-thorn, oak, and broom, as to
preclude any accurate determination.

I kept them in a gauze cage for the space of a fortnight, and supplied them
with fresh portions of the different plants every day, but could never observe
them take the least subsistence during the whole time; they affixed their tails
and hinder legs in the meshes of the gauze when I first removed them into the
cage, and never showed the least signs of life after; as they held firmly by
the gauze, in the positions represented in our plate, I was very much
disappointed to find on attempting to remove them, that two were dead; May 23d
I observed that which was alive threw out a very delicate white thread, as if
about to spin a cone; the body gradually shrivelled at the upper part, while
the lower became proportionably thicker; two days after it fell to the bottom
of the cage and became a pupa, at first of a whitish, and after of a fine green
color, marked at the narrow end with short black streaks. June 13th the Moth
came forth.

At Fig. I. is shown the head of the Caterpillar magnified; it is gray, with
the jaws black, and is concealed beneath two horns or projections of the same
green color as the back.


PLATE XCVIII. CIMEX LURIDUS. HEMIPTERA.
Shells or upper wings, semi-crustaceous, not divided by a straight future, but

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae longer than the thorax. Thorax margined, in each
foot three joints.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Thorax spined, brown, tinged with green. Shells brown,
with a dark spot on the center of each.

CIMEX Luridus. Thorace obtuse spinoso subvirescente, elytris griseis, macula
fusca, clypeo emarginato.

Syst. Ent. 701. 25. Fab. Spec. Ins. 2. 345. 38.
Fabricius is the only writer who has described this beautiful Insect; the
description in the Species Insectorum is taken from a specimen in the
collection of Sir J. Banks, Bart. A very minute Latin account is also given in
a Mantissa of Entomology lately published by the same author, but in which he
does not even mention the larva or pupa state, though their characters differ
so essentially from the perfect Insect; we suspect in the two first states the
Insect has hitherto remained unknown, as in the perfect state it is very rarely
met with. We have never seen a figure of either in any former publication.

June 10th, 1794. -- I found one specimen in the larva state at Coombe-wood,
Surrey; it was lurking beneath a branch of hazel, among some small Caterpillars
that had formed a slight web on the leaves; as it was only served with
vegetable food when confined in the breeding cage, it died in a few days.

June 26th, 1794. -- I shook another specimen from the upper branches of a tall
oak in Darn-wood, Dartford. At first it refused to eat, but shortly after I
observed it suspended across a leaf, with its head downward, and its rostrum
extended and transfixed through the head of a small Caterpillar which had
unfortunately strayed into the box. I fed it after with dead worms, house
flies, etc. from which it extracted nutritive moisture, and increased
considerably in bulk. -- June 29th it cast its exuviae -- July the 2d. it cast
another, when the perfect Insect came forth: the larva can scarcely be
distinguished from the pupa state.

PLATE XCIX. CHRYSOMELA BILITURALA. COLEOPTERA.
Wings two, covered by two shells, divided by a longitudinal future.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae knotted, enlarging toward the end. Corselet
margined.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae near the length of the body, black. Head, thorax,
and underside, black. Shells red, inclining to yellow brown, with a broad
longitudinal black stripe extending from the base, nearly to the extremity of
each.

This Insect is described in the manuscripts of T. MARSHAM, ESQUIRE. S. L. S. who
favored me with the specimen from which the figure in the annexed plate is
copied; it does not appear to have been either figured or described in any
preceding Natural History, and may therefore be esteemed as a rare Insect. The
specific name biliturala is adopted from that Gentleman's manuscripts by
permission.

Is found on Hornbeam in May.


PLATE C. PHALAENA COERULEOCEPHALA. FIGURE OF EIGHT MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.

blueish green; the resemblance of a double figure of eight on each. Inferior
wings lighter with a brownish scallopped margin.

The Caterpillars of this species are found in their last skin about the latter
end of May, or early in June; they change into chrysalis a few days after. The
Moth is produced in August.

In the Caterpillar state they are met with in great plenty, either on the crab
tree, black thorn, or white thorn; but are not so abundant in the last state,
as many perish when in chrysalis.

They change into chrysalis within a hard case, which they fasten to the small
stems of trees.


PLATE CI. CIMEX. HEMIPTERA.
Shells, or upper wings, semi-crustaceous, not divided by a straight future,

FIG. I. II. III. CIMEX QUADRIPUNCTATUS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae yellow. Eyes black. Head and thorax yellowish
orange color; four distinct black spots, and a transverse band of the same on
the latter. Wings yellow, with an orange shade, and streaked with black. Legs
and body bright orange.

This very rare and non-descript species is distinct from the Cimex striatus,
with which it has been supposed to have some affinity; it is smaller, the head,
thorax, and body are very different, though in the colors of the wings they
nearly correspond. -- The four black spots on the thorax furnish our specific
distinction.

FIG. V. VI. CIMEX PALLESCENS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Linear. Upper and under wings very pale brownish color.
Thorax and body pale yellow with two faint crimson longitudinal streaks from
the antennae to the extreme part of the body.

This little Insect is described in the manuscripts of T. Marsham, Esquire S. L. S.
under the specific name C. Pallescens; it is by no means uncommon though it has
never appeared in any former publication.

In the larva and pupa state it is a very beautiful creature, as the colors
are much brighter than in the perfect Insect; they are generally found in April
or May, among the grass and young plants that grow under hedges; in June or
July they are taken in the winged state. -- Fig. V. the pupa state, and Fig.

The Caterpillars of this Moth feed on the White and Black Thorn, together with
several herbaceous plants; it has been observed to thrive better in the
breeding cage when regularly supplied with fresh grass, to keep the former in a
proper state of moisture.

The Female deposits her eggs in June or July, the Caterpillars are hatched in
Autumn, and remain in that state during the Winter; about the middle of May it
spins a large brown case, within which it passes to the Pupa state; the Moths
appear in June.

In the Caterpillar state it is scarcely possible to distinguish the Male from
the Female, except that the former is smaller than the latter; but in the last
state their colors are entirely different, the Female being of a pale
yellowish teint, inclining to fox color, the Male is of a rich brown.

The Eggs are very curious, they resemble in shape those of a Hen, but are
neatly mottled with dark brown.

The Caterpillars cast their skins several times, and always thereby assume a
new appearance, though the general colors and character of the species may be
traced through every stage. Our figure is copied from a very large and fine
colored specimen of the Female, that was met with at Darent-Wood, Dartford.

This singular species is by no means so common as the Nepa Cinerea, already
figured in this Work. One specimen was taken at Ilford, in Essex, last
September; and Thomas Walford, Esquire met with another in a bog near Clare Priory,
Suffolk: the latter is preserved in the Museum of Mr. Parkinson.

In the Larva and Pupa state it is very rarely met with, as it lives in deep
stagnant water; the figure of the latter, which we have given at Fig. I. is
copied from the only English Specimen of the Insect we have ever seen in that
state; it was taken out of a Pool, near Epping, in the month of June, 1790.

The excavations of the superior wings of this Insect contribute such an air of
novelty to its general appearance, that it might rather be considered as the
effect of chance or design, on a single Insect, if we did not observe that
character prevail through every specimen; we find two kinds of them in several
cabinets in London, and we are in possession of a third that differs from
either.

By most practical Entomologists they have been considered as distinct species,
and they may be such; but as we are unwilling to create confusion by extending
the number of species, we prefer admitting them as varieties under the
Fabrician name Emargana. -- We are more readily inclined to adopt this measure,
as we have always found them at the same time of the year, in the same parts of
the woods, and generally sporting together, which is not commonly observed of
Insects that are not either varieties or differ only in sex.

They are rarely met with; our specimens were taken in June at Dartford. --
They have been taken together at Caen-Wood, Hampstead.

They have not been described by Linnaeus; but were known among Collectors by
the (now obsolete) name Excavana.

At Fig. 5. is shown one of the varieties; the third is much yellower but
marked with similar reticulated strokes, and exactly corresponds in size and
form with this figure.

The low oaks, and particularly such as are encircled with ivy, generally
afford a shelter to numbers of this pretty Insect during the heat of the day;
they are seldom found in the thickest of the wood, they seem to prefer the
thick hedges by the road sides.

Is found in the months of May, June, and July.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Long, narrow. Anterior wings pale clay color, with a dark
streak down the middle, and a few minute spots of the same color near the

color.

This elegant Insect was found the latter end of autumn, 1794, among some high
grass and water plants in the vicinity of Hampstead, and is now in the
possession of the author.

It has certainly never been described or figured before; nor is it in the
cabinet of any Entomologist within the circle of our friends; if we except a
very distinct variety which is in the cabinet of Mr. Honey, Union-Street,
Borough.

We have named it Panzerella in honor of the German Entomologist DR. GEORGE

including a figure of the largest kind, until I could affirm on credible
authority it had been taken in England also.

I have lately had the good fortune to be satisfied in this particular; LORD
WILLIAM SEYMOUR favored me with the specimen from which the annexed figure is

several other rare Insects, which will appear shortly in this work.
