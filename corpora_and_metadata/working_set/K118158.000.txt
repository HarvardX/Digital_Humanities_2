PREFACE.
SOME years since I published a complete Treatise on Mensuration, both in
Theory and Practice; in which the Elements of that Science are demonstrated,
and the Rules applied to the various practical purposes of life. That work has
been well received by the Public, and honored with the high approbation of the
more learned Mathematicians.

It has, however, been often represented to me, by Tutors and others, that the
great size and price of that work, as well as the very scientific manner in
which it is formed, prevent it from being so generally useful in schools, and
to practical measurers, as a more compendious and familiar little book might
be, which they could put into the hands of their pupils, as a work containing
all the practical rules of that art, in a form proper for them to copy from,
and unmixed with such geometrical and algebraical demonstrations as occur in
the large work.

In compliance, therefore, with such representations, I have drawn up this
Compendium of Mensuration, Practical Geometry, and Arithmetic, expressly with
the view of accommodating it to practical matters, and to the use of schools. I
have, therefore, here brought together all the most useful rules and precepts;
have arranged them in an orderly manner, proper for the pupil to copy; and
delivered them in plain and familiar language. An example, worked out at full
length, is set down to each rule, together with drawings or representations of
the geometrical figures proper to illustrate each problem; and then are
subjoined some more questions to each rule, as examples proposed for the
practice of the learner, with the answer set down, by which he may know when
his work is right.

The introduction to Decimal and Duodecimal Arithmetic, will be found useful,
by going over those branches before entering on the Mensuration, that the
learner may be very ready and expert in numeral calculations.

The Practical Geometry contains a great number of geometrical constructions
and operations; by the practice of which the learner will acquire the free and
easy use of his instruments, and so become prepared for making the drawings
that are useful for illustrating the various branches of mensuration following.

The Mensuration itself next succeeds, and is divided into various parts;
first, Mensuration in general, and then as applied to the several practical
uses in life. The whole being arranged in such order as the learner may
properly take in succession; or distinguished into several branches, of which
he may select and study any peculiar ones that may be more to his purpose than
the rest, when he either has not leisure or inducement to go over the whole in
a regular gradation. And notwithstanding the compendious size of the book, and
the great number of practical branches here treated, it will be found that each
one is much more full and complete than the first appearance of so small a form
may promise to admit of. However, if farther satisfaction be desired by any
one, either concerning the science in general, or the demonstrations of the
rules, or the more curious and copious display of properties, he may apply to
my large treatise before mentioned, where he will find every part delivered in
the most ample form.

INTRODUCTION.
DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
A Decimal is a fraction whose denominator is an unit, or 1, with some number
of ciphers annexed; as 1/10 or 45/10000.

Decimals are written down without their denominators, the numerators being so
distinguished as to show what the denominators are; which is done, by
separating, by a point, so many of the right hand figures from the rest as
there are ciphers in the denominator; the figures on the left side of the point
being integers, and those on the right decimals.

Thus, 0.5 is understood to be 5/10 or And 0.25 is understood to be 25/100 or
And 0.75 is understood to be 75/100 or And 1.3 is understood to be 13/10 or 1
3/10 And 24.6 is understood to be 24 6/10
But when there is not a sufficient number of figures in the numerator, ciphers
are prefixed to supply the defect.

So,.02 is 2/100 or 1/50 And.0015 is 15/10000 or 3/2000
So that the denominator of a decimal is a 1, with as many ciphers as there are
figures in the decimal.

A finite decimal, is that which ends at a certain number of places. But an
infinite decimal, that which no where ends, but is understood to be
indefinitely continued.

A repeating decimal, has one figure, or several figures continually repeated.
As 20.2433 etc. which is a single or simple repetend. And 20.2424 etc. or
20.246246 etc. which are compound repetends; and are otherwise called
circulates, or circulating decimals. A point is set over a single repetend, and
a point over the first and last figures of a circulating decimal.

The first place, next after the decimal mark, is 10th parts, the second is
100th parts, the third is 1000th parts, and so on, decreasing toward the right
by 10ths, or increasing toward the left by 10ths, the same as whole or integer
numbers do. As in the following Scale of Notation

etc. Millions Hundreds of thousands Tens of thousands Thousands Hundreds Tens
Units Tenth parts Hundredth parts Thousand parts Ten thousand parts Hundred
thousand parts Millionth parts etc.
Ciphers on the right of decimals do not alter their value: For.5 or 5/10 that
is And.50 or 50/100 that is And.500 or 500/1000 that is
etc. are all of equal value.

But ciphers before decimal figures, and after the separating point, diminish
the value in a ten-fold proportion for every cipher. So,.5 is 5/10 or But.05 is
5/100 or 1/20 And.005 is 5/1000 or 1/200
And so on.

So that, in any mixed or fractional number, if the separating point be moved
one, two, three, etc. places to the right hand, every figure will be 10, 100,
1000, etc. times greater than before.


But if the point be moved toward the left hand, then every figure will be
diminished in the same manner, or the whole quantity will be divided by 10,
100, 1000, etc.

ADDITION OF DECIMALS.
SET the numbers under each other according to the value of their places, as in
whole numbers, or so that the decimal points stand directly below each other.
Then add as in whole numbers, placing the decimal point in the sum straight
below the other points.

EXAMPLES.

Ex. 5. What is the sum of 27.148, 918.73, 14016, 294304,.7138, and 221.7?

Ex. 6. Required the sum of 312.984, 21.3918, 2700.42, 3.153, 27.2, and 581.06.

SUBTRACTION OF DECIMALS.
SET the less number under the greater in the same manner as in addition. Then
subtract as in whole numbers, and place the decimal point in the remainder
straight below the other points.

EXAMPLES.

Ex. 5. What is the difference between 2714 and.916?

Ex. 6. What is the difference between 16.37 and 800.135?

MULTIPLICATION OF DECIMALS.
SET down the factors under each other, and multiply them as in whole numbers;
and from the product, toward the right hand, point off as many figures for
decimals, as there are decimal places in both factors together.

But if there be not as many figures in the product as there ought to be
decimals, prefix the proper number of ciphers to supply the defect.

EXAMPLES.
(1) (2) (3) 520.3 91.78.217.417.381.0431 36421 9178 217 5203 73424 651 20812
27534 868 216.9651 34.96818.0093527

Ex. 4. What is the product of 51.6 and 21?

Ex. 5. What is the product of 314 and.029?

Ex. 6. What is the product of.051 and.0091?

Note, When decimals are to be multiplied by 10, or 100, or 1000, etc. that is
by 1 with any number of ciphers, it is done by only moving the decimal point as
many places farther to the right hand, as there are ciphers in the said
multiplier: subjoining ciphers if there be not so many figures.

EXAMPLES.
1. The product of 51.3 and 10 is 2. The product of 2.714 and 100 is 3. The
product of.9163 and 1000 is 4. The product of 21.31 and 10000 is
CONTRACTION.
When the product would contain several more decimals than are necessary for
the purpose in hand, the work may be much contracted thus, retaining only the
proper number of decimals.

Set the units figure of the multiplier straight under such decimal place of
the multiplicand as you intend the last of your product shall be, writing the
other figures of the multiplier in an inverted order: then in multiplying
reject all the figures in the multiplicand which are on the right of the figure
you are multiplying by; setting the products down so, that their right hand
figures fall straight below each other; and carrying to such right hand figures
from the product of the two preceding figures in the multiplicand thus, viz. 1
from 5 to 15, 2 from 15 to 25, 3 from 25 to 35, etc. inclusively; and the sum
of the lines will be the product to the number of decimals required, and will
commonly be to the nearest unit in the last figure.

EXAMPLES.

1. Multiply 27.14986 by 92.41035, so as to retain only four places of decimals
in the product.

4. Multiply 325.701428 by.7218393, retaining three decimals in the product.

DIVISION OF DECIMALS.
DIVIDE as in whole numbers. And to know how many decimals to point off in the
quotient, observe the following rules:

1. There must be as many decimals in the dividend, as in both the divisor and
quotient together; therefore, point off for decimals in the quotient, as many
figures, as the decimal places in the dividend exceed those in the divisor.

2. If the figures in the quotient are not so many as the rule requires, supply
the defect by prefixing ciphers.

3. If the decimal places in the divisor be more than those in the dividend,
add ciphers as decimals to the dividend, till the number of decimals in the
dividend be equal to those in the divisor, and the quotient will be integers
till all these decimals are used. And, in case of a remainder after all the
figures of the dividend are used, and more figures are wanted in the quotient,
annex ciphers to the remainder, to continue the division as far as necessary.

4. The first figure of the quotient will possess the same place, of integers
or decimals, as that figure of the dividend which stands over the units place
of the first product.

EXAMPLES.
1. Divide 3424.6056 by 43.6. 2. Divide 3877875 by.675. 43.6) 3424.6056
(78.546.675) 3877875.000 (5745000 3726 5028 2380 3037 2005 3375 2616 ^^^^ 000

3. Divide.0081892 by.347. 4. Divide 7.13 by.18. 5. Divide 3.15 by 375 6.
Divide 109 by.215
CONTRACTIONS.
1. If the divisor be an integer with any number of ciphers at the end; cut
them off, and remove the decimal point in the dividend so many places farther
to the left as there were ciphers cut off, prefixing ciphers if need be; then
proceed as before.

EXAMPLES.
1. Divide 953 by 21000. 2. Divide 41020 by 32000 21.000).953 32.000) 41.020
7.).31766 8) 10.255.04538 etc. 1.281875 Here I first divide by 3, and then by
7, because 3 times 7 is 21. Here I first divide by 4, and then by 8, because 4
times 8 is 32. 3. Divide 45.5 by 2170. 4. Divide 61 by 79000.

2. Whence, if the divisor be 1 with ciphers, the quotient will be the same
figures with the dividend, having the decimal point so many places farther to
the left as there are ciphers in the divisor.

EXAMPLES.
217*3 / 100=2.173 419 by 10 = 5.16 by 1000 =.21 by 1000 =

3. When the number of figures in the divisor is great, the division at large
will be very troublesome, but may be contracted thus:

Having, by the 4th general rule, found what place of decimals or integers the
first figure of the quotient will possess; consider how many figures of the
quotient will serve the present purpose; then take the same number of the
left hand figures of the divisor, and as many of the dividend figures as will
contain them (less than 10 times); by these find the first figure of the
quotient; and for each following figure divide the last remainder by the
divisor, wanting one figure to the right more than before, but observing what
must be carried to the first product for such omitted figures, as in the second
contraction of Multiplication; and continue the operation till the divisor is
exhausted.

When there are not so many figures in the divisor as are required to be in the
quotient, begin the division with all the figures as usual, and continue it
till the number of figures in the divisor and those remaining to be found in
the quotient be equal, after which use the contraction.

EXAMPLES.

1. Divide 2508.92806 by 92.41035, so as to have four decimals in the quotient.
-- In this case the quotient will contain six figures. Hence 92.4103,5)

2. Divide 4109.2351 by 230.409 so that the quotient may contain four decimals.

3. Divide 37.10438 by 5713.96 that the quotient may contain five decimals.

4. Divide 913.08 by 2137.2 that the quotient may contain three decimals.

REDUCTION OF DECIMALS.
1. To reduce a vulgar fraction to a decimal. Divide the numerator, with as
many decimal ciphers annexed, as may be necessary, by the denominator; and the
quotient will be the decimal sought.

EXAMPLES.
1. Reduce 1/99 to a decimal. 2. Reduce 1/75 to a decimal. 9) 1.000000 5) 1.0
11) 0.111111 5) 0.20 0.010101 etc.=1/99 3) 0.04 0.01333 etc.=1/75 Here divide
by 9 and 11, Here divide by 5, 5, and 3, because 9 times 11 is 99. because 5 x
5 x 3=75. And the decimal value of 1/99 And the decimal value of is the
circulate.01. 1/75 is the repetend.013.

OTHER EXAMPLES.
=.5 1/5=.2 =.125 1/3=.3 1/6=.16 1/9=.1 =.25 1/7=.142857 1/10=.1 2/7 = 14/191 =
21/758 =

So that whenever we meet with the repetend.3, in any operation, we may
substitute. for it; in like manner we may take for.6, and for.16, and 1/9
for.1, and 9/9 or 1 for.9, etc.

Note, When a great many figures are required in the decimal, and the
denominator of the given fraction is a prime number greater than 11, the
operation will be best performed as follows.

Suppose, for instance, I would find the reciprocal of the prime number 29, or
the value of the fraction 1/29 in decimal numbers. I divide 1.000 by 29, in the
common way, so far as to find two or three of the first figures, or till the
remainder becomes a single figure, and then I assume the supplement to complete
the quotient. Thus I shall have 1/29=0.03448 8/29 for the complete quotient;
which equation if I multiply by the numerator 8, it will give 8/29=0.27584
64/29 or rather 8/29=0.27586 6/29. I substitute this instead of the fraction in
the first equation, and I shall have 1/29=0.0344827586 6/29. Again I multiply
this equation by 6, and it will give 6/29=0.2068965517 7/29, and then by
substitution 1/29=0.03448275862068965517 7/29. Again, I multiply this equation
by 7, and it becomes 7/29=0.24137931034482758620 10/29, and then by
substitution 1/29=0.03448275862068965517241379310344 82758620 10/29, where
every operation will at least double the number of figures found by the
preceding operation. And this will be an easy expedient for converting division
into multiplication in all cases. For this reciprocal of the divisor being thus
found, it may be multiplied by the dividend to produce the quotient.

II. To reduce a decimal to a vulgar fraction.

Under the figures of the given decimal write its proper denominator; which
fraction, abbreviated as much as it can be, will be the vulgar fraction sought.

EXAMPLES.
So.5=5/10= And.25=25/100= And.75=75/100= And.6=6/10=3/5 And.625=625/1000=
And.5625=5625/10000=9/10
III. To find the value of a decimal, in the lower denominations.

Multiply the given decimal by the number of parts in the next lower
denomination; from the product cut off as many decimals as are in the given
number.

Multiply these by the parts in the next lower denomination again, cutting off
the same number of decimals as before.

And proceed in the same manner to the lowest denomination; then the several
integer parts cut off on the left hand will give the value of the decimal
proposed.

IV. To bring quantities to decimals of higher denominations.

CASE I.

If a single integer or decimal be proposed, reduce it to the higher
denomination, by dividing as in reduction of whole numbers.

EXAMPLES.
1. Reduce 9d to the decimal of a pound 2. Reduce 1dwt to the decimal of a lb.

CASE II.

A compound number may be reduced to a superior name by reducing each of its
parts, and taking the sum of the decimals; the best way to do which is thus:

Write the given numbers under each other, proceeding orderly from the least to
the greatest name, for dividends; draw a perpendicular line on the left of
these, and on the left of it write opposite to each dividend such a number, for
a divisor, as will reduce it to the next superior name; then begin with the
upper division, and affix the quotient of each to the next dividend, as a
decimal part of it, before it be divided, and the last sum will be the answer.

CIRCULATING DECIMALS.
IT has already been observed, that when an infinite decimal repeats always one
figure, it is a single repetend; and when more than one, a compound repetend,
or a circulate: also that a point is set over a single repetend, and a point
over the first and last figures of a circulate.

It may farther be observed, that when other decimal figures precede a
repetend, in any number, it is called a mixed number or quantity, as.23,
or.104123: otherwise it is a pure repetend as.3 and.123.

Similar repetends begin at the same place, and consist of the same number of
figures: as.3 and 6, or 1.341 and 2.156.

Dissimilar repetends begin at different places, and consist of an unequal
number of figures.

Similar and conterminous repetends, begin and end at the same place, as 2.9104
and.0613.

REDUCTION OF REPEATING DECIMALS.
CASE I. To reduce a single Repetend to a vulgar Fraction.

Make the given decimal the numerator; and for a denominator take as many nines
as there are recurring places in the given repetend.

If one or more of the left hand places, in the given decimal, be ciphers,
annex as many ciphers to the right hand of the nines in the denominator.

EXAMPLES.

1 So.3=3/9=. 4 And 2.63=2 63/99=2 7/11.

2 And.05=5/90=1/18. 5 And.0594405=594405/9999990=17/28.

3 And.123=123/999=41/333. 6 And.769230=769230/999999=10/13.

CASE II. To reduce a mixed Repetend to a vulgar Fraction.

To as many nines as there are figures in the repetend, annex as many ciphers
as there are finite places, for the denominator of the vulgar fraction.

Multiply the nines in the denominator by the finite part of the decimal, and
to the product add the repeating part, for the numerator.

Or find the vulgar fraction as before answering to the repetend, then join it
to the finite part, and reduce them to a common denominator.

EXAMPLES.
1. So ^ 2. And ^ 3. And ^ 4. And ^
ADDITION OF REPETENDS.
MAKE every line to begin and end at the same place, by extending the
repetends, and filling up the vacancies with the proper figures and ciphers.
Then add as in common numbers; only increase the sum of the right hand row, or
last row of the repetends, by as many units as the first row of repetends
contains nines. And the sum will circulate at the same places as the other
lines.

EXAMPLES.
(1) (2) 39.6548=39.65480 91.367=91.3570 81.046=81.04666 72.38=72.3888

SUBTRACTION OF REPETENDS.
MAKE the repetends to begin and end together, as in addition. Then subtract as
usual; only, if the repetend of the number to be subtracted exceed the repetend
of the other number, make the last figure of the remainder 1 less than it
otherwise would be.

EXAMPLES.
(1) (2) 76.32=76.3222 89.576=89.5760 54.7617=54.7617 12.5846=12.5846 Diff.

MULTIPLICATION OF REPETENDS.
1. WHEN a repetend is to be multiplied by a finite number: Multiply as in
common numbers; only observe what must be carried from the beginning of the
repetend to the end of it. And make all the lines begin and end together when
they are to be added.

2. In multiplying a finite decimal by a single repetend; multiply by the
repetend, and divide by.9 or 9/10.

3. In more complex cases, reduce the repetends to vulgar fractions; then
divide these, and reduce the quotient to a decimal, if necessary.

EXAMPLES.

32/9=12736/2970=4.2882154.

DIVISION OF REPETENDS.
1. IF the dividend only be a repetend, divide as in common numbers, bringing
down always the recurring figures, till the quotient become as exact as
requisite.

2. And if the divisor only be a repetend, it will be best to change it into
its equivalent vulgar fraction, then multiply by its numerator, and divide by
its denominator.

3. But if both divisor and dividend be repetends, change them both to vulgar
fractions.

INVOLUTION; OR RAISING OF POWERS.
A POWER is a number produced by multiplying any given number continually by
itself a certain number of times.

Any number is called the first power of itself; if it be multiplied by itself,
the product is called the second power, and sometimes the square; if this be
multiplied by the first power again, the product is called the third power, and
sometimes the cube; and if this be multiplied by the first power again, the
product is called the fourth power, etc. that is, the power is denominated from
the number which exceeds the number of multiplications by 1.

Thus: 3 is the first power of 3.

3 x 3=9 is the second power of 3.

3 x 3 x 3=27 is the third power of 3.

3 x 3 x 3 x 3=81 is the fourth power of 3.

etc. etc.

And in this manner may be calculated the following table.

The number which exceeds the multiplications by 1, is called the index or
exponent of the power: so the index of the first power is 1, that of the second
power is 2, that of the third is 3, and so on.

Powers are commonly denoted by writing their indices above the first power: so
the second power of 3 may be denoted thus, 32; the third power thus, 33; the
fourth power thus 34; etc. and the 6th power of 503, thus, 5036.

Involution is the finding of powers; to do which, from their definition there
evidently comes this.

RULE.
Multiply the given number, or first power, continually by itself, till the
number of multiplications be 1 less than the index of the power to be found,
and the last product will be the power required.

Note 1. Because fractions are multiplied by taking the products of their
numerators and of their denominators, they will be involved by raising each of
their terms to the power required. And if a mixed number be proposed, either
reduce it to an improper fraction, or reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal,
and proceed by the rule.

2. The raising of powers will be sometimes shortened by working according to
this observation, viz. whatever two or more powers are multiplied together,
their product is the power whose index is the sum of the indices of the
factors; or if a power be multiplied by itself, the product will be the power
whose index is double of that which is multiplied; so if I would find the sixth
power, I might multiply the given number twice by itself for the third power,
then the third power into itself would give the sixth power; or if I would find
the seventh power; I might first find the third and fourth, and their product
would be the seventh; or lastly, if I would find the eighth power, I might
first find the second, then the second into itself would be the fourth, and
this into itself would be the eighth.

Ex. 5. The square of is x =4/9.

Ex. 6. The cube of 5/9 is 5/9 x 5/9 x 5/9=125/729.

Ex. 7. The square of 3 or 17/5 is 17/5 x 17/5=289/25=11 14/25=11.56.

EVOLUTION; OR EXTRACTION OF ROOTS.
The root of any given number, or power, is such a number, as being multiplied
by itself a certain number of times, will produce the power; and it is
denominated the first, second, third, fourth, etc. root, respectively, as the
number of multiplications made of it to produce the given power is 0, 1, 2, 3,
etc. that is, the name of the root is taken from the number which exceeds the
multiplications by 1, like the name of the power in involution.

The index of the root, like that of the power in involution, is 1 more than
the number of the multiplications necessary to produce the power or given
number. So 2 is the index of the second or square root; and 3 the index of the
3d or cubic root; and 4 the index of the 4th root; and so on.

Roots are sometimes denoted by writing before the power, with the index of the
root against it: so the third root of 50 is 350, and the second root of it is
50, the index 2 being omitted, which index is always understood when a root is
named or written without one, but if the power be expressed by several numbers
with the sign + or -, etc. between them, then a line is drawn from the top of
the sign of the root or radical sign, over all the parts of it; so the third
root of 47-15 is ^. and sometimes roots are designed like powers, with the
reciprocal or the index of the root above the given number. So the root of 3 is
3, the root of 50 is 50, and the third root of it is 50, also the third root of
47 -- 15 is ^. And this method of notation has justly prevailed in the modern
algebra; because such roots, being considered as fractional powers, need no
other directions for any operations to be made with them, than those for
integral powers.

A number is called a complete power of any kind, when its root of the same
kind can be accurately extracted; but if not, the number is called an imperfect
power, and its root a surd or irrational quantity. So 4 is a complete power of
the second kind, its root being 2; but an imperfect power of the third kind,
its third root being a surd quantity, which cannot be accurately extracted.

Evolution is the finding of the roots of numbers, either accurately, or in
decimals to any proposed degree of accuracy.

The power is first to be prepared for extraction, or evolution, by dividing
it, by means of points or commas, from the place of units, to the left hand in
integers, and to the right in decimal fractions, into periods, containing each
as many places of figures as are denoted by the index of the root, if the power
contain a complete number of such periods; that is each period to have two
figures for the square root, three for the cube root, four for the fourth root,
and so on. And when the last period in decimals is not complete, ciphers are
added to complete it.

Note, The root will contain just as many places of figures as there are
periods or points in the given power; and they will be integers, or decimals
respectively, as the periods are so from which they are found, or to which they
correspond; that is, there will be as many integer or decimal figures in the
root, as there are periods of integers or decimals in the given number.

TO EXTRACT THE SQUARE ROOT.
1. Having divided the given number into periods of two figures each, find,
from the table of powers in page 25, or otherwise, a square number either equal
to, or the next less than the first period, which subtract from it, and place
the root of the square on the right of the given number, after the manner of a
quotient in division, for the first figure of the root required.

2. To the remainder annex the second period for a dividend; and on the left
thereof write the double of the root already found, after the manner of a
divisor.

3. Find how often the divisor is contained in the dividend, wanting its last
figure on the right hand; place that number for the next figure in the
quotient, and on the right of the divisor, as also below the same.

4. Multiply the whole increased divisor by it, placing the product below the
dividend, which subtract from it, and to the remainder bring down the next
period, for a new dividend; to which, as before, find a divisor by doubling the
figures already found in the root; and from these find the next figure of the
root, as in the last article; and continue the operation still in the same
manner till all the periods be used, or as far as you please.

Note. Instead of doubling the root to find the new divisors, you may add the
last divisor to the figure below it.

To prove the work, multiply the root by itself, and to the product add the
remainder, and the sum will be the given number.

Ex. 1. To extract the root of 17.3056.

Having divided the given number into three periods, namely 17, and 30, and 56,
I find that 16 is the next square to 17, the first period, which set below, and
subtracting, 1 remains, to which bring down 30, the next period, makes 130 for
a dividend. Then 4, the root of ^
16, is set on the right of the given number for the first figure of the root,
and its double, or 8, on the left of the dividend for the first figure of the
divisor; which being once contained in 13, the dividend wanting its last
figure, gives 1 for the next figure of the root, which 1 is accordingly set in
the root, making 4.1, and in the divisor, making 81, as also below the same.
These multiplied make also 81, set below the dividend, and subtracting, we have
49 remaining, to which the last period 56 being brought down, we have 4956 for
the new dividend. Then, for a new divisor, either double the root 4.1, or else,
which is easier, to the last divisor add the figure 1 standing below it, and
either way gives 82 for the first part of the new divisor. This 82 is 6 times
contained in 495, and therefore 6 is the next figure, to set in the root and in
the divisor, as also below the same; which being then multiplied by it, gives
4956, the same as the dividend; therefore nothing remains, and 4.16, is the
root of 17.3056, as required.

Ex. 2. For the Root of 2025. ^

Ex. 3. For the Root of.000729. ^

Note, When all the periods of the given number are brought down and used, and
more figures are required to be found, the operation may be continued by adding
as many periods of ciphers as we please, namely, bringing always two ciphers at
once to each dividend. And when the root is to be extracted to a great number
of places, the work may be much abbreviated thus: having proceeded in the
extraction after the common method till you have found one more than half the
required number of figures in the root, the rest may be found by dividing the
last remainder by its corresponding divisor, annexing a cipher to every
dividual, as in division of decimals; or rather, without annexing ciphers, by
omitting continually the right hand figure of the divisor, after the manner of
the third contraction in division of decimals in page 10.

So the operation for the root of 2, to 12 or 13 places, may be thus.

EXAMPLE 4.

^

Here, having found the first seven figures 1.414213 by the common extraction,
by adding always periods of ciphers, the last six figures 562373 are found by
the method of contracted division in decimals, without adding ciphers to the
remainder, only pointing off a figure at each time from the last divisor. And
the same for the two following examples.

Ex. 5. For the root of 3.

^

Ex. 6. For the root of 5.

^

In like manner may be found the following Roots.

The root of 6 is 2.449490 The root of 7 is 2.645751 The root of 10 is 3.162278
The root of 11 is 3.316625
RULES for the Square Roots of Vulgar Fractions and Mixed Numbers.

First prepare all vulgar fractions, by reducing them to their least terms,
both for this and all other roots. Then

1. Take the root of the numerator and of the denominator for the respective
terms of the root required. And this is the best way if the denominator be a
complete power. But if it be not,

2. Multiply the numerator and denominator together; take the root of the
product; this root being made the numerator to the denominator of the given
fraction, or made the denominator to the numerator of it, will form the
fractional root required.

That is ^And this rule will serve whether the root be finite or infinite. Or,

3. Reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal, and extract its root.

4. Mixed numbers may be either reduced to improper fractions, and extracted by
the first or second rule; or the vulgar fraction may be reduced to a decimal,
then joined to the integer, and the root of the whole extracted.

Ex. 1. ^is

Ex. 2. ^or ^is 3/7;

Ex. 3. For the root of 9/12 ^

Ex. 4. For the root of 5/12 ^

TO FIND A MEAN PROPORTIONAL.
There are various uses of the square root, one of which is to find a mean
proportional between any two numbers, which is performed thus: Multiply the two
given numbers together, then extract the square root out of their product, and
it will be the mean proportional sought.

Ex. 1. To find a Mean Proportional between 3 and 12.

Here 3 x 12=36.

And 36 is 6, the mean proportional sought.

For 36612.

Ex. 2. To find a Mean between 2 and 5.

Here 2 x 5=10 (3.162278 the mean reqd.

^

Note, By means of the square root also we readily find the 4th root, or the
8th root, or the 16th root, etc. that is, the root of any power whose index is
some power of the number 2: namely, by extracting so often the square root as
is denoted by the index of that power of 2; that is, two extractions for the
4th root, three for the 8th root, and so on.

Thus for the 4th root of 97.41.

^

So that the 4th root of 97.41 is 3.14159999, which expresses the circumference
of a circle whose diameter is 1 nearly.

OTHER EXAMPLES.
The 4th root of 21035.8 is 12.0431407. The 4th root of - 2 is 1.259921.
TO EXTRACT THE CUBE ROOT.
RULE I.

1. Point the given number into periods of three places each, beginning at
units: and there will be as many integral places in the root, as there are
points over the integers in the given number.

2. Seek the greatest cube in the left hand period, write the root in the
quotient, and the cube under the period; from which subtract it, and to the
remainder bring down the next period: Call this the resolvend, under which draw
a line.

3. Under the resolvend, write the triple square of the root, so that units in
the latter stand under the place of hundreds in the former; under the triple
square of the root, write the triple root, removed one place to the right; and
the sum of these two lines call a divisor; under which draw a line.

4. Seek how often this divisor may be had in the resolvend, its right hand
place excepted, and write the result in the quotient.

5. Under the divisor, write the product of the triple square of the root by
the last quotient figure, setting units place of this line, under that of tens
in the divisor; under this line, write the product of the triple root by the
square of the last quotient figure, let this line be removed one place beyond
the right of the former; and under this line, removed one place forward to the
right, write the cube of the last quotient figure; the sum of these three lines
call the subtrahend, under which draw a line.

6. Subtract the subtrahend from the resolvend; to the remainder bring down the
next period for a new resolvend; the divisor to this, must be the triple square
of all the quotient added to the triple thereof, etc. as in the third article,
etc.

EXAMPLE I.

What is the cube root of 48228544?

^

If the work of this example be well considered, and compared with the
foregoing rule, it will be easy to conceive how any other example of the like
nature may be wrought; and here observe that when the cube root is extracted to
more than two places, there is a necessity of doing some work upon a spare
piece of paper, in order to come at the root's triple square, and the product
of the triple root by the square of the quotient figure, etc.

In this example, the given number is a cube number, and therefore at the end
of the operation there remained nothing; for 364 multiplied by 364, the product
multiplied by 364 gives 48228544, the given number.

But if the number given be not a cube number; then, to the last remainder
always bring down three ciphers, and work anew for a decimal fraction if
needful.

These examples are all performed in the same manner as the foregoing one.

TO FIND TWO MEAN PROPORTIONALS.
There are many uses of the cube root; one is to find two mean proportionals
between two given numbers, which is performed thus:

Divide the greater extreme by the less, and the cube root of the quotient
multiplied by the less extreme, gives the less mean. Multiply the said cube
root by the less mean, and the product is the greater mean proportional.

Note, This is only understood of those numbers that are in continued geometric
proportion.

EXAMPLE. I.

What are the two mean proportionals between 4 and 108?

108 divided by 4 gives 27, whose cube root is 3; and the less extreme 4,
multiplied thereby, gives 12 for the less mean; and 12 multiplied by the said
root 3, gives 36 for the greater mean.

For 4 is to 12, as 36 to 108.

EXAMPLE II.

Find the two geometric means between 8 and 1728?

Now 8) 1728 (216, whose cube root is 6. And 6 times 8 is 48, the less mean,
and 6 times 48 is 288 the greater mean.

For 8 is to 48 as 288 to 1728.

If the rule already given for the cube root be thought too tedious, the
following one will be found much more ready for use.

RULE II. TO EXTRACT THE CUBE ROOT.

1. By trials take the nearest rational cube to the given cube or number, and
call it the assumed cube.

2. Then the sum of the given number and double the assumed cube will be to the
sum of the assumed cube and double the given number, as the root of the assumed
cube, is to the root required, nearly. Or as the first sum is to the difference
of the given and assumed cube, so is the assumed root, to the difference of the
roots nearly.

3. Again, by using, in like manner, the cube of the root last found as a new
assumed cube, another root will be obtained still nearer. And so on as far as
we please; using always the cube of the last-found root, for the assumed cube.

EXAMPLE. To find the cube root of 21034.8.

Here we soon find that the root lies between 20 and 30, and then between 27
and 28. Taking therefore 27, its cube is 19683 the assumed cube. Then ^

Again, for a second operation, the cube of this root is 21035.318645155823,
and the process by the latter method will be thus: ^

TO EXTRACT ANY ROOT WHATEVER.
Let G be the given power or number, n the index of the power, A the assumed
power, r its root, R the required root of G.

Then as the sum of n+1 times A and n -- 1 times G, is to the sum of n+1 times
G and n -- 1 times A, so is the assumed root r, to the required root R.

Or, as half the said sum of n+1 times A and n -- 1 times G, is to the
difference between the given and assumed powers, so is the assumed root r, to
the difference between the true and assumed roots: which difference added or
subtracted, gives the true root nearly.

That is, ^.

Or, ^.

And the operation may be repeated as often as we please, by using always the
last found root for the assumed root, and its nth power for the assumed power A.

EXAMPLE. To extract the 5th Root of 21035.8.

Here it appears that the 5th root is between 7.3 and 7.4. Taking 7.3, its 5th
power is 20730.71593. Hence then we have ^.

GENERAL RULES for extracting any Root out of a Vulgar Fraction or Mixed Number.
1. If the given fraction have a finite root of the kind required, it is best
to extract the root out of the numerator and denominator, for the terms of the
root required.

2. But if the fraction be not a complete power, it may be thrown into a
decimal, and then extracted. Or,

3. Take either of the terms of the given fraction for the corresponding term
of the root; and for the other term of the root, extract the required root of
the product, arising from the multiplication of such a power of the first
assigned term of the root whose index is less by 1 than that of the given
power, by the other term of the given number.

This rule will do when the root is either finite or infinite.

This is ^.

4. Mixed numbers may be reduced either to improper fractions or decimals, and
then extracted.

DUODECIMALS: OR CROSS MULTIPLICATION.
DUODECIMALS are so called because they decrease by twelves, from the place of
seet toward the right hand. Inches are sometimes called primes, and are marked
thus; the next division after inches are called parts, or seconds, and are
marked thus; the next are thirds, and marked thus; and so on.

This rule is otherwise called Cross Multiplication, because the factors are
sometimes multiplied cross ways. And it is commonly used by workmen and
artificers in casting up the contents of their work; though a much better way
would be by a Decimal Scale.

RULE I.
1. Under the multiplicand write the same names or denominations of the
multiplier; that is, feet under feet, inches under inches, parts under parts,
etc.

2. Multiply each term in the multiplicand, beginning at the lowest, by the
feet in the multiplier, and write each result under its respective term,
observing to carry an unit for every 12, from each lower denomination to its
next superior.

3. In the same manner multiply every term in the multiplicand by the inches in
the multiplier, and set the result of each term one place removed to the right
of those in the multiplicand.

4. Proceed in like manner with the seconds, and all the rest of the
denominations, if there be any more; and the sum of all the lines will be the
product required.

Or the denominations of the particular products will be as follows: Feet by
feet, give feet. Feet by primes, give primes. Feet by seconds, give seconds.
etc.
Primes by primes, give seconds. Primes by seconds, give thirds. Primes by
thirds, give fourths. etc.
Seconds by seconds, give fourths. Seconds by thirds, give fifths. Seconds by
fourths, give sixths. etc.
Thirds by thirds, give sixths. Thirds by fourths, give sevenths. Thirds by
fifths, give eighths. etc.


In general thus:

When feet are concerned, the product is of the same denomination with the term
multiplying the feet.

When feet are not concerned, the name of the product will be expressed by the
sum of the indices of the two factors.

Ex. 1. Multiply ^

RULE II.
When the feet in the multiplicand are expressed by a large number.

Multiply first by the feet of the multiplier, as before. Then, instead of
multiplying by the inches and parts, etc. proceed as in the Rule of Practice,
by taking such aliquot parts of the multiplicand as correspond with the inches
and seconds, etc. of the multiplier. Then the sum of them all will be the
product required.

Ex. 2. Multiply ^

RULE III.
If the feet in both the multiplicand and multiplier be large numbers.

Multiply the feet only into each other: then, for the inches and seconds in
the multiplier, take parts of the multiplicand; and for the inches and seconds
of the multiplicand, take aliquot parts of the feet only in the multiplier. And
the sum of all will be the product.

Ex. 3 Multiply ^

Another Method.

From any point m as a center, with the radius or distance mA, describe an arc
cutting the given line in n and A. -- Through n and m draw a right line cutting
the arc in r. -- Lastly, draw Ar, and it will be the perpendicular as required.

From any plane scale of equal parts set off Am equal to 4 parts. -- With
center A, and radius of 3 parts, describe an arc. -- And with center m, and
radius of 5 parts, cross it at n. -- Draw An for the perpendicular required.

Note. Angles of more than 90 degrees are usually taken off at twice.

Describe the arc mn with the chord of 60 degrees, as in the last Problem. --

Make Bm perpendicular and equal to half AB. -- Draw Am, and produce it till mn

intersecting in o, which will be the center of the circumscribing circle. --
Then with the center o, and the same radius, describe the circle; and about the
circumference of it apply AB the proper number of times.

diagram

Another Method.

Make Bm perpendicular and equal to AB. -- Bisect AB in n; then with the center
n, and radius nm, cross AB produced in o. -- With the centers A and B, and
radius Ao, describe arcs intersecting in D, the opposite angle of the pentagon.
-- Lastly, with center D, and radius AB, cross those arcs again in C and E, the

A third Method, nearly true.

On the centers A and B, with the radius AB, describe two circles intersecting
in m and n. -- With the same radius, and the center m, describe rAOBS, and draw

PROBLEM XXV. To make any regular Polygon on a given Line AB.
Draw Ao and Bo making the angles A and B each equal to half the angle of the
polygon -- With the center o and radius oA, describe a circle. -- Then apply
the line AB continually round the circumference the proper number of times, and
it is done.

diagram

Note. The angle of any polygon, of which the angles oAB and oBA are each one
half, is found thus: divide the whole 360 degrees by the number of sides, and
the quotient will be the angle at the center o; then subtract that from 180
degrees, and the remainder will be the angle of the polygon, and is double of
oAB or of oBA. And thus you will find the following table, containing the
degrees in the angle o at the center, and the angle of the polygon, for all the
regular figures from 3 to 12 sides.

No. of sides Name of the polygon Angle o at the center Angle of the polyg

the Circumference into any number of equal Parts. (See the last figure.)
At the center o make an angle equal to the angle at the center of the polygon,
as contained in the third column of the above table of polygons. -- Then the
distance AB will be one side of the polygon; which being carried round the
circumference the proper number of times, will complete the figure. -- Or, the
arc AB will be one of the equal parts of the circumference.

Another Method, nearly true.

Draw the diameter AB, which divide into as many equal parts as the figure has
sides. -- With the radius AB, and centers A and B, describe arcs crossing at n;
from whence draw nC through the second division on the diameter; so shall AC be
a side of the polygon nearly.

Another Method, still nearer.

Divide the diameter AB into as many equal parts as the figure has sides, as
before. -- From the center o raise the perpendicular om, which produce till mn
be three-fourths of the radius om. -- From n draw nc through the second
division of the diameter, and the line AC will be the side of the polygon still
nearer than before; or the arc AC one of the equal parts into which the
circumference is to be divided.

the inscribed circle; or with the distance to one of the angles, as A, describe
the circumscribing circle.

triangle.

PROBLEM XXXII. In, or about, a given Circle, to describe a Square, or an
Octagon.

extremities, and they will give the inscribed square ACBD. -- Also through
their extremities draw tangents parallel to them, and they will form the outer
square mnop.

diagram

Note. If any quadrant, as AC, be bisected in q, it will give one-eighth of the
circumference, or the side of the octagon.

PROBLEM XXXIII. In a given Circle, to inscribe a Trigon, a Hexagon, or a
Dodecagon.
The radius is the side of the hexagon. Therefore from any point A in the
circumference, with the distance of the radius, describe the arc BOF. Then is
AB the side of the hexagon; and therefore carrying it six times round will form
the hexagon, or divide the circumference into six equal parts, each containing
60 degrees. -- The second of these C, will give AC the side of the trigon or
equilateral triangle; and the arc AC one third of the circumference, or 120
degrees. -- Also the half of AB, or An is one-12th of the circumference, or 30
degrees, and gives the side of the dodecagon.

diagram

Note. If tangents to the circle be drawn through all the angular points of any
inscribed figure, they will form the sides of a like circumscribing figure.

diagram

Note. Circles, or any other similar figures, are added in the same manner.
For, if AB and BC be the diameters of two circles, AC will be the diameter of a
circle equal to both the other two. And if AB and BC be the like sides of any
two similar figures, then AC will be the like side of another similar figure
equal to both the two former, and upon which the third figure may be

On the one of these set off AB the side of one of the given squares, and on the
other AC the side of another of them. Join BC, and it will be the side of a
square equal to the two together. -- Then take AD equal to BC, and AE equal to
the side of the third given square. So shall DE be the side of a square equal
to the sum of the three given squares. -- And so on continually, always setting
more sides of the given squares on the line An, and the sides of the successive
sums on the other line Am.

diagram

Note. And thus any number of any sort of figures may be added together.

PROBLEM L. To make plane Diagonal Scales.
diagram

Draw any line as AB of any convenient length. Divide it into 11 equal parts
Only 4 parts are here drawn, for want of room.
. Complete these into rectangles of a convenient height, by drawing parallel
and perpendicular lines. Divide the altitude into 10 equal parts, if it be for
a decimal scale for common numbers, or into 12 equal parts, if it be for feet
and inches; and through these points of division draw as many parallel lines,
the whole length of the scale. -- Then divide the length of the first division
AC into 10 equal parts, both above and below; and connect these points of
division by diagonal lines, and the scale is finished, after being numbered as
you please.

Note. These diagonal scales serve to take off dimensions or numbers of three
figures. If the first large divisions be units; the second set of divisions
along AC, will be 10th parts; and the divisions in the altitude, along AD, will
be 100th parts. If CD be tens, AC will be units, and AD will be 10th parts. If
CB be hundreds, AC will be tens, and AD units. If CB be thousands, AC will be
hundreds, and AD will be tens. And so on, each set of divisions being tenth
parts of the former ones.

For example, suppose it were required to take off 243 from the scale. Fix one
foot of the compasses at 2 of the greatest divisions, at the bottom of the
scale, and extend the other to 4 of the second divisions, along the bottom;
then, for the 3, slide up both points of the compasses by a parallel motion,
till they fall upon the third longitudinal line; and in that position extend
the second point of the compasses to the fourth diagonal line, and you have the
extent of three figures as required.

Or if you have any line to measure the length of. -- Take it between the
compasses, and applying it to scale, suppose it fall between 3 and 4 of the
large divisions; or, more nearly, that it is 3 of the large divisions, or 3
hundreds, and between 5 and 6 of the second divisions, or 5 tens or 50, and a
little more. Slide up the points of the compasses by a parallel motion, keeping
one foot always on the vertical division of 3 hundred, till the other point
fall exactly on one of the diagonal lines, which suppose to be 8, which is 8
units. Which shows that the length of the line, proposed to be measured, is 358.

PLANE SCALES FOR TWO FIGURES.


The above are three other forms of scales, the first of which is a decimal
scale, for taking off common numbers consisting of two figures. The other two
are duodecimal scales, and serve for feet and inches, etc.

These, and other scales, engraven on ivory, are fittest for practical use. And
the most convenient form of a plane scale of equal divisions, is on the very
edge of the ivory, made thin at the edge for laying along any line, and then
marking on the paper opposite any division required: which is better than
taking lengths off a scale with compasses.

REMARKS.
Note 1. That in a circle, the half chord DC, is a mean proportional between
the segments AD, DB of the diameter AB perpendicular to it. That is AD: DCDCDB.

diagram

2. The chord AC is a mean proportional between AD and the diameter AB. And the
chord BC a mean proportional between DB and AB.

That is, ADACACAB, and BDBCBCAB.

3. The angle ACB, in a semicircle, is always a right

4. The square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, is equal to the
squares of both the sides.

That is, AC2=AD2+DC2, and BC2=BD2+DC2, and AB2=AC2+BC2.

5. Triangles that have all the three angles of the one, respectively equal to
all the three of the other, are called equiangular triangles, or similar
triangles.

6. In similar triangles, the like sides, or sides opposite the equal angles,
are proportional.

7. The areas, or spaces, of similar triangles, are to each other, as the
squares of their like sides.

MENSURATION OF SUPERFICIES.
THE area of any figure, is the measure of its surface, or the space contained
within the bounds of the surface, without any regard to thickness.

The area is estimated by the number of squares contained in the surface, the
side of those squares being either an inch, a foot, a yard, etc. And hence the
area is said to be so many square inches, or square feet, or square yards, etc.

Our ordinary lineal measures, or measures of length, are as in the first table
here below; and the annexed table of square measures, is taken from it, by
squaring the several numbers.

diameter, which remains fixed.

diagram

9. The axis of a solid, is a line drawn from the middle of one end, to the
middle of the opposite end; as between the opposite ends of a prism. Hence the

perpendicular to its base. -- This is equal to the axis in a right prism or
pyramid; but in an oblique one, the height is the perpendicular side of a
right-angled triangle, whose hypotenuse is the axis.

12. Also a prism or pyramid is regular or irregular, as its base is a regular
or an irregular plane figure.

half sphere, and of a cone having the same base with the segment, and its
vertex in the center of the sphere.

And the linear sides, or edges of the solid, are the sides of the plane faces.

20. There are only five regular bodies: namely, 1st, the tetraedron, which is
a regular pyramid, having four triangular faces; 2d, the hexaedron, or cube,
which has 6 equal square faces; 3d, the octaedron, which has 8 triangular
faces; 4th, the dodecaedron, which has 12 pentagonal faces; 5th, the
icosaedron, which has 20 triangular faces.

Note, If the following figures be exactly drawn on pasteboard, and the lines
cut half through, so that the parts be turned up and glued together, they will
represent the five regular bodies: namely, figure 1 the tetraedron, figure 2
the hexaedron, figure 3 the octaedron, figure 4 the dodecaedron, and figure 5
the icosaedron.

OF THE CARPENTER's RULE.
THIS instrument is otherwise called the sliding rule; and it is much used in
timber measuring and artificers works, both for taking the dimensions, and
casting up the contents.

The instrument consists of two equal pieces, each a foot in length, which are
connected together by a folding joint.

One side or face of the rule, is divided into inches, and half-quarters, or
eighths. On the same face also are several plane scales, divided into twelfth
parts by diagonal lines; which are used in planning dimensions that are taken
in feet and inches. The edge of the rule is commonly divided decimally, or into
tenths; namely each foot into 10 equal parts, and each of these into 10 parts
again: so that by means of this last scale, dimensions are taken in feet and
tenths and hundredths, and multiplied as common decimal numbers, which is the
best way.

On the one part of the other face are four lines, marked A, B, C, D, the two
middle ones B and C being on a slider, which runs in a groove made in the
stock. The same numbers serve for both these two middle lines, the one being
above the numbers, and the other below.

These four lines are logarithmic ones, and the three A, B, C, which are all
equal to one another, are double lines, as they proceed twice over from 1 to
10. The other or lowest line D, is a single one, proceeding from 4 to 40. It is
also called the girt line, from its use in casting up the contents of trees and
timber; and upon it are marked WG at 17.15, and AG at 18.95, the wine and ale
gage points, to make this instrument serve the purpose of a gaging rule.

Upon the other part of this face there is a table of the value of a load, or
50 cubic feet, of timber, at all prices, from 6 pence to 2 shillings a foot.

When 1 at the beginning of any line is accounted 1, then the 1 in the middle
will be 10, and the 10 at the end 100; and when 1 at the beginning is accounted
10, then the 1 in the middle is 100, and the 10 at the end 1000; and so on. And
all the smaller divisions are altered proportionally.

PROBLEM I. To multiply Numbers together.
Suppose the two numbers 24 and 13. -- Set 1 o^ B to 13 on A; then against 24
on B stands 312 on A, which is the required product of the two given numbers 24
and 13.

Note. In any operations, when a number runs beyond the end of the line, seek
it on the other radius, or other part of the line, that is, take the 10th part
of it, or the 100th part of it, etc. and increase the result proportionally 10
fold, or 100 fold, etc.

In like manner the product of 35 and 19 is 665, and the product of 270 and 54
is 14580.
PROBLEM II. To divide by the Sliding Rule.
As suppose to divide 312 by 24. -- Set the divisor 24 on B to the dividend 312
on A; then against 1 on B stands 13 the quotient on A.

Also 396 divided by 27 gives 14.6, and 741 divided by 42 gives 17.6.
PROBLEM III. To Square any Number.
Suppose to square 23. -- Set 1 on B to 23 on A; then against 23 on B stands
529 on A, which is the square of 23.

Or, by the other two lines, set 1 or 100 on C to the 10 on D, then against
every number on D stands its square in the line C. So against 23 stands 529
against 20 stands 400 against 30 stands 900 and so on.


If the given number be hundreds, etc. reckon the 1 on D for 100, or 1000, etc.
then the corresponding 1 on C is 10000, or 1000000, etc. So the square of 230
is found to be 52900.

PROBLEM IV. To extract the Square Root.
Set 1 or 100, etc. on C to 1 or 10, etc. on D; then against every number found
on C, stands its square root on D.

So, against 529 stands its root 23 against 400 stands its root 20 against 900
stands its root 30 against 300 stands its root 17.3 and so on.
PROBLEM V. To find a Mean Proportional between two Numbers.
As suppose between 29 and 430. -- Set the one number 29 on C to the same on D;
then against the other number 430 on C, stands their mean proportional 111 on D.

Also, the mean between 29 and 320 is 96.3, and the mean between 71 and 274 is
139.
PROBLEM VI. To find a Third Proportional to two Numbers.
Suppose to 21 and 32. -- Set the first 21 on B to the second 32 on A; then
against the second 32 on B, stands 48.8 on A, which is the third proportional
sought.

Also the 3d proportional to 17 and 29 is 49.4, and the 3d proportional to 73
and 14 is 2.5.
PROBLEM VII. To find a Fourth Proportional to three Numbers. Or, to perform
the Rule-of-Three.
Suppose to find a fourth proportional to 12, 28, and 114. -- Set the first
term 12 on B to the 2d term 28 on A; then against the third term 114 on B,
stands 266 on A, which is the 4th proportional sought.

Also the 4th proportional to 6, 14, 29, is 67.6, and the 4th proportional to
27, 20, 73, is 54.0.
TIMBER MEASURING.
PROBLEM I. To find the Area, or Superficial Content of a Board or Plank.
MULTIPLY the length by the mean breadth.

Note. When the board is tapering, add the breadths at the two ends together,
and take half the sum for the mean breadth.

By the Sliding Rule.

Set 12 on B to the breadth in inches on A; then against the length in feet on
B, is the content on A, in feet and fractional parts.

EXAMPLES.

1. What is the value of a plank, whose length is 12 feet 6 inches, and mean
breadth 11 inches?

^

By the Sliding Rule.

As 12 B11 A12 B11 A.

That is, as 12 on B is to 11 on A, so is 12 on B to 11 on A.

Ex. 2. Required the content of a board, whose length is 11 feet 2 inches, and
breadth 1 foot 10 inches.

Ans. 20f 5 8.

Ex. 3. What is the value of a plank, which is 12 feet 9 inches long, and 1
foot 3 inches broad, at 2d a foot?

Ans. 3s 3d.

Ex. 4. Required the value of 5 oaken planks at 3d per foot, each of them being
17 feet long; and their several breadths are as follows, namely, two of 13
inches in the middle, one of 14 inches in the middle, and the two remaining
ones, each 18 inches at the broader end, and 11 at the narrower. Ans. L 1 5 8.

PROBLEM II. To find the Solid Content of Squared or Four-sided Timber.
Multiply the mean breadth by the mean thickness, and the product again by the
length, and the last product will give the content.

By the Sliding Rule.

C D D C As length12 or 10quarter girtsolidity.

That is, as the length in feet on C, is to 12 on D when the quarter girt is in
inches, or to 10 on D when it is in tenths of feet; so is the quarter girt on
D, to the content on C.

Note 1. If the tree taper regularly from the one end to the other, either take
the mean breadth and thickness in the middle, or take the dimensions at the two
ends, and half their sum will be the mean dimensions.

2. If the piece do not taper regularly, but is unequally thick in some parts
and small in others, take several different dimensions, add them all together,
and divide their sum by the number of them, for the mean dimensions.

3. The quarter girt is a geometrical mean proportional between the mean
breadth and thickness, that is the square root of their product. Sometimes
unskilful measurers use the arithmetical mean instead of it, that it half their
sum: but this is always attended with error, and the more so as the breadth and
depth differ the more from each other.

EXAMPLES.

1. The length of a piece of timber is 18 feet 6 inches, the breadths at the
greater and less end 1 foot 6 inches and 1 foot 3 inches, and the thickness at
the greater and less end 1 foot 3 inches and 1 foot: required the solid content.

girt. C D D C As 18 12 14.9 28.6, the content.

Ex. 2. What is the content of the piece of timber, whose length is 24 feet,
and the mean breadth and thickness each 1.04 feet?

Ans. 26 feet.

Ex. 3. Required the content of a piece of timber, whose length is 20.38 feet,
and its ends unequal squares, the side of the greater being 19, and the side of
the less 9.

Ans. 29.838 feet.

Ex. 4. Required the content of the piece of timber, whose length is 27.36
feet; at the greater end the breadth is 1.78, and thickness 1.23; and at the
less end the breadth is 1.04, and thickness 0.91.

Ans. 41.278 feet.

PROBLEM III. To find the Solidity of Round or Unsquared Timber.
Rule 1, or Common Rule.

Multiply the square of the quarter girt, or of of the mean circumference, by
the length, for the content.

By the Sliding Rule.

As the length upon C12 or 10 upon D quarter girt, in 12ths or 10ths, on D
content on C.

Note. 1. When the tree is tapering, take the mean dimensions as in the former
problems, either by girting it in the middle, for the mean girt, or at the two
ends, and take half the sum of the two. But when the tree is very irregular,
divide it into several lengths, and find the content of each part separately.

2. This rule, which is commonly used, gives the answer about less than the
true quantity in the tree, or nearly what the quantity would be after the tree
is hewed square in the usual way: so that it seems intended to make an
allowance for the squaring of the tree. When the true quantity is desired, use
the 2d rule, given below.

EXAMPLES.

1. A piece of round timber being 9 feet 6 inches long, and its mean quarter
girt 42 inches; what is the content?

^

By the Sliding Rule.

C D D C As 9.5 10 35 116 Or 9.5 12 42 116

Ex. 2. The length of a tree is 24 feet, its girt at the thicker end 14 feet,
and at the smaller end 2 feet; required the content.

Ans. 96 feet.

Ex. 3. What is the content of a tree, whose mean girt is 3.15 feet, and length
14 feet 6 inches?

Ans. 8.9929 feet.

Ex. 4. Required the content of a tree, whose length is 17 feet, and which
girts in five different places as follows, namely, in the first place 9.43
feet, in the second 7.92, in the third 6.15, in the fourth 4.74, and in the
fifth 3.16.

Ans. 42.6075.

RULE 2.

Multiply the square of of the mean girt by double the length, and the product
will be the content, very near the truth.

By the Sliding Rule.

As the double length on C12 or 10 on D of the girt, in 12ths or 10ths, on D
content on C.

EXAMPLES.

1. What is the content of a tree, its length being 9 feet 6 inches, and its
mean girt 14 feet?

^

By the Sliding Rule. C D D C As 19 10 28 149. Or 19 12 33 6/10 149.

Ex. 2. Required the content of a tree, which is 24 feet long, and mean girt 8
feet.

Ans. 122.88 feet.

Ex. 3. The length of a tree is 14 feet, and mean girt 3.15 feet; what is the
content?

Ans. 11.51 feet.

Ex. 4. The length of a tree is 17 feet, and its mean girt 6.28; what is the
content?

Ans. 54.4065 feet.

Other curious problems relating to the cutting of timber, so as to produce
uncommon effects, may be found in my large Treatise on Mensuration; from which
may be seen the absurd and mischievous consequences attending the constant use
of the first or common rule for measuring round timber in all cases.

ARTIFICERS WORK.
ARTIFICERS compute the contents of their works by several different measures.

As glazing and masonry by the foot.

Painting, plastering, paving, etc. by the yard, of 9 square feet.

Flooring, partitioning, roofing, tiling, etc. by the square, of 100 square
feet.

And brickwork either by the yard of 9 square feet, or by the perch, or square,
rod or pole, containing 272 square feet, or 30 square yards, being the square
of the rod or pole of 16 feet or 5 yards long.

As this number 272 is a troublesome number to divide by, the is often omitted
in practice, and the content in feet divided only by the 272. But as this is
not exact, it will be both better and easier to multiply the feet by 4, and
then divide successively by 9, 11, and 11. Also to divide square yards by 30,
first multiply them by 4, and then divide twice by 11.

All works, whether superficial or solid, are computed by the rules proper to
the figure of them, whether it be a triangle, or rectangle, a parallelopiped,
or any other figure.

BRICKLAYERS WORK.
BRICKWORK is estimated at the rate of a brick and a half thick; and if a wall
be more or less than this standard thickness, it must be reduced to it, as
follows:

Multiply the superficial content of the wall by the number of half bricks in
the thickness, and divide the product by 3.

The dimensions of a building are usually taken by measuring half round on the
outside, and half round it on the inside; the sum of these two gives the
compass of the wall, to be multiplied by the height for the content of the
materials.

Chimneys are by some measured as if they were solid, deducting only the
vacuity from the hearth to the mantle, on account of the trouble of them.

And by others they are girt or measured round for their breadth, and the
height of the story is their height, taking the depth of the jambs for their
thickness. And in this case no reduction is made for the vacuity from the floor
to the mantle tree, because of the gathering of the breast and wings, to make
room for the hearth in the next story.

To measure the chimney shafts, which appear above the building; girt them
about with a line for the breadth, to multiply by their height. And account
their thickness half a brick more than it really is, in consideration of the
plastering and scaffolding.

All windows, doors, etc. are to be deducted out of the contents of the walls
in which they are placed. But this deduction is made only with regard to
materials; for the whole measure is taken for workmanship, and that all outside
measure too, namely, measuring quite round the outside of the building, being
in consideration of the trouble of the returns or angles. They have also some
other allowances, such as double measure for feathered gable ends, etc.

EXAMPLES.

1. How many yards and rods of standard brickwork are in a wall whose length or
compass is 57 feet 3 inches, and height 24 feet 6 inches; the walls being 2
bricks or 5 half bricks thick?

^

By the Sliding Rule.

B A B A As 1 24 57 1403.

Ex. 2. Required the content of a wall 62 feet 6 inches long, and 14 feet 8
inches high, and 2 bricks thick.

Ans. 169.753 yards.

Ex. 3. A triangular gable is raised 17 1/^ feet high, on an end wall whose
length is 24 feet 9 inches, the thickness being 2 bricks: required the reduced
content.

Ans. 32.08 yds.

Ex. 4. The end wall of a house is 28 feet 10 inches long, and 55 feet 8 inches
high to the eaves; 20 feet high is 2 bricks thick, other 20 feet high is 2
bricks thick, and the remaining 15 feet 8 inches is 1 brick thick; above which
is a triangular gable, which rises 42 courses of bricks, of which every 4
courses make a foot. What is the whole content in standard measure.

Ans. 253.626 yards.

MASONS WORK.
TO masonry belongs all sorts of stone work; and the measure made use of is a
foot, either superficial or solid.

Walls, columns, blocks of stone or marble, etc. are measured by the cubic
foot; and pavements, slabs, chimney-pieces, etc. by the superficial or square
foot.

Cubic or solid measure is used for the materials, and square measure for the
workmanship.

In the solid measure, the true length, breadth, and thickness, are taken, and
multiplied continually together. In the superficial, there must be taken the
length and breadth of every part of the projection, which is seen without the
general upright face of the building.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the solid content of a wall, 53 feet 6 inches long, 12 feet 3
inches high, and 2 feet thick.

Ans. 21f 10in.

CARPENTERS AND JOINERS WORK.
TO this branch belongs all the wood-work of a house, such as flooring,
partitioning, roofing, etc.

Note. Large and plain articles are usually measured by the square foot or
yard, etc. but enriched mouldings, and some other articles, are often estimated
by running or lineal measure, and some things are rated by the piece.

In measuring of joists, it is to be observed, that only one of their
dimensions is the same with that of the floor; and the other will exceed the
length of the room by the thickness of the wall, and of the same, because each
end is let into the wall about of its thickness.

No deductions are made for hearths, on account of the additional trouble and
waste of materials.

Partitions are measured from wall to wall for one dimension, and from floor to
floor, as far as they extend, for the other.

No deduction is made for door-ways, on account of the trouble of framing them.

In measuring of joiners work, the string is made to ply close to every part of
the work over which it passes.

The measure of centering for cellars is found by making a string pass over the
surface of the arch for the breadth, and taking the length of the cellar for
the length; but in groin-centering, it is usual to allow double measure, on
account of their extraordinary trouble.

In roofing, the length of the house in the inside, together with of the
thickness of one gable, is to be considered as the length; and the breadth is
equal to double the length of a string which is stretched from the ridge down
the rafter, and along the eaves-board; till it meets with the top of the wall.

For stair-cases, take the breadth of all the steps, by making a line ply close
over them, from the top to the bottom, and multiply the length of this line by
the length of a step for the whole area. -- By the length of a step is meant
the length of the front and the returns at the two ends, and by the breadth is
to be understood the girt of its two upper surfaces, or the tread and riser.

For the balustrade, take the whole length of the upper part of the hand-rail,
and girt over its end till it meet the top of the newel post, for the length;
and twice the length of the baluster upon the landing, with the girt of the
hand-rail, for the breadth.

For wainscotting, take the compass of the room for the length; and the height
from the floor to the cieling, making the string ply close into all the
mouldings, for the breadth. -- Out of this must be made deductions for windows,
doors, and chimneys, etc. but workmanship is counted for the whole, on account
of the extraordinary trouble.

For doors, it is usual to allow for their thickness, by adding it into both
the dimensions of length and breadth, and then multiply them together for the
area. -- If the door be pannelled on both sides, take double its measure for
the workmanship; but if one side only be pannelled, take the area and its half
for the workmanship. -- For the surrounding architrave, gird it about the
outermost part for its length; and measure over it, as far as it can be seen
when the door is open, for the breadth.

Window-shutters, bases, etc. are measured in the same manner.

In the measuring of roofing for workmanship alone, all holes for chimney
shafts and sky-lights are generally deducted.

But in measuring for work and materials, they commonly measure in all
sky-lights, luthern-lights, and holes for the chimney shafts, on account of
their trouble and waste of materials.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the content of a floor 48 feet 6 inches long, and 24 feet 3 inches
broad.

^

Ex. 2. A floor being 36 feet 3 inches long, and 16 feet 6 inches broad, how
many squares are in it?

Ans. 5 sq. 98 feet.

Ex. 3. How many squares are there in 173 feet 10 inches in length, and 10 feet
7 inches height, of partitioning?

Ans. 18.3972 squares.

Ex. 4. What cost the roofing of a house at 10s 6d a square; the length, within
the walls, being 52 feet 8 inches, and the breadth 30 feet 6 inches; reckoning
the roof 3/2 of the flat?

Ans. L 12 12 11.

Ex. 5. To how much, at 6s per square yard, amounts the wainscotting of a room;
the height, taking in the cornice and mouldings, being 12 feet 6 inches, and
the whole compass 83 feet 8 inches; also the three window shutters are each 7
feet 8 inches by 3 feet 6 inches, and the door 7 feet by 3 feet 6 inches; the
door and shutters, being worked on both sides, are reckoned work and half work?

Ans. L 36 12 2

SLATERS AND TILERS WORK.
IN these articles, the content of a roof is found by multiplying the length of
the ridge by the girt over from eaves to eaves; making allowance in this girt
for the double row of slates at the bottom, or for how much one row of slates
or tiles is laid over another.

In angles formed in a roof, running from the ridge to the eaves, when the
angle bends inwards, it is called a valley; but when outward, it is called a
hip. And in tiling and slating, it is common to add the length of the valley or
hip to the content in feet.

Deductions are seldom made for chimney shafts or small window holes.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the content of a slated roof, the length being 45 feet 9 inches,
and whole girt 34 feet 3 inches.

^

Ex. 2. To how much amounts the tiling of a house, at 25s 6d per square; the
length being 43 feet 10 inches, and the breadth on the slat 27 feet 5 inches,
also the eaves projecting 16 inches on each side?

Ans. L 24 9 5.

PLASTERERS WORK.
PLASTERERS work is of two kinds, namely, ceiling, which is plastering upon
laths; and rendering, which is plastering upon walls: which are measured
separately.

The contents are estimated either by the foot, or yard, or square of 100 feet.
Enriched mouldings, etc. are rated by running or lineal measure.

Deductions are to be made for chimneys, doors, windows, etc. But the windows
are seldom deducted, as the plastered returns at the top and sides are allowed
to compensate for the window opening.

EXAMPLES.

1. How many yards contains the ceiling, which is 43 feet 3 inches long, and 25
feet 6 inches broad?

^

Ex. 2. To how much amounts the ceiling of a room, at 10d per yard; the length
being 21 feet 8 inches, and the breadth 14 feet 10 inches?

Ans. L 1 9 8.

Ex. 3. The length of a room is 18 feet 6 inches, the breadth 12 feet 3 inches,
and height 10 feet 6 inches; to how much amounts the ceiling and rendering, the
former at 8d and the latter at 3d per yard; allowing for the door of 7 feet by
3 feet 8, and a fire place of 5 feet square?

Ans. L 8 5 6.

Ex. 4. Required the quantity of plastering in a room, the length being 14 feet
5 inches, breadth 13 feet 2 inches, and height 9 feet 3 inches to the under
side of the cornice, which girts 8 inches, and projects 5 inches from the wall
on the upper part next the ceiling: deducting only for a door 7 feet by 4.

Ans. 53vd 5t 3i of rendering 18 5 6 of ceiling 39 0 1/1 of cornice.

PAINTERS WORK.
PAINTERS work is computed in square yards.

Every part is measured where the color lies; and the measuring line is forced
into all the mouldings and corners.

Windows are done at so much a piece. And it is usual to allow double measure
for carved mouldings, etc.

EXAMPLES.

1. How many yards of painting contains the room which is 65 feet 6 inches in
compass, and 12 feet 4 inches high?

^

Ex. 2. The length of a room being 20 feet, its breadth 14 feet 6 inches, and
height 10 feet 4 inches; how many yards of painting are in it, deducting a
fireplace of 4 feet by 4 feet 4 inches, and two windows each 6 feet by 3 feet
2 inches?

Ans. 73 2/2^ yards.

Ex. 3. What cost the painting of a room, at 6d per yard; its length being 24

feet 9 by 3 feet 6, but the breaks of the windows themselves are 8 feet 6
inches high, and 1 foot 3 inches deep: deducting the fireplace of 5 feet by 5
feet 6?

Ans. L 3 3 10^.

GLAZIERS WORK.
GLAZIERS take their dimensions either in feet, inches and parts, or feet,
tenths and hundredths. And compute their work in square feet.

In taking the length and breadth of a window, the cross bars between the
squares are included. Also windows of round or oval forms are measured as
square, measuring them to their greatest length and breadth, on account of the
waste in cutting the glass.

EXAMPLES.

1. How many square feet contains the window which is 4.25 feet long, and 2.75
feet bread?

^

2. What will the glazing a triangular sky-light come to, at 10d per foot; the

PAVERS WORK.
PAVERS work is done by the square yard. And the content is found by
multiplying the length by the breadth.

EXAMPLES.

the rest being paved with pebbles at 2s 6d a yard?

Ans. L 40 5 10.

PLUMBERS WORK.
PLUMBERS work is rated at so much a pound, or else the hundred weight, of 112
pounds.

Sheet lead used in roofing, guttering, etc. is from 7 to 12lb to the square
foot. And a pipe of an inch bore is commonly 13 or 14lb to the yard in length.

EXAMPLES.

guttering 57 feet long, and 2 feet wide; the former 9.831lb, and the latter
7.373lb to the square foot?

Ans. L 115 9 1.

VAULTED AND ARCHED ROOFS.
ARCHED roofs are either vaults, domes, saloons, or groins.

Vaulted roofs are formed by arches springing from the opposite walls, and
meeting in a line at the top.

Domes are made by arches springing from a circular or polygonal base, and
meeting in a point at the top.

Saloons are formed by arches connecting the side walls to a flat roof, or
ceiling, in the middle.

Groins are formed by the intersection of vaults with each other.

Vaulted roofs are commonly of the three following sorts: 1. Circular roofs, or
those whose arch is some part of the circumference of a circle. 2. Elliptical
or oval roofs, or those whose arch is an oval, or some part of the
circumference of an ellipsis. 3. Gothic roofs, or those which are formed by two
circular arcs, struck from different centers, and meeting in a point directly
over the middle of the breadth, or span of the arch.


PROBLEM I. To find the Surface of a Vaulted Roof.
Multiply the length of the arch by the length of the vault, and the product
will be the superficies.

Note. To find the length of the arch, make a line or string ply close to it,
quite across from side to side.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the surface of a vaulted roof, the length of the arch being 31.2
feet, and the length of the vault 120 feet.

^

Ex. 2. How many square yards are in the vaulted roof, whose arch is 42.4 feet,
and the length of the vault 100 feet?

Ans. 499.37 yds.

PROBLEM II. To find the Content of the Concavity of a Vaulted Roof.
Multiply the length of the vault by the area of one end, that is, by the area
of a vertical transverse section, for the content.

Note. When the arch is an oval, multiply the span by the height, and the
product by.7854 for the area.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the content of the concavity of a semicircular vaulted roof, the
span or diameter being 30 feet, and the length of the vault 150 feet.

^

Ans. 42988.8.

PROBLEM III. To find the Superficies of a Dome.
Find the area of the base, and double it; then say, as the radius of the base,
is to the height of the dome, so is the double area of the base, to the
superficies.

Note. For the superficies of a hemispherical dome, take the double area of the
base only.

EXAMPLES.

1. To how much comes the painting of an octagonal spherical dome, at 8d per
yard; each side of the base being 20 feet?

^

Ex. 2. Required the superficies of a hexagonal spherical dome, each side of
the base being 10 feet.

Ans. 519.6152.

Ex. 3. What is the superficies of a dome with a circular base, whose
circumference is 100 feet, and height 20 feet?

Ans. 2000 feet.

PROBLEM IV. To find the Solid Content of a Dome.
Multiply the area of the base by of the height.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the solid content of an octagonal dome, each side of the base
being 20 feet, and the height 21 feet.

^

Ex. 2. What is the solid content of a spherical dome, the diameter of whose
circular base is 30 feet?

Ans. 7068.6 feet.

PROBLEM V. To find the Superficies of a Saloon.
Find its breadth by applying a string close to it across the surface. Find
also its length by measuring along the middle of it, quite round the room.

Then multiply these two together for the surface.

EXAMPLE.

The girt across the face of a saloon being 5 feet, and its mean compass about
100 feet, required the area or superficies.

^

PROBLEM VI. To find the Solid Content of a Saloon.
Multiply the area of a transverse section by the compass taken around the
middle part. Subtract this product from the whole vacuity of the room,
supposing the walls to go upright all the height to the flat ceiling. And the
difference will be the answer.

EXAMPLE.

If the height AB of the saloon be 3.2 feet, the chord ADC of its front 4.5,
and the distance DE of its middle part from the arch be 9 inches; required the
solidity, supposing the mean compass to be 50 feet.

Again ^

Then this taken from the whole upright space, will leave the content of the
vacuity contained within the room.

PROBLEM VII. To find the Concave Superficies of a Groin.
To the area of the base add 1/7 part of itself, for the superficial content.

EXAMPLES.

1. What is the superficial content of the groin arch, raised on a square base
of 15 feet on each side?

^

Ex. 2. Required the superficies of a groin arch, raised on a rectangular base,
whose dimensions are 20 feet by 16.

Ans. 365 ^/7;.

PROBLEM VIII. To find the Solid Content of a Groin Arch.
Multiply the area of the base by the height; from the product subtract 1/10 of
itself, and the remainder will be the content of the vacuity.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the content of the vacuity within a groin arch, springing from the
sides of a square base, each side of which is 16 feet.

^

2. What is the content of the vacuity below an oval groin, the side of its
square base being 24 feet, and its height 8 feet?

Ans. 4147.

NOTES.
1. To find the solid content of the brick or stone work, which forms any arch
or vault: Multiply the area of the base by the height, including the work over
the top of the arch; and from the product subtract the content of the vacuity
found by the foregoing problems; and the remainder will be the content of the
solid materials.

2. In groin arches however, it is usual to take the whole as solid, without
deducting the vacuity, on account of the trouble and waste of materials,
attending the cutting and fitting them to the arch.

LAND SURVEYING.
CHAPTER 1. Description and Use of the Instruments.
1. OF THE CHAIN.
LAND is measured with a chain, called Gunter's chain, of 4 poles or 22 yards
in length, which consists of 100 equal links, each link being 22/100 of a yard
or 66/100 of a foot, or 7.92 inches long, that is, nearly 8 inches or of a foot.

An acre of land, is equal to 10 square chains, that is, 10 chains in length
and 1 chain in breadth. Or it is 220 x 22 or 4840 square yards. Or it is 40 x 4
or 160 square poles. Or it is 1000 x 100 or 100000 square links. These being
all the same quantity.

Also, an acre is divided into 4 parts called roods, and a rood into 40 parts
called perches, which are square poles, or the square of a pole of 5 yards
long, or the square of of a chain, or of 25 links, which is 625 square links.
So that the divisions of land measure will be thus:

625 sq. links=1 pole or perch 40 perches=1 rood 4 roods=1 acre


The length of lines, measured with a chain, are set down in links as integers,
every chain in length being 100 links; and not in chains and decimals.
Therefore after the content is found, it will be in square links; then cut off
five of the figures on the right hand for decimals, and the rest will be acres
Those decimals are then multiplied by 4 for roods, and the decimals of these
again by 40 for perches.

EXAMPLES.

Suppose the length of a rectangular piece of ground be 792 links, and its
breadth 385; to find the area in acres, roods, and perches.

^

2. OF THE PLAIN TABLE.
This instrument consists of a plain rectangular board of any convenient size,
the center of which, when used, is fixed by means of screws to a three-legged
stand, having a ball and socket, or joint, at the top, by means of which, when
the logs are fixed on the ground, the table is inclined in any direction.

To the table belongs,

1. A frame of wood, made to fit round its edges, and to be taken off, for the
convenience of putting a sheet of paper upon the table. The one side of this
frame is usually divided into equal parts, for drawing lines across the table,
parallel or perpendicular to the sides; and the other side of the frame is
divided into 360 degrees from a center which is in the middle of the table; by
means of which the table is to be used as a theodolite, etc.

2. A needle and compass screwed into the side of the table, to point out the
directions, and to be a check upon the sights.

3. An index, which is a brass two-foot scale, with either a small telescope,
or open sights erected perpendicularly upon the ends. These sights, and one
edge of the index are in the same plane, and that edge is called the fiducial
edge of the index.

Before you use this instrument, take a sheet of paper which will cover it, and
wet it to make it expand; then spread it flat upon the table, pressing down the
frame upon the edges, to stretch it and keep it fixed there; and when the paper
is become dry, it will, by contracting again, stretch itself smooth and flat
from any cramps or unevenness. Upon this paper is to be drawn the plan or form
of the thing measured.

In using this instrument, begin at any part of the ground you think the most
proper, and make a point upon a convenient part of the paper or table, to
represent that point of the ground; then six in that point one leg of the
compasses, or a fine steel pin, and apply to it the fiducial edge of the index,
moving it round till through the sights you perceive some remarkable object, as
the corner of a field, etc. and from the station point draw a line with the
point of the compasses along the ^iducial edge of the index; then set another
object or corner, and draw its line; do the same by another, and so on till as
many objects are set as may be thought necessary. Then measure from your
station toward as many of the objects as may be necessary, and no more, taking
the requisite offsets to corners or crooks in the hedges, etc and lay the
measures down upon their respective lines upon the table. Then, at any
convenient place, measured to, fix the table in the same position, and set the
objects which appear from thence, etc. as before; and thus continue till your
work is finished, measuring such lines as are necessary, and determining as
many as you can by intersecting lines of direction drawn from different
stations.

And in these operations observe the following particular cautions and
directions.

1. Let the lines upon which you make starions be directed toward objects as
far distant as possible; and when you have set any such object, go round the
table and look through the sights from the other end of the index, to see if
any other remarkable object lie directly opposite; if there be not such an one,
endeavor to find another forward object, such as shall have a remarkable
backward opposite one, and make use of it rather than the other; because the
back object will be of use in fixing the table in the original position either
when you have measured too near to the forward object, or when it may be hid
from your sight at any necessary station by intervening hedges, etc.

2. Let the said lines, upon which the stations are taken, be pursued as far as
you conveniently can; for that will be the means of preserving more accuracy in
the work.

3. At each station it will be necessary to prove the truth of it; that is,
whether the table be straight in the line toward the object, and also whether
the distance be rightly measured and laid down on the paper. -- To know if the
table be set down straight in the line; lay the index upon the table in any
manner, and more the table about till through the sights you perceive either
the fore or back object; then, without moving the table, go round it and look
through the sights by the other end of the index, to see if the other object
can be perceived; if it be, the table is in the line; if not, it must be
shifted to one side, according to your judgment, till through the sights both
objects can be seen. -- The aforesaid operation only informs you if the station
be straight in the line; but to know if it be in the right part of the line,
that is, if the distance has been rightly laid down; fix the table in the
original position, by laying the index along the station line and turning the
table about till the fore and back objects appear through the sights, and then
also will the needle point at the same degree as at first; then lay the index
over the station point and any other point on the paper representing an object
which can be seen from the station; and if the said object appear straight
through the sights, the station may be depended on as right; if not, the
distance should be examined and corrected till the object can be so seen. And
for this very useful purpose, it is advisable to have some high object or two,
which can be seen from the greatest part of the ground, accurately laid down on
the paper from the beginning of the survey, to serve continually as proof
objects.

When, from any station, the fore and back objects cannot both be seen, the
agreement of the needle with one of them may be depended on for placing the
table straight on the line, and for fixing it in the original position.

Of shifting the Paper on the Plain Table.

When one paper is full, and you have occasion for more; draw a line in any
manner through the farthest point of the last station line, to which the work
can be conveniently laid down; then take the sheet off the table, and fix
another on, drawing a line upon it, in a part the most convenient for the rest
of the work; then sold or cut the old sheet by the line drawn on it, apply the
edge to the line on the new sheet, and, as they lie in that position, continue
the last station line upon the new paper, placing upon it the rest of the
measure, beginning at where the old sheet left off. And so on from sheet to
sheet.

When the work is done, and you would fasten all the sheets together into one
piece, or rough plan, the aforesaid lines are to be accurately joined together,
as when the lines were transferred from the old sheets to the new ones.

But it is to be noted, that if the said joining lines, upon the old and new
sheet, have not the same inclination to the side of the table, the needle will
not point to the original degree when the table is rectified; and if the needle
be required to respect still the same degree of the compass, the easiest way of
drawing the lines in the same position, is to draw them both parallel to the
same sides of the table, by means of the equal divisions marked on the other
two sides.

3. OF THE THEODOLITE.
The theodolite is a brazen circular ring, divided into 360 degrees, and having
an index with sights, or a telescope, placed upon the center, about which the
index is moveable; also a compass fixed to the center, to point out courses and
check the sights; the whole being fixed by the center upon a stand of a
convenient height for use.

In using this instrument, an exact account, or field-book, of all measures and
things necessary to be remarked in the plan, must be kept, from which to make
out the plan upon your return home from the ground.

Begin at such part of the ground, and measure in such directions, as you judge
most convenient; taking angles or directions to objects, and measuring such
distances as appear necessary, under the same restrictions as in the use of the
plain table. And it is safest to six the theodolite in the original position at
every station by means of fore and back objects, and the compass, exactly as in
using the plain table; registering the number of degrees cut off by the index
when directed to each object; and, at any station, placing the index at the
same degree as when the direction toward that station was taken from the last
preceding one, to fix the theodolite there in the original position, after the
same manner as the plain table is fixed in the original position, by laying its
index along the line of the last direction.

The best method of laying down the aforesaid lines of direction, is to
describe a pretty large circle, quarter it, and lay upon it the several numbers
of degrees cut off by the index in each direction; then, by means of a parallel
ruler, draw, from station to station, lines parallel to lines drawn from the
center to the respective points in the circumference.

4. OF THE CROSS.
The cross consists of two pair of sights set at right angles to each other,
upon a staff having a sharp point at the bottom to stick in the ground.

The cross is very useful to measure small and crooked pieces of ground. The
method is to measure a base or chief line, usually in the longest direction of
the piece from corner to corner; and while measuring it, finding the places
where perpendiculars would fall upon this line from the several corners and
bends in the boundary of the piece, with the cross, by fixing it, by trials,
upon such parts of the line as that through one pair of the sights both ends of
the line may appear, and through the other pair you can perceive the
corresponding bends or corners; and then measuring the lengths of the said
perpendiculars.

REMARKS.
Besides the forementioned instruments, which are most commonly used, there
are some others; as the circumferentor, which resembles the theodolite in shape
and use; and the semicircle, for taking angles, etc. But of all the
instruments for measuring, the plain table is certainly the best; not only
because it may be used as a theodolite or semicircle, by turning uppermost
that side of the frame which has the 360 degrees upon it; but because it is, in
its own proper use, by much the easiest, safest, and most accurate for the
purpose; for by planning every part immediately upon the spot, as soon as
measured, there is not only saved a great deal of writing in the field-book,
but every thing can also be planned more easily and accurately while it is in
view, than it can afterward from a field-book, in which many little things
must be either neglected or mistaken; and besides, the opportunities which the
plain table afford of correcting your work, or proving if it be right, at every
station, are such advantages as can never be balanced by any other method. But
although the plain table be the most generally useful instrument, it is not
always so; there being many cases in which sometimes one instrument is the
properest, and sometimes another; nor is that surveyor master of his business
who cannot in any case distinguish which is the fittest instrument or method,
and use it accordingly: nay sometimes no instrument at all, but barely the
chain itself, is the best method, particularly in regular open fields lying
together; and even when you are using the plain table, it is often of advantage
to measure such large open parts with the chain only, and from those measures
lay them down upon the table.

The perambulator is used for measuring roads, and other great distances on
level ground, and by the sides of rivers. It has a wheel of 8 feet, or half a
pole, in circumference, upon which the machine turns; and the distance
measured, is pointed out by an index, which is moved round by clock work.

Levels, with telescople or other sights, are used to find the level between
place and place, or how much one place is higher or lower than another.

An offset-staff is a very useful and necessary instrument, for measuring the
offsets and other short distances. It is 10 links in length, being divided and
marked at each of the 10 links.

Ten small arrows, or rods of iron or wood, are used to mark the end of every
chain length, in measuring lines. And sometimes pickets, or staves with flags,
are set up as marks or objects of direction.

Various scales are also used in protracting and measuring on the plan or
paper; such as plane scales, line of chords, protractor, compasses, reducing
scale, parallel and perpendicular rules, etc. Of plane scales, there should be
several sizes, as a chain in 1 inch, a chain in of an inch, a chain in an inch,
etc. And of these, the best for use, are those that are laid on the very edges
of the ivory scale, to prick off distances by, without compasses.

THE FIELD BOOK.
In surveying with the plain table, a field-book is not used, as every thing is
drawn on the table immediately when it is measured. But in surveying with the
theodolite, or any other instrument, some sort of a field-book must be used, to
write down in it a register or account of all that is done and occurs relative
to the survey in hand.

This book every one contrives and rules as he thinks fittest for himself. The
following is a specimen of a form very generally used. It is ruled into 3
columns: the middle, or principal column, is for the stations, angles,
bearings, distances measured, etc; and those on the right and left are for the
offsets on the right and left, which are set against their corresponding
distances in the middle column; as also for such remarks as may occur, and be
proper to note in drawing the plan, etc.

Here 1 is the first station, where the angle or bearing is 105 25. On the
left, at 73 links in the distance or principal line, is an offset of 92; and at
610 an offset of 24 to a cross hedge. On the right, at o, or the beginning, an
offset 25 to the corner of the field; at 248 Brown's boundary hedge commences;
at 610 an offset 35; and at 954, the end of the first line, the o denotes its
terminating in the hedge. And so on for the other stations.

Draw a line under the work, at the end of every station line, to prevent
confusion.

But in smaller surveys and measurements, a very good way of setting down the
work, is, to draw, by the eye on a piece of paper, a figure resembling that
which is to be measured; and so write the dimensions, as they are found,
against the corresponding parts of the figure. And this method may be practiced
to a considerable extent, even in the larger surveys.

CHAPTER II. THE PRACTICE OF SURVEYING.
THIS part contains the several works proper to be done in the field, or the
ways of measuring by all the instruments, and in all situations.

PROBLEM I. To Measure a Line or Distance.
To measure a line on the ground with the chain: Having provided a chain, with
10 small arrows, or rods, to stick one into the ground, as a mark, at the end
(...) every chain; two persons take hold of the chain, one at each end of it,
and all the 10 arrows are taken by one of them, who is to go foremost, and is
called the l^^der; the other being called the follower, for distinction's sake.

A picket, or station-staff, being set up in the direction of the line to be
measured, if there do not appear some marks naturally in that direction; the
follower stands at the beginning of the line, holding the ring at the end of
the chain in his hand, while the leader drags forward the chain by the other
end of it, till it is stretched straight, and laid or held level, and the
leader directed, by the follower waving his hand, to the right or left, till
the follower see him exactly in a line with the mark or direction to be
measured to; there both of them stretching the chain straight, and stooping and
holding it level, the leader having the head of one of his arrows in the same
hand by which he holds the end of the chain, let him there stick one of them
down with it while he holds the chain stretched. This done, he leaves the arrow
in the ground, as a mark for the follower to come to, and advances another
chain forward, being directed in his position by the follower, standing at the
arrow, as before; as also by himself now, and at every succeeding chain's
length, by moving himself from side to side, till he brings the follower and
the back mark into a line. Having then stretched the chain, and stuck down an
arrow, as before, the follower takes up his arrow, and they advance again in
the same manner another chain-length. And thus they proceed till all the 10
arrows are employed, and are in the hands of the follower; and the leader,
without an arrow, is arrived at the end of the 11th chain length. The follower
then sends or brings the 10 arrows to the leader, who puts one of them down at
the end of his chain, and advances with the chain as before. And thus the
arrows are changed from the one to the other at every 10 chains length, till
the whole line is finished; when the number of changes of the arrows shows the
number of tens, to which the follower adds the arrows he holds in his hand, and
the number of links of an other chain over to the mark or end of the line. So
if there have been 3 changes of the arrows, and the follower hold 6 arrows, and
the end of the line cut off 45 links more, the whole length of the line is set
down in links thus 3645.

PROBLEM II. To take Angles and Bearings.
Let B and C be two objects, or two pickets set up perpendicular, and let it be
required to take their bearings, or the angle formed between them at any
station A.

diagram

1. With the Plain Table.

The table being covered with a paper, and fixed on its stand; plant it at the
station A, and fix a sine p^n, or a point of the compasses in a proper point of
the paper, to represent the point A: Close by the side of this pin lay the
fiducial edge of the index, and turn it about, still touching the pin, till one
object B can be seen through the sights: then by the fiducial edge of the index
draw a line. In the very same manner draw another line in the direction of the
other object C. And it is done.

2. With the Theodolite, etc.

Direct the fixed sights along one of the lines, as AB, by turning the
instrument about till you see the mark B through these sights; and there screw
the instrument fast. Then turn the moveable index about till, through its
sights, you see the other mark C. Then the degrees cut by the index, upon the
graduated limb or ring of the instrument, shows the quantity of the angle.

3. With the Magnetic Needle and Compass.

Turn the instrument, or compass, so, that the north end of the needle point to
the flower-de-luce. Then direct the sights to one mark as B, and note the
degrees cut by the needle. Then direct the sights to the other mark C, and note
again the degrees cut by the needle. Then their sum or difference, as the case
is, will give the quantity of the angle BAC.

4. By Measurement with the Chain, etc.

Measure one chain length, or any other length, along both directions, as to b
and c. Then measure the distance bc, and it is done. -- This is easily
transferred to paper, by making a triangle Abc with these three lengths, and
then measuring the angle A as in Practical Geometry, prob. XI.

PROBLEM III. To Measure the Offsets.
Ahiklmn being a crooked hedge, or river, etc. From A measure in a straight
direction along the side of it to B. And in measuring along this line AB
observe when you are directly opposite any bends or corners of the hedge, as at
c, d, e, etc. and from thence measure the perpendicular offsets ch, di, etc.
with the offset-staff, if they are not very large, otherwise with the chain
itself. And the work is done. And the register, or field-book, may be as
follows: Offs. left. Base line AB. 0 A ch 62 45 AC di 84 220 Ad ek 70 340 Ae fl
98 510 Af gm 57 634 Ag hn 91 785 AB

diagram

Note. When the offsets are not very large, their places c, d, e, etc. on the
base line, can be very well determined by the eye, especially when assisted by
laying down the offset-staff in a cross or perpendicular direction. But when
these perpendiculars are very large, find their positions by the cross, or by
the instrument which you happen to be using, in this manner: As you measure
along AB, when you come about C, where you judge a perpendicular will stand,
plant your instrument in the line, and turn the index till the marks A and B
can be seen through both the sights, looking both backward and forward; then
look along the cross sights, or the cross line on the index; and if it point
directly to the corner or bend h, the place of C is right. Otherwise, move the
instrument backward or forward on the line AB, till the cross line points
straight to h. This being found, set down the distance measured from A to C;
then measure the offset ch, and set it down opposite the former, and on the
left hand side.

Then proceed forward in the line AB, till you arrive opposite another corner,
and determine the place d of the perpendicular as before. And so on throughout
the whole length.

PROBLEM IV. To Survey a Triangular Field ABC.
1. By the Chain.

AP 794 AB 1321 PC 826

diagram

Having set up marks at the corners, which is to be done in all cases where
there are not marks naturally; measure with the chain from A to P, where a
perpendicular would fall from the angle C, and set up a mark at P, noting down
the distance AP. Then complete the distance AB by measuring from P to B. Having
set down this measure, return to P, and measure the perpendicular PC. And thus,
having the base and perpendicular, the area from them is easily found. Or
having the place P of the perpendicular, the triangle is easily constructed.

Or, measure all the three sides with the chain, and note them down. From which
the content is easily found, or the figure constructed.

2. By taking one or more of the Angles.

Measure two sides AB, AC, and the angle A between them. Or measure one side
AB, and the two adjacent angles A and B. From either of these ways the figure
is easily planned; then by measuring the perpendicular CP on the plan, and
multiplying it by half AB, you have the content.

PROBLEM V. To measure a Four-sided Field.
1. By the Chain.

AE 214 210 DE AF 362 306 BF AC 592

diagram

Measure along either of the diagonals, as AC; and either the two
perpendiculars DE, BF, as in the last problem; or else the sides AB, BC, CD,
DA. From either of which the figure may be planned and computed as before
directed.

Otherwise by the Chain.

AP 110 352 PC AQ 745 595 QUOTH AB 1110

diagram

Measure on the longest side, the distances AP, AQ, AB; and the perpendiculars
PC, QUOTH.

2. By taking one or more of the Angles.

PROBLEM VI. To Survey any Field by the Chain only.
Having set up marks at the corners, where necessary, of the proposed field
ABCDEFG. Walk over the ground, and consider how it can best be divided into
triangles and trapeziums; and measure them separately as in the last two
problems. And in this way it will be proper to divide it into as few separate
triangles, and as many trapeziums as may be, by drawing diagonals from corner
to corner; and so as that all the perpendiculars may fall within the figure.
Thus, the following figure is divided into the two trapeziums ABCG, GDEF, and
the triangle GCD. Then, in the first, beginning at A, measure the diagonal AC,
and the two perpendiculars Gm, Bn. Then the base GC, and the perpendicular Dq.
Lastly the diagonal DF, and the two perpendiculars PE, OG. All which measures
write against the corresponding parts of a rough figure drawn to resemble the
figure to be surveyed, or set them down in any other form you choose.

Or thus.

Measure all the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, OF, FG, and GA; and the diagonals AC,
CD, GD, DF.

Otherwise.

Many pieces of land may be very well surveyed, by measuring any base line,
either within or without them, together with the perpendiculars let fall upon
it from every corner of them. For they are by those means divided into several
triangles and trapezoids, all whose parallel sides are perpendicular to the
base line; and the sum of these triangles and trapeziums will be equal to the
figure proposed if the base line fall within it; if not, the sum of the parts
which are without being taken from the sum of the whole which are both within
and without, will leave the area of the figure proposed.

In pieces that are not very large, it will be sufficiently exact to find the
points, in the base line, where the several perpendiculars will fall, by means
of the cross, and from thence measuring to the corners for the lengths of the
perpendiculars. -- And it will be most convenient to draw the line so as that
all the perpendiculars may fall within the figure.

Thus, in the following figure, beginning at A, and measuring along the line AG
the distances and perpendiculars, on the right and left, are as below.

PROBLEM VII. To Survey any Field with the Plain Table.
1. From one Station.

Plant the table at any angle, as C, from whence all the other angles, or marks
set up, can be seen; and turn the table about till the needle point to the
flower-de-luce; and there screw it fast. Make a point for C on the paper on the
table, and lay the edge of the index to C, turning it about C till through the
sights you see the mark D; and by the edge of the index draw a dry or obscure
line: then measure the distance CD, and lay that distance down on the line CD.
Then turn the index about the point C, till the mark E be seen through the
sights, by which draw a line, and measure the distance to E, laying it on the
line from C to E. In like manner determine the positions of CA and CB, by
turning diagram the sights successively to A and B; and lay the lengths of
those lines down. Then connect the points with the boundaries of the field, by
drawing the black lines CD, DE, EA, AB, BC.

2. From a Station within the Field.

When all the other parts cannot be seen from one angle, choose some place O
within; or even without, if more convenient, from whence the other parts can be
seen. Plant the table at O, then fix it with the needle north, and mark the
point O on it. Apply the index successively to O, turning it round with the
sights to each angle A, B, C, D, E, drawing dry lines to them by the edge of
the index, then measuring the distances OA, OE, etc. and laying them down upon
those lines. Lastly, draw the boundaries AB, BC, CD, DE, EA.

diagram

3. By going round the Figure.

When the figure is a wood, or water, or from some other obstruction you cannot
measure lines across it; begin at any point A, and measure round it, either
within or without the figure, and draw the directions of all the sides thus:
Plant the table at A, turn it with the needle to the north or flower-de-luce,
fix it, and mark the point A. Apply the index to A, turning it till you can see
the point E, there draw a line; and then the point B, and there draw a line:
then measure these lines, and lay them down from A to E and B. Next, move the
table to B, lay the index along the line AB, and turn the table about till you
can see the mark A, and screw fast the table; in which position also the needle
will again point to the flower-de-luce, as it will do indeed at every station
when the table is in the right position. Here turn the index about B till
through the sights you see the mark C; there draw a line, measure BC, and lay
the distance upon that line after you have set down the table at C. Turn it
then again into its proper position, and in like manner find the next line CD.
And so on quite round by E to A again. Then the proof of the work will be the
joining at A: for if the work is all right, the last direction EA on the
ground, will pass exactly through the point A on the paper; and the measured
distance will also reach exactly to A. If these do not coincide, or nearly so,
some error has been committed, and the work must be examined over again.

PROBLEM VIII. To Survey a Field with the Theodolite, etc.
1. From one Point or Station.

When all the angles can be seen from one point, as the angle E (first fig. to
last prob.) place the instrument at o, and turn it about till, through the
fixed sights, you see the mark B, and there fix it. Then turn the moveable
index about till the mark A is seen through the sights, and note the degrees
cut on the instrument. Next turn the index successively to E and D, noting the
degrees cut off at each; which gives all the angles BCA, BCE, BCD. Lastly,
measure the lines CB, CA, CE, CD; and enter the measures in a field-book, or
rather against the corresponding parts of a rough figure drawn by guess to
resemble the field.

2. From a Point within or without.

Plant the instrument at o, (last fig.) and turn it about till the fixed sights
point to any object, as A; and there screw it fast. Then turn the moveable
index round till the sights point successively to the other points E, D, C, B,
noting the degrees cut off at each of them; which gives all the angles round
the point O. Lastly, measure the distances OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, noting them down
as before, and the work is done.

3. By going round the Field.

By measuring round, either within or without the field, proceed thus. Having
set up marks at B, C, etc. near the corners as usual, plant the instrument at
any point A, and turn it till the sixed index be in the direction AB, and there
screw it fast: then turn the moveable index to the direction AF; and the
degrees cut off will be the angle A. Measure the line AB, and plant the
instrument at B, and there in the same manner observe the angle A. Then measure
BC, and observe the angle C. Then measure the distance CD, and take the angle
D. Then measure DE, and take the angle E. Then measure E^, and take the angle
F. And lastly measure the distance FA.

diagram

To prove the work; add all the inward angles A, B, C, etc. together, and when
the work is right, their sum will be equal to twice as many right angles as the
figure has sides, wanting 4 right angles. And when there is an angle, as F,
that bends inwards, and you measure the external angle, which is less than two
right angles, subtract it from 4 right angles, or 360 degrees, to give the
internal angle greater than a semicircle or 180 degrees.

Otherwise.

Instead of observing the internal angles, you may take the external angles,
formed without the sigure by producing the sides further out. And in this case,
when the work is right, their sum altogether will be equal to 360 degrees. But
when one of them, as F, runs inwards, subtract it from the sum of the rest, to
leave 360 degrees.

PROBLEM IX. To Survey a Field with Crooked Hedges, etc.
With any of the instruments measure the lengths and positions of imaginary
lines running as near the sides of the field as you can; and in going along
them measure the offsets in the manner before taught; and you will have the
plan on the paper in using the plain table, drawing the crooked hedges through
the ends of the offsets; but in surveying with the theodolite, or other
instrument, set down the measures properly in a field-book, or memorandum-book,
and plan them after returning from the field, by laying down all the lines and
angles.

diagram

So, in surveying the piece ABCDE, set up marks a, b, c, d, dividing it into as
few sides as may be. Then begin at any station a, and measure the lines ab, bc,
cd, da, and take their positions, or the angles a, b, c, d; and in going along
the lines measure all the offsets, as at m, n, o, p, etc. along every station
line.

And this is done either within the field, or without, as may be most
convenient. When there are obstructions within, as wood, water, hills, etc.
then measure without, as in the figure here below.

diagram

PROBLEM X. To Survey a Field or any other Thing, by Two Stations.
This is performed by choosing two stations, from whence all the marks and
objects can be seen, then measuring the distance between the stations, and at
each station taking the angles formed by every object, from the station line or
distance.

The two stations may be taken either within the bounds, or in one of the
sides, or in the direction of two of the objects, or quite at a distance and
without the bounds of the objects, or part to be surveyed.

In this manner, not only grounds may be surveyed, without even entering them,
but a map may be taken of the principal parts of a country, or the chief places
of a town, or any part of a river or coast surveyed, or any other inaccessible
objects; by taking two stations, on two towers, or two hills, or such like.

diagram

When the plain table is used; plant it at one station m, draw a line mn on it,
along which lay the edge of the index, and turn the table about till the sights
point directly to the other station; and there screw it fast. Then turn the
sights round m successively to all the objects ABC, etc. drawing a dry line by
the edge of the index at each, as mA, mB, mC, etc. Then measure the distance to
the other station, there plant the table, and lay that distance down on the
station line from m to n. Next lay the index by the line nm, and turn the table
about till the sights point to the other station m, and there screw it fast.
Then direct the sights successively to all the objects A, B, C, etc. as before,
drawing lines each time, as nA, nB, nC, etc. and their intersection with the
former lines will give the places of all the objects, or corners, A, B, C, etc.

When the theodolite, or any other instrument for taking angles, is used;
proceed in the same way, measuring the station distance mn, planting the
instrument first at one station, and then at another; then placing the fixed
sights in the direction m n, and directing the moveable sights to every object,
noting the degrees cut off at each time. Then, these observations being
planned, the intersections of the lines will give the objects as before.

When all the objects, to be surveyed, cannot be seen from two stations; then
three stations may be used, or four, or as many as is necessary; measuring
always the distance from one station to another; placing the instrument in the
same position at every station, by means described before; and from each
station observing or setting every object that can be seen from it, by taking
its direction or angular position, till every object be determined by the
intersection of two or more lines of direction, the more the better. And thus
may very extensive surveys be taken, as of large commons, rivers, coasts,
countries, hilly grounds, and such like.

PROBLEM XI. To Survey a Large Estate.
If the estate be very large, and contain a great number of fields, it cannot
well be done by surveying all the fields singly, and then putting them
together; nor can it be done by taking all the angles and boundaries that
enclose it. For in these cases, any small errors will be so multiplied, as to
render it very much distorted.

1. Walk over the estate two or three times, in order to get a perfect idea of
it, and till you can carry the map of it tolerably in your head. And to help
your memory, draw an eye draught of it on paper, or at least, of the principal
parts of it, to guide you.

2. Choose two or more eminent places in the estate, for your stations, from
whence you can see all the principal parts of it: and let these stations be as
far distant from one another as possible; as the fewer stations you have to
command the whole, the more exact your work will be: and they will be sitter
for your purpose, if these station lines be in or near the boundaries of the
ground, and especially if two lines or more proceed from one station.

3. Take what angles, between the stations, you think necessary, and measure
the distances from station to station, always in a right line: these things
must be done, till you get as many angles and lines as are sufficient for
determining all your points of station. And in measuring any of these station
distances, mark accurately where these lines meet with any hedges, ditches,
roads, lanes, paths, rivulets, etc. and where any remarkable object is placed,
by measuring its distance from the station line; and where a perpendicular from
it cuts that line; and always mind, in any of these observations, that you be
in a right line, which you will know by taking backsight and foresight, along
your station line. And thus as you go along any main station line, take offsets
to the ends of all hedges, and to any pond, house, mill, bridge, etc. omitting
nothing that is remarkable. And all these things must be noted down: for these
are your data, by which the places of such objects are to be determined upon
your plan. And be sure to set marks up at the intersections of all hedges with
the station line, that you may know where to measure from, when you come to
survey these particular fields, which must immediately be done, as soon as you
have measured that station line, whilst they are fresh in memory. By this means
all your station lines are to be measured, and the situation of all places
adjoining to them determined, which is the first grand point to be obtained. It
will be proper for you to lay down your work upon paper every night, when you
go home, that you may see how you go on.

4. As to the inner parts of the estate, they must be determined in like
manner, by new station lines: for, after the main stations are determined, and
every thing adjoining to them, then the estate must be subdivided into two or
three parts by new station lines; taking inner stations at proper places, where
you can have the best view. Measure these station lines as you did the first,
and all their intersections with hedges, and all offsets to such objects as
appear. Then you may proceed to survey the adjoining fields, by taking the
angles that the sides make with the station line, at the intersections, and
measuring the distances to each corner, from the intersections. For every
station line will be a basis to all the future operations; the situation of all
parts being entirely dependent upon them; and therefore they should be taken as
long as possible; and it is best for them to run along some of the hedges or
boundaries of one or more fields, or to pass through some of their angles. All
things being determined for these stations, you must take more inner stations,
and continue to divide and subdivide till at last you come to single fields;
repeating the same work for the inner stations, as for the outer ones, till all
be done; and close the work as often as you can, and in as few lines as
possible. And that you may choose stations the most conveniently, so as to
cause the least labor, let the station lines run as far as you can along some
hedges, and through as many corners of the fields, and other remarkable points,
as you can. And take notice how one field lies by another; that you may not
misplace them in the draught.

5. An estate may be so situated, that the whole cannot be surveyed together;
because one part of the estate cannot be seen from another. In this case, you
may divide it into three or four parts, and survey the parts separately, as if
they were lands belonging to different persons; and at last join them together.

6. As it is necessary to protract or lay down your work as you proceed in it,
you must have a scale of a due length to do it by. To get such a scale, you
must measure the whole length of the estate in chains; then you must consider
how many inches long the map is to be; and from these you will know how many
chains you must have in an inch; then make your scale, or choose one already
made, accordingly.

7. The trees in every hedge row must be placed in their proper situation,
which is soon done by the plain table; but may be done by the eye without an
instrument; and being thus taken by guess, in a rough draught, they will be
exact enough, being only to look at; except it be such as are at any remarkable
places, as at the ends of hedges, at styles, gates, etc. and these must be
measured. But all this need not be done till the draught is finished. And
observe in all the hedges, what side the gutter or ditch is on, and to whom the
fences belong.

8. When you have long stations, you ought to have a good instrument to take
angles with, and the plain table may very properly be made use of, to take the
several small internal parts, and such as cannot be taken from the main
stations: as it is a very quick and ready instrument.

PROBLEM XII. To Survey a County, or Large Tract of Land.
1. Choose two, three, or four eminent places for stations; such as the tops of
high hills or mountains, towers, or church steeples, which may be seen from one
another; and from which most of the towns, and other places of note, may also
be seen. And let them be as far distant from one another as possible. Upon
these places raise beacons, or long poles, with flags of different colors
flying at them; so as to be visible from all the other stations.

2. At all the places, which you would set down in the map, plant long poles
with flags at them of several colors, to distinguish the places from one
another; fixing them upon the tops of church steeples, or the tops of houses,
or in the centers of lesser towns.

But you need not have these marks at many places at once, as suppose half a
score at a time. For when the angles have been taken, at the two stations, to
all these places, the marks may be moved to new ones; and so successively to
all the places you want. These marks then being set up at a convenient number
of places, and such as may be seen from both stations; go to one of these
stations, and with an instrument to take angles, standing at that station, take
all the angles between the other station, and each of these marks, observing
which is blue, which red, etc. and which hand they lie on; and set all down
with their colors. Then go to the other station, and take all the angles
between the first station, and each of the former marks, and set them down with
the others, each against his fellow with the same color. You may, if you can,
also take the angles at some third station, which may serve to prove the work,
if the three lines intersect in that point, where any mark stands. The marks
must stand till the observations are finished at both stations; and then they
must be taken down, and set up at fresh places. And the same operations must be
performed, at both stations, for these fresh places; and the like for others.
Your instrument for taking angles must be an exceeding good one, made on
purpose with telescopic sights; and of three, four, or five feet radius. A
circumferentor is reckoned a good instrument for this purpose.

3. And though it is not absolutely necessary to measure any distance, because
any stationary line being laid down from any scale, all the other lines will be
proportional to it; yet it is better to measure some of the lines, to ascertain
the distances of places in miles; and to know how many geometrical miles there
are in any length; and from thence to make a scale to measure any distance in
miles. In measuring any distance, it will not be exact-enough to go along the
high roads; by reason of their turnings and windings, and hardly ev^^ lying in
a right line between the stations, which must cause infinite reductions, and
create endless trouble to make it a right line; for which reason it can never
be exact. But a better way is to measure in a right line with a chain, between
station and station, over hills and dales or level fields, and all obstacles.
Only in case of water, woods, towns, rocks, banks, etc. where one cannot pass;
such parts of the line must be measured by the methods of inaccessible
distances; and besides, allowing for ascents and descents, when we meet with
them. And a good compass that shows the bearing of the two stations, will
always direct you to go straight, when you do not see the two stations; and in
your progress, if you can go straight, you may take offsets to any remarkable
places, likewise note the intersection of your stationary line with all roads,
rivers, etc.

4. And from all your stations, and in your whole progress, be very particular
in observing sea coasts, river mouths, towns, castles, houses, churches,
windmills, watermills, trees, rocks, sands, roads, bridges, fords, ferries,
woods, hills, mountains, rills, brooks, parks, beacons, sluices, floodgates,
looks, etc. and in general all things that are remarkable.

5. After you have done with your first and main station lines, which command
the whole county; you must then take inner stations, at some places already
determined; which will divide the whole into several partitions: and from these
stations you must determine the places of as many of the remaining towns as you
can. And if any remain in that part, you must take more stations, at some
places already determined; from which you may determine the rest. And thus we
must go through all the parts of the county, taking station after station, till
we have determined all we want. And in general the station distances must
always pass through such remarkable points as have been determined before, by
the former stations.

6. Lastly, the position of the station line you measure, or the point of the
compass it lies on, must be determined by astronomical observation. Hang up a
thread and plummet in the sun, over some part of the station line, and observe
when the shadow runs along that line, and at that moment take the sun's
altitude; then having his declination, and the latitude, the azimuth will be
found by spherical trigonometry. And the azimuth is the angle the station line
makes with the meridian; and therefore a meridian may easily be drawn through
the map. Or a meridian may be drawn through it by hanging up two threads in a
line with the pole star, when he is just north, which may be known from
astronomical tables. Or thus; observe the star Alioth, or that in the rump of
the great bear, being that next the square; or else Cassiopeia's hip; I say,
observe by a line and plummet when either of these stars and the pole star come
into a perpendicular; and at that time they are due north. Therefore two
perpendicular lines being fixed at that moment, toward these two stars, will
give the position of the meridian.

PROBLEM XIII. To Survey a Town or City.
This may be done with any of the instruments for taking angles, but best of
all with the plain table, where every minute part is drawn while in sight. It
is best also to have a chain of 50 feet long, divided into 50 links, and an
offset-staff of 10 feet long.

Begin at the meeting of two or more of the principal streets, through which
you can have the longest prospects, to get the longest station lines. There
having fixed the instrument, draw lines of direction along those streets, using
two men as marks, or poles set in wooden pedestals, or perhaps some remarkable
places in the houses at the further ends, as windows, doors, corners, etc.
Measure these lines with the chain, taking offsets with the staff, at all
corners of streets, bendings, or windings, and to all remarkable things, as
churches, markets, halls, colleges, eminent houses, etc. Then remove the
instrument to another station along one of these lines; and there repeat the
same process as before. And so on till the whole is finished.

diagram

Thus, fix the instrument at A, and draw lines in the direction of all the
streets meeting there; and measure AB, noting the street on the left at m. At
the second station B, draw the directions of the streets meeting there; measure
from B to C, noting the places of the streets at n and o as you pass by them.
At the 3d station C take the direction of all the streets meeting there, and
measure CD. At D do the same, and measure DE, noting the place of the cross
streets at P. And in this manner go through all the principal streets. This
done, proceed to the smaller and intermediate streets; and lastly to the lanes,
alleys, courts, yards, and every part that it may be thought proper to
represent.

CHAPTER III. Of Planning, Casting-up, and Dividing.
PROBLEM I. To Lay down the Plan of any Survey.
IF the survey was taken with a plain table, you have a rough plan of it
already on the paper which covered the table. But if the survey was with any
other instrument, a plan of it is to be drawn from the measures that were taken
in the survey, and first of all a rough plan upon paper.

To do this, you must have a set of proper instruments, for laying down both
lines and angles, etc. as scales of various sizes, the more of them, and the
more accurate, the better; scales of chords, protractors, perpendicular and
parallel rulers, etc. Diagonal scales are best for the lines, because they
extend to three figures, or chains and links, which are hundredth parts of
chains. But in using the diagonal scale, a pair of compasses must be employed
to take off the lengths of the principal lines very accurately. But a scale
with a thin edge divided, is much readier for laying down the perpendicular
offsets to crooked hedges, and for marking the places of those offsets upon the
station line; which is done at only one application of the edge of the scale to
that line, and then pricking off all at once the distances along it. Angles are
to be laid down either with a good scale of chords, which is perhaps the most
accurate way; or with a large protractor, which is much readier when many
angles are to be laid down at one point, as they are pricked off all at once
round the edge of the protractor.

Very particular directions for laying down all sorts of figures cannot be
necessary in this place, to any person who has learned practical geometry, and
the construction of figures, and the use of his instruments. It may therefore
be sufficient to observe, that all lines and angles must be laid down on the
plan in the same order in which they were measured in the field, and in which
they are written in the field-book; laying down first the angles for the
position of lines, then the lengths of the lines, with the places of the
offsets, and then the lengths of the offsets themselves, all with dry or
obscure lines; then a black line drawn through the extremities of all the
offsets, will be the hedge or bounding line of the field, etc. After the
principal bounds and lines are laid down, and made to fit or close properly,
proceed next to the smaller objects, till you have entered every thing that
ought to appear in the plan, as houses, brooks, trees, hills, gates, styles,
roads, lanes, mills, bridges, woodlands, etc. etc.

The north side of a map or plan is commonly placed uppermost, and a meridian
somewhere drawn, with the compass or flower-de-luce pointing north. Also, in a
vacant part, a scale of equal parts or chains must be drawn, and the title of
the map in conspicuous characters, and embellished with a compartment. All
hills must be shadowed, to distinguish them in the map. Color the hedges with
different colors; represent hilly grounds by broken hills and valleys; draw
single dotted lines for foot-paths, and double ones for horse or carriage
roads. Write the name of each field and remarkable place within it, and, if you
choose, its content in acres, roods, and perches.

In a very large estate, or a county, draw vertical and horizontal lines
through the map, denoting the spaces between them by letters, placed at the
top, and bottom, and sides, for readily finding any field or other object,
mentioned in a table.

In mapping counties, and estates that have uneven grounds of hills and
valleys, reduce all oblique lines, measured up hill and down hill, to
horizontal straight lines, if that was not done during the survey, before they
were entered in the field-book, by making a proper allowance to shorten them.
For which purpose there is commonly a small table engraven on some of the
instruments for surveying.

PROBLEM II. To Cast up the Contents of Fields.
1. Compute the contents of the figures, whether triangles, or trapeziums, etc.
by the proper rules for the several figures laid down in measuring; multiplying
the lengths by the breadths, both in links; the product is acres after you have
cut off five figures on the right, for decimals; then bring these decimals to
roods and perches, by multiplying first by 4, and then by 40. An example of
which is given in the description of the chain, page 187.

2. In small and separate pieces, it is usual to cast up their contents from
the measures of the lines taken in surveying them, without making a correct
plan of them.

Thus, in the triangle in prob. iv, page 199, where we had AP=794, and AB=1321

^

Or the first example to prob. v, page 200, thus: ^

Or the 2d example to the same prob. v, thus: ^

3. In pieces bounded by very crooked and winding hedges, measured by offsets,
all the parts between the offsets are most accurately measured separately as
small trapezoids. Thus, for the example to prob. 111, p. 198, where AC 45 62 ch
Ad 220 84 di Ae 340 70 ek Af 510 98 fl Ag 634 57 gm AB 785 91 Bn

Then ^

4. Sometimes such pieces as that above, are computed by finding a mean
breadth, by dividing the sum of the offsets by the number of them, accounting
that for one of them where the boundary meets the station line, as at A; then
multiply the length AB by that mean breadth. Thus: ^

5. But in larger pieces, and whole estates, consisting of many fields, it is
the common practice to make a rough plan of the whole, and from it compute the
contents quite independent of the measures of the lines and angles that were
taken in surveying. For then new lines are drawn in the fields in the plan, so
as to divide them into trapeziums and triangles, the bases and perpendiculars
of which are measured on the plan by means of the seals from which it was
drawn, and so multiplied together for the contents. In this way the work is
very expeditiously done, and sufficiently correct; for such dimensions are
taken, as afford the most easy method of calculation; and, among a number of
parts, thus taken and applied to a seal, it is likely that some of the parts
will be taken a small matter too little, and others too great; so that they
will, upon the whole, in all probability, very nearly balance one another.
After all the fields, and particular parts, are thus computed separately, and
added all together into one sum, calculate the whole estate independent of the
fields, by dividing it into large and arbitrary triangles and trapeziums, and
add these also together. Then if this sum be equal to the former, or nearly so,
the work is right; but if the sums have any considerable difference, it is
wrong, and they must be examined, and recomputed, till they nearly agree.

A specimen of dividing into one triangle, or one trapezium, which will do for
most single fields, may be seen in the examples to the last problem; and a
specimen of dividing a large tract into several such trapeziums and triangles,
in prob. VI of chapter II of Surveying, page 201, where a piece is so divided,
and its dimensions taken and set down; and again at prob. VI of mensuration of
surfaces, where the contents of the same piece are computed.

6. But the chief secret in casting up, consists in finding the contents of
pieces bounded by curved, or very irregular lines, or in reducing such crooked
sides of fields or boundaries to straight lines, that shall enclose the same or
equal area with those crooked sides, and so obtain the area of the curved
figure by means of the right-lined one, which will commonly be a trapezium. Now
this reducing the crooked sides to straight ones, is very easily and accurately
performed thus: Apply the straight edge of a thin, clear piece of lanthorn-horn
to the crooked line, which is to be reduced, in such a manner, that the small
parts cut off from the crooked figure by it, may be equal to those which are
taken in: which equality of the parts included and excluded, you will presently
be able to judge of very nicely by a little practice: then with a pencil draw a
line by the straight edge of the horn. Do the same by the other sides of the
field or figure. So shall you have a straight sided figure equal to the curved
one; the content of which, being computed as before directed, will be the
content of the curved figure proposed.

Or, instead of the straight edge of the horn, a horse-hair may be applied
across the crooked sides in the same manner; and the easiest way of using the
hair, is to string a small slender bow with it, either of wire, or cane, or
whale-bone, or such like slender springy matter; for, the bow keeping it always
stretched, it can be easily and neatly applied with one hand, while the other
is at liberty to make two marks by the side of it, to draw the straight line by.

EXAMPLE.

Thus, let it be required to find the contents of the same figure as in prob.
IX of the last chapter, page 207, to a scale of 4 chains to an inch.

diagram

Draw the four dotted straight lines AB, BC, CD, DA, cutting off equal
quantities on both sides of them, which they do as near as the eye can judge:
so is the crooked figure reduced to an equivalent right-lined one of four sides
ABCD. Then draw the diagonal BD, which, by applying a proper scale to it,
measures 1256. Also the perpendicular, or nearest distance, from A to this
diagonal, measures 456; and the distance of C from it, is 428.

Then ^

And thus the content of the trapezium, and consequently of the irregular
figure, to which it is equal, is easily found to be 5 acres, 2 roods, 8 perches.

PROBLEM III. To Transfer a Plan to another Paper, etc.
After the rough plan is completed, and a fair one is wanted; this may be done,
either on paper or vellum, by any of the following methods.

FIRST METHOD.
Lay the rough plan upon the clean paper, and keep them always pressed flat and
close together, by weights laid upon them. Then, with the point of a fine pin
or pricker, prick through all the corners of the plan to be copied. Take them
asunder, and connect the pricked points, on the clean paper, with lines; and it
is done. This method is only to be practiced in plans of such figures as are
small and tolerably regular, or bounded by right lines.

SECOND METHOD.
Rub the back of the rough plan over with black lead powder; and lay the said
black part upon the clean paper, upon which the plan is to be copied, and in
the proper position. Then with the blunt point of some hard substance, as
brass, or such like, trace over the lines of the whole plan; pressing the
tracer so much as that the black lead under the lines may be transferred to the
clean paper: after which take off the rough plan, and trace over the leaden
marks with common ink, or with indian ink, etc. -- Or, instead of blacking the
rough plan, you may keep constantly a blacked paper to lay between the plans.

THIRD METHOD.
Another method of copying plans, is by means of squares. This is performed by
dividing both ends and sides of the plan, which is to be copied, into any
convenient number of equal parts, and connecting the corresponding points of
division with lines; which will divide the plan into a number of small squares.
Then divide the paper, upon which the plan is to be copied, into the same
number of squares, each equal to the former when the plan is to be copied of
the same size, but greater or less than the others, in the proportion in which
the plan is to be increased or diminished, when of a different size. Lastly,
copy into the clean squares, the parts contained in the corresponding squares
of the old plan; and you will have the copy either of the same size, or greater
or less in any proportion.

FOURTH METHOD.
A fourth method is by the instrument called a pentagraph, which also copies
the plan in any size required.

FIFTH METHOD.
But the neatest method of any is this. Procure a copying frame or glass, made
in this manner; namely, a large square of the best window glass, set in a broad
frame of wood, which can be raised up to any angle, when the lower side of it
rests on a table. Set this frame up to any angle before you, facing a strong
light; fix the old plan and clean paper together with several pins quite
around, to keep them together, the clean paper being laid uppermost, and upon
the face of the plan to be copied. Lay them, with the back of the old plan,
upon the glass, namely, that part which you intend to begin at to copy first;
and, by means of the light shining through the papers, you will very distinctly
perceive every line of the plan through the clean paper. In this state then
trace all the lines on the paper with a pencil. Having drawn that part which
covers the glass, slide another part over the glass, and copy it in the same
manner. And then another part. And so on till the whole be copied.

Then, take them asunder, and trace all the pencillines over with a sine pen
and Indian ink, or with common ink.

And thus you may copy the finest plan, without injuring it in the least.

When the lines, etc. are copied upon the clean paper or vellum, the next
business is to write such names, remarks, or explanations as may be judged
necessary; laying down the scale for taking the lengths of any parts, a
flower-de-luce to point out the direction, and the proper title ornamented with
a compartment; and illustrating or coloring every part in such manner as shall
seem most natural, such as shading rivers or brooks with crooked lines, drawing
the representations of trees, b^shes, hills, woods, hedges, houses, gates,
roads, etc. in their proper places; running a single dotted line for a foot
path, and a double one for a carriage road; and either representing the bases
or the elevations of buildings, etc.

CONIC SECTIONS; AND THEIR SOLIDS.
DEFINITIONS.
1. CONIC sections are the plane figures formed by cutting a cone.

According to the different positions of the cutting plane there will arise
five different figures or sections.

2. If the cutting plane pass through the vertex, and any part of the base, the
section will be a triangle.

diagram

3. If the cone be cut parallel to the base, the section will be a circle.

diagram

4. The section is called an ellipsis, when the cone is cut obliquely through
both sides.

diagram

5. The section is a parabola, when the cone is cut parallel to one of its
sides.

diagram

6. The section is an hyperbola, when the cutting plane meets the opposite cone
continued above the vertex, where it will make another section or hyperbola
equal to the lower one.

diagram

7. The vertices of any section, are the points where the cutting plane meets
the opposite sides of the cone.

8. The transverse axis is the line between the two vertices. And the middle
point of the transverse, is the center of the conic section.

diagram

diagram

9. The conjugate axis, is a line drawn through the center, and perpendicular
to the transverse.

10. An ordinate is a line perpendicular to the axis.

11. An absciss is a part of the axis between the ordinate and the vertex.

12. A spheroid, or ellipsoid, is a solid generated by the revolution of an
ellipse about one of its axes. It is a prolate one, when the revolution is made
about the transverse axis; and oblate, when about the conjugate.

diagram

13. A conoid is a solid formed by the revolution of a parabola, or hyperbola,
about the axis. And is accordingly called parabolic, or hyperbolic. -- The
parabolic conoid is also called a paraboloid; and the hyperbolic conoid, an
hyperboloid.

diagram

14. A spindle is formed by any of the three sections revolving about a double
ordinate, like the circular spindle.

15. A segment, of any of these figures, is a part cut off at the top, by a
plane parallel to the base.

16. And a frustum is the part left next the base, after the segment is cut off.

PROBLEM I. To describe an Ellipse.
Let TR be the transverse, CO the conjugate, etc the center. With the radius TC
and center C, describe an arc cutting TR in the points F, f; which are called
the two foci of the ellipse.

diagram

Assume any point P in the transverse; then with the radii PT, PR, and centers
F, f, describe two arcs intersecting in 1; which will be a point in the curve
of the ellipse.

And thus, by assuming a number of points P in the tranverse, there will be
found as many points in the curve as you please. Then with a steady hand draw
the curve through all these points.

Otherwise, with a Thread.

Take a thread of the length of the transverse TR, and fasten its ends with two
pins in the foci F, f. Then stretch the thread, and it will reach to I in the
curve: and by moving a pencil round, within the thread, keeping it always
stretched, it will trace out the ell^pse.

diameter, and 4 times the square of the diameter at of the length, or equally
distant between the middle and one end; as also the difference between 3 times
the greatest diameter, and 4 times the said middle diameter. Then the former
difference divided by the latter, will be quadruple the central distance, or
distance between the center of the spindle and center of the generating ellipse.

2. Then find the axes of the ellipse by problem 11, and the area of the
segment which generated the spindle by problem v.

3. Divide 3 times that area by the length of the spindle; from the quotient
subtract the greatest diameter; and multiply the remainder by the quadruple
central distance, before found.

multiply the remainder by the length of the spindle, and again by.5236, for the
solidity.

OF GAUGING.
THE business of cask-gauging is commonly performed by two instruments, namely,
the gauging or sliding-rule, and the gauging or diagonal rod.

1. OF THE GAUGING RULE.
This instrument serves to compute the contents of casks, etc. after the
dimensions have been taken. It is a square rule, having various logarithmic
lines on its four sides or faces; and three sliding pieces, running in grooves,
in three of them.

Upon the first face are three lines, namely, two marked A, B, for multiplying
and dividing; and the third, MD, for malt depth, because it serves to gauge
malt. The middle one B is upon the slider, and is a kind of double line, being
marked at both the edges of the slider, for applying it to both the lines A and
MD. These three lines are all of the same radius, or distance from 1 to 10,
each containing twice the length of the radius. A and B are placed and numbered
exactly alike, each beginning at 1, which may be either 1, or 10, or 100, etc.
or.1, or.01, or.001, etc. but whatever it is, the middle division 10, will be
10 times as much, and the last division 100 times as much. But 1 on the line MD
is opposite 215, or more exactly 2150.4 on the other lines, which number 2150.4
denotes the cubic inches in a malt bushel; and its divisions numbered
retrograde to those of A and B. Upon these two lines are also several other
marks and letters: thus, on the line A are M^, for malt bushel, at the number
2150.4; and A for ale, at 282, the cubic inches in an ale gallon; and upon the
line B is W, for wine, at 231, the cubic inches in a wine gallon; also si, for
square inscribed, at.707, the side of a square inscribed in a circle whose
diameter is 1; se, for square equal, at.886, the side of a square which is
equal to the same circle; and c, for circumference, at 3.1416, the
circumference of the same circle.

Upon the second face, or that opposite the first, are a slider and four lines,
marked D, C, D, E, at one end, and root, square, root, cube, at the other; the
lines C and E containing respectively the squares and cubes of the opposite
numbers on the lines D, D; the radius of D being double to that of A, B, C, and
triple to that of E: so that whatever the first 1 on D denotes, the first on C
is the square of it, and the first on E the cube of it; so if D begin with 1, C
and E will begin with 1; but if D begin with 10, C will begin with 100, and E
with 1000; and so on. Upon the line C are marked ^^ at.0796, for the area of
the circle whose circumference is ^; and 0 d at.7854 for the area of the circle
whose diameter is 1. Also, upon the line D are WG, for wine gauge, at 17.15;
and AG for ale gauge, at 18.95; and MR, for malt round, at 52.32; these three
being the gauge points for round or circular measure, and are found by dividing
the square roots of 231, 282, and 2150.4 by the square root of.7854: also MS,
for malt square, are marked at 46.37, the malt gauge point for square measure
being the square root of 2150.4.

Upon the third face are three lines, one upon a slider marked N; and two on
the stock, marked SS and SL, for segment standing and segment lying, which
serve for ullaging standing and lying casks.

And upon the fourth, or opposite face, are a scale of inches, and three other
scales, marked spheroid or 1st variety, 2d variety, 3d variety; the scale for
the 4th, or conic variety, being on the inside of the slider in the third face.
The use of these lines is to find the mean diameters of casks.

Besides all those lines, there are two others on the insides of the two first
sliders, being continued from the one slider to the other. The one of these is
a scale of inches, from 12 to 36; and the other is a scale of ale gallons
between the corresponding numbers.435 and 3.61; which form a table to show, in
ale gallons, the contents of all cylinders whose diameters are from 12 to 36
inches, their common altitude being 1 inch.

The Use of the Gauging Rule.
PROBLEM I. To Multiply two Numbers, as 12 and 25.
Set 1 on B to either of the given numbers, as 12, on A; then against 25 on B
stands 300 on A; which is the product.

PROBLEM II. To Divide one Number by another, as 300 by 25.
Set 1 on B to 25 on A; then against 300 on A stands 12 on B, for the quotient.

PROBLEM III. To find a Fourth Proportional; as to 8, 24, and 96.
Set 8 on B to 24 on A; then against 96 on B is 288 on A, the 4th proportional
to 8, 24, 96.

PROBLEM IV. To Extract the Square Root, as of 225.
The first 1 on C standing opposite the 1 on D on the stock, then against 225
on C stands its square root 15 on D.

PROBLEM V. To Extract the Cube Root, as of 3375.
The line D on the slide being set straight with E, then opposite 3375 on E
stands its cube root 15 on D.

PROBLEM VI. To find a Mean Proportional, as between 4 and 9.
Set 4 on C to the same 4 on D; then against 9 on C stands the mean
proportional 6 on D.

PROBLEM VII. To find Numbers in Duplicate Proportion. As to find a Number
which shall be to 120, as the Square of 3 to the Square of 2.
Set 2 on D to 120 on C; then against 3 on D stands 270 on C, for the answer.

PROBLEM VIII. To find Numbers in Subduplicate Proportion. As to find a Number
which shall be to 2 as the Root of 270 to the Root of 120.
Set 2 on D to 120 on C; then against 270 on C stands 3 on D, for the answer.

PROBLEM IX. To find Numbers in Triplicate Proportion. As to find a Number
which shall be to 100 as the Cube of 36 is to the Cube of 40.
Set 40 on D to 100 on E; then against 36 on D stands 72.9 on E, for the answer.

PROBLEM X. To find Numbers in Subtriplicate Proportion.
As to find a Number which shall be to 40, as the Cube Root of 72.9 is to the
Cube Root of 100.

Set 40 on D to 100 on E; then against 72.9 on E stands 36 on D, for the answer.

PROBLEM XI. To Compute Malt Bushels by the Line MD.
As to find the Malt Bushels in the Couch, Floor, or Cistern, whose Length is
230, Breadth 58.2, and Depth 5.4 Inches.

Set 230 on B to 5.4 on MD; then against 58.2 on A stands 33.6 bushels on B,
for the answer.

Note. The uses of the other marks on the rule, will appear in the examples
farther on.

OF THE GAUGING OR DIAGONAL ROD.
The diagonal rod is a square rule, having four faces; being commonly 4 feet
long, and folding together by joints. This instrument is used both for gauging
or measuring casks, and computing their contents, and that from one dimension
only, namely the diagonal of the cask, or the length from the middle of the
bung-hole to the meeting of the head of the cask with the stave opposite to the
bung; and is the longest line that can be drawn within the cask from the middle
of the bung. And, accordingly, on one face of the rule is a scale of inches,
for measuring this diagonal; to which are placed the areas, in ale gallons, of
circles to the corresponding diameters, in like manner as the lines on the
under sides of the three slides in the sliding rule.

On the opposite face are two scales of ale and wine gallons, expressing the
contents of casks having the corresponding diagonals. And these are the lines
which chiefly form the difference between this instrument and the sliding rule;
for all their other lines are the same, and to be used in the same manner.

EXAMPLE.

The rod being applied within the cask at the bung-hole, the diagonal was found
to be 34.4 inches; required the content in gallons.

Now to 34.4 inches correspond, on the rod, 90 ale gallons or 111 wine gallons;
the content required.

Note. The contents exhibited by the rod answer to the most common form of
casks, and fall in between the 2d and 3d varieties following.

OF CASKS AS DIVIDED INTO VARIETIES.
It is usual to divide casks into four cases or varieties, which are judged of
from the greater or less apparent curvature of their sides, namely, 1. The
middle frustum of a spheroid, 2. The middle frustum of a parabolic spindle, 3.
The two equal frustums of a paraboloid, 4. The two equal frustums of a cone.


And if the content of any of those be computed in inches, by their proper
rules, and this be divided by 282, or 231, or 2150.4, the quotient will be the
content in ale gallons, or wine gallons, or malt bushels, respectively. Because
282 cubic inches make 1 ale gallon 231 -- 1 wine gallon 2150.4 -- 1 malt bushel.

Or the particular rule will be for each as in the following problems.

PROBLEM XII. To find the Content of a Cask of the First Form.
To the square of the head diameter add double the square of the bung diameter,
and multiply the sum by the length of the cask. Then let the product be
multiplied by.0009 or divided by 1077 for ale gallons, and multiplied by.0011
or divided by 882 for wine gallons.

OF THE ULLAGE OF CASKS.
The ullage of a cask, is what it contains when only partly filled. And it is
considered in two positions, namely, as standing on its end with the axis
perpendicular to the horizon, or as lying on its side with the axis parallel to
the horizon.

PROBLEM XVIII. To find the Ullage by the Sliding Rule.
By one of the preceding problems find the whole content of the cask. Then set
the length on N to 100 on SS for a segment standing, or set the bung diameter
on N to 100 on SL for a segment lying; then against the wet inches on N is a
number on SS or SL, to be reserved.

Next, set 100 on B to the reserved number on A; then against the whole content
on B will be found the ullage on A.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the ullage answering to 10 wet inches of a standing cask, the
whole content of which is 92 gallons, and length 40 inches.

Having set 40 on N to 100 on SS, then against 10 on N is 23 on SS, the
reserved number.

Then set 100 on B to 23 on A, and against 92 on B is 21.2 on A, the ullage
required.

Ex. 2. What is the ullage of a standing cask whose whole length is 20 inches,
and content 11 ^/^ gallons; the wet inches being 5?

Ans. 2.65 gallons.

Ex. 3. The content of a cask being 92 gallons, and the bung diameter 32,
required the ullage of the segment lying when the wet inches are 8.

Ans. 16.4 gallons.

PROBLEM XIX. To Ullage a Standing Cask by the Pen.
Add all together the square of the diameter at the surface of the liquor, the
square of the diameter of the nearest end, and the square of double the
diameter taken in the middle between the other two; then multiply the sum by
the length between the surface and nearest end, and the product again by.0004
2/^ for ale gallons, or by.0005 for wine gallons, in the less part of the cask,
whether empty or filled.

EXAMPLE.

The three diameters being 24, 27, and 29 inches, required the ullage for 10
wet inches.

^

PROBLEM XX. To Ullage a Lying Cask by the Pen.
Divide the wet inches by the bung diameter; find the quotient in the column of
versed sines, in the table of circular segments at the end of the book, taking
out its corresponding segment. Then multiply this segment by the whole content
of the cask, and the product again by 1 for the ullage required, nearly.

EXAMPLE.

OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY.
THE specific gravities of bodies, are their relative weights contained under
the same given magnitude, as a cubic foot, or a cubic inch, etc.

The specific gravities of several sorts of matter are expressed by the numbers
annexed to their names in the following table.

A Table of the Specific Gravities of Bodies.
Fine gold 19640 Brick 2000 Standard gold 18888 Light earth 1984 Quicksilver
14000 Solid gunpowder 1745 Lead 11325 Sand 1520 Fine silver 11091 Pitch 1150
Standard silver 10535 Box-wood 1030 Copper 9000 Seawater 1030 Gun metal 8784
Common water 1000 Cast brass 8000 Oak 925 Steel 7850 Gunpowder, shaken 922
Iron 7645 Ash 800 Cast iron 7425 Maple 755 Tin 7320 Elm 600 Marble 2700 Fir 550
Common stone 2520 Cork 240 Loom 2160 Air 1

Note. The several sorts of wood are supposed to be dry. Also, as a cubic foot
of water weighs just 1000 ounces avoirdupois, the numbers in this table
express, not only the specific gravities of the several bodies, but also the
weight of a cubic foot of each, in avoirdupois ounces; and thence, by
proportion, the weight of any other quantity, or the quantity of any other
weight, may be known, as in the following problems.

PROBLEM I. To find the Magnitude of any Body, from its Weight.
As the tabular specific gravity of the body, Is to its weight in avoirdupois
ounces, So is one cubic foot, or 1728 cubic inches, To its content in feet, or
inches, respectively.

PROBLEM III. To find the Specific Gravity of a Body.
CASE 1. When the body is heavier than water, weigh it both in water and out of
water, and take the difference, which will be the weight lost in water. Then

As the weight lost in water,
Is to the whole weight,
So is the specific gravity of water,
To the specific gravity of the body.
EXAMPLE.

A piece of stone weighed 10lb, but in water only 6lb, required its specific
gravity.

^

CASE 2. When the body is lighter than water, so that it will not quite sink;
assix to it a piece of another body heavier than water, so that the mass
compounded of the two may sink together. Weigh the heavier body, and the
compound mass, separately, both in water and out of it; then find how much each
loses in water, by subtracting its weight in water from its weight in air; and
subtract the less of these remainders from the greater. Then

As this last remainder,
Is to the weight of the light body in air,
So is the specific gravity of water,
To the specific gravity of the body.
EXAMPLE.

Suppose a piece of elm weighs 15lb in air, and that a piece of copper, which
weighs 18lb in air and 16lb in water, is affixed to it, and that the compound
weighs 8lb in water; required the specific gravity of the elm.

Copper Compound 18 in air 33 16 in water 6 2 loss 27 2 As 25151000600 ans.

PROBLEM IV. To find the Quantities of Two Ingredients in a given Compound.
Take the three differences of every pair of the three specific gravities,
namely, the specific gravities of the compound and each ingredient; and
multiply the difference of every two specific gravities by the third. Then, as
the greatest product is to the whole weight of the compound, so is each of the
other products to the two weights of the ingredients.

EXAMPLE.

A composition of 112lb being made of tin and copper, whose specific gravity is
found to be 8784; required the quantity of each ingredient, the specific
gravity of tin being 7320, and of copper 9000.

^

Answer there is 100lb of copper and conseq. 12lb of tin in the composition.

OF THE PILING OF BALLS AND SHELLS.
IRON balls and shells are commonly piled, by horizontal courses, either in a
pyramidical or wedge-like form; the base being either an equilateral triangle,
a square, or a rectangle. In the triangle and square, the pile will finish in a
single ball; but in the rectangle, it will finish in a single row of balls,
like an edge.

In triangular and square piles, the number of horizontal rows, or courses, is
always equal to the number of balls in one side of the bottom row. And in
rectangular piles, the number of rows is equal to the number of balls in the
breadth of the bottom row. Also the number in the top row, or edge, is one more
than the difference between the length and breadth of the bottom row.

PROBLEM I. To find the Number of Balls in a Triangular Pile.

PROBLEM II. To find the Number of Balls in a Square Pile.
Multiply continually together the number in one side of the bottom course,
that number increased by 1, and double the same number increased by 1; then of
the last product will be the answer.

EXAMPLES.

1. How many balls are in a square pile of 30 rows?

Ex. 2. How many balls are in a square pile of 20 rows?

Ans. 2870.

PROBLEM III. To find the Number of Balls in a Rectangular Pile.

the breadth of the same, multiply the remainder by the said breadth, and the
product by one more than the same; and divide by 6 for the answer.

EXAMPLES.

1. Required the number of balls in a rectangular pile, the length and breadth
of the base row being 46 and 15.

their proper form; and the remainder will be the number in the frustum, or
incomplete pile.

EXAMPLES.

1. To find the Number of shot in the incomplete triangular pile, one side of
the bottom course being 40, and the top course 20.

OF DISTANCES BY THE VELOCITY OF SOUND.
BY various experiments it has been found that sound flies, through the air,
uniformly at the rate of about 1142 feet in 1 second of time, or a mile in 4
seconds. And therefore, by proportion, any distance may be found corresponding
to any given time; namely, multiply the given time in seconds, by 1142, for the
corresponding distance in feet; or take 3/14 of the given time for the distance
in miles.

Note. The time for the passage of sound in the interval between seeing the
flash of a gun, or lightning, and hearing the report, may be observed by a
watch, or a small pendulum. Or it may be observed by the beats of the pulse in
the wrist, counting, on an average, about 70 to a second in persons in moderate
health, or 5 pulsations to a mile, and more or less according to circumstances.

THE USE OF THE TABLE.
IN the foregoing table, each number in the column of area seg. is the area of
the circular segment whose height, or the versed fine of its half are, is the
number immediately on the left of it, in the column of heights; the diameter of
the circle being 1, and its whole area.785398.

The use of this table is to find, by it, the area of the segment of any other
circle, whatever be the diameter. And this is done by first dividing the height
of any proposed segment by its own diameter, and the quotient is a decimal to
be sought in the column of heights, and against it is the tabular area to be
taken out, which is similar to the proposed segment. Then this tabular area
being multiplied by the square of the given diameter, will be the area of your
segment required; because similar areas are to each other as the squares of
their diameters.

EXAMPLE.

So if it be required to find the area of a segment of a circle, whose height
is 3, the diameter being 50.

Here 50) 3.25 (.065 quot. or tab. height, and the tab. seg. is.021659 which
multiply by 2500 the square of the diam. gives 54.147500 the area required.

But, in dividing the given height by the diameter, if the quotient do not
terminate in three places of decimals without a fractional remainder, then the
area for that fractional part ought to be proportioned for, thus: Having found
the tabular area answering to the first three decimals of the quotient, take
the difference between it and the next following tabular area, which difference
multiply by the fractional remaining part of the quotient, and the product will
be the corresponding proportional part, to be added to the first tabular area.

So if the height of a proposed segment were 3, to the diameter 50.

Here 50) 3 (.066 Then to.066 answers.022154 the next area is.022652 their
difference is 498 of which is 232 which added to.022154 gives the whole tab.
area.022386 And mult. by 2500 gives the area 55.965000 sought.
