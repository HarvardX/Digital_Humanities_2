Personal Satire, a proper Entertainment for the Public, to whose experienced
Candor and Indulgence he submits the following BURLETTA.

AIR II. Dooralin. A thriving trade
The nimming jade
Has picked up, here, of chousing us;
With sly flim-flams,
And palming shams,
At Brothel learnt, or Bouzing-house!
[Turning to Van. insolently.] You must purloin,
In duds to shine
So dizen'd -- there is no (...) wi' you;

Can I help it? -- No, not I; --

And I Will use 'em -- quite genteelly.
If the Smarts of the Sky
Cringe, ogle and sigh,
Whenever I pass by;
And cry,
Looky there!
What an air!
Gods, bow fair!
Pray, why
(To feed your starched pride)
Must I go and hide,
'Till you're made a bride?
Who, I?
No, no -- If I do, may I die.

RECITATIVE. Pal. (incensed) Don't rouse me, Bold-face! -- if your tongue's so
flippant, I Will take y' a chuck -- as shall chop off the tip on it.

screaming) I Will swear the peace: -- keep at arms-length, Virago!

( To Juno, whimpering) She Will brain me, Mam!


Pal. (in spiteful rage) -- Well, had I don't long a-go.


Ven (still whimpering) Your tongue's no slander -- for that, not a button

Care I; -- but I cannot stand your fist of mutton.


Juno. (Aside, chuckling) Nuts to me, This -- I hope, 'twill be a scuffle;

(to them) My stars! what was it could thus your tempers ruffle?


Pal. Her gibes,


Ven. Her rants.


Pal. Don't snouch then!


Ven. Don't you hector!


Juno. (taking each by the hand) Faults on both sides -- sit down -- come, I Will
direct here.

And Iris! -- stir, wench! -- fill about the nectar.


Pal. Venus -- your quips would Patient Grisel canker,

However, shake hands!


Ven. (giving her hand) Here, Miss, I bear no rancour.


AIR IV. Touch the Thing, you Bastard. (All sit, and Iris serves them with
Nectar. Juno (sings;) When bickrings hot,
To high words got,
Break out at Gamiorum;
The flame to cool,
My Golden Rule
Is -- Push about the Jorum.
With fist on jug,
Coifs who can lug?
Or show me that glib speaker,
Who her red rag
In gibe can wag,
With her mouth full of liquor.

(They all drink.) (Exeunt, merrily singing in Chorus) The Golden Rule
Is -- Push about the Jorum.

Steals me the Dragon's Apple-we'll ha'merry days. Augh! -- ho! -- oa! --

(yawning and stretching) Court's grown damned hum-drum: -- Jove, poor Noodle!

Does naught but muddle. --

Juno too -- turned so -- mim, forsooth, Butter will scarce melt in her mouth.

But the Apple -- yes -- I Will throw -- that squib among 'em --

Shall stir the humors -- as a wasp had stung 'em,


AIR V. Behind the Bush in the Garden, To set at odds
These hair-brained Gods,
The turn of a straw or a pin does;
I make them fret,
Take pet,
Curvet,
And fling Heaven out of the windows.
He, she, soul, handsome, all,
On wires I dance 'em all,
Jove of my puppets but is chief;
Sky, earth, and ocean,
I put in commotion;
I dote on a snug bit of mischief.
[ To him enter running, as from pursuit, Erynnis, holding the Golden Apple in
her hand, and habited as an old witch.] RECITATIVE. Ery. Here, Momus, it is --
at last; -- I Am all over dripping.

Pat on his back, and scratch his pol. --


Ery. But I -- ( in terror)


Mo. You -- must plump down to Hell, -- to Pluto;

I Have writ a card to him. --


Ery. (trembling) Any where, -- in tuto.

Who wrought my grief,
I Would be her death;
Stop thief! Stop thief! Stop thief!

Momus comes forth, and accosts him familiarly. Mo. Ha, -- my old friend! --
how is it?


Dra. Saw you that Beldam Erynnis scamper by?


Mo. Faith, Sir, -- she -- seldom Visits these parts: -- yet passed -- within
this half-hour,

Hobbling -- to Juno, -- with some fruit -- you -- gave her.


Dra. She lies, -- she stole it; -- Gave! give her a halter!

Fair words --

Mo. Bare words
Never will prevail.

Dra. But I may be sent to Jail.

Mo. Mouthy, mealy!
Cannot I bail ye?
Does your courage fail ye?

Dra. No; but, Sir,
'Twill make a stir,
And Jove may demur.
And Jove may demur.

Mo. On my word, be will not demur.

Dra. Since you say
So, I may
Skur away.

Mo. Skur.
And be sure you put it home to her:
Servant, Sir.

Dra. I shall pelt on, 'till I came to her,
Whip and spur.

Have seen a Ghost --


Iris. Worse, Mem -- that hag -- Erynnis.

Not at home --
You Would have thought she would burst with rage.

Not at home,
Echoed they to all her askings.

undoubted;

So (to Venus) give it me -- and say no more about it.

That claim,
If you be wise,

Drag.?


[laughs.] Drag. {dolefully} Now, bail me, Momus!


Mom. I Would see you hanged first.


[Exit laughing.] Drag. Get along, -- and be Cursed! -- Why did I trust a
Courtier's Promise?


AIR I. A Stage Dance Tune. Fool, feel in grain
Is he,
Fond and vain,
Of brain
Quite dizzy,
Who, when out o'place,
Hopes at Court an embrace.
Nic, the old fiend,
Will first pretend,
For his own end,
To be your friend
Caught in
The gin
Of sin,
He Will grin
At your disgrace.
The Fury lashes him on. Exeunt. SCENE changes to Jupiter's Hall of Audience.
Enter Momus laughing. Mom. Ha! ha! ha! -- ha! ha! ha!

Three Cats -- I left 'em at it, -- spitting, -- scratching,

( Seeing Jupiter) Gadso!

Now, What can that wise Nob be hatching?


( stands aside to observe.) Jupiter comes forward. RECITATIVE accompanied.
Jup. How shall I get this tangled hank unravelled?

Put to my trumps, and gravelled!

'Twou'd dumb found, Wizard, Merlin, or Friar Bacon;

Aye, all the Square-caps from Oxford to Pekin.

No making head or tail on it -- which way soever I turn it --

If I know how to act -- I Am a sous'd gurnet.

Ha! that Firebrand Erynnis! (Could I but trap her, With what good will I Would
strap her!)

I Will be hanged, but 'twas she that kicked this dust up,

None but she -- mischief-maker! (The Devil take her!)

Amongst my proud leash of Ninnies.

But -- I -- for her provide will; Yes -- I Will have her fairly trussed up, Though
the old Trot should mount for it, Who can call me to account for it?

Or, if not strung -- she shall -- mill-doll -- in Bridewell.


AIR II. Fischietti. As Judge, Spouse, Progenitor,
What part shall I take?
My character, as senator,
My name lies at stake.
Says Justice -- What do you lag on?
For shame! -- content the Dragon.
Then whispers Court Favor,
To bilk him will be braver.
What part shall I take?
My choice is kept swinging,
Like Bow-bell a ringing,
Let go -- then pulled back.
Why, let them buff,
And jour and chide!
I Will save my buff,
Whatever betide.
To shun domestic jangle,
This paltry Pippin-Brangle,
Before George! I Will not decide.

[Towards the close of the Air, Momus advances to him.] RECITATIVE. Mom. That Is
fixed then.


Jup. Yes, yes -- I Have wound up my bottom.


Mom. Roundly; like a true Solomon -- ( aside) of Gotham.


Jup. But how to still their clamours -- there is the matter.


Mom. Depute some Mortal for their Arbitrator; 'Twill pull 'em down a peg.


Jup. (rubbing his bands delighted) 'Twill, 'twill -- the sluts!

I Will do it -- to fiddle-strings 'twill fret their guts.


Mom. Oh! they will cajole you with their Ifs and Buts.

Didn't they coax you in your beer to impris'n The Dragon but for claiming what
was his'n?


AIR III. Cotillon. When you're bosky, half-seas over,
Doxies wind you as they please;
Through their eyes you then discover,

In maims, blood, and bruises and blows;

And silence the trumpet and drum;
Let me with soft Myrtle my brows bear inwove,
And tenderly combat at home!
