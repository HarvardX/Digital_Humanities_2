THE GOOD MILITIA MAN, etc.
I.
I WAS a Plough-boy tall Sir;
My name was honest Dan;
But at my country's call, Sir,
I Have turned Militia Man.
II.
So on our little green, Sir,
Away from all the mire,
I daily now am seen, Sir,
To cock, present, and fire.
III.
In Regimentals bright, Sir,
Of Scarlet I do shine,
With hair tied up so tight, Sir,
And whitened all so fine.
IV.
Of Maidens not a few, Sir
Come crouding round the green;
And so do Parents too, Sir;
The Children push between.
V.
There like a Soldier prime, Sir,
I march both quick and flow;
I stamp my foot in time, Sir,
And then kick up my toe.
VI.
Mean while, with sound so grand, Sir,
They beat the Rum -- drum -- drum;
Till all our valiant Band, Sir,
Do wish the French would come.
VII.
But stop -- methinks it is wrong, Sir,
To talk this swelling stuff;
For no true Soldier's song, Sir
Should deal in empty puff.
VIII.
I Will give you then a spice, Sir
(Oh now you will like my plan)
Of sound and good advice, Sir
For each Militia Man.
IX.
First then, be sound at heart, Sir,
Be loyal, says my Song;
And nobly act your part, Sir
To right your Country's wrong.
X.
Yet let no Soldier hold, Sir,
He merely need be stout,
And blunt and brave and bold, Sir,
And mad to fight it out;
XI.
Your Soldier of true stamp, Sir
Is not like brutish Cattle;
And he will be good in camp, Sir,
As well as good in battle.
XII.
Unlike the looser herd, Sir
Each vice he will try to crush;
Nor will he speak a word, Sir
To make a Maiden blush.
XIII.
Nor will he show his spunk, Sir,
By turning jolly fellow;
He never will be drunk, Sir,
No, no -- nor yet be mellow.
XIV.
He counts it quite a shame, Sir
To hear a Soldier swear;
It Is what King George would blame, Sir,
No doubt if he was there.
XV.
Nor does he laugh and grin, Sir.
At these as petty things;
Your swearing is a sin, Sir
Against the King of Kings.
XVI.
For be it understood, Sir
He says with honest Dan,
"The Soldier cannot be good, Sir
While wicked is the Man."
XVII.
Now should some saucy Tongue, Sir,
Here stop me for a Toast,
I Will give the Man I Have sung, Sir,
"The Man that is worth a host."
Z.

THE END.
