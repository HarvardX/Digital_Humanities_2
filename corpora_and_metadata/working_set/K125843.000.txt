THE Roguish MILLER; OR, Nothing got by Cheating. A TRUE BALLAD.
A Miller there was, and he lived at his Mill,
Which was built on a stream at the foot of a hill.
He cheated all day and he drank all the night,
For cheating and drinking was all his delight;
While his moments in tippling unheeded did roll,
This still was his saying -- be sure to take toll.
Whoever sent corn to be ground at his Mill,
He spoilt it, he changed it, he pilfer'd it still;
In villainy thus a long course he did run,
For he fancied that cheating was very good fun.
He cared not what came of his body or soul,
While this was his saying -- I Will always take toll.
If you sent a full Sack of good corn to his Mill,
A Sack of bad flour he sent you back still,
For he fancied that when he the wheat had once ground,
The difference would not be easily found:
Now to change good for bad was as if he had stole,
And he not only changed it -- but always took toll.
The Neighbors often sent him their Money to pay,
But he always refused it and sent it away;
Had he taken the Money he would have got but his due,
But the payment that is lawful for him would not do;
What was honestly his he despised on the whole,
Because he got more from -- the taking of toll.
One day when a Farmer had sent a good sack
Of his Corn to be ground, and then sent for it back;
He called to his Man and demanded straitway,
If for this he had taken the toll on that day.
The Man strait declared, that though naught he had stole,
Yet that he had taken -- the full of the toll.
He then called his maid, and he asked her good lack
If toll she had taken from that very sack;
She declared that she had, but he fond of pelf,
Said, for fear that you should not, I Will take it myself;
So rashly he ventured the loss of his Soul,
And mended his practice -- by thrice taking toll.
At length he grew bolder and bolder in sin,
And cheating he deeper and deeper got in;
Of Satan, alas! he was quite at the beck,
Where he first took a pound he at length took a peck,
No church he frequented to pray for his Soul,
Who would might go thither -- so he could take toll.
The Farmer, the Squire, the Parson likewise
Agreed to observe him with still keener Eyes;
But the Justice he cheated to such a degree,
That no longer with patience his frauds could he see;
So he sent him to jail by the LAW's just control,
And a MITTIMUS paid him -- for taking of toll.
Come all honest Millers whoever you be,
And listen to counsel that is given by me;
Be content, like fair tradesmen with moderate gains,
And look for a lawful reward of your pains;
If it is paid you in money be pleased on the whole
And if you take any -- take moderate toll.
O! seek not each way to defraud that you can,
Nor cheat in the flour, nor cheat in the bran;
Be honest and all Men will flock to your Mill,
And though others want custom, yours never will stand still.
And when to your MAKER you give up your soul,
You Will rejoice that you always -- took moderate toll.
