PROLOGUE.
Spoken by Mr. SMITH.
BOLD was the man, and senc'd in every part
With oak, and ten-fold brass about the heart,
To build a play who tortured first his brain,
And then dared launch it on this stormy main.
What though, at first, he spreads his little sails
To Heaven's indulgent and propitious gales,
As the land gradual lessens to his eye
He finds a troubled sea, and lowering sky:
Envy, detraction, calumny, and spite,
Ra6ise a worse storm than when the winds unite.
Around his bark, in many a dangerous shoal,
Those monsters of the deep, the critics, prowl.
"She Is a weak vessel, for these seas unfit,
"And has on board her not a spice of wit:
"She Is French-built too; of foreign make," they cry;
Like geese still cackling that the Gauls are nigh.
If thrown on rocks by the hoarse dashing wave,
The unhappy crew no hand is stretched to save;
But round the wreck, like Moors, with furious joy,
The witlings crowd -- to murder and destroy,
These are known dangers; and, still full as certain,
The bard meets other ills behind the curtain.
Little you think, ere yet you fix his fate,
What previous mischiefs there in ambush wait;
What plagues arise from all the mimic throng:
"My part's too short; -- and, Sir, my part's too long."
This calls for incident; that repartee.
"Down the back-stairs pen an escape for me.
"Give me a ladder, Mr. Bays, of rope;
"I love to wear the breeches, and elope.
"Something for me the groundlings ears to split.
"Write a dark closet, or a fainting-fit.
"Fix Woodward in some whimsical disgrace:
"Or be facetious with Ned Shuter's face."
This is our way; and yet our bard to night
Removes each obstacle, and springs to light.
Some scenes, we hope, he brings to nature true;
Some gleams of humor, and a moral too;
But no strange monsters offers to your view:
No forms, grotesque and wild, are here at strife:
He boasts an etching from the real life;
Exerts his efforts, in a polished age,
To drive the Smithfield muses from the stage;
By easy dialogue would win your praise,
And on fair decency graft all his bays.

ACT I.
Enter CARELESS and BLUNT. BLUNT. FOR all that, Careless, I wish you had a
little of that man in your composition.


CARELESS. Of him! of Wisely! -- My dear Blunt, not for the wide world. --
Wisely has, indeed, the name of a good sort of a sensible kind of man -- and he
is so -- but the heart is never concerned in what he says or does.


BLUNT. Why, as to his heart, according to the way of the world --


CARELESS. He has none, Sir; no heart at all: his affections are all contracted
into a narrow attention to self; and his understanding acts the subservient
part to schemes of interest. --


BLUNT. Why that is the very quality I wish you possessed a little of; -- you
would not then be liable to ridiculous miscarriages in every thing you
undertake. --


CARELESS. There! going again to harp upon my indiscretions. But prithee no
more of that -- I am wonderfully altered. -- It Is true, I have had hitherto an
unguarded openness of temper; but that is all over.


BLUNT. All over! -- My dear Careless, you will never give it over. You are the
very sieve of your own intentions, the Marplot of your own designs.


CARELESS. Oh! no, no -- I am very secret of late.


BLUNT. 'Sdeath, man, I would as soon trust a secret with the printer of a
daily paper. -- Was it not but the other day you lost a seat in parliament by
not keeping your own counsel?


CARELESS. There again now you wrong me: Sir William's interest was weakened,
and --


BLUNT. Psha! I know the whole affair: You blabbed the scheme, and a whisper
from above to the corporation undid you.


CARELESS. Well! well! that has taught me wisdom. --


BLUNT. Wisdom! have you said nothing of Lucinda lately?


CARELESS. Not a syllable.


BLUNT. Have not you shown her letter to any body?


CARELESS. Letter! -- why -- a --


BLUNT. You have shown it; and there is captain Wimble in a fury about a
paragraph relating to himself.


CARELESS. Captain Wimble! -- I -- I -- now there, upon, my soul, I am very ill
used. -- I never showed that letter to any body but Jack Tattle; -- under the
seal of secrecy too. -- There is no such thing as trusting any body.


BLUNT. It was not he betrayed you.


CARELESS. Nobody else saw a syllable of it.


BLUNT. Not my lady Betty Gabble?


CARELESS. My lady Betty! I -- I repeated a passage to my lady Betty Gabble,
merely by way of conversation.


BLUNT. And by way of conversation you are for ever marring all your own
schemes.


CARELESS. Well, if that is the case, a Jew without renouncing shall as soon
gain admission to the Pope's toe, as any man get into my secrets again.


BLUNT. Caution is necessary, let me tell you, Careless; men are inquisitive
into other people's business.


CARELESS. So they are, Sir.


BLUNT. Ridicule and raillery are the taste of the age: every one you meet is a
pleasant fellow; he has picked up a character, an incident, a story, a damned
high story; and so a friend is sacrificed to the sport of the next company.


CARELESS. Very true; -- I find it so; -- but I am a new man grown,
notwithstanding all your criticisms upon my character.


BLUNT. A new man! -- Why you have ruined yourself with Lucinda: She Will never
marry you.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! you see now I can keep a secret. -- Ha! ha! my dear Blunt, I
don't intend to marry her.


BLUNT. No!


CARELESS. No; -- that has been settled this week; and though you and I live here
at Windsor in the same house, -- ha! ha! -- I have kept it from you these six
or seven days.


BLUNT. Well; if you have sufficient motives for breaking off --


CARELESS. I have. -- Ha! ha! -- You must not be in the cabinet-council of my
amors. -- Ha! ha! though -- ha! ha! -- you will be surpised when you know my
reasons. -- Ha! ha! the greatest thing in the world for me. -- Ha! ha!


BLUNT. Well, if it is so, be upon your guard.


CARELESS. Yes, yes; that is absolutely necessary: it all depends upon secrecy.
-- Ha! ha! -- It Is a prodigious hit.


BLUNT. You Will defeat it yourself. You Are an honest fellow, Careless, and no
one's enemy but your own.


CARELESS. Never fear me; ha! ha! you will be rejoiced when you hear it. -- Ha!
ha!


BLUNT. I hope so.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! you would never have suspected it. -- Ha! ha! -- It will
astonish the world how I brought it about. -- Ha! ha! I have a mind to give you
a hint.


BLUNT. There again now!


CARELESS. How can you be so supercilious? Telling you is nothing. Ha! ha! My
dear Blunt, if you will promise me --


BLUNT. I had rather not hear it.


CARELESS. It will so astonish you. -- Ha! ha! I shall have a borough of my own.


BLUNT. Well, but why need you speak? I had rather --


CARELESS. Only to you, only to you. Ha! ha! it will so surprise you: -- The
charming, youthful, lovely widow --.


BLUNT. Prithee, man, lock it up in your own breast.


CARELESS. Hortensia, my boy! -- Ha! ha! -- In a few days I am to be married to
her.


BLUNT. Hortensia! how the devil could you get access to her. Her way of life
is so retired --


CARELESS. I knew it would surprise you. -- Is it not a great affair?


BLUNT. Very great indeed!


CARELESS. My dear Blunt, I am ruined if a syllable transpires. -- She cannot
bear to be the topic of the day; -- she has broke off several matches because
her lovers were imprudent enough to make her the tea-table talk.


Enter a SERVANT. SERVANT. Your honor's tailor, Sir, from London, and your
peruke-maker.


CARELESS. Show them in. [ Exit Servant.] These are preparations for my wedding
-- Ha! ha! Have not I managed it well?


BLUNT. Well, now continue to be upon your guard till all is concluded. -- While
you are busy with these fellows, I Will just step and write a short letter. --
Wisely sets out for London today, and he will take my letter with him.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! -- How the world will stare! Ha! ha!


BLUNT. They will so.


CARELESS. But you see all depends upon close management: -- Now, if you have
the friendship for me you have always professed, let me entreat you --


BLUNT. Be watchful of yourself, my dear Careless, and --


CARELESS. Oh! you may be sure of me; -- it is too deep a stake -- ha! ha!

Exit Blunt. Notwithstanding his notions of my character, he sees now that I --
ha! ha!


Enter CRIB and LA JEUNESSE. CARELESS. Walk in, Mr. Crib -- Monsieur La
Jeunesse, bien venue.


LA JEUNESSE. Monsieur, I have de honor of make you such wig as by gar was
never seen.


CRIB. And I, Sir, have brought you such a suit of clothes -- I shall so admire
them when your honor has them on. The greatest pleasure of my life is to
admire my own clothes.


LA JEUNESSE. By gar, me go to de Mall every Sunday, on purpose to see my wig
walk by.


CARELESS. Gentlemen, ye are both eminent in your vocations.


CRIB. Ah, Sir! you will be such a handsome bridegroom in this suit. -- Will
your honor please to try it on?


CARELESS. You adapt your work so perfectly to my person, Mr. Crib, that I am
sure it fits me. -- Monsieur La Jeunesse, you may try on the wig.


LA JEUNESSE. De tout mon coeur -- a ca -- wid dis wig you will look comme un
ange. -- Dis wig! pardie, it is not wig, it is head of hair -- a ca. -- Has it
de honor of being easy on de head?


CARELESS. Vastly well, Monsieur La Jeunesse.


LA JEUNESSE. Voions! it is nature make dat, and not me.


CRIB. With my clothes on, Sir, madam Lucinda will so admire --


CARELESS. You think I am to be married to her, do you, master Crib?


CRIB. So the world says, your honor.


CARELESS. The world! ha! ha!


LA JEUNESSE. It is ver fine demoiselle; and it will be so en amor wid my wig.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! you are two foolish fellows. -- And so you think she is the
happy woman, do ye?


LA JEUNESSE. It is all de talk of de great worl.


CARELESS. The great world is greatly mistaken. -- I don't think of her.


BLUNT [Entering]. What is he about now?


CARELESS. An intrigue with Lucinda might be agreeable enough; and, not to
mince the matter, I believe I shall bring it to that. -- The lady seems to
think her fortune places her above censure; and she coquets with so many men,
that hang me if I don't believe she means to keep her estate in her own hands,
and to have all the pleasures of matrimony without parting with her power.


LA JEUNESSE. Monsieur, that is a leetle a-la-mode.


CARELESS. Yes, I fancy I shall have an affair with the lady.


LA JEUNESSE. By gar, monsieur, you may have intrigue wid who you will. -- My
wig it is not easy resist. -- I assure you, my wig it have more intrigue dan
any body at all.


CRIB. And my clothes, Sir; my clothes have had more fine women -- And so your
honor does not think of marriage?


CARELESS. Not with Lucinda; but I shall be married for all that. -- Ha! ha! --
You must not take any notice.


LA JEUNESSE. Oh! d'honneur!


CARELESS. Ha! ha! when you hear of a rich blooming widow --


BLUNT. Death and fury! he is going to divulge all. -- Careless, I have
finished my letter.


CARELESS. Have you? -- Gentlemen, I have no further occasion --


CRIB. Your honor's most obedient.


LA JEUNESSE. By gar, I long to know my wig who it is to be married to.

Exit Crib and La Jeunesse.
BLUNT. For shame, Careless! -- You were going to trust these fellows: -- And
you blabb'd about Lucinda.


CARELESS. Psha! that is nothing; they are two silly rascals, and will think no
more about it.


BLUNT. And thus you reconcile yourself to your follies. -- But don't you know,
that though Hortensia may have as prompt inclinations as any of her sex, she
seems to act more from judgment than des;ire?


CARELESS. Yes, man, I know all that. -- She says so herself, here in a
charming, charming note she sent me yesterday. [He searches for it.] Where the
devil is it? -- Zoons! I have not lost it! -- Here, Richard, George, run to my
room, and see if I have left a letter there. -- I was upon the terras last
night -- 'Sdeath, if I dropped it there --.


BLUNT. This is being qualified for a secret now.


CARELESS. Confusion! this will be the devil and all. -- Ho! no! I have it safe
-- You see, Blunt, I am close enough. -- Now you shall hear it.


Enter WISELY. WISELY. Gentlemen, your servant. Is your letter ready, Blunt?


CARELESS. My dear Wisely, I am sorry we are to lose you -- Some disappointment
in love, I reckon.


WISELY. There are other perplexities besides those of love, Sir. -- But no
matter for my concerns; I don't desire to be either pitied or envied.


CARELESS. Now I like to provoke the envy of mankind: And here is that [Shewing
the letter] will make my acquaintance look on me with a jealous eye.


BLUNT. Po! prithee, put up.


CARELESS. Nay, I can trust my friend Wisely; -- he is an honest fellow, and
minds nobody's business but his own; -- he shall know it before he goes to
town. [Reads.] "Hortensia's compliments to Mr. Careless -- "


WISELY. Hortensia to him! [Aside.] Well, Sir,


BLUNT. Careless, how can you?


CARELESS. Psha! he is going to town; he will not obstruct me.


WISELY. No, truly, not I, Sir. -- Unless you put me in the way. [Aside.]


CARELESS. Hortensia's compliments to Mr. Careless; she thinks it vain to
attempt concealing an inclination which he has raised in her heart, and which
many circumstances must have already interpreted. She was at first alarmed at
Mr. Careless's unguarded temper, but expects from his good sense an absolute
silence, till every thing is concluded. You see, Blunt, she thinks differently
of my character from what you do. -- Ha! ha!


BLUNT. Weak, idle man!


CARELESS. She will meet him at Sir Philip Figurein's mask this evening: And,
in the mean time, desires he will hide -- from the world this declaration of
her heart, which the merit of Mr. Careless has extorted from her. There Is a
billet doux for you.


BLUNT. Well, you obey the lady's commands most admirably.


CARELESS. Don't be so cynical! -- This is among ourselves.


BLUNT. Among ourselves! -- Suppose Wisely was in love with her.


WISELY. I, Sir -- I -- the lady is very little known to me. -- I would not be
suspected for the world. [Aside.]


BLUNT. Po! I hate to see you play the fool thus. -- Wisely, let your man
deliver this letter for me. -- Careless, your servant.

Exit.
CARELESS. Fare you well, philosoper. -- Poor Blunt! he thinks I don't know how
to distinguish between men; but I can confide in you -- I know you are an
honest fellow.


WISELY. Oh, you may confide in me, I assure you, Sir. I have such an interest
now in this business, that I am heartily obliged to you for the intelligence.


CARELESS. Ay, I knew you would be glad to hear it. -- Well now, a'n't I a very
happy fellow? -- Ha! ha! -- This letter would be enough to break the heart of a
rival; to make him challenge me, fight me, kill me. -- Ha! ha!


WISELY. Why it is a serious business for a rival. [Forcing a laugh.]


CARELESS. Only think of my carrying off Hortensia at last! I think it would
gall you now, if you had been one of her many admirers.


WISELY. To be rejected by her, in whom beauty and good sense are still at
strife for pre-eminence -- to be discarded by her, it is enough to drive the
mind to madness -- that is, I should think so, if the lady had engaged my heart
-- Confusion! I had like to have detected myself. [Aside] -- But I am glad to
hear what you have told me.


CARELESS. Oh, I knew you would be glad of it. -- But now I have opened myself
to you, not a word for your life.


WISELY. I shall make a proper use of it -- rely upon me.


CARELESS. I am sure you will -- I read men now -- A propos, as you are going
to town, do me a slight favor: Here is a snuff box with her picture in it; I
let it fall last night upon the terras, and have damaged it a little. Prithee
leave it at Deard's as you go by, and order it to be mended.


WISELY. With all my heart; -- I take it with great pleasure.


CARELESS. Only cast your eye on her picture: -- How lovely!


WISELY. Charming indeed! -- Successful coxcomb! Aside.


CARELESS. Don't let a mortal see it.


WISELY. By no means.


CARELESS. You see the least hint will ruin me.

Enter a SERVANT.
SERVANT. Sir Philip Figurein, Sir, has sent to know if your honor will meet
him on the terras this morning?


CARELESS. I Will wait on him [ Exit Servant.] Will you come and take a turn with
the knight?


WISELY. I don't care if I do. I shall hardly set out till evening.


CARELESS. The knight will divert us. What an absurd passion has possessed him
in his old days! He is seventy, is not he?


WISELY. Not much short; and in high spirits still.


CARELESS. Spirits! with one foot in the grave, he dances about the world, as
if he was bit by a tarantula.


WISELY. Why dancing is his ruling passion.


CARELESS. So much, that he runs about to all the country assemblies, and is a
beau garcon with all human infirmities.


WISELY. He is very harmless and good-natured.


CARELESS. Yes; but not a single idea but what is derived from dancing. If you
ask him what sort of a place such a town is, "They have a very good
Monday-night assembly." Or, if you desire to know what kind of people, "They
very often dance thirty couple."


WISELY. You have him exactly.


CARELESS. Can you guess his business with me?


WISELY. No, really.


CARELESS. He is to have a masquerade at his own house tonight, and wants to
give me the invitation.


WISELY. Civil!


CARELESS. But his wife has been beforehand with him. -- Ha! ha! -- I could let
you into a secret about her. -- Ha! ha! -- You must not let a word transpire.
-- Ha! ha! -- I am pretty well with her.


WISELY. The devil you are! -- My own relation, and he is going to betray her.

[Aside.]
CARELESS. Yes; I am much in her good graces: And if hereafter you should see
the likeness of your humble servant in one of my lady Figurein's children, tip
me a smile, but keep your mind to yourself.


WISELY. How, in the name of wonder, do you manage to ingratiate yourself thus?


CARELESS. Step with me to my dressing room, and you shall know further
particulars. -- Ha! ha! -- This very night, when the mask inflames every spirit
to joy and revelry, and while Sir Philip is sacrificing to the graces, as he
calls it, her ladyship and I intend a sacrifice to the god of love.


WISELY. Thou art an happy fellow. -- But I hope I shall be able to counter-act
your designs. [Aside.]


CARELESS. But, my dear Wisely, not a syllable of all this.


WISELY. You may rely upon me.


CARELESS. Not the least hint about Hortensia.


WISELY. Not for the world.


CARELESS. Poor Blunt! he calls me the Marplot of my own schemes. -- Ha! ha! --
But you see I know who to confide in. -- I know who are my friends.

Exeunt.
SCENE the Terras. Enter LUCINDA and BELLFIELD. BELLFIELD. And so, my dear
Lucinda, you think you know your own mind so well, that you can answer for it,
I shall never have the rights of an husband over that pretty person of yours.


LUCINDA. No, never; positively never.


BELLFIELD. And, on my part, I positively pronounce that you will, one day or
other, make me the happy man.


LUCINDA. Pray, Mr. Bellfield, have you a patent for my inclinations? or do you
intend to lay violent hands upon a weak defenseless woman, and make me your own
by force of arms?


BELLFIELD. O fie! no force: -- like a good-natured general I invite you to
capitulate, rather than urge me to the necessity of carrying the town by storm.


LUCINDA. But I find the garrison still able to hold out. -- The citadel
[laying her hand on her heart] is still proof against all the artillery you
have played off. -- I think you have not been able to throw in much fire, Mr.
Bellfield.


BELLFIELD. Ha! ha! you little know that I have a secret friend in that very
citadel, that will betray the place to me.


LUCINDA. Indeed you flatter yourself; -- There is not a single sentiment, not
one desire or inclination here, that has ever whispered the smallest good word
in your favor.


BELLFIELD. Well, well, there is a little destiny in these matters -- that is
all.


LUCINDA. Destiny! and so your system in love-affairs is like that of certain
heroes in military matters. -- You think, I suppose, that every heart, like
every cannon-ball, has its billet.


BELLFIELD. Even so, madam. Nature, like a skilful bowler, delivers every heart
out of hand with a secret bias to its proper object.


LUCINDA. There is something agreeably impudent in the fellow's vanity. [Aside]
But you will allow that nature gives little secret antipathies too.


BELLFIELD. Oh, certainly! -- She delights in blending contradictions, in order
to embellish the fair, and give her the graces of variety. A sort of mosaic
work, where folly is inlaid with talents, a love of pleasure with virtue, a
power of pleasing with a delight in giving pain; and, as the poet says,

"Fixed principles with fancy ever new,
"Shakes all together, and produces you."

LUCINDA. Upon my word this is altogether a new way of making love: By
convincing me that you can with curious discernment spy out all the little
foibles of the fair, you think to recommend yourself to my notice. Have a care,
Mr. Bellfield, remember Apollo's sentence upon the critic who found out all the
faults in a celebrated poem: He laid before him a sack of wheat, and bid him
separate the chaff, which he gave him for his pains.


BELLFIELD. That, madam, was because the man was so unfortunate as to have no
relish for the beauties; whereas my admiration --


LUCINDA. Oh, Sir, you manage your admiration as certain prodigals do their
money; you grudge the smallest part to your neighbors, and squander all most
profusely on yourself: And therefore it is you have been entered in my black
list; let me see how long -- let me see [takes out a pocketbook] Ay, this is
it: [reads] A list of those I am determined not to marry. Let me see, Mr.
Worthless condemned May the nineteenth, 1762.


BELLFIELD. Worthless! what he that married the great fortune.


LUCINDA. And took on so prodigiously at her death. -- He made love to me while
he had weepers on for his deceased wife; and so I hated him for an impostor,
worse than Maria does Dr. Wolf, in the Nonjuror. -- But where are you, you
creature? "Lord Hazard." This was a man of rank, with a pale quality face, and
a genteel, enervated figure. I perceived by his passion for play, that the
queen of trumps was in his eyes the greatest beauty in the world; so I
acquainted his lordship that I had no further occasion for his services; and he
told his friends that he resigned.


BELLFIELD. Ha! ha! -- I see plainly I must be the man.

[Aside.]
LUCINDA. Where the deuce is your name? "More-love -- Ranger -- Dorimant --
Blackacre." -- Well, this Mr. Blackacre was a perfect curiosity: Instead of
saying civil things of my person, he talked of nothing but my estate, and
assured me when the present leases expired he would let the whole at an
improved rent.


BELLFIELD. Why such a fellow was fitter to be bailiff or steward of your manor.


LUCINDA. There was something handsome about him too; -- no, not handsome
neither -- I don't know how to describe him: A sort of symmetry of features,
and a faint bloom that made a comely kind of deformity. No symptoms of
sensibility; no expression of a feeling mind; and he appeared to me likely to
make that sort of husband, who has no manner of vice, gets up in a morning
regularly, eats his breakfast, looks over his accounts, goes to the
coffee-house, comes home to dinner, reads his letters, goes to the coffee-house
again, reads the evening-papers, comes home to supper, and goes to-bed. -- Ha!
ha!


BELLFIELD. Ha! ha! Why you give portraits in miniature as well as any painter
of them all.


LUCINDA. Ha! ha! I laugh whenever I think of the man. -- He brought me all the
news of the day.


BELLFIELD. Ay.


LUCINDA. Oh, all; but none that I valued; no news about the little victories
this figure obtained in the world; no advices of what was said about my last
new cap -- the happy arrangement of a patch; no intelligence about a particular
bloom of my complexion; never came with a We hear from Ranelagh that Lucinda's
eyes scattered death and torment among all the beaus last Friday-night. No, no
such thing; it was all political intelligence; and, being a favorite, I had it
warm from the mint. At ten in the morning, there was an action in Germany, and
the French lost ten thousand men upon the field of battle, three princes of the
blood, and five marshals of France. At twelve, the news was premature. At two,
an express was arrived at the secretary of state's. In the evening, the victory
was not so complete; and a noble lord was heard to say, that if a certain
general had done his duty, the balance of Europe would have been settled. At
night, the whole report was false, and there was no battle at all.


BELLFIELD. You would have had all the joys of dear variety with such an
husband.


LUCINDA. Oh, horrid! -- I told him at length, that I could not consider him in
the light of a lover; but that really he was a very good news-paper; and that
whenever he was out of hand, or not bespoke, I should be glad to be entertained
with the topic of the day. -- Ha! ha!


BELLFIELD. And so ordered your servants to take him in, instead of the
Chronicle, or Public Ledger. -- Ha! ha! -- By laughing at all her lovers, she
is determined to have me. [Aside.] -- Upon my soul, Lucinda, you have a very
pretty groupe of humourists.


LUCINDA. Enough to furnish our a comedy. -- The vain, the proud, the formal,
the brisk, every species of the ridiculous and absurd, has been my most
obedient, very humble servant. -- And here -- here is another character, to help
out the piece -- "Mr. Bellfield."


BELLFIELD. Well, let us hear.


LUCINDA. Condemned, August the sixteenth, 1763, for looking at himself in the
glass for a full half hour, while he was directing his discourse to me. There,
you are out-lawed for open rebellion against my beauty -- hold up your hand --
and what have you to say, why judgment of death should not pass upon you?


BELLFIELD. Why, I have your pardon in my pocket.


LUCINDA. Oh, to be sure, I, who claim homage from every pretty fellow, am
likely to forgive the disaffected person who disputes my title, and becomes a
vain pretender to it himself.


BELLFIELD. How can you talk thus, when you know I have worshipped you even to
idolatry, and have offered up prayers on my very knees to you?


LUCINDA. But I require true devotion in your prayers. Would it not provoke the
patience of a saint to have a well-powder'd fop kneel at his shrine, with a
"There Is a handsome fellow for you; mind my clothes, Brussels lace,
diamond-ring, saucy snuff box, and impudent face?" And this too under the
notion of asking a blessing.


BELLFIELD. My dear Lucinda, I never knew you so much out. Would not you have a
man go to his prayers with a good conscience? And what are the pleasures of a
good conscience? The applauses of one's own heart. -- Now, my dear ma'am, if,
when I approach you, I have some self-approving airs, am not I therefore the
better entitled to you?


LUCINDA. Heavens! I am frightened at you. -- You are a free-thinker in love:
-- Preach this doctrine to the ladies, and they will call it downright heresy.


BELLFIELD. Very like. But surely, were I to make my advances with darts, and
flames, and Cupid, and Venus, and the Graces, I should be a mere uninstructed
pagan. Whe^eas, at present, I only want to discard superstition, and idle
ceremonials, and so establish the true system of love.


LUCINDA. Which you take to consist in --


BELLFIELD. In the language of the heart. -- As instance -- I love you, shall
study your happiness, and so let me call the parson.


LUCINDA. Easy and impudent! -- But love's religion is a sort of popery, and
requires penance, and fasting, and watching, and that you should pray for
favors in a language almost unintelligible. -- But you say your prayers in the
vulgar tongue: "And so let me call the parson." Why you might as well come most
cavalierly to my house, take possession of an arm chair, and, Here, bring me my
nightgown and slippers.


BELLFIELD. And as all the sighs, and verses, and fine things of lovers, must
end in that, you had better wave ceremony; for as to Careless, though you may
think you have hold of his heart --


LUCINDA. Careless! -- I desire you will never mention him. -- Careless! -- A
senseless wretch! -- A vile inconstant! -- who abandons me as if age had
suddenly rendered me loathlome.


BELLFIELD. Why, faith, though I detest the treachery, I cannot, upon this
occasion, quarrel with the traitor.


LUCINDA. Oh, Sir, I dare say you applaud his conduct; and would like him
declare, that I might pass very well for a mistress, to toy an hour with, and
must shortly come to that. -- But for a wife -- oh, shocking!


BELLFIELD. Has he dared talk thus, Lucinda?


LUCINDA. Even to the lowest wretch on earth; to that fellow, La Jeunesse, who
dressed my hair about half an hour ago. -- Oh, if my brother were in England,
he should find I do not want a friend to assert my honor.


BELLFIELD. By Heaven, I Will do it, this very day, myself. -- Now you shall have
proof of the sincerity with which I love. -- Pronounce me unworthy of you, if
your wrongs are not redressed within this hour.

Exit.
LUCINDA. Yet, why should vexation thus get the better of me! -- Mr. Bellfield
gone! Heavens! he talked something of calling this base man to an account.

I hope he will not be mad enough to think of such a thing. -- So, so, Mr.
Careless coming this way. -- I will not even condescend to upbraid him with his
baseness. -- I Will swear, I could almost find in my heart to throw myself into
Bellfield's arms, to pique the wretch!

Exit.
Enter CARELESS and WISELY. CARELESS. Ha! ha! is not he a ridiculous character?


WISELY. Yes; something singular in his way.


CARELESS. Poor Sir Philip! -- A passion for dancing when the use of his limbs
has almost left him. -- I am glad we have got rid of him. -- Ha! ha! --
'Sdeath, here he comes again, with St. Vitus strong upon him.


Enter Sir PHILIP FIGUREIN. SIR PHILIP. [In a minuet step.] I forgot to tell
you, Careless, I forgot to tell you, [sinks gently and rises] and you too, Mr.
Wisely, I forgot to tell you both, that I am to have a masked ball at my house
to night. [Hums a Minuet.]


CARELESS. I am much obliged to you, Sir Philip; but your lady has been
beforehand with you, and has done me the honor of an invitation.


SIR PHILIP. Has she? [turning out his toes.] -- I recollet now -- she told me
so -- you intend to -- la loll loll -- you intend to come, I hope -- la loll
loll.


CARELESS. By all means, Sir Philip; I shall wait upon my lady.


SIR PHILIP. [Advancing in a minuet step to Careless.] We shall be all gaiety,
joy, and activity of spirit. -- Mr. Wisely, [in a minuet step to him] I say,
Mr. Wisely, [turns out his toes, sinks and rises] I say, I hope, Sir, you
intend us the honor.


WISELY. I am afraid I cannot have that happiness; I am bound for London, Sir.


SIR PHILIP. Po! po! prithee, man, stay this night; be in at the diversions
with your friends.


WISELY. I have not your spirits, Sir Philip; I must beg to be excused. -- I am
not so young a man as you are.


SIR PHILIP. Why, considering all, I am pretty young: [throws back his
shoulders, and turns out his toes.] All owing to the exercise I take. -- I
dance three thousand miles a year.


WISELY. So much!


CARELESS. Ay, and more. -- Why he goes to all the assemblies within thirty
miles round London.


SIR PHILIP. [Turning his arms in and out.] Yes, I go to all: I call it
sacrificing to the graces. Socrates the philosopher called it so before me. He
sacrificed to the graces at threescore.


WISELY. I should like to have seen the old philosopher turning out his toes.


SIR PHILIP. [Turns out his toes, and hums a tune.] The old philosopher, Sir,
loved the elegant arts. And there was Scaliger a man of great learning, and an
eminent critic -- he danced a Pyrrhic dance -- a dance well known to the
ancients, Mr. Careless. -- Scaliger, Sir, danced a Pyrrhic dance, to the
astonishment of all Germany. We have his own word for it.


WISELY. And well they might be astonished!


SIR PHILIP. Why so, Sir? why so?


CARELESS. Very true, knight, why so? -- It Is a noble exercise.


SIR PHILIP. Give me your hand for that.

[Advances to him in a minuet step, and takes his hand gracefully.] A noble
exercise, indeed! it gives the graceful display of the limbs -- a free carriage
-- and a -- [sinks and rises.] Pray -- pray, Careless, -- pray do you know Miss
Charlotte Cherry?


CARELESS. She is the youngest daughter, is not she?


SIR PHILIP. The same; turned of fourteen years; just now in her fifteenth; and
the sweetest face, prettiest feet, and the finest here -- the finest chest; --
coming forward -- coming forward charmingly. I danced with her at the last
assembly at Sunning-hill.


CARELESS. Well done, knight.


SIR PHILIP. Hey, lads! was not it bold to undertake her so young? -- I can
match Hercules for labor in a country-dance. I began the minuets with my lady
Portsoken: -- A fine, comely, responsible woman is my lady Portsoken -- moves a
minuet like a cathedral. -- Indeed a slight accident happened to me.


CARELESS. Ay; what was that?


SIR PHILIP. Why, Sir, in the harmonious movement under the great branch in the
middle of the room, an unlucky hook took a fancy to my wig -- I lost the
honors of my head, Sir; they were suspended in air, and I moved through my
minuet, quite insensible of the disaster.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! my dear knight, an unlucky accident.


SIR PHILIP. Oh, no; nothing -- I did not mind it; a few lampoons, epigrams,
and little lutestring verses for the summer-season, flew about: I danced on --
they could not put me out of time. One of the smart sonneteers of the place
charged the accident home upon me; and in pretty Namby Pamby called it the Rape
of the Lock. The feet of his verse might be very good, but my feet were never
the worse. I laughed, and answered him out of Horace, Nunc pede libero pulsanda
tellus.


CARELESS. Admirable! an excellent repartee!


WISELY. So it was. -- A propos, Sir Philip, I never wished you joy upon your
daughter's marriage.


SIR PHILIP. You do me honor, my dear Sir, you do me honor. -- Poor girl! --
heigh ho! -- poor Harriet! -- She did not live long.


WISELY. No! I beg your pardon for mentioning. --


SIR PHILIP. She has been dead these three months. [Sinks and rises.] Yes, Sir,
[goes to him in a minuet step] my poor daughter was not fond of exercise -- she
did not take to her dancing -- it was the death of her.


WISELY. I am very sorry for it; especially as it seems to grieve you so much.


SIR PHILIP. Ay, poor girl! [turning out his toes, and adjusting his arms] she
died in Wiltshire.


CARELESS. At your own house, I suppose.


SIR PHILIP. No; that house was sold long before, to the highest bidder, before
a master in Chancery, to pay some of my wife's gaming debts. You know she is
addicted to play. [Turning out his toes.] It is the worst passion in the world.


WISELY. You had a beautiful seat there.


SIR PHILIP. Pleasantly situated, Sir. -- You were near the assembly at
Salisbury, the assembly at Winchester, and the assembly at Southampton.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! that was convenient; ha! Wisely.


WISELY. Ay, very convenient.


SIR PHILIP. Yes; and the estate was much improved of late: For my friend
George Martin, of Southampton, who is a very facetious companion, and tells an
admirable story, has built a set of rooms, in the sweetest situation imaginable.


CARELESS. They have a fine country about there, have not they?


SIR PHILIP. I have seen them dance thirty couple.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! and did not it grieve you to leave so sweet a place?


SIR PHILIP. No, Sir; nothing grieves me; I dance away my cares: I have no head
for thought and trouble, and calculation and accounts. I make my career as
brilliant as possible; and whenever any thing begins in the least to chagrin
me, I then go to an assembly, and sacrifice to the graces.


CARELESS. Well, I challenge the world for such another philosopher.


SIR PHILIP. I call myself a peripatetic philosopher. -- I go about for the
serenity of my mind. -- I had a letter yesterday from my attorney to meet him
on Monday next, at the Mitre tavern in Fleet Street, in order to sign deeds of
lease and release for a small estate in Berkshire, a little out at elbows; but
I have appointed him to meet me at the Long Room at Hampstead.


CARELESS. Why there? that is an odd place.


SIR PHILIP. The best in the world; because, when the business is finished, I
can then go and give right hand and left at the assembly.


WISELY. But I am sorry your estates are dancing away in this manner. -- It
will be a little hard upon your children. -- And then there is your daughter;
she is a very fine girl.


SIR PHILIP. She lives with her aunt Scatterbrain.


WISELY. Where is your eldest son?


SIR PHILlP. Reduced upon half-pay.


WISELY. And your second son?


SIR PHILIP. Gone a clerk to the East Indies.


WISELY. And my little favorite, your third boy?


SIR PHILIP. At school at Stockbridge. -- He Will be a scholar.


CARELESS. Vive la dance! Sir Philip.


SIR PHILIP. Ay, Sir, Vive la dance. -- Well, you will be at the ball tonight.
-- Wisely, I am sorry we are to lose you, -- [Moves in a minuet step to
Careless.] Careless, you will not fail. -- Nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus. -- --
La loll loll.

Exit in a minuet step.
CARELESS and WISELY. Ha! ha! ha!


CARELESS. Was ever so ridiculous a fellow? -- No care, no management, no
attention. -- I wish he had a little of my prudence to mind the main chance;
hey, Wisely!


WISELY. Your prudence would be of singular use to him indeed.


CARELESS. My dear friend, adieu! not a word of Hortensia; nor of my lady
Figurein.


WISELY. Oh, my dear Careless --


CARELESS. I Will let you know by a line how I succeed with them both. -- Adieu!

Now for the schemes on which we are both intent:

I for the widow's charms.

Exit.
WISELY. I to prevent.

Exit.
END of the FIRST ACT. ACT II.
Enter WISELY and BRAZEN. WISELY. NO, Brazen, I shall not leave Windsor today.


BRAZEN. No, your honor!


WISELY. No; I have business upon my hands of the highest importance. -- Look
ye, Brazen, I have ever found you trusty and honest.


BRAZEN. Why truly, without vanity, I may say, you have no reason to complain.


WISELY. No speeches, Brazen. -- I will now repose a confidence in you. -- I
have found out my rival.


BRAZEN. So much the better, Sir: -- I love an active campaign; -- order me
upon any attempt; I am ready to annoy the enemy. -- Who is he?


WISELY. Careless.


BRAZEN. What, the gentleman I heard you speak of so often?


WISELY. The same.


BRAZEN. Joy, Sir, joy -- I give you joy -- victory is ours.


WISELY. Why, yes, I think I am a bad general, and you a bad officer, if we
don't defeat him.


BRAZEN. I saw him as he walked down, street yesterday evening. -- Comely,
well-proportion'd, and handsome, I think.


WISELY. Slave! villain!

[Collars him.]
BRAZEN. For heaven's sake, don't strangle me!


WISELY. Puppy! rascal! he handsome!


BRAZEN. That is, Sir -- if you will but press more tenderly on my windpipe --
that is to say, Sir -- not quite so hard -- the gentleman seems, at a distance
-- a little too tight still, Sir -- but when you come nearer -- a little looser
-- that will do -- enough of all conscience -- when you are near him, Sir, he
looks quite another thing, and very unpromising.


WISELY. What am I doing? the rage of jealousy --

[lets him go.]
BRAZEN. Dear heart, he will be nothing in our hands.


WISELY. How could she prefer that vain, imprudent -- Have you no plan, rascal,
to counterplot this happy rival?


BRAZEN. Only reflect upon what you expect of me: -- To stop the course of a
river, or a bird in the air, or a lawyer at Westminster, or thunder and
lightning, or a poet repeating his own verses, or a critic abusing them, or --
in short, Sir, any of these things is easier than to silence a coxcomb of wit
and parts.


WISELY. Of wit and parts, sirrah!


BRAZEN. Of no parts -- a coxcomb of no parts.


WISELY. Leave prating, and propose something directly.


BRAZEN. With submission, I am but a poor ingenious good clever kind of fellow,
who pretend to little more than a tolerable share of mother-sense, to obey the
happier talents of my master.


WISELY. Oh, Hortensia! to give him this tender token -- your own picture in
snuff box here. -- And then to send me this cruel letter of dismission!
[Reads.] To encourage your addresses any longer would be the sign of a vain and
ungenerous way of thinking. Distraction! [Reads.] "Never can be yours.
Hortensia." -- What can be done? -- There Is one bold stroke left: -- Brazen, I
must depend upon your execution of a bright project, conceived this instant.


BRAZEN. I wait but your commands, Sir.


WISELY. I know you faithful and dextrous. -- You have not been long enough at
Windsor to be known by any body. -- Hey! is not that Hortensia yonder, walking
this way, arm in arm with Lucinda? -- I Will found a retreat, like a prudent
general, and send you to skirmish with the enemy, Brazen. -- This way -- follow
me.


BRAZEN. And I Will bring on a general action, I warrant me.

Exeunt.
Enter LUCINDA and HORTENSIA. LUCINDA. My dear Hortensia, that is carrying it
too far -- you grow captious -- there is no harm in a little raillery, sure.


HORTENSIA. But will not you allow me to be deeper in my own secrets than any body
else?


LUCINDA. No, by no means; we are all very ingenious in deceiving ourselves:
Our passions wear so many cunning disguises, we hardly know them. -- Spleen
shall pass for wit, avarice (...) ^^onomy; and the love of a man shall often be
thought a mere female vanity, in hearing the praises of a shape or a feature.


HORTENSIA. So that if I suffer a civil thing from a pretty fellow, the
pleasure I find from the compliment makes a quick transition to a liking of the
man.


LUCINDA. Instantly, and almost imperceptibly to ourselves. And when we think
we are putting him off, with our arts of cold delay, it is at the bottom but
mere coquetry, to draw him on the more. Like playing with edge tools, till we
cut ourselves.


HORTENSIA. Still I am not wounded.


LUCINDA. I'II lay you a pot of coffee you are married before me.


HORTENSIA. You Will lose. -- There is nothing in my conduct that can --


LUCINDA. I beg your pardon: -- There is in you serious people a sedate love of
pleasure that we giddy creatures never come up to. We receive slight
impressions, and slight impressions chatter away, and evaporate in the whirl of
our fancy. Now you demure ones dwell upon what gains access to your hearts; and
then your thoughts are like what they tell me of white powder: -- They make no
noise, but are full of mischief.


HORTENSIA. This is very strange. -- But let me assure you, I have not forgot
my poor deceased husband.


LUCINDA. Ay; but that tender melancholy will so dispose your mind to receive
the kindred passion of love, that I should not wonder if -- in short, grief is
very amorous, my dear.


HORTENSIA. Mighty fine! -- But the man who makes me sacrifice my liberty must
have an extraordinary merit.


LUCINDA. There again now! -- Another of the masquerade habits our passions
wear: -- When you are in love with a man's person, you fancy it is a refined
esteem for his merit. -- Oh, Hortensia! under that illusion the heart of a
woman will soften and melt prodigiously. -- Do you think it possible to have a
lasting esteem for a man, merely on the score of his merit?


HORTENSIA. Surely; is not it natural to love virtue?


LUCINDA. Why, to speak a plain truth, which I would not have a man hear from
me for the world, whims, passions, and desires, are the ground-works of our
minds; and virtue, I am afraid, is but in-laid.


HORTENSIA. O fie, Lucinda!


LUCINDA. O fie, hypocrite!


HORTENSIA. Pray now let me ask you, have you no esteem for Mr. Careless?


LUCINDA. A propos! I forgot to tell you -- well, I adore my ease on this
occasion! -- Sure every thing is at an end between me and that gentleman.


HORTENSIA. You amaze me! -- Was not the wedding day fixed?


LUCINDA. Yes; I was under sentence of matrimony: -- but he has sent me a
reprieve.


HORTENSIA. Can it be possible?


LUCINDA. He is going to be married to another.


HORTENSIA. You astonish me! -- She does not suspect me. [Aside.] -- Going to
be married to another! -- No woman of delicacy would hearken to him,
considering how far matters have been carried with you.


LUCINDA. Why, if there is any lady really smitten, the dispute between her
love and her delicacy will not last long. -- Delicacy may talk of nice points
of honor; but that will only reach the head: While every syllable from that
little urchin Love will make its way directly to the heart; and while Delicacy
is reading lectures, Love will persuade, and so the business is over. -- But
pray, my dear, had not you heard this before?


HORTENSIA. I, my dear? -- I hope he has not divulged any thing. [Aside.] --
How can you ask such a question? -- I am not in a course of towntalk.


LUCINDA. Why, I don't know -- one is always saying one silly thing or another.
-- Let Us change the subject; the man is not worth a moment's thought: his
indiscretion is the smallest of his faults. -- My rest shall not suffer a single
wink for him.


HORTENSIA. That Is right, Lucinda; give me your hand, and take my advice: -- If
the false man deserts you, show yourself a girl of spirit on the occasion. --
The wretch is not worth a single smile from any of our sex; -- an idle, vain
boaster! -- to trust him is taking up water with a sieve. -- So resolve at once
to look down with scorn both on him, and the vain beauty that prides herself in
the conquest: -- Wish her joy of her bargain, my dear, and think no more about
him.


Enter BRAZEN, in a livery. BRAZEN. Madam Hortensia, my master presents his
compliments --


HORTENSIA. Careless's livery! [Aside.] -- Who is your master?


BRAZEN. Mr. Careless.


LUCINDA. Mr. Careless!


BRAZEN. My master sends you word, Ma'am, that he has changed his mind. -- Upon
consulting his heart, he finds his inclinations fixed elsewhere -- upon madam
Lucinda, this lady here. -- I endeavored, Ma'am, to soften his hard heart: --
"Will Not you consider, Sir, that Hortensia -- " Hold your tongue, you rascal --
do as I bid you; and so off he brushed, to the tune of an old song, [sings] One
kiss of a maid's worth two of a window.


LUCINDA. Ho! ho! ho! -- This is worth all the discoveries of all the
philosophers for a thousand years. -- This is the most whimsical accident. --
Ha! ha!


HORTENSIA. Fool that I was! [Aside.] -- Who bribed you, Sir, to be guilty of
this rudeness? -- Lucinda, I assure you --


LUCINDA. My dear Hortensia -- Ho! ho! ho!


HORTENSIA. Nay, if you will not give me have to speak -- Begone! fellow, this
moment! I know nothing of your master.


LUCINDA. Well, I forgive him all: -- this is a most charming business. -- And
so, Hortensia, you are the happy lady --


HORTENSIA. I assure you, Ma'am -- Go about your business, Sir.


BRAZEN. It Is very well; but before I go, permit me to return this snuff box,
with your picture in it.


LUCINDA. So, so, so! presents have passed too.


BRAZEN. "Here, carry her back her snuff box," says he, and as I have damaged
it a little, if she will get it mended, I Will pay for it.


LUCINDA. Ho! ho! ho! -- I shall die, I shall die.


HORTENSIA. Vexation! -- this absurd man!


BRAZEN. Any commands for my master, madam?


HORTENSIA. Let me hear no more of your insolence, Sir.


BRAZEN. What shall I say to poor Mr. Careless? -- no parting pang? no kind
adieu?


HORTENSIA. Tell him he is a villain! a perfidious wretch! a monster of
ingratitude!


BRAZEN. Ay, I know him well: -- he is all that, and worse. -- Well done,
Brazen! this will do rarely.

Exit
LUCINDA. My dear Madam, you will excuse me; -- but if my life depended upon it,
I cannot help laughing.


HORTENSIA. You need not triumph on the occasion: You are welcome to the
gentleman.


LUCINDA. No doubt. -- The man that insinuates himself into your good graces
must have an extraordinary merit.


HORTENSIA. Mighty well! -- If you must run on --


LUCINDA. Besides, you have not as yet forgot your poor deceased husband.


HORTENSIA. This raillery is unseasonable, madam.


LUCINDA. Well now, do you know, that I was weak enough to suppose, that no
woman of delicacy, [stifles a laugh] considering how far things had been
carried with me --

[laughs out.]
HORTENSIA. Oh, shame! shame! All my ill stars combined --


LUCINDA. Come, come, give me your hand, Hortensia; if the false man deserts
you, show your self a woman of spirit on the occasion.


HORTENSIA. Oh, insupportable!

[breaks away.]
LUCINDA. [Following her.] To trust him is taking up water with a sieve; and so
look down with scorn on him, and the vain beauty -- Ho! ho!

[laughs heartily.]
HORTENSIA. I sha'n't stay to be insulted.

Exit
LUCINDA. And has your Aeneas left you? [looking after her] poor disconsolate
Dido! -- Oh! I shall expire with laughing. -- Well, I feel my heart much
lighter. -- Certainly revenge is the ruling passion of the female breast; it is
the second passion at least. -- But stay, stay, stay -- what is to be done? --
Shall I, to complete my triumph, marry Careless? -- Why, Revenge says so -- but
Love slily whispers, have not you a secret tender for Mr. Bellfield? -- I don't
know what to say to that -- let me examine myself on that head: -- How say you,
my heart? [laying her hand on her bosom] you shall true answer make to all such
questions as shall be asked you: -- The traitor owns its various flutterings.
-- Eyes, how say you, do you know Mr. Bellfield? -- We have seen the gentleman.
-- But is that all? remember you're upon oath: Have not you indulged in many a
stolen glance? -- -- Soft seducers, they own it all. -- Lips, what do you know
of this matter? -- Why, the gentleman has rudely forced a kiss. -- Rudely!
come, don't equivocate: Did not you think it civilly done? And when you uttered
words of reproach, were ye not pleased with the touch of his? -- Guilty -- They
plead guilty. What say my hands? When he has drawn a glove on you, [looking at
one hand] or gently clasped you [looking at the other] to lead me to my chair
-- Ah! those tremblings were the anxieties of love. -- Ears, -- Oh! they were
pleased with the accents of his flattery. -- I must call no more witnesses, for
fear every circumstance should plead a'gainst me. -- But what resolution must I
come to? -- Hortensia will be so piqu'd should I marry Careless -- and so will
Careless should I marry Bellfield -- One match has been talked of -- so has
the other -- I have coquetted on this side -- so I have on that. -- I Am in a fine
condition: -- Revenge and Love have got poor weak woman's will between them,
and they beat it about like a shuttlecock -- to and fro -- backwards and
forwards -- tick-tack, tick-tack -- and on which side it will fall, Fate only
knows.


Enter BELLFIELD. BELLFIELD. My dear Lucinda --


LUCINDA. Psha! why did not he stay till the game was out? -- I don't know what
to say to the wretch. -- Well, have you buried him?


BELLFIELD. I am glad to see you in a bantering vein.


LUCINDA. Why, is not he dead? -- O fie! to let a man breathe a moment under my
displeasure!


BELLFIELD. Madam, before this day closes --


LUCINDA. But I have changed my mind -- I give him his wretched life; -- let
him drag a miserable being, in torment.


BELLFIELD. And must I too wear out a life in torment? -- Come, come, pronounce
one favorable word.


LUCINDA. Why, you unlucky thing, what brought you so unseasonably? -- You
broke off a violent debate about yourself.


BELLFIELD. About me?


LUCINDA. Yes; my head and my heart were at open war about you. But you would
not stay to let them fight in out. -- Well, I Will retire to solitude, and let
them go to cuffs again; and so now you will give yourself up to melancholy and
peevishness. And my character, I dare say, will be cruelly torn to pieces.


BELLFIELD. Madam, your character --


LUCINDA. Is a strange one. -- I know that is what you will say -- Or, perhaps, a
few scraps and ends of verse: Most women have no character at all.


BELLFIELD. Po! po! cannot you restrain one moment?


LUCINDA. "Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear, -- "


BELLFIELD. 'Sdeath! this is all --


LUCINDA. "And best distinguished by black, brown, and fair."


BELLFIELD. Nay, prithee, how can you rack me thus? -- This is all wildness,
all extravagance of spirit.


LUCINDA. Well! well! my spirits, as the heyday of youth wears away, will be
duly restrained, as flowers contract themselves at the setting-sun.


BELLFIELD. If you go on thus, your follies will increase with your years, and
show more strikingly as your beauty declines, as shadows lengthen with the
setting-sun.


LUCINDA. Satirical Bellfield! -- But you should not have said that to my face:
-- You might have staid till my back was turned, to spare my blushes. -- Well,
I am gone. -- Think favorably of me. -- Ha! ha! -- Poor Bellfield!

Exit.
BELLFIELD. Think favorably! -- I shall think no more of you. -- You may as
well fix quicksilver as a woman's mind. -- It takes a thousand shapes to elude
you. -- Careless has fixed her though: -- Challenge him, and perhaps -- the
thing does not admit a moment's delay.

Exit.
Re-enter LUCINDA. LUCINDA. This is charming! -- Careless comes this way, as I
could wish: -- His behavior will decide my doubts. -- How shall I act? -- Oh!
a girl of spirit need never think how to manage a man.


Enter CARELESS. CARELESS. Lucinda, without her train of beaus fluttering about
her! -- How has this happened pray?


LUCINDA. Why, you frighten them all away from me; and you know, though fruit
be ever so fine, if a scarecrow is near, the birds will not nibble.


CARELESS. Well, thou art the veriest coquette that ever studied the exercise
of the fan.


LUCINDA. Scandalous wretch!


CARELESS. A lover with you has as bad a time as a poor animal in a
philosopher's air-pump: -- When your false refinements are too thin for him to
subsist upon, they are rendered somewhat more substantial by letting in a
little air of commonsense, that you may have the pleasure of ratifying all away
again; and so leave a poor deluded fellow panting for his existence.


LUCINDA. Why, I like to try experiments upon 'em. -- But, Mr. Careless, you
tried the most admirable experiment today that ever yet was thought of. -- Ha!
ha! -- I must laugh with you, though you don't deserve it. -- Never was any thing
so charming.


CARELESS. Another of your wild flights now -- why, you mount like a pheasant
-- whur!


LUCINDA. And do you vainly hope to bring me down?


CARELESS. The gun of wit may reach you. -- Take care.


LUCINDA. But the laws of Parnassus for the preservation of the game don't
allow such as you to shoot flying. -- But I must tell you how it was -- Ho! ho!
-- I enjoyed her distress beyond measure.


CARELESS. I am perfectly in a wood here.


LUCINDA. Your servant played his part admirably, and she so bit her lips with
vexation.


CARELESS. What the deuce has she taken into her head?


LUCINDA. "Tell him he is a villain!" says she, a perfidious wretch! a monster
of ingratitude!


CARELESS. Unriddle, pray; what is all this?


LUCINDA. Why, don't you know?


CARELESS. Not I, truly.


LUCINDA. Oh! you have changed your mind perhaps! -- Or, have you seen her
since, and made it up?


CARELESS. May I never have the fan of an incensed beauty raised to my throat;
if I understand one word of the matter.


LUCINDA. Oh, very well, Sir. -- I could almost have found in my heart to smile
upon you: -- But, go on; -- dissemble, do: -- Mr. Bellfield may fare the better
for your behavior, I promise you.


CARELESS. Oh, Ma'am, as to that -- Ha! ha!


LUCINDA. Pretend to laugh too! -- But no woman will speak to you at the rate
you go on.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! -- You are very diverting! -- I could tell you, perhaps, of
a much-envied lady, who -- ha! ha! -- who sees me in a favorable light.


LUCINDA. Impossible! -- You will be despised, rejected.


CARELESS. [Laughing conceitedly.] Well, well, I Will tell you who the lady is,
and then you shall judge whether I --


Enter Sir PHILIP, HORTENSIA, and BLUNT. SIR PHILIP. [Still in a minuet step.]
Careless, well met again. -- Lucinda, my fair partner, my lovely little
Hercules in a country-dance!


LUCINDA. Always in spirits, Sir Philip. -- Now let us see how my gentleman and
the widow will behave.

[Aside]
HORTENSIA. He has been flirting with that coquette, I see.

[Aside.]
CARELESS. I must not pretend to know Hortensia. -- She Is upon the discreet
plan, I see.

[Aside.]
LUCINDA. They don't take notice of one another: -- But I Will embarrass them
both. [Aside.] -- Oh! Mr. Blunt, I am so lucky that you and this company came
to my relief -- Your friend Careless has so pestered me with his fulsome
flattery, and his tender pain, and his pleasing anguish, and all the nonsense
of love --


CARELESS. I, Ma'am! -- The conversation seemed to have, taken a very different
turn.


LUCINDA. Oh, you hideous man! do you deny it? -- Hortensia, such a scene you
never saw.


HORTENSIA. I dare say, Ma'am, [forcing a laugh] it was at once both very
acceptable, and very ridiculous.


LUCINDA. The wretch was down on his knees to me, heart-broken, sighing,
trembling, tears in his eyes, venting a thousand protestations that he loved
me, and only me.


CARELESS. Nay, now, Lucinda, you wrong me.


LUCINDA. Wrong you! why are you ashamed of your passion for a fine woman?


SIR PHILIP. Refuse to be his partner at Sunning-hill next Monday-night for
that.


LUCINDA. So I will, Sir Philip -- you and I will dance. -- He actually vowed,
Hortensia, that there is a certain lady who pines and languishes for him: But
Death's life with me, without me death to live.


HORTENSIA. False, perfidious man!

[Aside.]
CARELESS. Nay, now, this is carrying the jest too far,


LUCINDA. Then I resign you -- I here give you up to any lady that pleases. --
What say you, Madam?


HORTENSIA. You are much worthier of the gentleman, and so pray keep him.


CARELESS. Discreetly answered. -- She will not give the least hint.

[ Aside to Blunt.]
SIR PHILIP. For that matter, I think ye both, Ladies, highly worthy of my
friend Careless: -- For you are two as good romps in a country-dance as I ever
desire to cast off and figure in with. -- I think one of you should take the
gentleman out.


LUCINDA. For my part, I Am engaged. -- Shall I make interest for you, Ma'am?


HORTENSIA. The character the gentleman bears, and the light you have made him
appear in, are sufficient to warn a woman of prudence against so dangerous a
risk.


CARELESS. Blessngs on her discretion and good-sense for abusing me so. [Aside]
Blunt, you see she will not give the smallest suspicion of what is depending. --
I Will throw my mite into the scale, to convince her of my prudence.


SIR PHILIP. Come, come, Careless, be brisk; -- something in your own defense;
-- don't be out of time.


CARELESS. I must do the lady the justice to say, that I have not the happiness
or merit of deserving a place in her good graces.


HORTENSIA. You own it, false man, do you?

[Aside.]
LUCINDA. And are you insensible to the lady's superior beauty, and that
distinguished prudence with which she moves so orderly in every sphere of life?


CARELESS. Prudence! -- Why, faith, prudence may be a very useful qualification
in trade, and may answer the purposes of a mercer upon Ludgate Hill, or a
money-scrivener in the city. -- But I wish may die if I have not always thought
prudence the most frigid virtue a person of fashion can be possessed of.


HORTENSIA. I dare say you think so.

[Aside.]
LUCINDA. Ho! ho!


CARELESS. I do it well, don't I, Blunt?


SIR PHILIP. It is in life as in dancing: -- Every thing should be done with
briskness and activity of spirit.


CARELESS. [ To Blunt.] That little satire upon prudence will show how much I
have myself.


BLUNT. Weak, inconsiderate fool!

[Aside]
SIR PHILIP. Careless is right. [Sinks and rises.] I should be sorry to have it
said that prudence is my most shining quality. -- But, I don't know how it is
-- we don't make a good set here -- it looks as if we had some of the little
fraca's of love amongst us.


LUCINDA. I am not in love with any of the company, I promise you.


HORTENSIA. And if I am, may I be married to the wretch for my punishment.


CARELESS. A sly inuendo, Blunt. -- And as to me, if I felt a single symptom of
love, so far from concealing it, I did not care if it was the whole talk of
every party at cards and scandal throughout the city of London, and liberty of
Westminster.


HORTENSIA. That I do verily believe.

[Aside]
CARELESS. You see, Blunt, I have no management. -- Ha! ha!


HORTENSIA. Laughed at too! -- I have not patience. -- Come, Lucinda, it draws
near dinnertime.


LUCINDA. Why, yes, I think we had as good adjourn. -- We'll leave you to
divulge all the secrets you know, Mr. Careless. -- Ha! ha!


SIR PHILIP. Are you going, Ladies? -- I must be your knight errant: -- Favor
me with your hand. -- Careless -- Blunt -- you will be at the mask in good time.
-- I attend you, Ma'am.

Exit with Hortensia and Lucinda.
BLUNT. Bravo! Careless you will undo yourself: You have abused the lady's
distinguishing perfection to her face.


CARELESS. To deceive the company -- a stroke of judgment and discretion.


BLUNT. But she seemed to speak with acrimony.


CARELESS. Oh! I adored her for that. -- She Is a charming woman; and a word of
abuse out of her mouth is worth all the praises of the rest of her sex. -- Ha!
ha! -- It was the luckiest interview! -- and gave me the finest opportunity of
shining! -- Ha! ha! -- She carried it off finely too.

When women praise, their passions gently move;
But if they rail, then with a rage they love.

END of the SECOND ACT. ACT III.
Enter BELLFIELD and WISELY. BELLFIELD. I NEVER saw your spirits so depressed
before, Wisely. -- Sure something extraordinary has happened.


WISELY. No, nothing -- a transient gloom; that is all.


BELLFIELD. Never let any thing affect your spirits, man. -- A cross accident
is never converted into an advantage by being peevish: Just the reverse; by
suffering inwardly, every little trifle acquires the force of a real
misfortune. -- My dear Wisely, do as I do; laugh to scorn all the little
perverse circumstances of life.


WISELY. They fall as lightly on me as on any body, I believe.


BELLFIELD. I can perceive you hurt even now: -- There Is something working in
your mind.


WISELY. You are quite mistaken, Bellfield.


BELLFIELD. What if a mistress frown -- cannot you smile for all that?


WISELY. I have no mistress, Sir.


BELLFIELD. Nay, I cannot say how that is. -- But it diverts me of all things to
see a man, because an untoward beauty is insensible of his merit, become
insensible of it himself, and sit in company wrapped in a cloud of vapors,
when he ought to make the caprices of the sex sport for himself and every body
else too.


WISELY. Very true; and should Lucinda's love, or her understanding, have a
relapse, I dare say --


BELLFIELD. I should not like to lose her; but I could laugh at the loss.


WISELY. Then it will not grieve you to hear, that Careless and she are well
together again.


BELLFIELD. Oh, no such thing -- you are misinformed. -- He has revolted from
Lucinda; and the widow is "the Cynthia of this hour" with him.


WISELY. What intelligence you lovers have! -- Every thing is finally concluded
between him and Lucinda. -- Ha! ha! -- He Is a weak, absurd fellow. -- But I beg
yout pardon -- it does not seem to divert you


BELLFIELD. [Forcing a laugh.] It shall not disconcert me, you may assure yourself
-- She Is as changeable as the wind, -- and he is a weathercock. -- Ha! ha! -- I
don't mind it. -- Ha! ha! -- This very morning she was enraged, and wanted me
to cut his throat.


WISELY. And this very evening she would wish you hanged if you had. -- Ha! ha! --
They have both very strange humors, faith.


BELLFIELD. And you have an odd kind of significant dry laugh with you. -- You
seem to enjoy my misfortune.


WISELY. Misfortune! -- I thought you --


BELLFIELD. Psha! no, not misfortune -- but my disappointment -- not
disappointment neither, for these things are to be expected from the levity of
her mind. -- A fantastical, deceitful -- ha! ha! -- And so Careless is to be
married to her -- You see -- you see, Wisely, that I don't feel -- [laughing
peevisishly.] Your servant, Sir -- I am your humble servant.

Exit:
WISELY. Poor Bellfield! -- my joy overflowed, and I could not help telling him
-- ha! ha! -- and yet he pretends not to feel it.

Exit:
SCENE Careles's Lodgings. Enter CARELESS and BLUNT. CARELESS. My dear Blunt,
you see my affairs are in a fine train: -- You will now at least grant, that
prudence is an essential part of my character.


BLUNT. Your state of probation has been rather short.


CARELESS. Po! po! -- My dear Blunt* you are a fellow of such a suspicious
temper, that you would believe the plague on board a ship, after she had performed
quarantine. -- But the most precise caution has guided my actions for some time
past. -- Hey! what have we here? letters! -- And that stupid sot of a servant
not to know any thing of the matter. [Opens a letter.] -- No indiscretion of
mine, I promise you, Blunt, will ever give you uneasiness again.


BLUNT. Well, I wish it may be so.


CARELESS. You Will find it so. -- [Reading.] How! 'Sdeath! what does this mean?
-- Upon my soul now, there is co such thing as living at this rate.


BLUNT. What Is the matter?


CARELESS. [Reads out.] I hold you accountable to me for the injuries you have
done my sister. A treaty of marriage with Sir Harry Strickland is broke off on
account of your scandalous givings out. -- When shall you be at London? If not
within this day or two, expect to see me at Windsor.

Yours, Richard Hotspur.



BLUNT. There again now! the old way.


CARELESS. How the devil could this happen? -- There is not so low a thing on
earth as repeating private conversation.


BLUNT. And cannot you be upon your guard in private conversation?


CARELESS. The most distant hint in the world escaped from me at the
Thatch'd-house one day at dinner. -- Though his sister had granted me the last
favor, yet I did not --


BLUNT. And you must blab now!


CARELESS. Po! with you I don't mind.


BLUNT. Nor with any man. -- It Is an inveterate habit, and you cannot conquer it.


CARELESS. 'Sdeath! nothing but plague and torment! -- [Opening another
letter.] What Is this?

Sir,
I did not imagine a base vainglory could have betrayed you into an action so
ungenerous and mean. -- My husband has heard all the circumstances, and he
threatens an immediate divorce. -- I am miserable, and you are the blackest
villain upon earth.

Eloisa.


That Is the feigned name under which she corresponded with me. -- But it will
be impossible for Mr. Kitely to prove --


BLUNT. Kitely! that secret's out too.


CARELESS. 'Sdeath! you catch a man so -- I did not mean to tell it.


BLUNT. I wish he may recover damages against you.


CARELESS. There is no trusting any body, I see plainly. -- I only hinted the
affair to a friend, who admired Mrs. Kitely, to let him see that she was
comeatable -- and now this is the return I meet with. -- It Is very vexatious!

Enter BELLFIELD, Bellfield, I am glad to see you.


BELLFIFLD. Mr. Careless, business of a particular nature occasions this visit.
-- Will you indulge us a moment, Blunt?


BLUNT. By all means. -- More misfortunes, I suppose.

Exit.
CARELESS. Well, Bellfield.


BELLFIELD. You will be so good as to name your time and place, and choose your
weapon, Sir.


CARELESS. Explain the cause.


BELLFIELD. The cause of injured innocence, injured truth, and violated honor.


CARELESS. Still I Am in the dark, Sir.


BELLFIELD. Lucinda! -- Does light break in upon you now? -- You have treated
her, Mr. Careless, unworthily, basely, scandalously.


CARELESS. And are you become her champion?


BELLFIELD. I am -- and I have the applause of my own heart for it. -- Every
honest man is interested in the refutation of calumny, when a tear falls from
the soft eye of injured beauty.


CARELESS. Mr. Bellfield, any reparation, in my power, I am willing to make the
lady -- or, if that will not do, Sir, I must give you the meeting: -- but, I cat't
marry Lucinda.


BELLFIELD. Mr. Careless, she is worthy of -- you cannot marry her! -- why not,
Sir? -- explain.


CARELESS. Would you fain compel me into a marriage?


BELLFIELD. Compel you! -- 'Sdeath! what am I at? -- No; but --


CARELESS. It is impossible, Sir. I am engaged to Hortensia.


BELLFIELD. To Hortensia! -- Positively?


CARELESS. Most positively.


BELLFIELD. And you think no more of Lucinda?


CARELESS. I must forget her entirely.


BELLFIELD. Ha! ha! -- You Are an honest fellow, Careless. -- Give us your
hand. -- I challenge you! -- For what? -- You have done Lucinda no injury --
and so I Will go and tell her. -- My dear Careless, fare you well. -- I wish you
all happiness with Hortensia. -- Your servant -- your servant. -- I challenge
you! not for the world. Exit.

Enter BLUNT.
CARELESS. A pretty business this! -- He comes in a romantic humor, huffing
like an errant Don Quixote, and then goes away laughing.


BLUNT. You were loud enough -- I heard it all. -- There will be no end of your
scrapes and difficulties.


CARELESS. Po! prithee, man -- how can you. -- Tomorrow makes Hortensia mine:
-- I shall then move in a higher sphere; set up for men to gaze with envy at.


BLUNT. You Will never succeed in any thing.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! that gravity is diverting. -- Why, in the common occurrences
of life, I own, I have carried myself negligently; but the business of my heart
is too important: There I have acted with the nicest precision.


BLUNT. Psha! while you are guarding yourself in one point, you lie exposed in
a thousand others. -- Your prudence is exactly like the philosopher's cloak:
When he drew it over his head his feet were uncovered.


CARELESS. Ha! ha! not in my concerns with Hortensia.

Enter BRAZEN, in another livery.
CARELESS. Hortensia's livery! -- Ha! ha! -- Now, Blunt, you will see: -- This is
a message from her.


BRAZEN. Mr. Careless, will your honor permit me just to whisper one word?


CARELESS. A million. Well, friend! how? what?


BRAZEN. Madam Hortensia gave me in strict charge to deliver this letter into
your own hand, Sir.


CARELESS. A thousand thanks. Here -- here is a reward for your diligence [gives
money]. You shall wait for an answer.


BRAZEN. I dare not, Sir. Secrecy is the word. I must be gone. Exit.


CARELESS. So; you see, I am in high favor with her. -- I cannot help laughing
at your peevish surmises. Ha! ha! -- But here, here, here is a proof of my
approaching joys.


BLUNT. I am sure I shall be glad to see you happy.


CARELESS. I know thou will. -- Ha! ha! -- Now let us see. [Opens the letter.]
Now, now, now. [Reads to himself] How! what is this? [Reads.] To no purpose --
character -- now vanished -- different light -- be my last -- never can be
yours. [Stands in confusion.]


BLUNT. Well, Careless, a proof of your approaching joys.


CARELESS. [Looks earnestly at Blunt, then walks away.] I never was so let down
in all my days.


BLUNT. You seem dejected, Careless.


CARELESS. Madam Fortune playing some of her damned cross purposes with me.


BLUNT. What Is the matter, man? [Careless gives him the letter, and walks about
the room.] What can all this be? [Reads.]

Sir,
To encourage your addresses, when they really are to no purpose, would be the
sign of a vain and ungenerous way of thinking. -- There were at first some
circumstances in your character and manner, which were not displeasing; but
those appearances are now vanished. I must therefore in this letter, which will
be my last, wish you all happiness; and freely declare, I never can be

Yours, Hortensia.


Undone, I fee; quite undone.


CARELESS. Yes, undone with a witness! -- What can the woman mean? -- If there
were any cause --


BLUNT. I fear you have given too much.


CARELESS. There is no dealing with any of her sex. -- An artful, false,
dissembling woman! -- Damnation! -- My dear Blunt, a thought is just come into
my head: I Will not torment myself about her. Revenge is at hand, and I Will enjoy
its sweets directly. -- Ha! ha! -- I have still an after-game to play: -- I
have another string to my bow -- Lucinda, my boy!


BLUNT. You gave her up ten minutes ago; and Bellfield's gone to tell her.


CARELESS. 'Sdeath! that is true. -- I Will fly to prevent the mischief. -- Ha!
ha! -- I Will have my revenge, and marry Lucinda directly; and then you will see me
an happy man still. Exit.


BLUNT. The veriest self-tormentor that ever lived!

Exit.
SCENE the Terras. Enter BELLFIELD and WISELY. BELLFIELD. Yes, Sir, I am in
spirits, and I Have reason. -- I am the happiest fellow in nature.


WISELY. I am glad to hear it, Bellfield.


BELLFIELD. I have had an interview with Careless. -- Who do you think he is to
marry?


WISELY. Hey? who? [uneasy.]


BELLFIELD. Hortensia.


WISELY. The devil he is!


BELLFIELD. Yes; after all. -- Ha! ha! -- Don't you think it is excellent news.


WISELY. Very extraordinary news, indeed.


BELLFIELD. He for ever quits claim to Lucinda. -- A'n't I a lucky fellow? --
Hortensia has fixed the affair at last. -- Ha! ha! -- My dear Wisely, you don't
enjoy my happiness.


WISELY. To see one's friends happy, Sir, is --


BELLFIELD. Was not I right not to fume and fret? -- Ha! ha! -- I kept my
temper, you see. -- Ha! ha! -- Is not it the luckiest thing in the world?


WISELY. [With a forced laugh.] Such luck never was heard of.

Enter CARELESS.
CARELESS. Wisely -- Bellfield -- how do ye, lads? -- Wisely, give me joy: -- I
have had a most admirable escape from the galling yoke of matrimony. -- I have
done with the widow, my boy.


WISELY. [In spirits.] Have you?


BELLFIELD. [Uneasy.] Done with her!


CARELESS. Yes, completely: -- She Is a compound of deceit, affectation,
treachery, and fraud.


BELLFIELD. My dear Careless, she is a very fine woman. -- Marry her stiil, man.


WISELY. You have hit her character, Careless. I should be sorry any friend of
mine --


CARELESS. Ay; I know her thoroughly. -- I shall mortify her pride: -- I Will
gall her proud heart: -- You Will see me tomorrow married to Lucinda.


BELLFIELD. How!


CARELESS. And the widow will be so provoked --


BELLFIELD. Zoons! Sir, but let me tell you --


CARELESS. Ha! ha! -- You wanted me to make her amends a little while ago: I
could not then; but now I Am at liberty, I shall certainly do it.


BELLFIELD. Sure the widow is a much finer woman.


CARELESS. Oh! no, no, no [laughing].


WISELY. Not to be compared to her, Careless. -- Ha! ha!


CARELESS. I shall certainly marry her, Bellfield.


BELLFIELD. But, Sir, do you imagine -- [angrily.]


CARELESS. She Is beautiful as an angel: -- Young, accomplished, elegant --


BELLFIELD. Mr. Careless, what do you mean by this?


CARELESS. Why, will not you let me praise her? -- Wisely, he was going to cut my
throat a while ago, for abusing her; and now he wants to murder me for speaking
in her commendation -- But make yourself easy, my dear Bellfield, I shall marry
her.


BELLFIELD. Marry her! Damnation!

[puts his hand to his sword.]
WISELY. [Interposing.] No violence, Bellfield: Careless is very right [holds
Bellfield.] She Is a sweet girl, Careless.


CARELESS. Yes; I know she is. -- Ha! ha!


WISELY. Marry her by all means.


CARELESS. Most certainly. -- Ha! ha!


BELLFIELD. Let go your hold, Mr. Wisely. -- I desire, Sir --


Enter Sir PHILIP. SIR PHILIP. Lads, for shame! -- not ready for the ball! --
Hey! what! quarrelling! -- never quarrel, my dear Bellfield -- never be out of
humor. -- Passion unhinges the whole frame; [turning out his toes] destroys
the grace and gaiety, and --


CARELESS. My dear knight, you're always in good humor; give us your hand.


SIR PHILIP. Always, Sir; always in spirits. -- Bellfield, I have made a new
country-dance since I saw you.


BELLFIELD. With all my heart, Sir.


SIR PHILIP. I heard some bad news; and so I did it to shake off melancholy.


CARELESS. Bad news! -- What Is the matter, Sir Philip?


SIR PHILIP. Poor lady Portsoken! -- You know I told you I used to dance with
her. -- I received a letter, mentioning, that after a venison feast at her
house last week, as she was amusing herself over a quart of syllabub, she was
taken suddenly ill, and expired [sinks and rises]. I was very much shocked; so
I composed a dance to raise my spirits.


BELLFIELD. Hang him, a troublesome fellow.

[Aside.]
SIR PHILIP. I am very sorry for her, I assure you. -- Bellfield, it is a
charming dance; all briskness and activity.


BELLFIELD. [Avoiding him.] Po! po!


SIR PHILIP. [Following him.] Foot it at top, cast off two couple, foot if at
bottom, dance corners --


BELLFIELD. I shall be glad to speak a word with you in private.

[ Aside to Careless.]
SIR PHILIP. Dance corners, I say, out at sides, cross over, turn your partner,
right hand and left.


CARELESS. Shall us dance it this evening, Sir Philip?


SIR PHILIP. Yes, Sir, this evening. -- But come, the hour draws nigh. -- For
shame, lads! -- Wisely, Bellfield, ye both live near my house; -- come, and
make ye ready.


BELLFIELD. I cannot go directly now.


WISELY. You must; I have business with you. -- [ Aside to Bellfield.] Lucinda
shall be your own still. -- I have business with you too, Sir Philip. -- Come,
Bellfield, I insist upon it. Forcing him off.


SIR PHILIP. Gentlemen, I attend you. -- Careless, foot it at top, cast off two
couple. Dances out.


CARELESS. An ungenerous woman to treat me thus! -- I Will master up resolution
to despise her, and never converse with her again.


Enter HORTENSIA, and passes by him. So, so, dissembling woman! [looking after
her.]

HORTENSIA. Low, vile wretch!


CARELESS. I Will not expostulate the matter with her.


HORTENSIA. I Will not condescend to upbraid him. -- [Goes up to him.] Mr.
Careless, you're a villain.


CARELESS. [Pretends to laugh.] Oh, Ma'am, I am fully acquainted with your
sentiments already.


HORTENSIA. A cool, deliberate villain!


CARELESS. Ha! ha!


HORTENSIA. Unfeeling in all points of honor as in love.


CARELESS. Pleasant, upon my soul! -- She upbraids me too!


HORTENSIA. That unmanly sneer! -- Mr. Careless, Mr. Careless, after every
proof of love a weak, inconsiderare woman could give -- I will only now take
the liberty to tell you, the baseness of your heart will make you the aversion
of our sex, and the scorn of your own.


CARELESS. Since I must speak, Heaven is my witness, I never failed in caution
and respect for you; I never abused the confidence you reposed in me; nobody
breathing ever heard a syllable of our loves.


HORTENSIA. No, Sir?


CARELESS. No; not a mortal. -- You made me break off with Lucinda, and now --


HORTENSIA. Could you favor me with a pinch of snuff?


CARELESS. I have not my box about me.


HORTENSIA. Shall I presume to offer you a pinch of mine?


CARELESS. She Is coming to again, by all that is tender! -- Ha! ha! -- I see how
it is. [Aside.] -- [Turns to her.] You are very obliging. -- How!


HORTENSIA. Do you own your baseness now?


CARELESS. How came that in your hands?


HORTENSIA. You could send it back with an affronting message too.


CARELESS. I, Ma'am! -- By heaven, nobody ever handled it, or knew your picture
was there, except my friend Wisely.


HORTENSIA. Who?


CARELESS. Wisely. -- Excepting him, nobody ever --


HORTENSIA. Oh, blockhead! fool! [Walks about.] You told him then?


CARELESS. Yes, yes -- I told him -- I told him all -- I desired him to take it
to town, and get it mended -- I let him into the whole secret -- I knew I could
trust him.


HORTENSIA. The man on earth you should not have trusted: He was your rival;
and he contrived this mischief. He sent it back to me, as from you. -- That Is
the use he has made of your confidence in him.


CARELESS. Oh! I see my folly. -- Damnation! -- And so the letter I received --


HORTENSIA. Sir, I repent me of that letter.


CARELESS. [Looking pleased.] Do you?


HORTENSIA. Most heartily.


CARELESS. Blessings on you for the word.


HORTENSIA. [Angry.] What, you are glad, are you?


CARELESS. To rapture.


HORTENSIA. [With a sneer.] I promise you, you shall never receive such another.


CARELESS. Then I return it to you most joyfully.


HORTENSIA. Very well, Sir! you return a fond letter thus with scorn.


CARELESS. Fond do you call it?


HORTENSIA. Was it no fondness to tell you here -- [opens the letter.] What Is
this? oh, I see through this too! Now blush for your indiscretion, weak,
trifling man! This very letter I sent Mr. Wisely, when first my foolish heart
seduced me to listen to your addresses.


CARELESS. Shame and confusion! idiot that I was!


HORTENSIA. How paltry do you appear now.


CARELESS. I feel it all. -- And yet will you suffer him, Wisely, to succeed in
so ungenerous a plot?


HORTENSIA. He has acted like a man of sense: he has at once shown me his own
prudence, and the infirmity of your frivolous mind.


CARELESS. But in all my conduct you see no marks of guilt, no treachery, no --


HORTENSIA. Sir, it is to me the same thing if an idle imbecility of
understanding assumes the appearance, or acts the purposes, of every vice in
its turn.


CARELESS. And can you thus, for a small failure --


HORTENSIA. Small failure do you call it? Mr. Wisely has deserved me, and I Will
bestow myself upon him this very day, to show the value I have for the man who
has honor enough to keep a woman's secrets, and the contempt due to the wretch
who, like you, can trifle with a generous heart.

Exit.
CARELESS. Hell and the devil! I shall never be able to show my face after
this: -- Blunt will rail at me, my enemies will rejoice, and every female
tongue will clack, clack. -- Confusion! -- What Is to be done? -- I Will follow
her to Sir Philip's mask; and from this moment not one unguarded word shall
ever escape me. Exit.


SCENE a Room in Sir Philip's House. Enter Sir PHILIP, WISELY, and BELLFIELD.
SIR PHILIP. You amaze me, Mr. Wisely. -- Careless a design upon my wife!


WISELY. He has laid his plot as I have told you.


SIR PHILIP. Why this is enough to spoil a man's dancing indeed. [Dances.]


WISELY. Be directed by me, and you shall at once have full proof, and be able
to prevent the mischief.


SIR PHILIP. [Dancing.] I was never so disconcerted in my born days.


BELLFIELD. Your own eyes, your own ears, shall convince you. -- Wisely, [
aside to Wisely] I Will step and see if Lucinda's ready.


WISELY. [ Aside to Bellfield.] Does she enter with spirit into the scheme?


BELLFIELD. Most cheerfully.


WISELY. Well, step and speak to her once more. [ Exit Bellfield.] This will
finish him with Hortensia. [Aside.] -- The levity of this man, Sir Philip, his
own folly, has put it in my power to do you this service. -- Hush! I see
Careless coming; I know his dress.


SIR PHILIP. And there is comes my wife; I know her dress too.


WISELY. Sir Philip, get you behind that curtain: -- quick -- quick; -- your
happiness depends upon it.


SIR PHILIP. I am gone. [Goes behind the curtain hanging to the back scene.]


WISELY. Now, now, this is the very crisis of his fate.

Exit.
Enter CARELESS and LUCINDA, at opposite doors, both masked. CARELESS. Her
ladyship is true to her appointment, I see. [Unmasks.] -- My lady Figurein,
this is generous indeed.


LUCINDA. The ball-room's full. [In a feigned voice.]


CARELESS. And we are safe here. -- Come, come, let me hear the gentle accents
of your own sweet voice.


LUCINDA. No; I love to practice.


SIR PHILIP. [Peeping behind.] I never knew such perfidy in my life.


CARELESS. Now then the opportunity favors -- let us retire to complete each
others' bliss.


SIR PHILIP. You shall dance [sinks and rises] to another tune presently.


LUCINDA. I Have something to say to you first: -- I hear you're going to marry
that flirt, Lucinda.


CARELESS. Lucinda! -- Ha! ha! -- That will never be! -- Marry her! -- A proud
insolent, who over-rates both her beauty and her fortune. -- I never had a
sincere regard for her; I gave the girl hopes, and pampered her vain
imagination, but I never liked her.


LUCINDA. I am glad to hear that; -- I am afraid her character is not the best.


CARELESS. If it has a flaw, she uses it like broken china; patches it up as
well as she can, and turns the fairest side to view.


LUCINDA. But then you will marry Hortensia.


CARELESS. That will be as things happen. -- But as to her, she will be of no
inconvenience to our amors; I shall always be able to detach a part of my time
from her, in order to dedicate it more happily to love and joy with your
ladyship.


SIR PHILIP. Such a villain never entered a gentleman's house!


LUCINDA. I am very faint of a sudden. -- Throw up that window yonder.


CARELESS. Don't alarm yourself. [Drawing up the curtain, and looking toward
her.] Your ladyship will be well in a moment. -- Sir Philip will never suspect,
or be able to find us out. He Will be busy with the graces. -- [Making fast the
string of the curtain, sees him.] Damnation! [Walks away.]


SIR PHILIP. [Following him.] Mr. Careless, this is the vilest proceeding --
the basest usage, Sir -- the wickedest dssign -- it is enough to put a body in a
passion.


CARELESS. Zoons! what shall I do now?


SIR PHILIP. I did not think you capable of this -- nor your ladyship either:
-- Come, show your face, madam, and let me see how guilt becomes it. -- [Takes
off her mask.] Lucinda all this time!


CARELESS. How! -- This is worse and worse.


LUCINDA. Yes, Sir Philip, the gay, the giddy Lucinda.


SIR PHILIP. And my wife innocent all the time!


LUCINDA. Entirely: -- We concerted this scheme amongst ourselves to detect
that gentleman. -- Mr. Careless, you never had a sincere regard for me, I
think; and I have a flaw in my character, have not I? -- Ha! ha! -- Poor,
detected Mr. Careless.


CARELESS. [Avoiding her.] I deserve it all -- I brought it all on myself.


Enter WISELY and BELLFIELD. WISELY and BELLFIELD. Your humble servant, Mr.
Careless. -- Ha! ha!


CARELESS. A swarm of enemies all at work against me. -- This is your damned
designing head, Wisely.


SIR PHILIP. Mr. Careless, [in a minuet step] this is the grossest violation of
all friendship, honor, and hospitality -- and, Sir, I shall hope to see you no
more in my house.


CARELESS. I shall take another opportunity to explain this matter, Sir Philip;
and for the present I -- [going].


Enter HORTENSIA and BLUNT. She too here! -- Oh, I Am in high luck!


LUCINDA. Hortensia, here has been such a discovery!


HORTENSIA. I have heard it all, my dear -- I have been attending in the next
room. -- Mr. Careless, what must I think of you now?


CARELESS. Every thing that is harsh, I make no doubt. -- Blunt, you see what a
condition I Am in here.


BLUNT. I knew you would be a bankrupt in fame as well as love at last.


CARELESS. 'Sdeath! I cannot stand it -- it is too much to bear. -- I here take
my leave of ye all. [Going]


HORTENSIA. No, Sir, your presence is necessary: -- You shall be a witness to
an act of justice. -- Mr. Wisely, I now acknowledge before this company, that I
have behaved indelicately to you: -- But now Sir, without ceremony, I give you
my hand; at once to make atonement for my past conduct, and to show that wretch
the just reward of secrecy in love.


WISELY. Generous Hortensia!


LUCINDA. And, to do full and ample justice on him, Mr. Bellfield, I have been
a very tyrant to you. I have used you like -- What was your simile, Mr.
Careless? -- My airs were too thin for a lover to subsist upon; and so now I Will
let in a little common-sense to keep him alive -- Here, take me, Mr. Bellfield,
that the gentleman may also see the just reward of sincerity in love.


BELLFIELD. Then I am paid indeed.


SIR PHILIP. Poor Careless! I almost pity him. -- He has had his dance, and now
he pays the piper.


OMNES. Ha! ha!


CARELESS. Oh, mighty well! -- you may laugh. -- I shall leave ye in possession
of your mirth. [Throwing off his mask.] Ha! ha! -- I fancy, though, you will see
that I can meet with a success elsewhere equal to any of ye.


OMNES. Ha! ha!


CARELESS. Ay, ay, go on -- enjoy the joke: -- -- I shall not drop the least hint
of my future schemes; but I believe --


OMNES. Poor Careless! -- Ha! ha!


CARELESS. In a little time you will know it all. -- I shall depart for the
county of Norfolk; and you may possibly read, in a few days, in the Norwich
Journal, of Miss Belvidere and your humble servant -- That Is all.


LUCINDA. O brave! a sieve to the very last.


SIR PHILIP. I have known them dance fifty couple at the Norwich assembly.


OMNES. Ha! ha!


CARELESS. Well, well; I Will say no more. [Going.]


SIR PHILIP. [Stopping him.] Mr. Careless, since no injury is done me, I am
willing to hope this day's business will correct your future conduct.


CARELESS. You are very good, Sir Philip. -- It will be a lesson to me for the
rest of my life.


SIR PHILIP. Then let us dance away reflection for the precent. -- I will not be
disappointed: -- You shall sacrifice to the graces with me.


CARELESS. With all my heart: -- I have no ill will to any one. -- Wisely, I
deserve it, for putting myself in your power. -- Blunt, spare my confusion. --
I have been a very silly fellow: -- But since things are come to this issue, I
have the consolation to feel, that whatever may have been my indiscretions, I
am greatly above a selfish and ungenerous character: I scorn a base action as
much as any man in England.

The careless indiscreet (this day has shown)
Is no One's Enemy except His Own.

FINIS.
