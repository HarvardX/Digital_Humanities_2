PROLOGUE.
FROM Dryden's period to our present days,
Thus would be-critics censure modern plays;
Some are too dull, without intrigue, or jest --
And some mere speaking pantomimes at best;
That living authors are by dead surpast,
So he must write the worst, who writes the last --
Still each new drama captiously they blame,
And, though the town be pleased, deny it same.
Should this decision be allowed as just,
The bays denied the Bard, may grace his bust!
But if this taste for antiques we pursue,
Age may improve wit, wine, and women too.
One old opinion we would still retain,
The right that England has to rule the main!
Long as the sea shall fence our envied land,
Long as our navy shall the sea command;
So long shall Howe's, St. Vincent's, Duncan's name,
Be engraved by memory on the rock of same!
The page of history shall their deeds repeat,
With Britain's triumph, and the foe's defeat.
But ah! the pensive muse, with tearful eye,
Views glory's brightest triumph with a sigh!
And midst the shouts victorious fleets attend
Mourns over the ashes of an honored friend,
Who in his country's quarrel fought and bled,
By England numbered with her patriot dead!
May war's alarms midst rival nations cease,
And all embrace that lovely stranger -- Peace,
Whose olive branch once planted by her hand,
Shall bless a loyal, brave, and happy land.
This night our Author's hopes on you are placed,
His former efforts by your smiles were graced;
To your decree submissively he bends,
Trusting his judges will be found his friends.

SECRETS WORTH KNOWING.
ACT I.
SCENE I. -- An Apartment in Greville House; Servants talking without.
Enter Valet, Butler, Coachman, Cook, and Footmen. VALET. SILENCE, I say! Why,
you keep as loud a gabbling as if you were settling the balance of Europe in
the lobby of the House of Commons. Order, I say -- the question is this. Our
old master being dead, and our young one expected every moment from abroad,
ought we, when he arrives, to laugh or cry? Hear the Cook!


Cook. Why, I thinks, that for the death of an old master, a little dripping
from the eyes would be quite natural.


Valet. It may be natural, master Cook; but lord bless you, the genteel feel of
your tip top folks, is no more like nature, than one of your fine kabobbed
fricassees is to plain roast and taties. Besides, when a man leaves behind him
a good ten thousand a year, I think it quite natural for the heir to laugh.
What say you, Coachy?


Coach. I pulls with you, Mr. Valet -- young master must in the main be glad,
for we all know that the old gemman seeing that he run skittish, kept him upon
low provender beyond sea. So my verdict is, Mr. Butler, that we all smiles
agreeably.


Butler. So say I. Dam'me, I Will look as pleased as punch, ha! ha!


Valet. Softly. And will you, sir, who have but thirty pounds a year, dare to
be as pleased at seeing your master, as I, who have fifty? No, no --
subordination is every thing.


Coach. Ecod, the best reason we should not be sorry, is, that the old Buck
left us no legacies.


Valet. That settles it. (all laugh.) (a knocking at the door.) Here he comes
-- I am to look most pleased, and stand in the front. Back a little, Coachy,
and remember I am to speak.


Enter Mr. and Mrs. Greville. Grev. Why this boisterous mirth?


Coach. You are to speak, you know.

(to the Valet.)
Grev. Is it thus you honor the memory of your departed master? My love,
welcome to England, and to my father's house. If I can trust my heart, the
greatest happiness I shall feel from prosperity, (should it await us,) will be
in placing my Maria in the elevated station her virtues will illumine.


Sally, in a traveling dress, speaks as she enters. Sally. Traveling indeed!
nothing but extortion I declare -- Such a gang of them! First, in comes the
bill; then remember the Waiter -- John Ostler, sir -- the Chambermaid, ma'am --
don't forget poor Boots -- I am the Porter -- the Post Boy, your honor -- so
that your hand keeps constantly moving up and down, up and down, like the great
lump of wood at Chelsea waterworks. -- ( the Servants nod and wink to her.) --
What are you all nodding and winking at? why don't you set chairs? -- (Servants
set chairs.) -- Now, go along all of you, and see the luggage unpacked --
(Servants surprised) -- why don't you go?

(Greville waves his hand.)
Valet. To be ordered about by such a dowdy! My dear Coachy, this will never do
for us.

Exeunt Servants.
Sally. A parcel of lazy chaps. I dare say -- but I Will make them stir their
stumps. Well, here we are at last. Oh gemini gig! how my poor bones do ache!


Mrs. Greville. My Greville, excuse her familiarity -- she has lived with me
from my infancy, and is, indeed, a faithful, affectionate creature.


Sally. Aye, that I am. Oh bless its pretty face!

(patting her mistress's cheek.)
Mrs. Grev. Leave us, good Sally.


Sally. Leave you?


Mrs. Grev. Yes.


Sally. Well, I will. I am a foolish, good natured -- I Will go and scold the
servants.

Exit Sally.
Mrs. Grev. You look uneasy, Charles.


Grev. It Is for thy sake, Maria. Between hope and fear my mind is tortured:
when I reflect on my father's determined, but just, resentment at my dissipated
conduct while in England -- so determined, that I dared not acquaint him of my
union with my adored Maria -- then I fear that he died without blessing me, and
has estranged me from his house and fortune. When I reflect that I am perhaps
destitute of the means of supporting thee -- surrounded by creditors -- (a
knocking at the door.)


Enter Sally. Sally. Oh! master, here is such a frightful old fellow wants to
speak with you. Such a -- Oh Lord! here he is.


Enter NICHOLAS, his face wrinkled, hollow cheeks, and every exhibition of
dolefulness, age, and decrepitude. Grev. Your name, friend, and business?


Nich. Sir, my name is -- so, there is a lady in the case -- my name, sir, is
Nicholas Rue, and my business will be explained by this letter. (Greville reads
the letter, and seems elated with pleasure.) Now to have a peep, (puts on his
spectacles.) Eh! as I hope to live these fifty years -- Miss Egerton. How my
master will be surprised!


Grev. What happy tidings! present my best respects to your master -- I will
wait on him immediately.


Nich. Very well, sir. How my master will be surprised!

Exit.
Grev. This letter, Maria, is from my father's executor.

(Reads.) Sir,
As executor to my dear, departed friend, Mr. Greville, I have to inform you,
his will leaves you, conditionally, his sole heir.



Sally. He! he! how happy I am!


Grev. The familiarity of this girl is intolerable.


Sally (pouting.) Tolerable indeed! Oh, Mr.Egerton, her noble brother behaved
different: He never thought me tolerable.


Mrs. Grev. For shame, Sally!


Sally. And so it is a shame that a poor servant should be out of her wits for
joy at hearing her dear lady's good fortune? Sir, I has as much right to be
happy as you has, and I will be happy, though you make me cry all day for it.


Grev. Well, Well -- loving Maria atones for a thousand faults.


Sally. (significantly.) Ha! he! perhaps this is as lucky for Mister Somebody,
as for Sally Downright.


Mrs. Grev. Dear Sally --!


Sally. Do you say dear?


Mrs. Grev. Pray be silent.

(Sally puts her hand to her mouth, and retires.)
Grev. My love, I must hasten to Mr. Undermine.


Mrs. Grev. Who?


Grev. Mr. Undermine, my father's executor.


Mrs. Grev. Heavens!


Grev. Do you know him, Maria!


Mrs. Grev. Alas! too well.


Sally. (advancing.) Know him! he is the blackest villain, sir -- It was he who
ruined her dear brother, and drove him from England, to wander, nobody knows
where.


Mrs. Grev. Oh, Greville! I doubt the goodness of that fortune to which he is
harbinger.


Grev. You alarm me; but I will hasten to him.


Sally. And I Will go with you, and, by gemini gig, I Will give it him --


Grev. For heaven's sake, be quiet! Droop not my dearest love! It Is prosperity
awaits us. I go to seize the prize, and lay it at thy feet, a fit oblation to
thy surpassing virtues.

Exit.
Mrs. Grev. Heigho!


Sally. Don't sigh, dear lady! I know from experience riches don't give
happiness. When poor, I was happy, and now that I am independent, having L.3
10s. a year in the consolidated real grand Bank of England, yet I Am not happy;
but I shall be so when my darling mistress is a great lady, and her dear
brother comes home a general.


Mrs. Grev. Poor Egerton! What perils has he not encountered for my sake --
perhaps his precious life --


Sally. Oh, no, no -- take comfort, for sure nobody would go to kill so
handsome and good a creature as he is -- besides, ma'am, has not he a mole on
his right arm? Was he not born with a cawl? And has he not a pocket-piece that
I got conjured?


Mrs. Grev. Peace, foolish girl! Yet I will take comfort, for he has the
protecting arm of heaven.

Exeunt.
SCENE II. -- A Room in UNDERMINE'S House,
Enter NICHOLAS. Nich. (crossing the stage.) That the sister of Egerton should
be the lady -- this is news indeed. They must be married, and then my old rogue
of a master gets the estate, and poor I, only a thousand pounds for assisting
in the roguery; but it is a snug sum.


Enter UNDERMINE, (yawning.) Und. Good morning. You look ill, Nicholas.


Nich. Oh dear! don't say so -- I feel pretty much in the old way -- eat little
to be sure -- sleep less.


Und. Ah! but you have been a sad old rogue, Nicholas.


Nich. I have always executed your honor's commands faithfully. Sir, I don't
like 12 o'clock at night. All dark as pitch! The church-bell tolling, and
nothing else to be heard but the rats in the wainscott.


Und. Don't talk of it.


Nich. Then, somehow a trembling seizes me --


Und. And you feel a kind of shivering damp, don't you?


Nich. Yes.


Und. I know -- I know. Then the dreams. I dreamt that old Greville came to my
bed, and demanded justice to his son, with horrible ghastly eyes like -- just
like yours, Nicholas; -- and -- pshaw! I Am becoming a superstitious fool. Away
to Greville with my letter.


Nich. I have already been there. You see how anxious I am to put you in
possession.


Und. How anxious you are to touch the L.1000, Nicholas!


Nich. Well, sir! he is arrived, and with him --


Und. Aye!


Nich. A lady.


Und. His wife, think you?


Nich. I Will tell you who she is, and leave you to judge -- the sister of
Egerton.


Und. Indeed!


Nich. Whom you ruined.


Und. And he deserved it for his folly. What chance had he, with only old blind
justice on his side, while I had possession, a long purse, and a chancery suit,
ha! ha! you don't laugh, Nicholas?


Nich. Lord, sir, I hav'n't laughed these thirty years.


Und. Ah! you have been a sad rogue. But when am I to expect Greville?


Nich. Directly, sir.


Und. Then give me his father's will out of that drawer.


Nich. (significantly.) Which will, sir?


Und. Which will? why, you are a wag, Nicholas. Not his second will, which you
burnt. Ha! ha! you are a wag. No, no -- this is the will for us, Nicholas; the
second did not suit quite so well -- it did not contain this beautiful provi^oe
-- But in case my said son shall have acted, or shall act, contrary to this my
will, I then bequeath all my estates, whatsoever and wheresoever, to my herein
named executor, adviser, and valued friend, Urban Undermine esquire. -- And was
not I a good adviser, eh? But then, Nicholas, what trouble I had, to make the
old superannuated fool sign it. How I had, to enforce the sin of disobedience,
read to him all the tragical stories of improvident marriages -- yet, Nicholas,
we are not quite safe, while my late servants, the witnesses to the burnt will,
are forth coming. Have you been to Newgate to see them?


Nich. Yes, sir; and says I to them -- you know my master's plate was found at
the bottom of your trunks, (which you know, sir, I put there myself,) and the
law has condemned you to be hanged -- now your kind master has got your
sentence softened to a mere trip to Botany Bay.


Und. And they were quite happy, I suppose?


Nich. No, sir -- they grumbled.


Und. Ah! man -- man -- never contented. This is my reward for sending them to
a charming flourishing colony, where there is every luxury -- even a
playhouse, Nicholas.


Nich. And I am told, sir, there are very good actors there.


Und. I dare say there are. (a knocking at the door.) Run to the window, and
see if it be Greville.


Nich. Lord, sir, I cannot run -- nor I cannot see.


Und. (aside.) Pshaw! old withered dolt! -- cannot see -- one comfort is, you
will soon be dead.

Exit.
Nich. But I can hear -- Soon be dead, eh? Oh dear me, no -- equally obliged to
you notwithstanding -- I am pretty well -- indeed -- excepting a slight liver
complaint, a flying gout, and a touch of the dropsy, I am quite well -- Ah! the
one thousand pounds must be first duly and truly paid, or I Will show you a trick
you little expect, old master of mine.


Enter UNDERMINE. Und. It Is he -- it is Greville -- run to the door.


Nich. I cannot run, I tell you.

Exit.
Und. If he be but married! Now for management -- If he be but married --


Enter GREVILLE. Mr. Greville, I presume -- allow me to congratulate you on
your arrival in England. I hope you enjoyed your health abroad?

Grev. Perfectly so. Excuse me, Mr. Undermine; but my anxiety --


Und. I understand -- I here, sir, is your good father's will.


Grev. (reads.) I, Robert Greville, do make and declare this my will. To my
only son, Charles Greville, I bequeath my forgiveness and blessing, (bows in
thankfulness,) together with all my estates, real and personal, provided my
said son has not during my life contracted, or does not, till he has fulfilled
his twenty-fifth year, contract -- matrimony.

(greatly agitated.)
Und. He is miserable -- I am a happy man!


Grev. (reading.) And in case my said son shall have acted, or shall act
contrary to this my will, I then bequeath all my estates, whatsoever and
wheresoever, to my herein-named executor, adviser, and valued friend, Urban
Undermine, esquire. (aside.) Most accomplished ruin! Oh, Maria!


Und. You seem indisposed.


Grev. How shall I act? Sir, the dying blessing of a justly offended father has
agitated my spirits. (aside.) And shall this wretch, the enemy of Maria, riot
in the blessings she should enjoy?


Und. Mr. Greville!


Grev. (aside.) Suppose I conceal my marriage -- The clergyman who officiated
abroad, being dead, and the certificate safe in my possession, detection is
impossible.


Und. Sir, the pleasure I might otherwise feel at so large an acquisition of
property as your marriage gives me, is really, sir, changed into anguish on
your account.


Grev. (aside.) I Will conceal my marriage -- I Will torture him. Mr. Undermine,
how happy am I to relieve your benevolent heart from the anguish which
oppresses it, and make you happy by declaring, I am not married; but you don't
seem happy.


Und. N -- no -- not married! -- Is it possible that --


Grev. It is quite possible.


Und. That is -- I mean -- I -- I -- have the pleasure of knowing Miss Egerton.


Grev. True, and she says she knows you well.


Und. Yet, on reflection, who can wonder --


Grev. What do you say?


Und. Who can wonder, I say, that the sister of a proud beggar should be lost
to those celestial virtues --


Grev. It Is false! Virtues! she is their representative on earth.


Und. Except chastity.


Grev. (aside.) Distraction! Oh, my wronged wife! am I the assassin of thy
fame? -- If I remain here, I shall betray myself.


Und. Yet, I say --


Grev. Say no more, sir.


Und. Allow me to advise --


Grev. Pardon me, good sir -- the advice you have here given is so excellent,
(returning the will,) that I should be deemed a monopolist, did I engross more.
Let the world benefit; my family have had quite enough of it.


Und. In short, then, Mr. Greville --


Grev. In short, then, Mr. Undermine, I am equal to the attendance on my own
affairs. Do you prove your attention to yours, by promptly attending me in the
capacity of executor, and not as heir, to my father. Exit.


Und. So, so, so -- Yet he must be married: but then how to prove it -- how to
manage --


Enter NICHOLAS, running and capering. Nich. Well, sir, here I am -- ready to
touch.


Und. You can run, I see.


Nich. Why, after a thousand pounds, I can hobble a bit.


Und. Can you? Then hobble to Lucern, in Switzerland, and obtain proof of their
union -- he denies being married.


Nich. Deny being married! But I Will take my oath he is.


Und. I dare say you will -- But who will believe you, Nicholas? I Will probe him
to the quick -- a licentious profligate! Ah, Nicholas! let this be a lesson to
you. Avoid the sin of seduction!


Nich. I will, sir.


Und. To rob innocence of its thousand charms.


Nich. To rob me of my thousand pounds!


Und. But he is married. I Will after him directly.


Nich. Sir, you forget the steward is coming.


Und. True, true, old April -- a full twenty years since we met.


Nich. He must be tottering on the grave, poor old fellow.


Und. He tells me he has brought Rose Sydney to town with him, our joint ward.
I have left the care of her entirely to him, because it never struck me how I
could get any thing by her.


April. (without.) Up stairs, do you say? Come along, Rose.


Und. The old fellow is fumbling his way up. Don't hurry yourself, friend
April, I Will help you.


Enter April and ROSE SYDNEY. -- APRILl' s figure representing the "lusty
winter" of life, strong, corpulent, a ruddy complexion, and long, flowing,
silver hair.
April. Who the devil wants your help! Friend Undermine, how are you? heartily
glad to see you, (shaking him violently by the hand.)


Nich. Ah, Mr. April!


April. What, old Nick! alive! You grow devilish like your namesake! Ha, ha!
(stops laughing suddenly.) My dear Rose; ask pardon -- forgot to introduce, and
all that -- Undermine, this is our ward, our pretty Rose -- brought her up to
town to see all the devilments and things, and marry her to my grandson
Plethora, who is by this time, I warrant, a celebrated physician.


Rose. That is, Guardy, if I like him.


April. To be sure -- no compulsion -- no -- no -- You see mine has been a
difficult task, friend Undermine -- not only to take care of a large lump of
land, but also this pretty little morsel of live stock.


Rose. Which is certainly the harder task of the two; for where you leave a
pasture at night, there you are sure to find the pasture in the morning; but
you may leave me peaceably browzing in that pasture in the evening, and the
next day, hear of my curvetting and frisking it on a certain Green, called
Gretna.


Und. Ha, ha! madam, you will be esteemed a wit.


April. She will -- for she has three thousand a year, ha, ha! But, old Nick,
have not you a bit of dried wainscot in the house, commonly called a
housekeeper. Rose will want an army of miliners, haberdashers, and odds and
ends.


Nich. Do you imagine, sir, we exist without the blandishments of the softer
sex? Allow me to conduct you -- don't be alarmed, miss, you may rely on my
prudence and delicacy.


Exeunt Nicholas and Rose. April. Come, let me look at you, old boy. You are
grown devilish rusty.


Und. Impudent blockhead!


April. My countenance is the same.


Und. Yes, brass never rusts; but you must want repose.


April. Repose, ha, ha! Why I walked good twenty miles yesterday, over hedge
and stubble, to shoot you a bag of birds, old boy. How you stare!


Und. How the devil have you contrived to keep so ruddy a face?


April. By keeping clean hands, friend Undermine.


Und. And how do you manage to keep your body upright?


April. By keeping my heart in the same attitude; for I soon found out that the
weight of every illgotten guinea is laid on a man's shoulders for life -- bends
him down -- there is no getting rid of the load. (Undermine tries to hold up
his head, but fails.) So I preferred a long life to a long annuity, and a light
heart to a heavy purse, eh, master Undermine?


Und. A most excellent plan indeed -- for the country.


April. Well, but the news -- is Greville arrived? The young heir -- the dear
boy, Charles -- is he well?


Und. Yes, a pretty chick he is -- a profligate -- a seducer.


April. What! Oh, I see -- a joke of yours, to try to prevent my laughing, ha,
ha! Eh, you shake your head though.


Und. What would you say, if I told you he had basely seduced a virtuous and
superior woman?


April. I would say it was a lie.


Und. Go then, and convince yourself.


April. What Charles Greville guilty of dishonor, merely to get a fashionable
name?


Und. And even there he will be disappointed. Formerly, indeed, the ruin of an
innocent woman was thought wickedness enough to entitle you to a seat in the
cotorie of fashion; but now, unless that woman be the wife of your friend, or
the daughter of your benefactor, your gusto is scouted, and you are
black-balled for want of a due qualification.


April. Oh, rare London, ha, ha! Should not laugh though. -- Sad doings. I Will go
to him; if what you say be true, he wont dare to look even me in the face --
but it cannot be. -- Oh! he was the bravest, noblest lad. I Will tell you stories
of him, will make you so laugh, ha, ha! And I Will tell you stories will make you
so cry.

Exeunt.
ACT II.
SCENE I. -- An Apartment in UNDERMINE'S House.
Enter APRIL and UNDERMINE. April. But tell me, tell me -- have you seen my
grandson Plethora lately?


Und. No, not lately.


April. Is he one of your first rate doctors, eh?


Und. (concealing a laugh.) Not quite, I believe.


April. He must be grown a tremendous fellow. Sent him to town in high
condition -- full of health -- all sinew -- strong as a castle.


Und. You Will find your castle reduced to mere lath and plaster. (aside.)


April. And a power of money in his pocket.


Und. Aye, how much?


April. All I was worth.


Und. The devil you did?


April. To be sure. The road of life is confoundedly up hill, so I determined
the boy should not want provender. Besides, they say money gets money -- and by
this time I dare say he has doubled, aye, trebled it.


Und. (aside.) Ha! ha! Give all he has to a young spendthrift. Well, you will
follow me to Greville's?


April. Never to do things by halves is a maxim in the family of the Aprils.


Und (aside.) And you have certainly proved yourself the first of the Aprils,
ha! ha!

Exit.
Enter Rose. April. Ah, Rose, my girl, I expect your lover every moment. (Rose
shakes her head.) Nay, fair play -- see him, and hear him -- let us have no
sending adrift without a fair trial. Egad, you will see a man fit for a husband;
like -- like what I was fifty years ago.


Rose. Of this I am sure: I never can hate any thing that resembles my dear
Guardy.


April. Bless thee! -- (knocking.) -- Eh -- here he comes -- the head of
Apollo, the strength of Hercules, the voice of a Stentor, the --:


Enter PLETHORA, his visage thin and emaciated, his figure lean, his voice
tremulous. A man of twenty with a constitution of eighty. APRIL jumps with
surprise. April. Eh! what! no!


Pleth. How are you, Grandad?


April. Rose, my love, speak to it.


Rose. Alas! poor ghost!


Pleth. How goes it, I say? -- Grown quite slim and genteel since you saw me
last, an't I?


April. Quite!


Pleth. This is shape and make, is not it?


April. Why, Bob -- ha, ha! should not laugh -- Poor fellow! perhaps it is
intense study. -- But, he, he! zounds, doctor, instead of giving it to others,
you seem to have taken all the physic yourself.


Pleth. Yes, of cherry-bounce quantum suff. -- and old Oporto, -- a couple of
magnums -- that is my physic -- a short life and a merry one, ha, ha! -- Ugh,
ugh! But you sent word you wanted me on business. What is it, eh?


April. Why, I had an intention of proposing a marriage between you and that
sweet girl. But I don't know what to say -- you don't seem exactly calculated.
What do you think, Rose? (She shakes her head and laughs.) Nay, don't laugh at
my grandson. Age is respectable. I say, old one, what do you think of marriage?


Pleth. With that fine girl -- with all my heart. A short life, and a merry one.


Rose. Don't be rash, sir. And will you venture to run away with me?


Pleth. That I will. Easy stages though.


Rose. Easy stages! -- It will not do, Guardy.


April. No; we must give it up. But what have you done with all the money I
gave you?


Pleth. Why, I duly considered the hardness of the times, and so threw it into
circulation.


April. Indeed! And pray how do you intend to live?


Pleth. I am one of the host of Pharaoh.


April. Dam'me, you are one of the lean kine, ha! ha! But zounds and fury! --
(going up to him.)


Rose. Oh, don't! -- If you touch him you will kill him.


Pleth. You have arrived in time; for I have just decanted the last hundred.
Come, tip a rouleau.


April. I heard you kept a carriage.


Pleth. Two -- a gig and a tandem.


April. You a physician! Why, you ignorant --


Pleth. Come, tip. (holding out his hand a la medicin.)


April. Eh! ignorant -- I beg your pardon -- No, I see you understand at least
the grand principle of the profession, (imitating,) ha, ha! But, 'sdeath! what
have you to show for all the money?


Pleth. Show! Ask at the College.


April. Oh! in Warwick Lane.


Pleth. Warwick Lane! Curse the old quizes! ha, ha! -- ugh, ugh! -- No, I mean
the Horse College.


April. The Horse College!


Pleth. To be sure. Farriery is now the only learning fit for a man of fashion.
Why, have not you read the Rights of Cattle?


April. No.


Pleth. No! Then you are a yahoo. -- Nor Loose Thoughts on a Horse-shoe, six
volumes folio, price twenty guineas?


April. No.


Pleth. Nor you, ma'm?


Rose. No, sir.


Pleth. What, both ignorant of horse-shoeing! Why, you an't fit to show your
heads in polished society. I tell you it is the only thing going.


April. Indeed! Well, as it is a thing going, there can be no harm in wishing
it gone.


Pleth. Gone! Why, bless you, so far from that, there is Lord Snaffle learning
to read a purpose. But I must be off.


April. Where?


Pleth. To the College to be sure -- never miss -- famous day. Two lectures --
one, a grand dissertation on the use and abuse of cruppers.


April. Amazing!


Pleth. The other, on the proper application of the horsewhip.


April. You need not go on that account. I Will show you that in two minutes, (is
restrained by Rose.)


Pleth. But, I say -- if I am to match with that nice girl, say the word, that
I may go into training accordingly.


Rose. Certainly nor, sir.


Pleth. Then good bye -- I say, a short life and a merry one, he, he! -- ugh,
ugh! Exit.


April. So, all my property gone to make a farrier. I say, did you ever see
such a bit of blood, ha, ha! But I must away to Greville's. Good bye, my girl!
Horse-shoeing! -- Egad, doctor, you shall have a bellyful of it; for into the
country you go, and farrier you are for life. Exeunt.


SCENE II. -- A Library at GREVILLL'S.
Mrs. GREVILLE discovered, dejectedly leaning her cheek on her hand -- SALLY
looking out of the window. Mrs. Grev. Greville not yet returned?


Sally. There he is, ma'am, pacing up and down the Square, with his arms
crossed -- now he stops -- now he walks quick.


Mrs. Grev. Oh! call him to me.


Sally. He is coming, ma'am. Don't agitate your dear spirits. --


Enter GREVILLE, under great agitation; not observing his wise, he draws a
chair, and sits down. Grev. To conceal my marriage -- How can I ask it of my
wife? To confess it, then! (rising.) Ruin without hope. I cannot bear the
thought. Unfortunate Maria!


Mrs. Grev. (leaning on his shoulder.) Not so -- while I possess your love --
Oh, tell me, Charles! the wild disorder of your eye terrifies me. Greville
points to Sally.) -- Leave us good Sally! ( Exit Sally.) -- Tell me, Oh, tell
me the worst.


Grev. I will -- it is -- for us, a prison during life. Beggary for our child.
( Mrs. Greville weeps.) This horrid fate you can alone avert,


Mrs. Grev. (smiling through her tears.) Oh, Charles! how unkind to think that
misfortune shall for a moment oppress your heart, which I can avert. 'Twill be
a happiness --


Grev. (mournfully.) Happiness, Maria! mark me. To prevent the heavy hand of
poverty from crushing us, you must declare -- how shall I utter it? -- that we
are not married. Should that be known, I am disinherited.


Mrs. Grev. Oh! must we part?


Grev. I mean not chat. Consent to live with me, yet --


Mrs. Grev. Say on.


Grev. Declare yourself -- think the rest.


Mrs. Grev. Your mistress. ( faintly.) I will. Pardon me a moment's agitation,
(recovering.) Yes, cheerfully.


Grev. Think, my love, 'twill be but a transient sorrow.


Mrs. Grev. Alas! I think but this -- it was my Greville asked it; and I
solemnly swear by the holy marriage vow, never to claim the honored name of
wife, but at your command.


Grev. Let me adore thee!


Mrs. Grev. Yet, oh! ( bursting into an agony of tears.)


Grev. Is this cheerfulness, Maria?


Mrs. Grev. It Is not for myself -- the title of mistress gives not this pang.
But, oh Charles, what name will attach to our pretty innocent?


Grev. I cannot bear the conflict. Let ruin come.


Mrs. Grev. Oh no! forgive me -- but at that moment the mother felt strong
within me. Indeed I will be all you wish. Pray look happy. Come, you shall see
I Will act my part to admiration! Be gay. ( faints,.)


Grev. Maria -- my love! --


Mrs. Grev. (recovering.) I am better. It was my last struggle. Indeed I am
better.


Grev. Within there! (Sally makes one step on the stege.) You were very near at
hand. -- Her secrecy will be necessary. By your alacrity, I judge it would be
needless to repeat what has now passed?


Sally. Why, sir, to speak the truth, I overheard every word you said.


Grev. This, then, is your duty? --


Sally. Ah, sir! -- If my love for my dear mistress had not been stronger than
my duty, you would not have been so long troubled with Sally Downright.


Grev. Well, well -- have the servants asked you any questions about your
mistress?


Sally. A, thousand.


Grev. What answer did you give them?


Sally. None.


Grev. That was right. Now attend to my orders. You mutt deny my marriage with
your mistress.


Sally. I will not.


Grev. What!


Sally. I will not. (with firmness.)


Grev. I am not to be tristed with. Will you obey my orders? ( she shakes her
head.) Then leave this house instantly.


Sally. I will not go. (takes a chair and sits down between them.) Her dear noble
brother left her to my care --


Grev. But your charge is superseded by a husband's protection.


Sally. Act like a husband, and I Will go, bag and baggage. -- 'Till then, here I
sits.


Mrs. Grev. Would you see us reduced to want?


Sally. Want! -- Nonsense! Have not I a pair of hands strong enough to work for
you? And I suppose his are strong enough to work for himself. Want, indeed!


Mrs. Grev. Leave her with me. I know I can prevail. Retire, my love.


Grev. My mind is too oppressed to meet Undermine. Tell him to return in two
hours.


Mrs. Grev. Compose your spirits.


Grev. Thanks, my kind Maria.

Exit.
Sally. What! deny his own honorable, real, lawful spouse, and such a lady!
And then expect me to encourage --


Mrs. Grev. Come, come -- you can refuse me nothing.


Sally. I cannot say it.


Mrs. Grev. But you can be silent.


Sally. That I can.


Mrs. Grev. Then promise me to remain so, should the subject be mentioned to
you.


Sally. I do.


Mrs. Grev. Aye, but seriously?


Sally. Or may I never see your dear brother again. It Is lucky he does not know
of these doings.


Enter Servant. Serve. Mr. Undermine.

[Exit.
Mrs, Grev. Be prudent, Sally -- remember.


Enter UNDERMINE. -- Mrs. GREVILLE bows Coldly, and retires up the Stage. Und.
This is the confident, I suppose. (beckons her toward him.) I Will try a dole of
flattery: that costs nothing. You are as handsome as an angel.


Sally. So are you, sir.


Und. Me! no, that will not do. Ah! then I must apply to the grand specific;
(takes out a purse.) put that in your pocket for my sake; but don't talk about
it.


Sally. You shall never hear of it again depend on it.


Und. I say -- a handsome couple.


Sally. Very.


Und. I suppose you had a very jolly wedding. (she remains silent.) Come, come,
you may trust me. Why should you suppose me a babbling idiot, that cannot keep
a fecret?


Sally. Why should you suppose me one?


Und. (after looking at her with suspicion.) I Will thank you just to look at
that purse again.


Sally. Certainly, sir. (seeling for it.) But, can you really be snug?


Und. I can -- keep the purse -- I insist on it -- I have her -- I have her.


Sally. Can you be secret?


Und. Yes.


Sally. So Can I.

Exit.
Und. God bless my soul! -- She is gone -- and the purse is gone -- Somehow, I
didn't manage quite so cleverly. Eh! but now for the mistress. I Will humble her,
however -- yes -- with the earth -- Madam, I am under the necessity of asking
by what name I am to have the honor of addressing you.


Mrs. Grev. ( coming forward.) By a name most unhappy, most wronged -- yet, by
the still proud name of Egerton. Mr. Greville cannot see you at present. In two
hours he will be at leisure. That is the door.


Und. Alas! madam, I pity you.


Mrs. Grev. ( stisting her indignation.) I thank, you for thinking I deserve
it. How superior, then, am I, to that wretch, who basely defrauds worth, and
drives from his friends and country a noble youth, to encounter calamity,
perhaps death; -- for, in the awful hour of retribution, who will pity him.
That, sir, is the door.

[Exit.
Und. God bless my soul! I have not triumphed quite so much as I expected. I
don't exactly know what to do. I see no particular use in staying here, and, as
she observed, that certainly is the door. God bless my soul!

[Exit.
Enter SALLY and APRIL.
Sally. (bobbing a curtsey.) My master is not at home, sir,


April. Pugh -- pugh -- tell him it is April come to see him. I am his steward.


Sally. Indeed, sir --


April. And who are you?


Sally. I am Sally, sir -- I came with them from foreign parts.


April. Then I suppose you can prattle German, Sally? --


Sally. Me jabber their outlandish stuff! Sir, I Will give you my opinion on that
subject. I thinks, that, for a true-born Briton to speak one word of foreign
lingo, is a mortal sin.


April. Bravo, English Sally! and how did you like the people?


Saliy. Not at all -- a parcel of conceited chaps -- pretended not to
understand me, though I spoke as legibly to them in the real vulgar tongue as I
does to you.


April. Ha, ha! And how did you like the country?


Sally. Not a bit -- high srightful mountains all covered with ice. Ugh! (
shivering.) And horrible roaring cascades, making such terrible noises. No --
Taunton Dean for my money. Regular hayfields, and cornfieldsd, and a good
turnpike-road.


April. Egad, you are a girl to my mind.


Sally. And I am sure you are a nice old man.


April. Do you think so, ha, ha! Now to sound her. Pray, Sally, how long has
our young master been married? ( she is moving off silently, be gets between
her and the door.) And so you think me a nice old man, eh?


Sally. Yes, that I do -- ha! ha!


April. And so they were married abroad, eh? (Sally looks grave again, and
exit.) Then it is so. Ah, here he comes -- he is grown a noble fellow. Pity
that so fine a tree should be rotten at the core. Ah! I see he is a man of
pleasure, he looks so miserable.


Enter Mr. and Mrs. Greville. Grev. Ah! April, the same man I left.


April. Yes, the same -- body and heart. -- Can you say so to me, Charles?


Grev. So, so -- more torture.


April. What a charming creature! ( addressing Mrs. Greville.) Don't be
offended, madam -- you look like an angel -- nay don't droop -- I dare say you
will be one. Heaven is merciful! give me your fair hand. An old man's blessing
will not harm you, lady.

( wiping his eyes.)
Mrs. Grev. He weeps. Oh Greville, let us retire. Even the pity of a villain
did not move me; but the virtuous tears of that old man press on my heart with
agony insupportable.


April. Oh, Charles! Charles!


Enter SALLY. Grev. Mr. April, are you content to be a silent observer of my
conduct?


April. I cannot -- I cannot.


Grev. Then, sir, you must estrange yourself from this house.


[ Exeunt Mr. and Mrs. Greville. April. I Will go -- I Will go -- Is this my once
noble boy -- my pride? -- forbid me his house!


Sally. Never mind his forbidding. I shall always be proud to see you, sir.


April. Thank you, Sally. I, that tought him to shoot flying, and now have his
dogs so trained -- coveys waiting for him to come and shoot them -- it is all
over. Pray, (but tell me if I am impertinent,) who is that lovely creature?


Sally. The sister of Mr. Egerton. Ah! there is a man. How I loved him!
Platonic, I assure you. And the regard was mutual; for, excepting the old
greyhound, I was first favorite.


April. What, he likes greyhounds -- then I dare say he is a fine fellow. I Will
think no more of Greville -- And so, your love was platonic, eh? -- Ha! ha! --
nay, if I cannot laugh, it is all over with me. yes, I will leave your house.
Lend me your arm, my good girl; for to say the truth, Sally, this quarter of an
hour has shook me worse than the last twenty years wear.


[Exeunt. ACT III.
SCENE I. -- An Apartment in UNDERMINE'S House.
Enter UNDERMINE and NICHOLAS. Nich. Well, sir, what news of Greville? Does he
confess?


Und. No.


Nich. Dear me, I should like to touch. I am an old man, and I cannot, I
suppose, hope to live always. Do you think I can, sir?


Und. Not always, I should think.


Nich. Ah!

( sighs) then, sir, if -- ever -- I should by any accident happen to die -- it
would be consoling to clutch the L.1000 first. Oh dear -- I forgot. -- Your
nephew Rostrum, the young auctioneer, is below.


Und. What does he want?


Nich. Every thing -- riches, title, sense, elegance; because

(to express myself in one grand, energetic word), he wants the cash.


Und. Well, well, give him a guinea -- stay, I have a thought. Suppose I make
him an engine to torment Greville -- but he is such a Sneakup! Were he a boy of
metal, I would adopt him -- but he is so honest, Nicholas.


Nich. It Is excusable in youth, sir. -- Time and your instructions --


Und. Then he is deficient in spirit.


Nich. Lord, sir, you have never allowed him fair play: give him a purse full
of gold -- try that -- adod, it would make a buck of me.


Und. I will try it.


Nich. And, sir, -- a thought has struck me too.


Und. Out with it.


Nich. I don't think, sir, we lead very happy lives.


Und. No -- not remarkably so.


Nich. Suppose then, sir, when you get the Greville estate, and I get the
thousand pounds, that we get rid of the cold damps and shiverings.


Und. Aye, but how! -- how!


Nich. Lord, sir, don't you see, how the great contrive it. Instead of passing
twelve o'clock at night in darkness, and the blue devils -- their houses are
illuminated, full of company and jollity.


Und. And a most excellent plan it is -- I Will do it. -- Yes, I Will pass the next
fifty years of my life in luxury and honorable uprightness.


Nich. Except I suppose any snug bit of roguery should occur in our way.


Und. Certainly, and I Will become a man of taste and virtu.


Nich. What become a man of virtue! Sir?


Und. No -- no -- you blockhead -- I Will explain to you, Nicholas -- Virtua is
an admiration of every thing useless, or monstrous; as old books full of lies
-- tea cups -- bad sixpences -- butterflies -- kittens with two heads, and so
forth; while Virtue is, that -- I say Virtue is a -- every body knows what
Virtue is.


Nich. And edod I Will have my jollifications, and who knows but in time I may
learn to laugh again.

[Exit.
Und. Now how to provide handsomely for my nephew, without it is costing me a
farthing -- I have it -- marry him to Rose Sidney -- ah! let me alone for
management. Ah, here is my young auctioneer.


Enter ROSTRUM. Ros. How do you do, sir.

( bowing low.)
Und. Curse your bowing -- come here, sir, -- hold up your head.


Ros. Civility, sir, in my line is every thing.


Und. Yes, but I am going to make a dashing buck of you, and in that line --
civility will be all againft you.


Ros. What, sir, am I to leave my pulpit, -- and part with my little hammer.


Und. ( throws him a purse.) There is something better than your little hammer.


Ros. Oh dear, and what am I to do with all this?


Und. What you please.


Ros. I Will go to a sale.


Und. Go to a sale -- I gave it you to throw to the devil.


Ros. I Will take it to my attorney's.


Und. Take it to Bond-street -- purchase expensive clothes, horses, carriages
-- I Will make a man of you.


Ros. Well, I should not have thought that becoming a sprig of fashion was the
way to make a man of me.


Und. I say, how do you feel with a heavy purse?


Ros. Quite light, sir -- the cash certainly loosens a man's joints, and gives
a sort of a -- I -- don't -- care -- a -- damn -- for -- any -- body, kind of a
feel. --

( strutting about.)
Und. Obey me, and my fortune's yours -- disobey me, and you are a beggar. In
the first place, forget your absurd auctioneer jargon -- you understand. --


Ros. Sir, I take your bidding -- I mean I take your hint.


Und. And get rid of that respectful manner, the age of supple adulation is
passed; bend now to the great, and they will sink you lower. -- No, you must
assume a superiority -- you must hold up your head. -- Do you think, for
instance, you can get rid of your respect for me?


Ros. With the greatest ease possible.


Und. Very well. Observe, every thing may be done by management. I who am now
looked up to -- aye, sir, looked up to; once kept you, know, -- a paltry
grocer's s;hop.


Ros. It was a chandler's shop.


Und. Was it -- well -- well -- how have I become what I am -- by management --
for instance -- I am thought to possess a strong understanding -- is it so?


Ros. It never struck me that you did.


Und. Very well -- again -- the world calls me a man of scrupulous integrity --
am I so?


Ros. Certainly not, sir.


Und. Very well, then -- all the effect of management. Say little -- yet never
seem ignorant; but by significant nods and smiles, seem to say, I know all --
but will not tell.


Ros. Oh! when ever I don't understand a subject, I must nod.


Und. Yes.


Ros. Then, my dear uncle, I shall nod my head off to a certainty.


Und. No, no, you may manage -- get a smattering of politics at a party
bookseller's -- morality you may learn at the playhouses -- mechanism at
Merlin's. -- and the fine arts --


Ros. At my own auction room.


Und. Confound your auction room -- away and begin your career. -- Stay; a
little trifle I had forgot -- I am going to marry you to a --


Ros. Marry me! -- Oh lock, sir!

( with bashfulness.)
Und. Oh lock, sir! -- -- You sneaking --


Ros. Upon my foul I meant sink me -- I meant to say -- so you are going to
marry me. Sink me.


Und. Yes; and to a lady who has all the requisites for an excellent wife. In
the first place, she is esteemed beautiful by all who have seen her -- fine
estate in Worcestershire.


Ros. Fine estate! I should like to sell it -- freehold or copyhold?


Und. Freehold, I believe.


Ros. Within a ring fence.


Und. How the devil should I know. In the next place, she is remarkably
sensible and witty -- that I had from a gentleman who says her estate is the
prettiest in the county.


Ros. A most excellent authority.


Und. And thirdly, she has a crowd of lovers, which certainly proves --


Ros. That her estate is the prettiest in the county; quite natural, for now
adays no gentleman comes more frequently to the hammer than little Cupid --
but I must away; this purse makes me very fidgetty.


Und. Success attend you -- don't forget my lessons -- ( they nod to each
other.) -- Management is every thing -- remember -- hypocrisy.


[Exit. Ros. Hypocrisy! I am sure I ought to nod now, for thank heaven that, is
a subject I am completely ignorant of.

[Exit.
SCENE II. -- Bond Street.
Enter EGERTON in a military greatcoat and cross belt, with every appearance of
distress, and dejection of mind and body. Eger. It Is strange, that I should
pass unheeded amidst a crowd of friends, that none should know me; surely the
necromancers of old were fools to study life away in vain attempts to become
impervious to human sight, when, to render themselves invisible to their
nearest friends, 'twas only to put on the garb of wretchedness. ( takes out a
miniature.) This is the only treasure I have left -- my sweetest Rose. ( kisses
the picture.) But what have I to do with love or happiness. Yet I Will not part
with thee, sweet remembrancer, though nature's calls are most imperious, and I
sicken with hunger.


Enter ROSTRUM. Ros. Plague take this purse; I don't know what to do with it. I
don't care twopence for horses -- I hate gaming. I cannot drive curricles. And
as for the once concealed charms of the fair -- no need of a purse for that --
now adays, they are all to be seen gratis. -- Heigho! I am no more fit to be a
blood, than my uncle is to be a bishop -- I have nothing to do -- no where to
go -- Oh! what a cursed bore it is to be a gentleman. -- Eh! what have we here
-- Oh! I see a soldier returned from the wars in the full dress of victory --
As we conoscenti say, it is a grand head, and in nature's best manner. On
canvass it would fetch twenty guineas, but on the shoulders of a poor soldier
nobody will give sixpence for it -- throw this to the devil -- no -- suppose,
instead, I try to get my name inserted in a better catalogue. -- Sir, your most
obedient -- this fine sharp air gives a keen appetite.


Eger. It does indeed.


Ros. Comical place this Bond Street -- brilliant equipages dashing along --
most of the owners though are in the predicament of your coat -- rather out at
the elbows.


Eger. Sir!


Ros. I don't mean to offend. -- You seem a stranger; give me leave, sir, to
show you the lions -- that small gentleman, with a large coronet, is a new peer
of ninety-seven -- that lady all the bucks are ogling, is an old woman of
ninety-seven -- that seven feet giant is a milliner -- that gentleman running
across the way to shake hands with a bailiss, is over head and ears in debt;
don't be surprised, he is in parliament -- in the phaeton with little ponies
fits a female gambler, and a great orator: The female gambler, the great
orator, and the little ponies are all upon sale, and may be knocked down to the
best bidder. -- I was once a delightful auctioneer -- my present trade is
buckism -- pray, sir what may your trade be?


Eger. Alexander's!


Ros. By my soul it is an interesting picture, and it shall not be my fault if it
has not a gilt frame. Sir will you have the goodness to lend me twenty pounds?


Eger. Do you mean to insult me?


Ros. I do not indeed -- will you then have the goodness to let me lend you
twenty pounds.


Eger. No, sir.


Ros. Proud as Lucifer -- I Will lose some money to him -- a remarkable clear
bright sun-shiny day.


Eger. Yes.


Ros. I Will bet you ten pounds it rains --


Eger. Madman -- leave me.


Ros. Leave you! oh very well -- if you insist -- good bye to you.

( drops his purse, which Egerton picks up.)
Eger. Sir; here is a purse which you dropped.


Ros. I dropped -- oh! you fly dog -- Is that your trick -- ring dropping -- a
brilliant and a draft -- I understand it all -- my dear fellow it will not do --
oh for shame of yourself.

[Exit.
Eger. A most extraordinary character, but benevolence fills his heart, and I
will not insult it, by refusing to take from his purse such benefits as nature
so strongly craves.

( Sally crosses the stage singing a ballad, "'It Is of a sailor that I write,
Who on the s:eas took great delight.")
Do my eyes deceive me -- my sister's servant in England. Sally!


Sally. ( turning round and running into his arms.) Oh! my dear master; alive!
-- he! he! he! -- ah! but you are not well.


Eger. Not quite well --


Sally. And in poverty.


Eger. Oh! it is the soldier's lean inheritance. He must feel nothing a
misfortune -- but disgrace. But tell me -- why do I meet you in England --
surely, Sally, you have not deserted Maria?


Sally. I desert her! -- have you received no letter?


Eger. None. You seem agitated -- is my sister well?


Sally. Yes -- heaven bless her --


Eger. Then I guess the cause -- she is married? -- ( she looks perplexed,) --
Ah! did thou not hear me -- she is then married? -- (a pause.) -- no answer
-- damnation -- the thought is madness. -- On thy foul, I charge thee, speak.
Is she a wife? -- yet silent -- oh! while strength and reason hold -- 'lead me
to her.

[Exeunt.
SCENE III. -- An Apartment in GREVILLE'S house.
Enter Mrs. GREVILLE. Eger. ( without.) Where is she?


Mrs. Grev. Ah! that voice. -- It is my brother?


Enter EGERTON -- he sinks into a chair. Eger. Stand off. -- Mrs. Grev. What
means my brother?


Eger. Come not near me but answer. -- Art thou a wife?


Mrs. Grev. Ah! have I not sworn to conceal my marriage? -- Oh! William! --
pardon my silence -- I am most unhappy, yet most innocent.


Eger. The laws of honor are simple unsophisticated -- thou art an angel, or
-- it is plain -- I see the burning blash of guilt -- and are my sufferings for
thee thus repaid?


Mrs. Grev. Sufferings! oh! tell me --


Eger. I will tell thee, for thou have deserved to know them -- When I had
given thee all, I sought my fortunes in a German regiment in the pay of
England; we were ordered to the West Indies -- there, slowly recovering from
the pestilential fever of the island, my emaciated state would not allow me to
dress in the ranks with my usual alacrity; the consequence was, that from the
cane of a young ensign I received on my shoulders a blow. ( rising.) Yes, a
blow -- in the paroxism of madness I felled him with the earth, ( sinks again
into the chair.) Yet, it was cowardly in me, for it was a boy that struck me.


Mrs. Grev. Oh!

( weeps.)
Eger. The punishment of death I was prepared to meet -- but Maria! picture the
agony of this proud heart, when I was ordered to the halberts -- yes, to be
punished with ignominy.


Mrs. Grev. Oh! my brother.


Eger. I shall soon conclude -- I flew with desperation on my guard, hoping
from them to meet the death I longed for -- I was deceived, they favored my
escape -- at that moment thy image rushed upon my heart, and nature bade me
struggle with my fate, and find a sister -- I have found her, and may the heavy
curse --


Mrs. Grev. ( catching his arm.) Oh! do not curse me -- suspend it but a day --
an hour -- grant me this, William, or you do not love me.


Eger. Not love thee! -- unhappy girl -- even now spite of it is wrongs, my
heart throbs as it would burst to meet thee. -- Yes -- one embrace, for her
honored sake who bore thee -- no more -- curse on my feeble nature.

( sinks into the chair.)
Mrs. Grev. Ah! you look saint.


Eger. It is not strange -- I have not lately tasted food.


Mrs. Grev. Oh! William, protect your valued life -- take this -- on my knees
let me entreat it --


Eger. ( rising with a smile of dignified disdain, and dropping the purse.) Do
not insult me, girl!


Mrs. Grev. Indeed I meant it not, -- Oh! Greville, come and save my heart from
breaking.


Eger. Greville! ah! -- that then is the villain's name.

[Exit hastly.
Mrs. Grev. Oh stay! -- my brother -- hear me!

[Exit, following.
SCENE IV. -- An Apartment at UNDERMINE'S.
Enter ROSE. Rose. Heigh ho! no information yet of my dear Egerton; I fear to
enquire for him, for should my guardian, Undermine, know of my attachment, I
should become the object of his fixed malevolence. -- pshaw -- here comes his
nephew to make love to me.


Enter ROSTRUM. Ros. There she stands.


Rose. (sings.) "Deel take the wars, that hurried Willie from me."


Ros. Who the devil is Willie -- I feel very awkward.

( aside.) How do you do ma'am?


Rose. Now for a specimen of a modern lover.


Ros. I hear, ma'am, you have a charming estate.


Rose. A modern lover indeed -- which estate, in my opinion, sir, you value
above it is merits.


Ros. I beg your pardon, ma'am -- no -- when I am called in to value an estate,
I --


Rose. Sir! --


Ros. Zounds! no, ma'am; what I wish to speak of is quite another article, I
mean quite another lot -- I mean quite another affair -- it is not the fine
estate in Worcestershire; but,

( blushing.) but the holy estate of matrimony, ma'am.


Rose. Well sir, what of it? -- pray speak?


Ros. ( aside.) I am tongue-tied -- it is damned hard, I can only preach in my
own pulpit.


Rose. What did you say, sir?


Ros. I said ma'am, that -- I Will try my uncle's way.

( nods to her.) You understand?


Rose. Indeed I do not.


Ros. Nor I neither.

( aside.) -- Ma'am!


Rose. Sir!


Ros. I say --

( aside.) I have it -- I Will pour forth a torrent of eloquence. -- Oh! miss,
believe me, I despise riches -- ah! how blessed should I be to live with you in
a retired and peaceful cottage; situate in a delightful sporting country, with
attached and detached offices, roomy cellaring, and commodious attics.


Rose. Sir!


Ros. Together would we inhale the vernal breeze in an acre and a half of
garden ground, crammed with esculents and choice fruit trees -- well stocked
and cropped.


Rose. The poor man is mad.


Ros. With content smiling round us. I would not languish fortown enjoyments --
no -- though situated only an agreeable distance from the turnpike road, with the
accommodation of a stage coach passing daily to London.


Rose. But sir, I hate a cottage -- and when I marry --


Ros. The premises may be viewed with tickets, and immediate possession had.


Rose. Quite -- quite mad. --


Ros. Well, miss -- after all that, don't you love me?


Rose. No --

( sings.) "The pride of all nature was sweet Willie O!"

Ros. Damn Willie -- my name is Tom.


Rose. Tom, is it? ha, ha!


Ros. She is a sweet creature -- perhaps, ma'am, your heart has been previously
disposed of by private contract?


Rose. It has --

( sings.) "He would be a soldier, would sweet Willie O."

Ros. Oh! Willie is a soldier is he? then what chance has a simple auctioneer,
with his little hammer, against a soldier with his long sword -- so ma'am, you
cannot bid for me -- I mean you cannot love me?


Rose. No, sir.


Ros. What a pity -- is there no agreeable attitude I could put myself into --
no way -- what would I give for one kiss.


Rose. I Will tell you how you may obtain twenty.


Ros. How?


Rose. By giving up the lover, and assuming a character I am sure you will
succeed in -- a sincere friend.


Ros. Indeed! thank you -- quite happiness enough for me -- only place me next
to Sweet Willie O in your heart, and I am satisfied -- what shall I say -- I Will
serve you with fidelity -- pugh! -- that I would do for any body else -- I Will
-- I Will fight for you; and that I would not do for any body else.


Rose. Oh! sir, could I but learn where my soldier is --


Ros. I Will run and enquire at the War Office.


Rose. ( embracing him.) Thank you, dear sir.


Ros. Oh charming -- farewell. Would it not be as well though if I knew his name,
because, if I ask, the clerks for Sweet Willie O! they may not comprehend --


Rose. True! true! -- his name is William Egerton.


Ros. Happy fellow -- one more friendly hug.


Enter at opposite doors UNDERMINE and APRIL. April. Hey-day!


Und. ( aside.) There Is management -- he will do -- he will do.


April. More vexation! -- Shame girl -- in the arms of a stranger! --


Und. He is my nephew -- will be my heir -- and he is a very clever fellow.

(Rostrum nods.)
April. He has a queer way of showing it.


Und. A tolerable well-looking man, is not he?


April. I cannot tell.


Und. He has an excellent heart.


April. I don't know.


Und. Do you think I would deceive you.


April. I cannot say -- you may be all alike -- my grandson has ruined my
fortune -- Greville has ruined my happiness, and, perhaps, I may find him a
coxcomb -- my Rose ungrateful -- and you a scoundrel -- so I Will to the country
again, and in the mean time, my dear, you shall see as much of this virtuous
town as you possibly can, out of a two pair of stairs window.

(Rose, and Rostrum kiss their hands to each other.) [ Exeunt April and Rose.
Und. You are a clever fellow -- an exceeding clever fellow. -- I say, how did
you manage to win her so soon.


Ros. I don't know -- I believe I have an odd agreeable tickling way with me.
Did you never see me coax the ladies to bid at my auctions? -- adieu uncle --


Und. Come back, sir -- I cannot part with you -- this match with management, I
conclude, is as good as settled.


Ros. Exactly.


Und. Very well -- now you must get a mistress --


Ros. A what?


Und. A mistress -- you rascal -- do you blush?


Ros. I blush! -- sir, I blush to think, that you should think, that I should
think of blusliing

( fanning himself with his hat.) -- only getting a mistress, when a man is
going to be married --


Und. Well, sir.


Ros. I can only say the necessity of it does not strike me.


Und. Necessity! -- I tell you it is the etiquette.


Ros. Oh! the etiquette is it?


Und. Now for my grand attack on Greville -- follow me, sir.

[Exit.
Ros. This will never do for me. Oh! I foresee a dissolution of partnership
here -- but he is a relation -- what then -- am I therefore to sacrifice
principle to duty -- no -- I remember our school adage was "Amicus Plato sed
majis amica veritas;" which I thus interpret -- Undermine is my uncle, but
integrity is my father.

[Exit.
ACT IV.
SCENE I. -- A Library in Greville's House.
Servant introduces UNDERMINE and ROSTRUM. Und. Tell your master I wait for him
--


Ser. My master is from home -- I will acquaint my mistress with your arrival
--

[Exit.
Und. A noble mansion, is not it?


Ros. A charming tenement indeed. What is the ground rent?


Und. How should I know? Here she comes. What think you of this encumbrance
with it, eh? Is not she beautiful?


Ros. Very; but she seems unhappy.


Und. It Is the more incumbent in you then to endeavor to make her otherwise --


Enter Servant. Ser. My mistress.

[Exit.
Enter Mrs. GREVILLE. Mrs. Grev. Gentlemen, I expect Mr. Greville home every
moment. Oh, would he were come!

( aside.)
Und. Madam, Mr. Rostrum, my nephew -- now address her.


Ros. But she is in tears, sir.


Und. What Is that to you, sir? tears! nonsense! Is she not a mistress?


Ros. Is she not a woman?


Und. Come let us have a specimen of the agreeable tickling way you were
talking of.


Ros. [ approaching her.) What shall I say? Ma'am, what a capital room, ma'am,
this would be for a sale.


Mrs. Grev. ( with surprise.) Very probably, sir


Ros. That is all, ma'am.


Und. God's Death, is that your tickling way? Make love to her, you rascal.


Ros. Yes, sir.


Und. Be sprightly.


Ros. Yes, sir.


Und. Dance up to her, you dog.


Ros. Yes, sir.

( addressing Mrs. Greville in a melencholy tone.) You are the most charming
creature.


Mrs. Grev. Sir!

( shrinking in the alarm.) -- [ Enter Greville.) Oh, I am glad you are
returned.


Grev. What is the matter?


Mrs. Grev. Nothing.


Grev. No insult has been offered?


Mrs. Grev. No -- I am so timid -- indeed, quite childish; but Oh! I have a
tale to tell you, Charles. Yet that wretch shall not triumph in our agitation.
No -- until he is gone I am calm.


Grev. Matchltss girl! Come, sir, dispatch.


Und. My nephew, sir.

(Greville bows.) If I can but put him off his guard. -- Now is your time.

( to Rostrum.)
GREVILLE and UNDERMINE sit at a table, with their eyes fixed on ROSTRUM, who
addresses Mrs. GREVILLE in dumb show. -- She appears disiressed at his
attentions. Und. These, sir, are the ready money securities. Bonds to the
amount of L 5,000.

(Greville snatching the papers, and eagerly returning to his observation.)
Bravo!

( eying Rostrum and Mrs. Greville.) else are exchequer bills -- that is an
India bond.


Grev. ( quitting his chair and running to his wife.) I cannot bear it. It Is
torture insupportable! I will declare thy innocence. -- Poverty, death I can
endure; but not thy tears, Maria. Mr, Undermine. --


Mrs.Grev. Hold -- Greville --!


Enter SALLY. Sally. Stand aside; here comes somebody will soon tell who is
who. I Will get out of the way.

[Exit.
Enter EGERTON. Eger. Who answers to the name of Greville?


Grev. I do.


Eger. Give me your hand.


Grev. What do you mean?


Eger. ( seizing his hand.) The gripe of everlasting friendship -- for it is
death must part us. You are a villain,

( presants pistols. Greville snatches one, Mrs. Greville rushes between 'em.)
Mrs.Grev. Oh my brother!


Grev. Brother!

( throws away his pistol.)
Mrs.Grev. Oh raise not your arm against --

( pauses.)
Eger. Who?

( Mrs. Greville pauses.)
Grev. Her husband.


Eger. and Und. Her husband!


Grev. Yes; spite of the poverty that name entails on me, spite of impending
ruin, my heart triumphantly exults in proclaiming her my loved, my honored wife!

( kneeling to her.) By my soul, Maria, I would not raise another blush upon
that angel cheek to purchase the world's dominion.


Und. Then the estate is mine. Strut, you dog.

( to Rostrum.)
Ros. I do, sir.

( reluctantly.)
Eger. My darling sister! my pride! let me now hold thee to my heart with
raptur.

( puts his handkerchief to his eyes!)
Und. Tears from a soldier!

( sneeringly.)
Eger. Unfeeling man! did net tears of joy start from me at beholding beauty
and innocence restored to their native luster, I were unworthy of the name of
soldier. And, sir, it may be prudent for you to remember, that a soldier's
heart is like his sword, formed of tempered steel; for while it bends with
sympathizing pity to the touch of woe, it can resume its springing energy to
punish arrogance, or crush oppression.


Ros. Strut, uncle!


Und. No, no -- a little is very well. It would not be feeling. When will it be
convenient Mr. Greville to give possession?


Grev. Immediately,

( with spirit.)
Und. I say -- I Will triumph by and by -- at present we'll go home, shug and
quiet. Ten thousand a year, here is management, you dog.

[Exit.
Eger. ( to Rostrum who is following.) Sir, allow me with gratitude to return
this purse. You will find that I have greatly benefited by your generosity.


Ros. Nay, don't.


Eger. I insist, sir.


Ros. Conceited fellow! but I must away to enquire for Sweet Willie O.


Grev. Come, Mr. Egerton.


Ros. ( turning round.) Egerton! did I hear rightly? Sir, one word, if you
please. Will you take this purse again?


Eger. No, sir.


Ros. You will not! We'll see that. Have you forgot a lady called Rose Sydney?


Eger. Have I forgot her!

( sighing.)


Ros. I have just parted from her, and she said -- will you take this purse?


Eger. Excuse me -- but tell me --


Ros. She said -- you had better take it, or the devil a word will you get out
of me.


Eger. Well, well.

( takes it.)
Ros. Now you are an honest fellow again -- she loves you -- sincerely -- and
if you will meet me in an hour in Berkley Square, she shall tell you so.


Eger. Don't trifle with my feelings.


Ros. By heaven, I am serious. You shall have a kiss, and I Will have another.
And I say -- bring a parson with you.


Eger. I don't know any. Who will introduce me?


Ros. Who will introduce you to a parson! look at your friend in your right
hand, my dear fellow -- he is gentleman usher to all mankind, in court or in
city. -- In public, he will escort you to a great man in his state chamber, or
in private to a pretty woman in her bed chamber.

[Exit.
Mrs. Grev. You are not happy, Greville.


Grev. Yes, Maria -- though berest of fortune; though a prison opens its gates to
receive us, yet blessed with thy love, and my heart's approbation, I feel that
I am happy. Accept my homage, Oh, celestial virtue! Nature's sweet nurse -- 'ts
thou alone can pour a healing balm upon the wounded spirit, and lull the
throbbing heart to rest.


Enter SALLY. Sally. ( speaking as the enters) Oh, now it is Mrs, Greville, is
it? Did not I say it would be so? Now every thing is as it should be, and my
tongue can wag again.

( to Egerton.) Oh my dear master -- Well, you must tell me how you have been,
and where you have been, and -- sir

( to Greville) I am entirely satisfied with your conduct, and to show I am
perfectly reconciled, you may if you please

( she wipes her mouth, Greville smiles, and salutes her.) But here am I
talking a heap of nonsense, while he wants rest and refreshment.


Mrs. Grev. Oh true.


Eger. Maria! how could I mistake the glow of virtue for the blush of guilt!
This lovely cheek resembles that of the chalte queen of night, which can only
be illumined by a ray from heaven. Come, my sister.

( takes her band; Sally on the other side presents hers; be smiles takes it,
and exeunt.)
Grev. Ah! here comes my early, my excellent old friend. Circumstances obliged
me to behave hardly to him; but I know the way to his honest heart.


Enter APRIL. April. ( softly.) Huzza! he is my own bey again. Ecod, I could
jump over the moon. But he shall not see my joy, that is -- if I can help it. Ha,
ha! No, he has insulted my regard for him, and it demands satisfaction.


Grev. Well, good April --!


April. ( assuming sulkiness.) Called for orders, sir.


Grev. Sir! is that language to a friend, to your own boy? Come, if I have been
a little frolicsome, pray who was my instructor?


April. ( stifling a laugh, and appearing sulky.) I don't know.


Grev. No -- don't you remember the mischievous pranks you taught me?


April. Yes -- Ha, ha! -- No I don't.


Grev. What! not making me fill the apothecary's boots with cold water?


April. ( aside) He, he, he!

( sulkily.) It was not cold water, it was hot hasty-pudding.


Grev. True; and then April, in our shooting excursions, how you assisted me in
climbing the hills. I think I feel at this moment the pressure of your friendly
hand upon my infant fingers. I wonder how it would feel now.

( presents his hand.)
April. ( no longer able to resist his joy, turns round and embraces him.) Oh!
my dear Charley boy!

( sobbing.) Now you shall see how merry an old man can be, ha, ha --! The old
pye-balled poney is dead though. Ecod, I Will tell you a good joke. My dog of a
grandson has spent every shilling I am worth, ha, ha --! But you look grave.


Grev. Have I not reason?


April. What reason?


Grev. Are you, then, ignorant, that by my marriage I forfeit my father's
estate to Mr. Undermine?


April. Eh! what! forfeit! It Is impossible.


Grev. Such is my father's will.


April. That your father's will? Then my old master, heaven rest his soul, is
gone to the devil to a certainty. But Undermine cannot think of keeping it.


Grev. Ah, you then know little of Mr. Undermine.


April. But I will know him, aye thoroughly. There must be villainy. I Will to him
directly. -- He

possess the Greville estate -- no, no! Though his majesty has not a more
peaceable subject in his dominions than myself, yet, rather than that, I would
throttle him to a certainty. Come, come, cheer up. That Is right -- don't droop;
for while the left side is the stoutest, I warrant it will some how contrive to
prop up the other.

[Exeunt severally.
SCENE II. -- An Apartment in UNDERMINE'S house.
Enter UNDERMINE meeting ROSTRUM. Und. Well, nephew, I am a made man; and if I
could but see you married to Miss Sydney.


Ros. ( aside.) Now for a little swaggering! -- Make yourself easy. I mean to
marry her in an hour.


Und. The devil you do! But how will you get April's consent?


Ros. ( snapping his fingers.) That for his consent. I Will carry her off.


Und. You don't say so!


Ros. I will -- sink me!


Und. But are you sure of her consent?


Ros. I don't care that for her consent neither. I Will carry her off, whether
she will or no.


Und. Amazing! I didn't think it was in you. But, I say -- you must have
somebody to asist in carrying her off.


Ros. I will -- I Will get two of our auction-porters, careful fellows -- Carried
home a Venus the other day without the smallest fracture.


Und. Nonsense! -- They will not do.


Ros. No! Then I Will get an officer in the army to ass;is it me in the elopement.


Und. That Is right -- they are used to it. Now for management! Take that.
Observe -- that key --


Ros. Is a patent one.


Und. Psha! It opens the escrutoire up-stairs. In the right hand drawer you
will find the title deeds of her estate, which April put into my care; and
possession --


Ros. Is every thing. -- Bravo! This is luck indeed.

( aside.)
Und. But stay -- I musl not seem to consent to your carrying her off.


Ros. Certainly not.


Und. I must resist you, and you must push me about.


Ros. I will.


Und. Ah! but may I depend on you?


Ros. You may, upon my foul. Good bye, ha, ha!


Und. I say -- this is management.


Ros. It is.


Und. You Will trick the old one.


Ros. I mean it, I assure you, ha, ha!

[Exit.
Und. I did not think it was in him.


Enter NICHOLAS. Nich. I give you joy, sir, with all my heart and soul.


Und. Aye, Nicholas, it is all settled, so say no more about it. All quite
settled.


Nich. Except the one thousand pound, sir.


Und. What? Oh, true. But at present I have not any cash in the house.


Nich. A check on your banker, sir.


Und. Eh! But without pen and ink --


Nich. Here they are, sir.


Und. Well, well -- a thousand pounds is not it?


Nich. And interest.


Und. Interest! -- It has not been due an hour.


Nich. A little interest, sir.


Und. How much?


Nich. Five hundred pounds, sir.


Und. ( aside.) Here Is a damned villain. -- There Is no need for hurry.


Nich. I am an old man, and have no time to lose.

( presenting the pen.)
Und. ( avoiding him.) You must hire servants.


Nich. I will, sir.

( pursuing with pen.)
Und. I mean to sup in my new mansion.


Nich. You shall, sir.


Und. And let me have a band of music --


Nich. I Will go directly. I can hire them in St. James's street.


Und. Aye, go directly, Nicholas.


Nich. And as your banker lives in Pall Mall, it will be quite handy.


Und. By and by.


Nich. It must be paid directly; for being due for a little roguery, it of
course becomes a debt of honor.


Enter APRIL (unobserved.) Und. Zounds! don't teize so. Interestforsooth!
Consider what an enormous sum a thousand pounds is, for only just popping a
will into the fire. I will not be hurried, I tell you.

[Exit.
Nich. And if I had popped it into the fire, what a pretty way I should be in.
Ah! you had no such fool to deal with. No, it is sewed up safe here in my coat.
By day the comforter of my heart, by night the companion of my pillow; and it
shall not be burnt till the thousand pounds is paid. Aye, and with swinging
interest too. ( alarmed.) Ah! Mr. April, I did not see you.


April. What do you say? -- I am very deaf.


Nich. I am devilish glad of it. Then all is snug.


April. Burnt will!

( aside)
Nich Mr. April. --


April. How to fathom it --

( aside.)
Nich. I say, I shall be steward now -- it is a great undertaking; but I suppose
I shall contrive not to lose much by it.


April. I dare say you will. -- A thousand pounds.


Nich. Prepare the tenants for my arrival.


April. Yes; I Will tell them old Nick is coming among them. What the devil did
he say about sewing up?


Nich. The country air may be of service.


April. Yes, with the'help of that, you may live some weeks.


Nich. Oh dear! some weeks -- A large quantity of years, you mean? Well, good
bye, April.

( they embrace, and April lays his hand on the left side, where the will is
depcsited.)
April. Eh -- what -- By heaven I felt something like parchment -- If it
should, be -- I Will be convinced -- Good bye, Nick -- a last embrace.

( embraces him closely, and feels for the parchment.)
Nich. It Is suffocation!


April. It Is parchment.


Nich. Zounds! it had like to have been a last embrace indeed.


April. How shall I get at that parchment? I can easily persuade him he is ill
-- perhaps by that means -- I Will try -- once more.


Nich. No, no -- there is my hand.


April. ( taking it.) Eh! -- what! good God!


Nich. What is the matter?


April. Let me look at you -- good God! -- don't be alarmed.


Nich. But I am very much alarmed. Am I ill?


April. ( shakes his head.) I dare say you feel -- flurried.


Nich. Exceedingly.


April. Palpitation at the heart' -- it is parchment?


Nich. Oh yes -- very sudden this. I felt quite well just now.


April. Did you? That Is an alarming symptom; for I have always observed, that
nothing makes the physcian look so grave, as the patient's saying he feels
quite well. My dear friend, send for one directly.


Nich. I don't know what to say, They sometimes save your life; but then it is
sure to cost you a guinea.


April. ( aside.) And saving yours is certainly not worth it. But I see you are
a philosopher -- You are prepared for death,


Nich. Oh dear! not at all -- I am quite terrified. If perspiration is good for
me, I feel that copiously. -- What shall I do?


April. Come, for old acquaintance sake, my grandson shall attend you gratis.


Nich. Oh, thank you.


April. Wonderful physician! Never lost a patient --! ( aside.) because he
never had a patient to lose. I expect him here in five minutes. You had better
go to your room.


Nich. Aye.


April. Keep yourself warm.


Nich. I will.


April. Above all things, don't change your clothes.


Nich. I will not.


April. Shall I button your coat?


Nich. No, no -- I Will do that myself.


April. Go, I Will follow, and talk to you of your latter end, and keep up your
spirits.


Nich. I believe I am dying. It Is very good of you to get me a doctor gratis, (
exit, and reenters.) But I say -- who is to pay the apothecary?


April. I Will settle that too. -- ( Exit Nicholas.) -- Now for Undermine -- If
he have one spark of humanity in his composition, I Will call it forth; if not,
and I can get that coat --


Enter UNDERMINE Und. Nicholas! What April here -- I guess your errand, and am
sorry, sir, I cannot continue you as steward.


April. ( aside.) I your steward! No, that is not my errand, I am a feeble
fellow, sliding out of the world; but Greville is a noble fellow rising into
it. It Is respecting him I come. You must assist him. How is he to live?


Und. ( Sneeringly.) Oh! his integrity will support him.


April. True; but consider what a way you would be in, if you had nothing but
your integrity to support you.


Und. Sir, I see you only want to triflle with me.


April. True; I only want a trifle of you.


Und. I am flint.


April. Well; but even flint, when properly hit, will send forth warm, vivid
sparks.


Und. I must leave you. Time presses.


April. So do his wants.


Und. A nobleman is waiting for me.


April. A bailiff is waiting for him.


Und. If you proceed, expect some personal insult.


April. Throw your purse at me. Come --

( Takes hold of his coat.)
Und. I shall burst with rage.


April. They will famish with hunger.


Und. Unhand me, I say.

( strikes April from him.)
April. What, a blow!

( with subdued irritation.)
Und. Yes; take him that.


April. No, no, that you meant for myself, and I Will take it, so you will give
something better to poor Greville.


Und. I will not.


April. ( shaking him.) You scoundrel! And do you suppose, that because I would
submit to a blow to endeavor to save a friend from ruin, that I want the
spirit of a man to resent an indignity. Ask my pardon.


Und. Pardon!


April. Aye.


Und. I do -- help! help!


April. On your knees, or your last hour is come.


Und. Well, I do -- I do, Help! help!


Enter Two Servants. -- April throws Undermine from him, who retreats behind
the Servants. Und. Leave my house, sir, leave my house. By heaven, I Will be
revenged.


April. By hell, you are a villain.


[Exeunt, severally. ACT V.
SCENE I. -- Outside of UNDERMINE'S house.
Enter ROSTRUM and EGERTON with caution. Ros. That is the house.


Eger. Does that contain --


Ros. Softly -- recollect, sir, you are only a subaltern in this affair, and
that I am your commanding officer; so, obey orders.


Eger. How do you intend to proceed?


Ros. I am too great a general to communicate my plan of operations; I shall do
my duty in giving you possession of the lovely citadel, and then take care and
do your duty. ( going.) I say, when the alarm is given, do you retreat -- you
know how to do that, I dare say.


[Exit into the house. Eger. I fear to trust my happiness. Can it be possible
that my adored girl still thinks with kindness on her poor Egerton? Ah! a noise
-- what an anxious moment!

( retires.)
Enter Rostrum from the house, with Miss SYDNEY in one band, and repelling
UNDERMINE with the other. Ros. I will carry her off.


Und. You shall not, sir, I am her guardian.


Ros. Do you think I care for guardians? dare to stir hand or foot, and I Will
crush you into atoms, you old scoundrel. ( during this, Egerton discovers
himself to Miss Sydney, who runs into his arms.)


[They Exuant.] Und. That will do -- zounds! be quiet -- they are gone, I tell
you.


Ros. Eh! so they are, ha, ha! -- well, how did I do it?


Und. Oh, capitally -- (rubbing his arm.) has the soldier got her?


Ros. Yes.


Und. That Is as it should be.


Ros. Exactly.


Und. Well!


Ros. Well!


Und. Are you mad?


Ros. What is the matter?


Und. The matter! why don't you go?


Ros. Where?


Und. Why zounds! how can you marry the girl if you stand here.


Ros. I marry! oh, very true. I declare it quite escaped me.


Und. 'Sdeath! run.


Ros. I am a-going, a-going, a-going -- (returning.) Sir! where shall I bring
the bride?


Und. To Greville's. Go along.


Ros. (returning.) I say -- this is management.


Und Yes, yes -- but go along.


Ros. (returning.) Sir, you would make a capital puff at an auction.


Und. Zounds! go. ( exit Rostrum.) So that is settled -- and now to Greville's
in triumph. I Will walk in with erected crest, and -- ugh! confound the fellow,
how he has bruised me!


Exit. SCENE II. -- An Apartment at Mr. UNDERMINE'S.
NICHOLAS discovered on a couch. APRIL sitting by him with a book. Nich. I wish
the doctor were come. -- Bless me, I hope I shall not die -- I don't care what
pain I suffer, so I don't die. Oh! for a swinging rheumatism that would last me
twenty years -- do read a little to me.


April. (reading.) "Crumbs of comfort for an aged sinner."


Nich. These books are quite new to me.


Enter PLETHORA. April. (apart to Plethora.) Have you had my letter?


Pleth. Yes.


April. Don't forget -- it is the coat I want -- and remember you are a
physician, not a farrier.


Pleth. I will -- and if I succeed, remember you tip. How do you do?


Nich. That Is what I want to know of you.


Pleth. True -- oh I see --


Nich. Shall I detail my symptoms?


Pleth. No -- it is a clear case -- if you were to talk for an hour, I should
not know more of your complaint than I do at present.


April. (apart.) Bleed him --


Pleth. (feels his pulse.) I will. You have no objection to part with a little
blood?


Nich. I have an objection to part with any thing.


Pleth. Except to advantage. Now, if by sinking an ounce or two of blood, you
can produce an income of sixteen pounds of flesh, the advantage is immense.


Nich. How sensibly he talks! why, it is five thousand per cent profit. I Will be
bled directly.

(taking off his coat.)
Pleth. Help him.


Nich. No, no, I can do that myself. ( places the coat carefully under the
cushion of the sopha. -- As he sits down, April slips the coat from under the
cushion, winks to Plethora, and exit on tiploe.) It Is very terrifying -- I Will
read a little more. But, doctor, are you sure now I shall not be suddenly
called to heaven.


Pleth. I am very sure of that.


Nich. Oh, you are. (throwing away the book.) Then, pray, sir, what is my
complaint?


Pleth. Complaint! what shall I say? I wish he would return -- oh, it is the --
the glanders.


Nich. The glanders! zounds! do you make a horse of me?


Pleth. No -- we will be content with making an ass of you. (aside.) -- ( Enter
April with the coat and will, which he exhibits to Plethora in triumph.) Or
perhaps the disorder may be seated in the coats belonging to the stomach.


April. (coming forward.) No, no -- the disorder was seated in the coat
belonging to the back, ha, ha! but now it is removed, (throwing him his coat.)
Do you see this?

(showing the will.)
Nich. I am undone.


April. And how the devil could you expect a moment's ease with such a thing as
this laying next your heart -- you may go -- you are quite cured.


Nich. Cured! I am ruined. Oh! if I had but touched the thousand pounds, I
would not mind the interest -- perhaps it is not too late.


April (examining the will.) Sole heir without reservation or restriction;
huzza!


Nich. Sir, honorable sir, will you allow me to ask you one small favor?


April. What is it?


Nich. Only to delay mentioning this (sighing.) joyful discovery for a few
moments. My master and I have a little account to settle, and I should like
just to strike a balance before he knows what has happened.


April. Oh, I understand -- we have bled you, and now you want to go and bleed
him.


Nich. Just a little, sir.


April. With all my heart, old Nick. Devil claw devil.


Nich. Oh, thank you, sir.


April. But dispatch --


Nich. I fly, sir.


Exit hobbling. April. Now with heels as light as our hearts we'll away to
Greville's.


Pleth. Stop -- stop for me, grandfather.


April. I beg your pardon, old one. Here take my arm -- let your grandfather
assist you. Upon my soul, I quite forget you.


Exeunt. SCENE III. -- An elegant Drawing room in GREVILLE'S house,
illuminated. -- A band of music playing. -- A number of Servants dressed in
splendid liveries.
Enter UNDERMINE in great elation, joining the music in, "See the conquering
hero," etc. Und. Approach! is Greville gone?


Serve. Not yet, sir.


Und. Any of my guests arrived?


Serve. No, sir.


Und. Has the Traiteur furnished a splendid entertainment?


Serve. Yes, sir.


Und. Let music usher in the guests.

(music plays.)
Enter APRIL singing -- "See the conquering hero," and. flourishing the will in
his hand; seeing Undermine, he conceals it. Und. Zounds! he here. -- ( to the
Servant.) -- Don't go away, sir.


( places the Servant between him and April.) April. How do you do?


Und. How do you do?

(with alarm.)
April. I have overcome my passion, and thought better.


Und. Oh, very well -- then it is all over.


April. Yes.


Und. (to the Servant.) You impudent rascal, how dare you stand between me and
my friend? -- Begone, you scoundrel! -- I thought you would see the absurdity
of my supporting Greville.


April. Oh yes; it would have been quite out of character.


Music plays. Rostrum, singing -- "See the conquering hero," etc. enters
leading in EGERTON and ROSE SYDNEY. April. Heyday! my ward here! why, girl --?

(goes up to her, and they converse in dumb show.)
Und. (to Rostrum.) Come here -- come here -- give me your hand, you dog -- I
suppose it is all settled.


Ros. It is -- the wedding's over.


Und. I say -- what will that old fool April say, I wonder?


Ros. We shall hear.


April. (to Miss Sydney.) I understand. Mr. Undermine, have you given our ward
permission to marry?


Und. To be sure I have.


April. If that be the case, my dear, you have mine.


Eger. Gentlemen, I thank you.


Und. He thank me! what has he to do with it. Oh! I forgot he helped you to
this delicious morsel.


Ros. No, he did not; he helped himself -- and what is more, persuaded a parson
to say grace.


Und. Egerton her husband! Did not I order you to marry her? Did not I bid --


Ros. You did bid, sir; but honor bid more.


April. I give you joy, my girl. You have chosen a noble fellow.


Und. Well, and I give her joy, for she has chosen a beggar.


Ros. On that point I beg to be heard. You remember you gave me a key -- here
it is.


Und. Well, sir?


Ros. It belonged, ladies and gentlemen, to an escrutoire, with a secretary
drawer. Pannells richly fineered -- scrole pediment head -- bracket feet -- the
whole finished in a workmanlike manner, and well worth the attention --


Und. At the auctioneer again. Zounds! you are so fond of it, I dare say you
would sell me.


Ros. Sir, I would knock you down with all the pleasure in life.


Und. But what of the key? -- the key --


Ros. The key certainly opened the drawer you mentioned; and it as certainly
opened a drawer you did not mention.


Und. What?


Ros. Be quiet. There I found a parcel of papers, and title deeds, which you
must have put there entirely by mistake, my dear sir, because I perceived they
belonged to Mr. Egerton.


Und. Give them to me directly, directly -- I say, sir, restore --


Ros. Every thing to its right owner. Certainly -- I don't wish to keep your,
or any man's property -- so, Egerton, there are your papers again -- and,
Uncle, there is your key again.


April. Ha, ha!


Eger. What disinterested integrity!


Und. What damned rascality!


Ros. Oh fie! no, no.


Und. What is it then?


Ros. Management.


Und. Well, you have managed finely for yourself however -- I discard you. Had
you followed my instructions, you would have been exalted --


Ros. To the pillory, I suppose. -- No sir, though you don't scruple it to
others, far be it from me to rob you of your natural inheritance.


Und. I would have left you all I am worth.


Ros. What then? you forget all you are worth belongs to other people. When you
were gone, they would naturally ask me for their own, and how could I have the
face to refuse them?


April. Give me your hand. You have acted your part nobly; and now it is my turn.


Und. All this I laugh at. Am I not possessed of the Greville estate? Who has
any thing to say on that subject!


April. I believe I shall trouble you with a word or two.


Und. I see Greville is about to depart, and I must beg you will all follow his
example.


Enter Mr. and Mrs. GREVILLE, SALLY following with a small bundle, and weeping.
Eger. My best friends, allow me to present to you a sister. By this gentleman's
kindness, Maria, happiness again dawns upon us.


April. (aside.) And I will make it blaze with meridian splendor.


Grev. Let us then leave this man to the full enjoyment of such reflections as
his conscience may administer.


April. I beg your pardon a moment. Umph! Mr. Undermine, I hear doubts have
arisen respecting the authenticity of the late Mr. Greville's signature.


Und. (with a confident smile.) Indeed! -- Sir, to show my fairness, I Will leave
this point to your decision.

(showing the will.)
April. It Is genuine, it must be confessed.


Und. Must it so?


April. Any objection to my reading it?


Und. None.


April. Perhaps it may tire you?


Und. By no means. I think it remarkably entertaining.


April. (substituting the second will, reads.) I, Robert Greville, do declare
this my last will. -- To my only son, Charles Greville, I give and bequeath my
forgiveness and my blessing, together with all my estates real and personal. --
Umph! that is very entertaining.


Und. Very -- but I prefer the remainder -- "Provided my said son" -- go on --
go on.


April. What do you say?


Und. 'Pshaw! -- "Provided my said son has not "contracted" -- why don't you go
on?


April. I don't see any thing like it.


Und. You don't -- ha, ha! Give me leave to direct your attention.

(looks at the will, drops his hat and cane, and groans deeply.)
Grev. What does this mean!


April. Mean! -- That my young master, my friend, my dear Charles, is happy --
that my old master is in heaven, and that I am in heaven; two wills were made;
by the last, which he endeavored to suppress, you are sole heir, without
reservation.


Mrs. Grev. Is it possible?


Grev. How shall I express my gratitude for this discovery? -- for giving
happiness to my Maria?


Sally. And to me too. Oh, you are a nice old man.


Und. He must have dealt with --


April. Old Nick. You are right -- I did -- and here he comes.


Enter Nicholas. Und. Ah, Nicholas -- Nicholas!


Nich. Ah, master -- master!


Und A dreadful affair this!


Nich. Very shocking indeed, sir.


Und. Eh -- zounds! I have given him a draft for a thousand pounds.
(coaxingly.) Nicholas -- Come here, Nicholas. I am not angry. My consolation
is, what is done, cannot be undone. I gave you a draft --


Nich. You did, sir. And my consolation is, what is done, cannot be undone.


Und. Indeed! But it will be of no use. I have no cash at my banker's.


Nich. Dear sir, what credit you have! They paid it without a word.


Und. (eagerly.) You have not been --


Nich. Yes, sir -- I just contrived to hobble there.


Und. You infernal! (gulping down his passion.) Old friends should not quarrel,
Nicholas; suppose we go home, and talk it over agreeably. I Will propose
something reasonable.


Nich. It must be very reasonable.


Und. It shall. Gentlemen --

(bowing.)
Ros. What, bowing! You forget, sir, your own lessons. -- Be erect, and I Will
tell you how you may be so; -- become an honest man, and on my life, that will
make you hold up your head more gallantly than the first dancing master in
Europe can; -- depend on it, sir. Roguery is the worst trade a man can follow;
for (to the credit of human nature) I sincerely believe, that where one fortune
is raised by pursuing the devious mazes of chicanery, a hundred are acquired by
walking in the simple path of industrious integrity.


Und. Indeed!


Nich. You had better stick to management!


Und. Management! -- Oh, I have had enough of that.


Exeunt Undermine and Nicholas. April. Now, being all as happy as heart can
wish, come along with me, Sally. Good bye to you --


Grev. Where are you going, April?


April. To the kitchen. I have no notion of your houses, not I, where all the
joy is confined to the drawing room. Let there be degrees in every thing but
happiness; and before George, if any servant in this house be sober enough to
wait on you at supper, I Will discharge him tomorrow morning. -- Poor fellows!
must not make them ill though Never mind -- Come along Sally.


Sally. Oh, you are a nice old man!


Exeunt April and Sally. Ros. (to Egerton and Greville.) If I must have thanks,
gentlemen, let me receive them here! -- (kissing the ladies' hands.) Happy
fellows! you are to be envied.


Mrs. Grev. So are you. We have received happiness, you have given it.


Rose. Your fortunes, sir, will be our peculiar care.


Ros Thank you, dear ladies; but, with your permission, I Will stick to my trade.

And oh! could all my prayers but gain this lot,
To raise my pulpit nightly on this spot;
Then your poor Auctioneer would prize his station,
While you vouchsafed one nod of approbation.

END OF THE COMEDY.
EPILOGUE.
SECRETS worth knowing -- Shall I tell you one?
Don't frown, or our poor Bard will be undone.
Change to a grin his present woeful phiz,
Last year he cured your Heart Ache, now cure his.
But leaving him, as we are left here alone,
Suppose I tell a secret of my own.
Know then, I think -- though women will be craving.
Your men-folks at the best are scarce worth having.
No more entire -- they go about by halves,
Like legs consumptive, that have lost their calves;
What with their crops, slouched gait, and short surtouts,
Half heads, half tails, half manners, and half boots.
A wife, or an old maid! Aye, that is the question;
Both bitter pills, and bad for our digestion;
The prim old maid detests all amorous hussies,
Her nursery's confined to pups and pussies;
Pug's her gallant, and her dear fondled baby,
Master Grimalkin, or grey-ey'd miss Tabby.
"Man, what an animal! to love to hug,
"Puppies they are; but not like my sweet pug,
"Prating as parrots, obstinate as donkies;
"We'd better all lead apes than follow monkies."
The wife poor thing, at first so blithe and chubby,
Scarce knows again her lover in her hubby;
No more -- "my charming dear! my sweetest life,"
It Is -- "stir that fire, give me some coffee, wife."
"There -- now you have burnt my fingers; -- what a ninny
"My dog's more nouse than you, I Will bet a guinea!"
He flies about to swallow port by dozens;
She stays at home, to mope with aunts and cousins.
Some wives there are, perhaps as well intentioned,
More spirited than such as I have mentioned;
Flirt at the opera, gamble at quadrille,
Run down a character, run up a bill;
Should spouse not be at dinner to say grace,
Can find a substitute to fill his place;
Invade man's province, bluster and look big,
Nor wear the breeches only, but the wig.
Enchanting taste! each day we change our hue,
White, auburn, grizzle, tye-wig, scratch or queue.
The red-hair'd lass, to hide her golden nob,
Tucks up her tresses in a nut-brown bob.
And full blown dames, through time a little flaxen,
Conceal that outrage by a coal-black caxen,
Nay, prosing belies, however bald the pate,
Can by this means insure a tete-a-tete.
To show I prize the mode, and would not mock it,
I carry all my graces in my pocket,
These are the native charms with which I shine, (takes out a wig.))
A stamped receipt will prove that they are mine. (puts on the wig.)
How do I look? Methinks it is grand to move (walks about with wig on.)
Beneath the covert of this curly grove.
It shields one too; for, should some wag, in scoff,
Assault my scratch, he can but scratch it off.
Shall I, in future, then, this helmet wear?
Decree, and I Will obey you to a Hair.

Mr. Pratt has introduced to a numerous set of readers a novel that has the
merit of being at once tender, pathetic, and full of love; and, which may be a
more uncommon circumstance, of love mixed with the greatest discretion. Monthly
Review, May 1797. In the volumes before us, there are several beautiful and
affecting strokes of nature. Analytical Review, April 1797. 3. A GOSSIP's STORY
and LEGENDARY TALE. By Mrs. WEST, Author of Advantages of Education, etc. In
two Volumes 12mo. Price 7s. in Boards.

We can recommend this story as uniting to a great degree of interest the rarer
qualities of good sense, and an accurate knowledge of mankind. The grammatical
errors and vulgarisms which disgrace many even of our most celebrated novels,
have here no place; and several of the shorter poetical pieces interspersed
through the work, have very considerable merit. Amusement is combined with
utility, and fiction is inlisted in the cause of virtue and practical
philosophy. Monthly Review, January 1797. 4. CLARA DUPLESSIS and CLAIRANT: The
HISTORY of a FAMILY of FRENCH EMIGRANTS. Translated from the German. In Three
Volumes, 12mo. Price 10s. 6d. Boards.

This pathetic novel, or relation of facts, has been deservedly successful in
its, native country, and at Paris. --

The characters are drawn with a truth of nature which is truly admirable.

The Monthly Critics, who have already reviewed this new work, speak of it in
the following words:

The writers of the Monthly Revicw for last month say, "We cannot dismiss these
volumes without observing, that they contain a considerable portion of
political information. The work will, by its discerning readers, be
characterized as highly interesting; and it will prove particularly so to those
who still remember the times to which the anecdotes here recorded are
referable. To the future historian also it will afford much assistance, by
contributing, in many instances, toward the means of information, which, but
for publications of this kind, might be utterly consigned to oblivion.

The writers of the Analytical Review for January last, say, "The work before
us will be found particularly interesting to those who wish to obtain an idea
of the management of state affairs in this country, during the whole of the
present reign."

The writers of the Gentleman's Magazine for January last, say, "These volumes
are written by the author of the Anecdotes of the late Earl of Chatham, and are
not inferior to that work either in interest or intelligence. Those persons who
are fond of reading the political anecdotes of their own times, particularly
from the year 1760 to the year 1780, (an important period), which, the writer
assures us, have not been printed, will receive fiom this work much pleasure
and information."

The writers of the European Magazine, say, "The editor of these volumes is
entitled to the thanks of the public, for preserving many facts which otherwise
might have fallen into oblivion. The reader will find entertainment and
information in them, and the future investigator of the acts of the present
reign will meet with some valuable materials to exercise his sagacity upon,
which are to be no where else found, and which will serve to guide him through
the obscure paths of political finesse."

8. The ANECDOTES of LORD CHATHAM's LIFE. The Sixth Edition. In Three Volumes,
8vo. Price 18s. Boards.

The author has made a valuable Collection of Anecdotes, especially of the late
and most conspicuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters
connected with it. He says he is not conscious of having advanced one
falsehood: We give credit to his declaration, having found no cause to doubt
it. Monthly Review, May 1792. A greater number of curious and interesting
anecdotes, concerning public affairs, have not appeared since the days of Sir
William Temple, than are to be found in this work.

We cannot dismiss this article without acknowledging, that it throws a great
and new light upon the occurences and events of more than half a century of our
history.

Gent. Mag. Aug. 1793. 9. A RESIDENCE in FRANCE, during the Years 1792, 3, 4,
and 5; described in a Series of Letters from an ENGLISH LADY, with general and
incidental Remarks on the French Character and Manners. Prepared for the Press
by JOHN GIFFORD Esquire. In Two Volumes, 8vo. Price 14s. Boards. The Third Edition.

It is only justice to say, that the style is as polished as the matter is
interesting and important: nor have we any doubt that the book will remain a
permanent monument of the taste and talents of the writer. British Critic,
April 1797. 10. GLEANINGS THROUGH WALES, HOLLAND, and WESTPHALIA; with Views of
Peace and War at Home and Abroad. To which is added, HUMANITY; or, The Rights
of Nature: A Poem. Revised and corrected. By Mr. PRATT. In Three Volumes, 8vo.
Price One Guinea in Boards. Third Edition.

We have found so many lively and pleasant exhibitions of manners, so many
amusing and interesting anecdotes, and so many observations and reflections,
gay and grave, sportive and sentimental, (all expressed in a gay and familiar
style,) better suited to the purpose than sentences labored with artificial
exactness, that we cannot but recommend it to our readers as a highly amusing
and interesting performance. Analytical Review, Jan. 1796. 11. An HISTORY, or
ANECDOTES of the REVOLUTION in RUSSIA, in the Year 1762. Translated from the
French of M. DERULHIERE. With an elegant Head of the late EMPRESS. Second
Edition. Price 4s. sewed.

The grounds of M. De Rulhiere's information seem indisputable, and his readers
appear to have every reason to be satisfied with his discernment, in unfolding
the motives and circumstances that concurred in bringing about this striking
event. He is no servile copier, but has drawn his characters, and described his
scenes, with the hand of a master.

We shall only add, that we have seldom met with more interesting original
anecdotes, than those that are contained in the little work which we have now
reviewed.
