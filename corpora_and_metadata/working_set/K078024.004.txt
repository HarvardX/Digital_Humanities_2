and some other entomological writers have very minutely described the Larva
and Pupa state of this rare butterfly; the Larva feed on the leaves of the
turnip, cabbage, and other plants of the same genus; it is of a yellow color,
with spots of brown, head pale green. The Pupa is yellow, spotted with brown
also, and has two teeth, or sharp points in the forepart.

We have received the Butterfly from North America, as well as from Germany; it
appears to be a native of most parts of the European Continent, though perhaps
not frequently found. -- Berkenhout is the only writer who has described it as
an English species Synopsis of the Natural History of Great Britain and Ireland.
; he says it is rare (in this country,) found in woods. In the perfect state,
visits flowers in the day time.

The Caterpillar of this singular Insect is very common in May; it is of a
green color, with a white stripe down the back, and one on each side; it casts
its skin several times.

We have observed some Caterpillars which were quite smooth, after casting
their skin become rough or covered with hairs; and others which were white
become black by the same process; in this caterpillar we have observed a
similar change: a specimen which was of a plain green as before described,
became suddenly spotted with black as shown in our plate, that skin being cast
off it assumed its former appearance and became a pupa.

It feeds on grass, nettles, etc. near the sides of ditches, and is found
sporting in the evening, when in the fly state among the grass and herbage.

The Caterpillar becomes a Pupa about the beginning of June. -- It affixes
itself by the tail to a stalk of grass in the same manner as those of the
Butterfly genus, and like them is often found with the head suspended
downwards; it can by a sudden spring turn itself upright again.

In a little book entitled the AURELIAN'S POCKET COMPANION, by Moses Harris, we
find this species described, and called the White Plumed, but the Linnaean
specified Name Didactyla is added: -- And under the Linnaean name Pentadactyla
(our present specimen) he has described the Brown plumed Another specimen of
the same division of the genus (Aluctae) but of a brown color "Alis fissis
fuscis, etc." Linn.
. -- The same confusion is extended to his folio work the AURELIAN. In Plate 1.
he has figured the White plumed under the specific name Didactyla, and in Plate
30, the Brown plume, under Pentadactyla. Linnaeus has comprised all those
Lepidopterous Insects whose wings appear to consist of several distinct
feathers, connected only at the shafts, under the subdivision Aluctae, but
Fabricius has given them the new name PTEROPHORUS, and added the name Alucitae
to a small division of the Tinea, as Phal. Christylostella, etc. of Linn.

The Phal. Pentadactyla appears in the perfect state about the latter end of
June, sometimes earlier.

near Sandwich.

This very common Insect is found on the nut tree, and oak. It conceals itself
in the middle of the day among the foliage, or flies only in moist, shady
places. It is always observed to be very brisk at the approach of a thunder
storm, like the Hemorobius Perla, etc.

The nerves on the wings are so exceedingly delicate, that it is impossible to
give an accurate representation of the natural size; but to remedy that defect,
we have shown the magnified appearance of an upper and under wing at Fig. 2.

The wings are of a pale transparent brown; which as the Insect moves in
different directions reflect all the vivid colors of a Prism.

The Caterpillar of the Goat Moth feeds on the internal substance of willow
trees; it is said to be also found in the body of the oak, but we have never
discovered any in such a situation. The eggs are laid in the crevices of the
trees; as soon as the Caterpillars are hatched, they begin to pierce into the
solid wood. In most parts of England they are called Auger Worms; the holes
which they make in the timber appearing as if bored with that Instrument.

It lives in the Caterpillar state three years before it is transformed to a
pupa; when full fed it is four inches long, the body appears very fleshy, and
without hairs; the head is black, and armed with very sharp forceps; the case
is composed of bits of wood and saw-dust, which it unites with a strong web;
the inside is lined with a fine smooth white filmy substance, like satin; it
passes to the pupa state in the cavity which it has perforated in the
caterpillar state, within three or four inches of the opening: it remains only
two months in that state before the Fly is produced.

Is found in chrysalis in May; in the fly state, the latter end of June, or in
July.


PLATE CXV. CHRYSOMELA CEREALIS. COLEOPTERA.

This beautiful Insect is a native of Georgia in North America; and has been
received from several parts of Africa, as Guinea, etc.

It has also been found (though we believe very rarely) in the southern parts
of Europe, particularly in Italy; and we have reason to conclude it has been
met with in the south of France, and in Germany Habitat in Europae australioris
segete, in spartio scoparia. D. Prof. Hermana. Fab. Spe. Ins.
.

We presume to include it among the English Chrysomelae, on the authority of
the late Mr. Hudson, author of the Flora Anglica, etc. who appears to be the
only Naturalist that has taken it in Great Britain, except the Rev. Mr. Hugh
Davies, of Beaumaris, who also met with a specimen of it on a mountain in Wales
some years since.

The color of the stripes on the shells sometimes vary; and the underside,
which in our Insect is purple, is often of a shining brownish color; the
transparent wings, which are concealed beneath the shells, are bright red.


PLATE CXVI. SPHINX CHRYSORRHOEA. GOLDEN-TAIL SPHINX. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings, when at rest,
deflexed. Fly slow, morning and evening only.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings transparent with black veins. Head, thorax, body,
shining black with yellow rings or belts. Tail fine golden yellow.

In the paintings of Ernst, a figure of a transparent-winged Sphinx, similar to
this, is given, under the specific name Oestriformis: we are not clearly
convinced he intended it for this Insect, nor can we conceive the name to be by
any means applicable; we therefore pass over the reference to that very scarce
work as doubtful, and reject his specific name lest he should mean another
Insect.

Linnaeus has not described this species, nor have we found a description of it
in the writings of Fabricius.

It is rare in England. THOMAS MARSHAM, Esquire. Sec. L. S. favored me with the
specimen from which the annexed figure is taken; it was met with in Kensington
Gardens in June.


PLATE CXVII. PHALAENA CRATAEGI. OAK EGGER MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings, in general contracted
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings rounded. Ash Color, or dull brown, with obscure
waves of a darker color.

We have never found this Insect common, though it must not be considered as a
rare species; it is seldom met with near London: our specimen was found in the
Caterpillar state at Dartford in May. It changed to Chrysalis in June. The fly
came forth in September.

The male is rather smaller than the female generally, though not always. The
strength of their colors is very inconstant, especially in the female, which
we have seen very dark in some specimens; in others nearly as pale as the male;
the general distinction however between the two sexes is, the male being of a
light gray with spots and waves of brown, the female of an obscure brown with
spots more diffused.

This singular and beautiful Caterpillar is found on the Willow, early in June;
it becomes a Pupa within a fine, brownish web, which it spins between two or
three leaves, (as represented in our Plate,) late in the same month; the Moth
comes forth in August.

The trivial name prominent has been given to this Insect, because when the
Moth is at rest the remarkable appendages on the interior margin of the upper
Wings form a prominent tuft above the back; we have six different species of
Phalaena in this country which have the same character, and are known among
Collectors by the several names, Pale, Maple, Swallow, Iron, Pebble, and
Cockscomb, Prominents; the last is common, the rest are generally very rare.

The wonderful instinct that directs the smallest Insects to provide for the
safety of their future progeny, never fails to strike the attention of the
inquisitive researcher into their economy. -- To perpetuate their race is the
great end of their being, and the most astonishing effort of their ingenuity
and care is employed to perfect this grand design. We not only find innumerable
eggs, and larvae of Insect on all kinds of plants; in all standing waters; and
in animal matter, when putrid; but many which can only be hatched from the egg
by the warmth of living animals; thus the Tabanus pierces the thick hide of the
Cow, and plunges its eggs into the flesh; the heat and moisture of which
nourishes both in the egg, and larva; the Hippobosca equina protrudes its eggs
into the rectum of Horses; and the Ichneumon into living Caterpillars: to those
we could add many remarkable instances of Insects, who have shown a lower
species of perception, by depositing their eggs in places where the larvae
would find abundance of proper food; and with such ingenious contrivances for
their safety in a defenseless state, as we could only expect from the sagacity
of larger animals; but it is only our intention to premise with those general
remarks, lest the subject we have chosen for our present Plate should be
considered as a solitary example of such ingenuity, and care toward their
future offspring.

The Natural History of the Common Be has been both fully and ably treated of,
by Schirach, Maraldi, Reaumur, Debraw, and other authors of respectability, and
may be supposed to be pretty generally known by those conversant in rural
affairs; the manners, however, of other species of the same genus has neither
been so fully explained, nor examined; they yet present a fund for the
enquiries of the Naturalist, equally worthy his attention; though less
beneficial; as the honey they make cannot be converted to our use.

Among the solitary Bees, some penetrate into the earth, scoop out hollow
cavities; then polish the sides within, and deposit their eggs, with proper
food for the larvae, till it becomes a Pupa. Others form nests of loose sand,
which they glue together with a strong cement; those nests are generally formed
against walls that are exposed to the south; without, they are rude and
irregular, but within are very neatly finished, and divided into several cells
or apartments, in each of which the Parent Be lodges an egg. Of our present,
and a few other species, we may say, In firmest oak they scoop a spacious tomb,
And lay their embryo in the spurious womb Brooks on Universal Beauty.
.


We find this season, the Apis Centuncularis has done considerable injury among
the Timber Plantations in Essex; and we have similar information from some
parts of Cambridgeshire. A Gentleman sent me (early in the Spring) a piece of
Oak, containing a quantity of the larva, from his plantation at Birdbrook, in
Essex. He informs me, several Gentlemen in his neighborhood had found large
trunks of apparently healthy Oaks, completely perforated and filled with the
larva of this mischievous Insect; in many instances the trunk had been
materially injured, and the cases were arranged as shown by the horizontal
Section at Fig. 4, in our Plate. -- The perforations were in a longitudinal
direction, several feet through the solid timber, and when the leaves were
fresh, appeared as shown at Fig. 1.

The Insect commences its operation at the upper part of the trunk of the tree;
then boring in an oblique direction for about two inches or more, it follows a
longitudinal course, it divides the ligneous fibers, or threads, till it forms
the diameter of the cavity, which is about three-eighths of an inch, its depth
various; sometimes only a few inches, at others, considerably more; when the
cavity is entirely formed, and all the dust and fragments cleared away, it
finishes the sides perfectly smooth; the hardest knot in the timber being
insufficient to resist the strength of its jaws. -- The cavity, when finished,
appears divided by slight ridges, placed at the distance of about three
quarters of an inch from each other; this serves to regulate the size of each
apartment or cell; and it now only remains to be lined for the reception of the
egg: this lining is generally composed of rose-leaves; and is applied to the
apartments in a very curious manner: the Parent Be flies with a leaf to the
orifice of the perforation, where she clips it round to the size of the hole;
this is forced to the bottom of the lowest cell; about seven, eight, or ten of
such pieces form the first layer; it next forms the sides, or cylindrical part
of the lining; this is done by laying several whole leaves partly over each
other, as shown in our Plate, and cementing them together with a glutinous
substance; thus the sides and bottom, each consisting of several layers, being
finished, (in the form of a thimble) the Be partly fills it with a kind of
paste, then throws over it a small quantity of leaves, reduced to powder, and
deposits the egg; the covering to the whole is formed of the same materials,
and in the same manner as the bottom; when she has forced about ten or fifteen
circular pieces of leaves into the avenue and cemented them to the top, the
covering is completed, and the egg is completely secured from accident. -- The
covering separated is shown in the Plate, at fig. 3, the larvae, at fig. 2.

In this manner she proceeds with, and finishes every cell distinctly, till the
perforation is entirely filled: in some trees forty or fifty such perforations
are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other. -- The Be comes forth
late in August; if the lowest is formed before those above, it eats its way up
the channel, through their cases.

Mr. Adams, in his Essay on the Microscope, mentions a remarkable circumstance
of a Be (we suspect of this species). "A friend of mine (says he) had a piece
of wood cut from a strong post We learn this post was fir.
that supported the roof of a cart-house, full of these cells or round holes,
three-eighths of an inch diameter, and about three-fourths deep, each of which
was filled with these rose-leaf cases, finely covered in at top and bottom."

It has been suspected by some Entomologists, that this Insect should only be
considered as a variety of Curculio Argentatus. Much of its beautiful
appearance depends on the time we take it in; when first hatched its colors
are very rich and highly glossed with gold, but it gradually becomes dirty
brown, or almost black.

The cause of this alteration in its appearance is easily perceived by the
microscope; the first, or ground color is dark brown, but is entirely covered
with oblong scales of various beautiful colors, particularly of a reddish
gold, or bronze, interspersed with those of green, and brown color; when the
Insect is first hatched, the scales lay over each other so as to conceal the
ground color; but as they rub off, or are otherwise injured, the brown becomes
the general color. -- They vary also very much from red, to yellow, or green
hues, when first hatched; and are sometimes found late in the season, with
almost every scale rubbed off.

Linnaeus and Fabricius say, it is found on Pear trees Habitat in Pyri foliis,
in Corrolis declaratus. Lina.
. We have met with it on several other trees. Found from May to September.

CURCULIO CAPREAE. Fab. Spec. Ins. 1. 168. 39.
This little Insect very much resembles Curculio Salicis, both in size and
colors; but it is sufficiently distinguished from that species by its walking
or running; as leaping is a particular character of that Curculio.

We have never met with more than one specimen; found on the Ozier in June.

appearance is shown at fig. 6. -- The rostrum fig. 7. -- Fig. 5. Natural size.

The Caterpillars of this very elegant Sphinx are generally found in marshy
places in June and July. They feed on the Convolvulus, Vine, and some other
plants, but prefer white ladies bedstraw; they cast their skins several times,
and when full fed are some green, and others of a brown color. The
Caterpillars of the female is a fine green elegantly marked with black, as
represented in our plate; those of the male are varied with the same dark
markings, but the color is a dull brown inclining to black in those parts
where the females are green.

It possesses a faculty peculiar to a very few Insects, it can protrude its
head and three first joints to a tapering point; or entirely conceal the head
and contract the first joints, by drawing them apparently into its body.

The Caterpillars form a white spinning among the leaves in August; remains in
the pupa state during the winter; the Fly comes forth May following. They are
frequently destroyed by an Ichneumon fly.

A very rare species of Phalaena. In the perfect state it is seldom met with;
and in the Caterpillar state few Collectors are acquainted with its haunts. It
feeds on the sallow, willow, and poplar, and may be found sometimes by
stripping off the bark of those trees.

Our specimen was taken in the vicinity of Oak-of-Honor Hill, Surry. The
Caterpillar was met with when it was ready to spin its web, in which state it
is represented; its spinning was formed between the folds of a leaf in the
month of October, the Moth came forth in May.

The Moth in the upper part of the plate is a small specimen of the female; it
differs very little from the male, except that the antennae of the latter is
much feathered, as is shown on the back of the leaf.

The species is more plentiful on the continent of Europe, and a variety of it
is a native of some parts of North America.

A Collector of Insects in London met with a brood of this species last
September, in the Caterpillar state, containing more than twenty; some were
covered with a milk-white down, others inclining to gray, but in general they
were like the specimen given in our plate. They changed their appearance
frequently, and some were much larger than the rest. The Moths also differ very
much both in size and color; some are dingy, others have the chocolate color
much diffused; and in general, when the Insect is perfect, it is beautifully
varied with a pale bloom of a purple hue.

The Caterpillar of this Moth are usually found on the Bramble, from which it
has received its English name; it is not, however, wholly confined to that
food, as we have fed it on grass and other plants indiscriminately put into its
breeding-cage. It passes to the chrysalis state in September; the Fly appears
in May.

This uncommonly beautiful Insect has been described as a native of Algiers in
Africa, a figure of it is given in the work of Olivier, and another in Panzer's
History of the Insects of Germany; we find it also described by Fourcroy and
Geoffrory as a native of France, but cannot learn that it has been considered
as an English species before this time.

We were not so fortunate as to take this Insect, it was communicated by a
person on whose veracity we can rely: he found it on the bark of an old willow
tree, between Dulwich Common and Norwood, on, or about the 8th of June, 1794.
As we know the precise spot where it was taken, we shall attend to it
particularly next season, and the earliest intimation of success, shall be
given through the medium of a future number.

When we consider how much the study of coleopterous Insects has been neglected
in this country, even by those who have pursued with unremitting perseverance
almost every other branch of Entomology, we cannot be much astonished that such
a minute Insect as the Buprestis Salicis should have escaped notice; add to
this, we can scarcely doubt that it is very rare in this country, and probably
lives concealed in the crevices of the tree, or under the rotten part of the
bark. The number of new Insects that have been discovered in this country
within a few years Among the rarities met with last summer, we may particularly
mention the Phalaena Delphinii, Pease Blossom Moth. This very beautiful Insect
was taken by a Gentleman at Chelsea; it was never ascertained before to be an
English Insect.
, renders it not improbable, that future English Entomologists, by extending
their enquiries, may find many more of the species that are now met with in the
northern, and perhaps even southern parts of Europe.

In the larva and pupa state, this Insect is found under loose stones at the
bottom of shallow pools; in the winged state it frequents the water.

We have several species of this genus in England. The Ephemera Vulgata, is the
largest among them. A very distinguishing character of them is the shortness of
their lives, which seldom exceeds a few hours. In the month of May these
Insects are seen in great plenty on the water, where they are greedily devoured
by the fish; anglers say, when the large Ephemera appears, the trout will snap
at no other bait, than the artificial fly made after its form. -- In some
specimens the wings are more clouded, and the tails longer than in others.

The Argent and Sable Moth is scarce in the Fly state: though its young
caterpillars are not uncommon in some parts of Kent; we have met with several
about the narrow lanes in Darent-wood, Dartford, in April, or early in the
month of May. It is however very difficult to breed them; they generally die in
the pupa state, or before they cast their last skin when caterpillars; from
several specimens taken during the three last summers, we have only had one
Moth produced, and that so crippled, as merely to enable us to ascertain the
species.

The small Caterpillars are of a dark purplish color, when nearly full fed
they have a yellow under side marked with black, with the back purple; before
they change to the pupa state, they become almost brown.

They remain only a month in the pupa state. The Moth appears about the middle
of June. -- Food, white-thorn and alder.

PHALAENA ANASTOMOSIS. FIG. IV.
Since the publication of the last Number, we have been favored with a most
beautiful specimen of the Moth figured in the 124th Plate of this Work, and
present a figure of it to our subscribers, together with the several changes of
the Phalaena Hastata; it will show how very liable this Insect is to variation
in its colors, size, etc.

We find also that though this Insect has been named Phalaena Anastomosis in
the most scientific Cabinets in London, and always received as such by the best
authority, it is not the Insect referred to by Fabricius in his Species
Insectorum under that title; that Author, as well as Linnaeus, refers under the
specific name Ph. Curtula to the 43d Plate of the third Volume of Roesel's
Insects; in this Plate is figured a Moth which is certainly a species distinct
from our Insect, and is well known by its Linnaean name Curtula, or English
title Chocolate Tip; yet Fabricius gives an additional reference for the same
species to the 11th Plate of Roesel's fourth Volume of Insects, and in this we
find the figure of a Moth whose markings and general appearance correspond with
our specimen, though its colors are totally different, being a very pale gray
with scarcely any dark color near the apex of the wings; the larva much more
resembles our figure, and induces us to conclude, that though the figure of
this last Moth is so extremely different, it is probably intended for the same
species as our Insect; and therefore that the two distinct species have been
confounded together, by a false quotation of Linnaeus's Amanuensis.

And we are partly confirmed in this supposition by the words of Linnaeus
himself; he says, Ph. Anastomosis is very like Ph. Curtula, but the Moth
figured in Roesel's plate, and referred to in the Synonyms under Anastomosis,
does not bear the least resemblance to it; -- our Insect on the contrary,
though evidently a distinct species, is not unlike it.


PLATE CXXX. GRYLLUS VIRIDISSIMUS. HEMIPTERA.

This Insect is larger than the great green Grasshopper, (Gryllus verrucivorus)
or any other species of the genus we have in this country; unless we notice the
Gryllus Magratorius, which is well known for its depredations in many parts of
the world, but is rarely met with in England.

The present species is perhaps not uncommon in many places, but it is very
difficult to discover its hiding-places in the daytime; its chirp is sometimes
heard in a calm Summer's evening, about sunset, issuing from the bushes where
it is concealed; and from which it seldom ventures till night: it continues its
chirping at intervals till morning.

The female seems to prefer a warm, and rather moist situation, to deposit her
eggs in, and this is commonly the side of a bank that is exposed to the sun;
but is well covered with grass and other herbage to keep it moist. She is
furnished with a sharp double edged sheath, like a sword, with which she opens
the ground in a perpendicular direction; first scooping out a convenient
cylindrical aperture, and then widening the lower part into a spacious
apartment for the reception of the eggs. See Fig. I.

When the Insect bursts from the egg it is very minute, and without Wings; in
this state it nips the tender shoots of grass, etc. It soon increases in size
and assumes the pupa form; in which state though the Wings are not perfect,
their rudiments appear next the Thorax: it continues in this state till it has
nearly acquired its full size before the Wings burst open from the
protuberances.

Our specimens were taken in Battersea Meadows; in the egg state early in
April; winged state in June.

In the months of June and July, or earlier in forward seasons, this Insect is
found in great plenty in the lanes and skirts of woods; and are very
troublesome to persons or animals who pass through such places in the middle of
the day: they conceal themselves in the crevices of the bark of trees, or among
the foliage till about an hour before noon, when they come forth in great
plenty, and settle on the hands and face, or other thinly covered parts, and
dart their sharp pointed trunks or proboscis into the flesh: we have observed
the sting of this Insect to be most severe about midday, particularly when the
sun shines bright, and emits much heat; a disagreeable sensation continues in
the stung part for some time, and is generally succeeded by a large tumor, and
a slight discharge of pungent fluid before it disappears entirely.

To explain more minutely the structure of the trunk, we have given a figure of
its magnified appearance at Fig. III: the outer coat, or sheath, terminates at
its extremity, in two lateral, moveable lips, and contains a longitudinal,
horny, unequal blade; the acute point of which is concealed between these lips:
this interior tube, when examined with a Microscope, appears to consist of
three others, exceedingly sharp at the points; and are used by the Insect as
lancets to lacerate the flesh when it feeds, while it pumps, or sucks up the
blood and moisture from the wound, through the capillary tubes with which
several parts of the trunk are furnished.

It feeds in the same manner on Insects, but chiefly on those in the larva
state.

The species is not uncommon in Germany, France, Italy, and most warm parts of
Europe: also received from Georgia, in North America.

Kleman Ins. 3. Fab. Spec. Ins. 2. 245. 18?
We have been furnished with the larva of this extremely rare Insect in a
singular manner; a wasted specimen of the female was taken in the Summer of the
year 1794, and deposited a quantity of eggs in the box in which it was stuck;
these hatching some time after, a great number of young Caterpillars were
produced; several of a full size, passed to the pupa state, (in a reddish web
spun on the leaves) and four fine Moths came forth last Summer.

The eggs were very minute, perfectly globular, and of a pale greenish color:
the cluster consisted of more than seventy, and few of them proved abortive;
but some of the largest Caterpillars devoured the rest, and many others
wandered from the food, and so perished. The Moths were far superior for the
beauty and richness of their colors to any specimens we have seen before; but
this is not remarkable, as most of the specimens preserved in Cabinets near
London, have been taken in the winged state.

It feeds on the lime; is found in the Caterpillar state in August; the Moth
appears in June. Is sometimes taken in the interior part of Darent-Wood,
Dartford; and rarely elsewhere near London. It has been met with also at
Feversham, in Kent, on the Elm.

Kleman, in the last volume of German Insects, lately published, has given
three figures of this Moth; but has neither figured the Caterpillar nor Pupa.
Fabricius is the only systematical Writer who appears to have noticed it.

The Caterpillars of the Gray Dagger-Moth is frequently found on fruit trees;
particularly on the cherry: it feeds also on the willow and poplar, and on
almost all plants indiscriminately when confined in the breeding cage. It is
not an uncommon Insect: the Caterpillars change in September, remain in the
chrysalis state during winter, and the Moth appears late in May, or early in
June.

This species feeds on nettles, chickweed, plantain, grass, etc. The
Caterpillars very much resemble those of the large Garden Tiger Moth Rhal. Caja.

appear in the winged state the latter end of May.

We have not found this Insect so plenty as the Ruby Tiger Moth Phal.

, and it is infinitely more scarce than the great Garden Tiger Moth, figured in
the early part of this Work.

A variety of this species, with crimson under wings, is found in the East

specimens, are much redder than in the male.

The singular structure of the antennae of this minute Insect, recommends it to
partic^lar notice. They are nearly as long as the body, and in the thickest
part are very bulky; hence it has received the specific name Spissiconis, or
large horned Cimex.

It is not uncommon in summer; flies amongst bushes or low herbage in the day
time the lower wings are of a very beautiful purple color, and give a blackish
hue to the outer wings when folded under them. The larva we suspect has not
been figured, if noticed, before, and for this reason we have given it of the
natural size at fig. 1. and its magnified appearance at fig. 2. -- at fig. 3.

Among an almost endless variety of species, which the tribes of Insects
present, few have a more singular appearance than the little creature we have
selected for our present subject. It is perhaps one of the most curious pieces
of natural mechanism (if we may be allowed the expression) that can be
conceived, for of a most complicated fabric which the wings appear, every part,
though separate, acts in perfect unison with the rest; in most winged Insects
we find the tendons of each wing united by strong membranaceous webs, which
prevent any one from acting without the others, but in this every tendon must
perform a distinct part, and yet perfectly in conformity with the rest to
assist the Insect in its flight. When the Insect rests the feathers fold over
one another; but when it flies, they are thrown open, and resemble a full
expanded fan.

The natural size of this singular creature is given at Fig. 1. and as a more
correct figure than can be shown in such a small compass was thought necessary,
its magnified appearance is represented at Fig. 2.

The plumes of this Insect differs so much from those of other Moths, that we
have also added, at Fig. 3, the appearance of the upper part of one, as seen by
a very deep lens of the Microscope; by this the stem or quil is observed
covered with scales of the form usually found on other Moths, but the sides are
finely feathered with long hairs, in tufts, alternately of a light and dark
color, and which, owing to the minuteness of the Insect appear like patches of
an uniform color, before it is examined with the Microscope.

This Insect is not uncommon in Summer, it flies about hedges in the evening.

The pencil can produce but a feeble and inadequate imitation of the metallic
splendor of this beautiful, yet common Insect. The upper Wings have the
appearance of fine burnished brass, changeable in different directions of the
light to green, brown, and rich golden hues; the under Wings are of a blackish
color, and serve as an admirable contrast to the more brilliant and varied
teints of the upper Wings. The Thorax is crested.

Berkenhout has given a very false description of the Caterpillar of this
Insect, he says it is "smooth, orange with white spots;" we think it necessary
to note this error only as it may mislead young Collectors, who have no other
assistant than his Synopsis, by which they can determine the Species, when in
the Caterpillar state. It is astonishing how he could possibly be led into this
error, when Albin, Fabricius Larva solitaria, gibbosa, viridis albo striata.
Fabricius.
, and all preceding authors on Entomology, have described it so plainly.

It feeds on Nettles, and other Plants, growing among the low herbage by the
side of banks; in fine seasons there are generally two broods of them from May,
to June in the following year; the first are found early in May in the
Caterpillar state, appear in June in the winged state; Caterpillars are full
fed again in July, the Moths come forth in August.

This species is far less common than Cassida Viridis. It is a very beautiful
Insect; but, like most other minute species, appears with infinitely more
advantage in the Microscope for opake objects; indeed, without such assistance,
it is impossible to perceive the beauty of that part by which it is
distinguished from every other species of the same genus we have in England,
the lines of fine gold and blue, which are seen on the middle of the Shells.

When the Insect is alive, it is of a pale greenish color, inclining to
brownish gray, and along the middle of each Shell appears a splendid streak, or
line of gold, margined with a fine pale sky blue, alternately varying into
green, and gold. By the Microscope we also discover many minute punctures, and
several waved lines and streaks, which descend along the Shells from the base,
and unite near the apex.

Its colors are more or less beautiful as the Insect is healthy or sickly; and
as it dies, the colors gradually perish; the splendour of gold is no longer
visible than life is retained, it changes to green; from green to a brown,
which scarcely appears through a faint tinge of blue, and in a few hours it
changes altogether to a rusty brown color.

This Insect is admirably protected from external injury by the singular form
of its Thorax and Shells, which are also so large as to conceal every other
part when the Insect walks.

The natural size is shown at fig. 4, (upper side.) Fig. 2, under side. Fig. 3,

changeable, with a bronze appearance. Beneath, reddish brown, or testaceous.

CHRYSOMELA BANKII: ovata supra aenea subtus testacea. Fab. Entomologia
Systematica. T. 1. 310. 16.
This is a very rare Insect in England. It resembles Chrysomela bicolor in
size, and color of the Head, Thorax and Shells; but it may be readily
distinguished from that species by the testaceous color of the under side,
that part being wholly of a violaceous color in C. bicolor.

Found in May on a thistle.

FIG. V. VI. CICADA DILATATA. HEMIPTERA.
Shells or upper Wings, semi crustaceous, divided by an oblique future, and
incumbent on each other. Beak bent down.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper. Shells membraneous. In each foot three
joints. Hind legs strong for leaping.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Entirely brown, pale with faint whitish and dark lines, a
small black spot on the center of each wing.

A figure of this Insect is given in Villers's Entomology as a native of
France; in this he follows the authority of Fourcroy, who has a description of
the same species in his Catalogue of Insects, found in the environs of Paris.
This last author calls it Le Cigale renflee, from its puffed or swelled
appearance. The name given by Villers is Cicada dilatata.

The confusion made by Fabricius, in his alterations of the Linnaean genera,
renders it doubtful whether he has described this Insect, though, from its
being commonly found in most parts of Europe, we must suppose he has not passed
over it without notice: we have examined his last work, (Entomologia
Systematica, etc.) and cannot find an Insect answering our species with any
reference either to Fourcroy or Villers, we therefore prefer the specific name
given by the latter author.

Is found in June; and is less common than any Insect of the same genus
hitherto given in this work.

The Phalaena Meticulosa certainly exceeds many other Insects of the same tribe
for elegance and simplicity: the variety of teints so delicately, indeed almost
insensibly softened into one another, and neatness of the waves and lines
interspersed over the whole, amply compensate for the defection of more gaudy
colors. In the caterpillar state it is scarcely less deserving attention; the
yellow specks on a beautiful, yet lucid green, have a very pleasing effect. The
web it spins round its pupa is of a fine white color, and silky texture; the
pupa within of a blackish chocolate color.

This species is sometimes met with in plenty, though less so in some seasons
than in others; and not unfrequently is more abundant when the season appears
most unfavourable. It feeds on nettles chiefly, but we have found it on several
other plants; and once on a young oak, in Kent; the leaves of which we fed it
on some time. In the caterpillar state it is found in April, changes to the
pupa state in May, the Moth appears in June.

Formerly this beautiful Moth was found in great abundance at Charlton in Kent,
but within the last two or three years most of the broods have been wantonly
destroyed, and they are now seldom met with. In the caterpillar state they feed
on nettles and hound's-tongue Cynoglossum officinale.
, changes to the pupa state about the middle of May, and in June the Moth comes
forth.

This Insect has been only noticed in the latter writings of Fabricius. We have
not found it uncommon in the summer upon the leaves of Fruit trees; and
particularly on such as grow against a south wall: they fly briskly about noon,
when the sun shines.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Eyes brown. Thorax green; changeable to silver. Abdomen
silvery, with shades of bright yellow, and gray, and some transverse streaks of
black, very changeable.

Musca semi-argentata. Marsham's MSS.

We do not find that this rare and beautiful Insect has been described either
by Linnaeus or Fabricius. It was taken a few years since in Epping Forest by
Mr. Bentley, an eminent Collector of English Insects, and noticed by Thomas
Marsham, Esquire. Sec. L. S. in his Manuscript Notes, under the specific name
Semi-argentata. Several specimens of it were taken last June in Epping Forest;
except them, we have not heard of any being met with for some time.

Though this beautiful Insect is very common in some places in the Butterfly
state, we have never met with it is larva, nor with any account of it that
appeared satisfactory. In that state it seems scarcely known. It is said, by
some Collectors, to be a plain green Caterpillar, with very few hairs, bulky,
and broadest across the middle. It certainly feeds very low among the thickest
grass, or perhaps like some larvae of Moths, never comes above the surface of
the ground, and lives on the roots of grass.

The Male is of a fine blue color on the upper side, and elegantly marked on
the under side with white circles, having a black spot in the center of each:
the wings are also bordered with similar spots, marked with a vermillion
color. The Female has very little appearance of the fine blue of the Male: the
upper wings are of a dull brownish black, with a bluish color on parts, and
marked with a few red and black spots: the underside as in the Male.

They seem to delight in Meadows, and, like all other Butterflies, are on the
wing only in the day time. The first brood appears in the Fly state in June.

Early in July we find this species flying about the narrow paths and lanes in
woods where Oaks are plenty. It is observed to shelter itself in the day time,
generally among such trees as have the foliage thick and the bark covered with
moss, etc. and very seldom among young trees. In the Caterpillar state it lives
concealed in a fine silky web, spun up on the leaves. When it is disturbed it
drops by a single thread from one branch to another, the glutinous substance of
the thread adhering wherever it touches, so that if it is damaged in any part
the Insect is in no danger of falling, unless the last fastening breaks off.
The Caterpillar changes to the pupa state early in June: the first appearance
of the Moth is commonly about the end of the same month.

In England we have another small Moth (Phalaena Chlorana) which at first sight
may be mistaken for Phalaena Viridana. It differs from this Insect in several
respects; the under Wings are whiter, and the stripe along the anterior margin
of the upper Wings incline more to a cream color than in our present species;
the Caterpillar also is very different and feeds on the Willow.
