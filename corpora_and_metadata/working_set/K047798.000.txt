MASTER GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE.
MY LORD,
SHOULD this small performance continue to prove useful to the Institution for
which it was composed, or become acceptable to the public; its existence, as
well as its publication, must be ascribed to YOUR GRACE.

But, my LORD, the particular injunctions to avoid panegyric, under which
permission for this dedication was granted, preclude me from explaining how the
advanced state of learning in the Royal Military Academy rendered such a work
necessary: since this would be to enumerate the means by which, under Your
Auspices, this institution has attained a degree of perfection, which perhaps
few public ones have ever equalled, none certainly have exceeded.

To YOUR GRACE therefore, with all Respect, this work is most humbly dedicated
by,

MY LORD, YOUR GRACE's most obedient, most devoted, and most humble servant,
CHARLES HUTTON.
Royal Mil. Acad. Aug. 24, 1787.
PREFACE.
THE want of a proper set of exercises, applied to the different branches of
mathematical knowledge, which are deemed requisite to the military profession,
induced me to draw up the following sheets. Their utility to the students in
the Royal Military Academy, having been fully established, recommended them to
the consideration of the Master General; and His Grace has been pleased to
order them to be printed.

The miscellaneous form of this small work, arises from its consisting chiefly
of practical questions in most of the sciences now taught in the Academy.
Although Invention was not my immediate object, yet throughout the whole there
will be found many things that are new, in point of matter, but more so in the
manner of treating the subjects.

In the Conic Sections there are several new and important properties dispersed
through the books; and it is presumed that this branch is treated in a way
better adapted to its intended use, than heretofore. The propositions, although
demonstrated in a manner strictly geometrical, have this peculiarity, that only
the first property of each section is demonstrated from the cone itself, and
all the subsequent ones derived from the first, or from each other, in an easy
and natural way, without introducing any arbitrary organical description of
curves in plano. The arrangement of the s^eps in separate lines is also found
to be an advantage, as it renders the demonstrations more easy to be
comprehended, by presenting the whole to the eye in one connected view. And
another very considerable improvement arises from the application of a new and
general property concerning the intersections of a right line, with any of the
curves, in two points: by means of which the general properties of the oblique
ordinates, to any diameter, are easily deduced, without the forced and
perplexed consideration of the areas of certain spaces.

The several propositions and properties, in the three curves or sections, are
also arranged in such order, and enunciated in such manner, as to show which
properties are common to the different sections; and in particular it will be
found, that most of the definitions and scholia are common to all the three
curves; and that all the propositions and demonstrations of the ellipse, are
literally the same with those of the hyperbola: a circumstance which must
render both the learning and the remembering of the properties much easier than
heretofore.

The collection of practical questions, which follow the Conic Sections, are
mostly given without solutions, their answers only being set down, as
probationary exercises to certain rules and branches of science contained in
most books relating to these subjects. But the last collection, concerning
forces, and the accompanying circumstances of time, space, and the velocity
generated, have solutions annexed to them; as they require a knowledge of some
other principles besides those that are usually found in the common books of
science. Many of the problems in this part may, indeed, be met with elsewhere;
but it is presumed, that the solutions will be found in general, either new, or
attended with considerable improvement.

I have taken the liberty also to enrich this part with some new and useful
problems relating to the times of filling and emptying the ditches of
fortifications, or other receptacles, with water, entering and evacuating them
under certain circumstances. These curious problems, His Grace the Master
General of the Ordnance was pleased to propose at a late examination of the
Gentlemen Cadets; and the solutions at large, of such important propositions,
are here published, as far as I know, for the first time.

To these succeeds the common theory of the motion of bodies in resisting
mediums, but delivered in a manner, I trust, better adapted to practical
purposes than in any former publication.

The volume then concludes with a compendium of some experiments, lately made
to ascertain the actual resistance of the air to given surfaces, moving through
it with given velocities, and different degrees of inclination: experiments,
which it is to be wished may be farther prosecuted, as it is by such means only
that the true theory of military projectiles, as well as other branches of
natural philosophy, can be improved to any degree of practical utility.

CONIC SECTIONS.
DEFINITIONS.
1. CONIC sections are the figures made by the mutual intersection of a cone
and a plane.

2. According to the different positions of the cutting plane, there arise five
different figures or sections, namely, a triangle, a circle, an ellipse, a
parabola, and an hyperbola: the three last of which only are peculiarly called
conic sections.

3. If the cutting plane pass through the vertex of the cone, and any part of
the base, the section will evidently be a triangle; as VAB.

diagram

4. If the plane cut the cone parallel to the base, or make no angle with it,
the section will be a circle; as ABD.

diagram

5. The section DAB is an ellipse, when the cone is cut obliquely through both
sides, or when the plane is inclined to the base in a less angle than the side
of the cone is.

diagram

6. The section is a parabola, when the cone is cut by a plane parallel to the
base, or when the cutting plane and the side of the cone make equal angles with
the base.

diagram

7. The section is an hyperbola, when the cutting plane makes a greater angle
with the base than the side of the cone makes.

diagram

8. And if all the sides of the cone be continued through the vertex, forming
an opposite equal cone, and the plane be also continued to cut the opposite
cone, this latter section will be the opposite hyperbola to the former; as dBe.

9. The vertices of any section, are the points where the cutting plane meets
the opposite sides of the cone, or the sides of the vertical triangular
section; as A and B.

Hence the ellipse and the opposite hyperbolas, have each two vertices; but the
parabola only one; unless we consider the other as at an infinite distance.

10. The Axis, or Transverse Diameter, of a conic section, is the line or
distance AB between the vertices.

Hence the axis of a parabola is infinite in length, Ab being only a part of it.

Ellipse.

Oppos. Hyperb.

Parabola.

Ellipse


Oppos. Hyperb.


Parabola.


11. The Center C is the middle of the axis.

Hence the center of a parabola is infinitely distant from the vertex. And of
an ellipse the axis and center lie within the curve; but of an hyperbola
without.

12. A Diameter is any right line, as AB or DE, drawn through the center, and
terminated on each side by the curve; and the extremities of the diameter, or
its intersections with the curve, are its vertices.

Hence all the diameters of a parabola are parallel to the axis, and infinite
in length. And hence also every diameter of the ellipse and hyperbola have two
vertices; but of the parabola only one; unless we consider the other as at an
infinite distance.

13. The Conjugate to any diameter, is the line drawn through the center, and
parallel to the tangent of the curve at the vertex of the diameter. So FG,
parallel to the tangent at D, is the conjugate to DE; and HI, parallel to the
tangent at A, is the conjugate to AB.

Hence the conjugate HI, of the axis AB, is perpendicular to it.

Ellipse.

Oppos. Hyperb.

14. An Ordinate to any diameter, is a line parallel to its conjugate, or to
the tangent at its vertex, and terminated by the diameter and curve. So DK, EL
are ordinates to the axis AB; and MN, NO ordinates to the diameter DE.

Hence the ordinates to the axis are perpendicular to it.

15. An Absciss is a part of any diameter contained between its vertex and an
ordinate to it; as AK or BK, or DN or EN.

Hence, in the ellipse and hyperbola, every ordinate has two abscisses; but in
the parabola, only one; the other vertex of the diameter being infinitely
distant.

16. The Parameter of any diameter, is a third proportional to that diameter
and its conjugate.

17. The Focus is the point in the axis where the ordinate is equal to half the
parameter. As K and L, where DK or EL is equal to the semi-parameter.

Hence, the ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci; but the parabola only one.

18. If DAE, FBG be two opposite hyperbolas having AB for their first or
transverse axis, and ab for their second or diagram conjugate axis. And if dae,
fbg be two other opposite hyperbolas having the same axes, but in the contrary
order, namely, ab their first axis, and AB their second; then these two latter
curves dae, fbg, are called the conjugate hyperbolas to the two former DAE,
FBG; and each pair of opposite curves mutually conjugate to the other.

19. And if tangents be drawn to the four vertices of the curves, or
extremities of the axes, forming the inscribed rectangle HIKL; the diagonals
HCK, ICL of this rectangle, are called the asymptotes of the curves.

SCHOLIUM.
The rectangle inscribed between the four conjugate hyperbolas, is similar to a
rectangle circumscribed about an ellipse by drawing tangents, in like manner,
to the four extremities of the two axes; and the asymptotes or diagonals in the
hyperbola, are analogous to those in the ellipse, cutting this curve in similar
points, and making the pair of equal conjugate diameters. Moreover, the whole
figure, formed by the four hyperbolas, is, as it were, an ellipse turned inside
out, cut open at the extremities D, E, F, G, of the said equal conjugate
diameters, and those four points drawn out to an infinite distance, the
curvature being turned the contrary way, but the axes, and the rectangle
passing through their extremities, continuing fixed.

COROLLARY I. Ellipse


Hyperbola.


Parabola.


In the ellipse, the semi-conjugate axis, CD or CE, is a mean proportional
between CO and CP, the parts of the diameter OP of a circle drawn through the
center C of the ellipse, and parallel to the base of the cone. For DE is a
double ordinate in this circle, being perpendicular to OP as well as to AB.

In like manner, in the hyperbola, the length of the semi-conjugate axis, CD or
CE, is a mean proportional between CO and CP, drawn parallel to the base, and
meeting the sides of the cone in O and P. Or, if AO be drawn parallel to the
side VB, and meet PC produced in O, making CO = CO; and on this diameter OP a
circle be drawn parallel to the base: then the semi-conjugate CD or CE will be
an ordinate of this circle, being perpendicular to OP as well as to AB.

Or, in both figures, the whole conjugate axis DE is a mean proportional
between QA and BR, parallel to the base of the cone. For, because AB is double
of AC or CB, therefore, by similar triangles, QA is double of OC, and BR double
of CP; consequently

DE2 or 2C ^ 2E, or 2CO ^ 2CP is = QA ^ BR, or QA DE DE BR.

In the parabola both the transverse and conjugate are infinite; for AB and BR
are both infinite.

COROL. 2. In all the sections AG will be equal to the parameter of the axis,
if QG be drawn making the angle AQG equal to the angle BAR.

For, by the definition, AB DE DE p the param. But by corol. 1, BR DE DE AQ;
Therefore AB BR AQ p. But, by similar triangles, AB BR AQ AG; And therefore AG
= p the parameter.

In like manner Bg will be equal to the parameter p, if Rg be drawn to make the
angle BRg = the angle ABQ; since here also AB AQ BR BG = p.

COROL. 3. Hence the upper hyperbolic section, or section of the opposite cone,
is equal and similar to the lower section. For the two sections have the same
transverse or first axis AB, and the same conjugate or second axis DE, which is
the mean proportional between AQ and RB; they have also equal parameters AG,
Bg. So that the two opposite sections make, as it were, but the two opposite
ends of one entire section or hyperbola, the two being every where mutually
equal and similar. Like the two halves of an ellipse, with their ends turned
the contrary way.

COROL. 4. And hence, although both the transverse and conjugate axis in the
parabola be infinite, yet the former is infinitely greater than the latter, or
has an infinite ratio to it. For the transverse has the same ratio to the
conjugate, as the conjugate has to the parameter, that is, as an infinite to a
finite quantity, which is an infinite ratio.

OF THE ELLIPSE.
PROPOSITION I.
The Squares of the Ordinates of the Axis are to each other as the Rectangles
of their Abscisses.

Let AVB be a plane passing through the axis of the cone; AGIH another section
of the cone perpendicular to the plane of the former; AB the axis of this
elliptic section; and FG, HI ordinates perpendicular to it. Then I say that FG2
HI2 AF^FB AH^HB.

diagram

For, through the ordinates FG, HI draw the circular sections KGL, MIN parallel
to the base of the cone, having KL, MN for their diameters, to which FG, HI are
ordinates, as well as to the axis of the ellipse.

Now, by the similar triangles AFL, AHN, and BFL, BHM, we have AF AH FL HN, and
FB HB KF MH; hence, taking the rectangles of the corresponding terms, we have
the rect. AF^FB AH^HB KF^FL MH^HN. But, by the nature of the circle, KF^FL =
FG2, and MH^HN = HI2; Therefore the rect. AF^FB AH^HB FG2 HI2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. All the parallel sections are similar figures, or have their two
axes in the same proportion; that is, AB ab DE de.

For, by sim. triang. AB ab AQ aq, and AB ab RB rb; Theref. by comp. AB2 ab2
AQ^RB aq^rb. But AQ^RB = DE2, and aq^rb = de2; Therefore AB2 ab2 DE2 de2, or AB
ab DE de.

COROL. 2. Hence also, as the property is the same for the ordinates on both
sides of the diameter, it follows, that

1st. At equal distances from the center, or from the vertices, the ordinates
on both sides are equal, or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis;
and that the whole figure, made up of all the double ordinates, is also
bisected by the axis.

2d. The two foci are equally distant from the center, or from either vertex.

COROL. 3. When the angle, which the plane of the section makes with the base
of the cone, increases till it become equal to the angle made by the side of
the cone and the base, or till the section be parallel to the opposite side of
the base; then the axis becomes infinitely long, and the ellipse degenerates
into a parabola; and because then the infinites FB and HB are in a ratio of
equality, the general property, namely AF^FB AH^HB FG2 HI2, becomes AF AH FG2
HI2, or, in the parabola, the abscisses are to each other, as the squares of
their ordinates.

PROPOSITION II.
As the Square of the Transverse Axis: Is to the Square of the Conjugate So is
the Rectangle of the Abscisses: To the Square of their Ordinate.

That is, AB2 ab2 or AC2 ac2 AD^DB DE2.

diagram

For, by prop. 1. AC^CB AD^DB ca2 DE2; But, if C be the center, then AC^CB =
AC2, and ca is the semi-conj. Therefore AC2 AD^DB ac2 DE2; or, by permutation,
AC2 ac2 AD^DB DE2; or, by doubling, AB2 ab2 AD^DB DE2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Or, because the rectangle AD^DB = CA2 - CD2, the same property is
CA2 ca2 CA2 - CD2 DE2, or AB2 ab2 CA2 - CD2 DE2.

COROL. 2. Or, by div. AB ab2/AB CA2 - CD2 DE2, that is, AB p AD^DB or CA2 -
CD2 DE2; where p is the parameter ab2/AB by the definition of it.

That is, As the transverse, Is to its parameter, So is the rectangle of the
abscisses, To the square of their ordinate.

COROL. 3. When the axis AB is infinitely long, the curve becomes a parabola,
and the infinites AB, DB are then in a ratio of equality; and then the last
property, namely AB p AD^DB DE2; or AB^DE AD^DB p DE, becomes DE AD p DE, or AD
DE DE p.

That is, in the parabola, the parameter is a third proportional to any absciss
and its ordinate.

PROPOSITION III.
As the Square of the Conjugate Axis Is to the Square of the Transverse Axis So
is the Rectangle of the Abscisses of the Conjugate, or the Difference of the
Squares of the Semi-conjugate and Distance of the Center from any Ordinate of
that Axis To the Square of that Ordinate.
That is, Ca2 CB2 ad^db or Ca2 - cd2 dE2.

diagram

For draw the ordinate ED to the transverse AB.

Then, by cor. 1. prop. 2. CA2 Ca2 CA2-CD2 DE2.

But CD2 = dE2, and DE2 = cd2, therefore CA2 Ca2 CA2 - dE2 Cd2, or by
alternation, CA2 CA2 - dE2 Ca2 Cd2, and by division, CA2 dE2 Ca2 Ca2 - Cd2, and
by alter. and invers. Ca2 CA2 Ca2 - Cd2 dE2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. If two circles be described on the two axes as diameters, the one
inscribed within the ellipse, and the other circumscribed about it; then an
ordinate in the circle will be to the corresponding ordinate in the ellipse, as
the axis of this ordinate, is to the other axis.

That is, CA Ca DG DE, and Ca CA dg dE.

For, by the nature of the circle, AD^DB = DG2; theref. by the nature of the
ellipse, CA2 Ca2 AD^DB2 or DG2 DE2, or CA Ca DG DE.

In like manner Ca CA dg dE. Moreover, by equality, DG DE or Cd dE or DC dg.

Therefore CgG is a continued strait line.

COROL. 2. Hence also, as the ellipse and circle are made up of the same number
of corresponding ordinates, which are all in the same proportion of the two
axes, it follows that the areas of the whole circle and ellipse, as also of any
like parts of them, are in the same proportion of the two axes, or as the
square of the diameter to the rectangle of the two axes; that is, the areas of
the two circles, and of the ellipse, are as the square of each axis and the
rectangle of the two, and therefore the ellipse is a mean proportional between
the two circles.

PROPOSITION IV.
The Square of the Distance of the Focus from the Center, is equal to the
Difference of the Squares of the Semi-axis; Or, the Square of the Distance
between the Foci, is equal to the Difference of the Squares of the two Axes.

That is, CF2 = CA2 - Ca2, or Ff2 = AB2 - ab2.

diagram

For, to the focus F draw the ordinate FE; which, by the definition, will be
the semi-parameter. Then by the nature of the curve CA2 Ca2 CA2 - CF2 FE2; and
by the def. of the para. CA2 Ca2 Ca2 FE2; therefore Ca2 = CA2 - CF2; and by
addit. and subtr. CF2 = CA2 - Ca2; or, by doubling, Ff2 = AB2 - ab2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The two semi-axes, and the focal distance from the center, are the
sides of a right angled triangle CFa; and the distance Fa from the focus to the
extremity of the conjugate axis, is = AC the semi-transverse.

For, as above, CA2 - Ca2 = CF2, and by right angled triangles Fa2 - Ca2 = CF2,
therefore CA = Fa, and AB = Fa + fa.

COROL. 2. The conjugate semi-axis Ca is a mean proportional between AF, FB, or
between Af, fB, the distances of either focus from the two vertices.

For Ca2 = CA2 - CF2 = CA + CF^CA - CF = AF^FB.

COROL. 3. The same rectangle AF^FB of the focal distances from either vertex,
is also equal to the rectangle AC^FE under the semi-transverse and its
semi-parameter; since this last is equal to the square of the semi-conjugate by
the definition of the parameter.

Or AF FE AC FB.

PROPOSITION V.
The Difference between the Semi-transverse and a Line drawn from the Focus to
any Point in the Curve, is equal to a Fourth Proportional to the
Semi-transverse, the Distance from the Center to the Focus, and the Distance
from the Center to the Ordinate belonging to that Point of the Curve.

That is, AC - FE = CI, or FE = AI; and fE - AC = CI, or fE = BY.

Where CA CF CD CI the 4th proportional to CA, CF, CD.

diagram

For, by right angled triangles, FE2 = FD2 + DE2.

Now draw AG parallel and equal to ca the semi-conjugate; and join CG meeting
the ordinate DE in H.

Then, by prop. 2, CA2 AG2 CA2 - CD2 DE2; and, by sim. tri. CA2 AG2 CA2 - CD2
AG2 - DH2; consequently DE2 = AG2 - DH2 = Ca2 - DH2. Also FD = CF CD, and FD2 =
CF2 - 2CF^CD + CD2; therefore FE2 = CF2 + Ca2 - 2CF^CD + CD2 - DH2.

But by prop. 4. Ca2 + CF2 = CA2 and, by supposition, 2CF^CD = 2CA^CI; theref.
FE2 = CA2 - 2CA^CI + CD2 - DH2.

But, by supposition CA2 CD2 CF2 or CA2 - AG2 CI2; and, by sim. tri. CA2 CD2
CA2 - AG2 CD2 - DH2; therefore CI2 = CD2 - DH2; consequently FE2 = CA2 - 2CA^CI
+ CI2. And the root or side of this square is FE = CA - CI = AI.

In the same manner is found fE = CA + CI = BY. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence CI or CA - FE is a 4th proportional to CA, CF, CD.

COROL. 2. And fE - FE = 2CI; that is, the difference between two lines drawn
from the foci, to any point in the curve, is double the 4th proportional to CA,
CF, CD.

PROPOSITION VI.
The Sum of two Lines drawn from the Foci, to meet in any Point of the Curve is
equal to the Transverse Axis.

That is, FE + fE = AB.

diagram

For, by the last prop. FE = CA - CI = AI, and, by the same, fE = CA + CI = BY;
theref. by addition, FE + fe = AB.

COROL. Hence is derived the common method of describing the curve mechanically
by points, or with a thread, thus.

diagram

In the transverse take the foci F, f, and any point I. Then with the radii AI,
BY, and centers F, f, describe arcs intersecting in E, which will be a point in
the curve. In like manner, assuming other points I, as many other points will
be found in the curve. Then with a steady hand, draw the curve line through all
the points of intersection E.

Or, take a thread of the length of AB the transverse axis, and fix its two
ends in the foci F, f, by two pins. Then carry a pen or pencil round by the
thread, keeping it always stretched, and its point will trace out the curve
line.

PROPOSITION VII.
If from any Point I in the Axis produced, a Line IEH be drawn cutting the
curve in Two Points; and from those Two Points be drawn the Perpendicular
Ordinates DE, GH; and if K be the Middle of DG, and C the Center or the Middle
of AB: Then shall CK be to CI as the Rectangle of AD and AG to the Square of AI.

That is, CK CI AD^AG AI2.

diagram

For, by prop. I. AD^DB AG^GB DE2 GH2, and by sim. tri. ID2 IG2 DE2 GH2;
theref. by equality, AD^DB AG^GB ID2 IG2.

But DB = 2CK + AG, and GB = 2CK + AD, theref. AD^2CK + AD^AG AG^2CK + AD^AG
ID2 IG2, and, by div. DG^2CK IG2 - ID2 or DG2^2IK AD^2CK+AD^AG ID2. or 2CK 2IK
AD^2CK + AD^AG ID2 or AD^2CK AD^2IK AD^2CK + AD^AG ID2; theref. by div. CK IK
AD^AG ID2 - AD^2IK, and, by comp. CK CI AD^AG ID2 - AD^ID + IA, or CK CI AD^AG
AI2. Q.E.D.

COROL. When the line IH, by revolving about the point I, comes into the
position of the tangent IL, and the ordinate LM being drawn, then the points E
and H meet in the point L, and the points D, K, G, coincide with the point M;
and then the property in the proposition becomes CM CI AM2 AI2.

PROPOSITION VIII.
If a Tangent and Ordinate be drawn from any Point in the Curve, meeting the
Transverse Axis; the Semi-transverse will be a Mean Proportional between the
Distances of the said Two Intersections from the Center.

That is, CA is a mean proportion between CD and CT; or CD, CA, CT are
continued proportionals.

diagram

For, by cor. prop. 7, CD CT AD2 AT2, that is, ^, or CD2+CA2 CA2+CT2, and CD2
CA2, and CA2 CT2; therefore CD CA CA CT. Q.E.D.
COROL. 1. Since CT is always a third proportional to CD, CA; if the points D,
A, remain constant, then will the point T be constant also; and therefore all
the tangents will meet in this point T, which are drawn from E, of every
ellipse described on the same axis AB, where they are cut by the common
ordinate DEE drawn from the point D.

COROL. 2. Hence a tangent is easily drawn to the curve, from any point, either
in the curve or without it.

First, if the given point E be in the curve. Draw the ordinate DE of the
diameter AC; and in the diameter produced take CT a third proportional to CD,
CA. Then join TE for the tangent required.

But if the point T be given any where without the curve. Join CT, in which
take CD a third proportional to CT, CA; and draw the ordinate DE. Then join TE
as before.

PROPOSITION IX.
If there be any Tangent meeting Four Perpendiculars to the Axis drawn from
these four Points, namely the Center, the two Extremities of the Axis, and the
Point of Contact; those Four Perpendiculars will be Proportionals.

That is, AG DE CH BY.

diagram

For, by prop. 8, TC AC AC DC, theref. by div. TA AD TC AC or CB, and by comp.
TA TD TC TB, and by sim. tri. AG DE CH BY. Q.E.D.

COROL. Hence TA, TD, TC, TB and TG, TE, TH, TI are also proportionals.

For these are as AG, DE, CH, BY, by similar triangles.

PROPOSITION X.
If there be any Tangent, and two Lines drawn from the Foci to the Point of
Contact; these two Lines will make equal Angles with the Tangent.

That is, the FET = fEe.

diagram

For draw the ordinate DE, and fe parallel to FE.

By cor. 1. prop. 5, CA CD CF CA - FE, and by prop. 8, CA CD CT CA; therefore
CT CF CA CA - FE; and by add. and sub. TF Tf FE 2CA - FE or fE by prop. 6. But
by sim. tri. TF Tf FE fe; therefore fE = fe, and conseq. e = fEe. But, because
FE is parallel to fe, the e = FET; therefore the FET = fEe. Q.E.D.

COROL. As opticians find that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection, it appears from our proposition, that rays of light issuing from
the one focus, and meeting the curve in every point, will be reflected into
lines drawn from the other focus. So the ray fE is reflected into FE. And this
is the reason why the points F, f are called foci, or burning points.

PROPOSITION XI.
If a Line be drawn from either Focus, Perpendicular to a Tangent to any Point
of the Curve; the Distance of their Intersection from the Center will be equal
to the Semi-transverse Axis.

That is, if FP, fp be perpendicular to the Tangent TPp, then shall CP and cp
be each equal to CA or CB.

diagram

For, through the point of contact E draw FE and fE meeting FP produced in G.
Then, the GEP = FEP, being each equal to the fEp, and the angles at P being
right, and the side PE being common, the two triangles GEP, FEP are equal in
all respects, and so GE = FE, and GP = FP. Therefore, since FP = FG, and FC =
Ff, and the angle at F common, the side CP will be = fG or AB, that is CP = CA
or CB.

And in the same manner cp = CA or CB. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. A circle described on the transverse axis, as a diameter, will pass
through the points P, p; because all the lines CA, CP, Cp, CB, being equal,
will be radii of the circle.

COROL. 2. CP is parallel to fE, and Cp parallel to FE.

COROL. 3. If at the intersections of any tangent, with the circumscribed
circle, perpendiculars to the tangent be drawn, they will meet the transverse
axis in the two foci. That is, the perpendiculars PF, pf give the foci F, f.

PROPOSITION XII.
The equal Ordinates, or the Ordinates at equal Distances from the Center, on
the opposite Sides and Ends of an Ellipse, have their Extremities connected by
one Right Line passing through the Center, and that Line is bisected by the
Center.

That is, if CD = CG, or the ordinate DE = GH; then shall CE = CH, and EACH will
be a right line.

diagram

For, when CD = CG, then also is DE = GH by cor. 2. prop. 1. But the D = G,
being both right angles; therefore the third side CE = CH, and the DCE = GCH,
and consequently EACH is a right line.

COROL. 1. And, conversely, if EACH be a right line passing through the center;
then shall it be bisected by the center, or have CE = CH; also DE will be = GH,
and CD = CG.

COROL. 2. Hence also, if two tangents be drawn to the two ends E, H of any
diameter EH they will be parallel to each other, and will cut the axis at equal
angles, and at equal distances from the center. For, the two CD, CA being equal
to the two CG, CB, the third proportionals CT, CS will be equal also; then the
W sides CE, CT being equal to the two CH, CS, and the included angle ECT equal
to the included angle HCS, all the other corresponding parts are equal: and so
the T = S, and TE parallel to HS.

COROL. 3. And hence the four tangents, at the four extremities of any two
conjugate diameters, form a parallelogram circumscribing the ellipse, and the
pairs of opposite sides are each equal to the corresponding parallel conjugate
diameters.

For, if the diameter eh be drawn parallel to the tangent TE or HS, it will be
the conjugate to EH by the definition; and the tangents to eh will be parallel
to each other, and to the diameter EH for the same reason.

PROPOSITION XIII.
If two Ordinates ED, ed be drawn from the Extremities E, e, of two Conjugate
Diameters, and Tangents be drawn to the same Extremities, and meeting the Axis
produced in T and R;

Then shall CD be a mean Proportional between Cd, dR, and Cd a mean
Proportional between CD, DT.

For, by prop. 8, CD CA CA CT, and by the same Cd CA CA CR; theref. by equality
CD cd CR CT, But by sim. tri. DT Cd CT CR; theref. by equality CD Cd Cd DT. In
like manner Cd CD CD dR. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence CD Cd CR CT.

COROL. 2. Hence also CD Cd de DE.

And the rect. CD ^ DE = cd ^ de, or CDE = Cde.

COROL. 3. Also Cd2 = CD^DT, and CD2 = Cd^dR.

Or Cd a mean proportional between CD, DT; and CD a mean proportional between
Cd, dR.

PROPOSITION XIV.
The same Figure being constructed as in the last Proposition, each Ordinate

For, by prop. 8, CD CA CA CT, and by div. CD CA AD AT, and by comp. CD DB AD
DT, or DA DT DC DB.

In like manner dA dR dC dB. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence, and from cor. 3 to the last prop. we have Cd2 = CD^DT = AD^DB
= CA2 - CD2, CD2 = Cd^dR = Ad^dB = CA2 - Cd2.

COROL. 2. Hence also CA2 = CD2 + Cd2, and Ca2 = DE2 + de2.

COROL. 3. Farther, because CA2 Ca2 AD^DB or Cd2 DE2, therefore CA Ca Cd DE.
likewise CA Ca CD de.

For, by prop. 2, CA2 Ca2 AD^DB DE2, But, by rt. angled s, the rect. TD^DP =

PROPOSITION XVI.
All the Parallelograms circumscribed about an Ellipse are equal to one
another, and each equal to the Rectangle of the two Axes.

That is, the Parallelogram PQRS = the rectangle AB^ab.

diagram

Let EG, eg be two conjugate diameters parallel to the sides of the
parallelogram, and dividing it into four lesser and equal parallelograms. Also
draw the ordinates DE, de, and CK perpendicular to PQ.

diagram

Then, by prop. 8, CT CA CA CD; and, by cor. 3 prop. 14, Ca de CA CD; theref.
by equality, CT CA Ca de.

And by sim. tri. CT CK Ce de, theref. by equality CK CA Ca Ce, and the rect.
CK^Ce = rect. CA^Ca.

But the rect. CK^Ce = the parallelogram CEQe; theref. the rect. CA^Ca = the
parallelogram CEQe; and, by doubling, the rect. AB^ab = the paral. PQRS. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The rectangles of every pair of conjugate diameters, are to one
another reciprocally as the sines of their included angles. For the areas of
their parallelograms, which are all equal among themselves, are equal to the
rectangles of the sides, or conjugate diameters, multiplied by the sines of
their contained angles, the radius being 1. That is, the rectangle of every two
conjugate diameters, drawn into the sine of their contained angle, is equal to
the same constant quantity. And therefore the rectangle of the diameters is
inversely as the sine of their contained angle.

COROL. 2. As it is proved in this proposition that every circumscribing
parallelogram of an ellipse is a constant quantity, so it may hence be shown
that each of the spaces EAgP, EaeQ, GBeR, Gbgs, between the curve and the
tangents, is equal to a constant quantity. For, since every diameter bisects
the ellipse, the conjugate diameters EG, eg divide the ellipse into four equal
sectors CEAg, CEae, CGBe, CGbg; but the same conjugate diameters divide also
the whole tangential parallelogram PQRs into four equal parts, or small
parallelograms CEPg, CEQe, CGRe, CGSg; and therefore the differences between
these small parallelograms and the sectors, which are the said external spaces,
must be all equal among themselves.

And as the ellipse and circumscribing parallelogram both remain constant, the
difference of their fourth parts will also be a constant quantity. That is, the
said external parts are each equal to the same constant quantity.

PROPOSITION XVII.
The Sum of the Squares of every Pair of Conjugate Diameters, is equal to the
same constant Quantity, namely the Sum of the Squares of the two Axes.

That is, AB2 + ab2 = EG2 + eg2, where EG, eg are any conjugate diameters.

diagram

For draw the ordinates ED, ed. Then, by cor. 2 prop. 14, CA2 = CD2 + cd2, and
ca2 = DE2 + de2; therefore the sum CA2 + ca2 = CD2 + DE2 + cd2 + de2. But, by
rt. ed s, CE2 = CD2 + DE2, and ce2 = cd2 + de2; therefore CE2 + ce2 = CD2 + DE2
+ cd2 + de2. consequently CA2 + ca2 = CE2 + ce2; Or, by doubling, AB2 + ab2 =
EG2 + eg2. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION XVIII.
If there be Two Tangents drawn, the One to the Extremity of the Transverse,
and the other to the Extremity of any other Diameter, each meeting the other's
Diameter produced; the two Tangential Triangles so formed, will be equal.

That is, the triangle CET = the triangle CAN.

diagram

For, draw the ordinate DE. Then By sim. triangles CD CA CE CN; but, by prop.
8, CD CA CA CT; theref. by equal. CA CT CE CN.

The two triangles CET, CAN have then the angle C common, and the sides about
that angle reciprocally proportional; therefore those triangles are equal.

Namely the CET = CAN. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. From each of the equal tri. CET, CAN, take the common space CAPE,
and there remains the external PAT = PNE.

COROL. 2. Also from the equal triangles CET, CAN, take the common triangle
CED, and there remains the TED = trapez. ANED.

PROPOSITION XIX.
The same being supposed as in the last Proposition; then any Lines KQ, GQ,
drawn parallel to the two Tangents, shall also cut off equal Spaces.

That is, the Triangle KQG = Trapez. ANHG. and the Triangle Kqg = Trapez. ANhg.

For draw the ordinate DE. Then The three sim. triangles CAN, CDE, CGH, are to

theref. by equal. ANED TED ANHG KQG. But, by cor. 2 prop. 18, the trap. ANED =
TED; and therefore the trap. ANHG = KQG. In like manner the trap. ANhg = Kqg.
Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The three spaces ANHG, TEHG, KQG are all equal.

COROL. 2. From the equals ANHG, KQG, take the equals ANhg, Kqg, and there

COROL. 3. And from the equals ghHG, gqQG, take the common space gqLHG, and
there remains the LQH = Lqh.

COROL. 4. Again from the equals KQG, TEHG, take the common space KLHG, and
there remains TELK = LQH.

COROL. 5. And when, by the lines KQ, GH, moving with a parallel motion, KQ
comes into the position IR, where CR is the conjugate to CA; then the triangle
KQG becomes the triangle IRC, and the space ANHG becomes the triangle ANC; and
therefore the IRC = ANC = TEC.

COROL. 6. Also when the lines KQ and HQ, by moving with a parallel motion,
come into the position Ce, Me, the triangle LQH becomes the triangle CeM, and
the space TELK becomes the triangle TEC; and theref. the CeM = TEC = ANC = IRC,

PROPOSITION XX.
Any Diameter bisects all its Double Ordinates, or the Lines drawn Parallel to
the Tangent at its Vertex, or to its Conjugate Diameter.

That is, if Qq be parallel to the Tangent TE, or to ce, then shall LQ = Lq.

diagram

For draw QH, qh perpendicular to the transverse. Then by cor. 3. prop. 18, 19,
the LQH = Lqh; but these triangles are also equiangular; consequently their
like sides are equal, and therefore LQ = Lq. Q.E.D.

COROL. Any diameter divides the ellipse into two equal parts.

For, the ordinates on each side being equal to each other, and equal in
number; all the ordinates, or the area, on one side of the diameter, is equal
to all the ordinates, or the area, on the other side of it.

PROPOSITION XXI.
As the Square of any Diameter Is to the Square of its Conjugate So is the

For draw the tangent TE, and produce the ordinate QL to the transverse at K.
Also draw QH, eM perpendicular to the transverse, and meeting EG in H and M.

Then similar triangles being as the squares of their like sides, we shall
have, by sim. triangles, CET CLK CE2 CL2; or, by division, CET trap. TELK CE2
CE2 - CL2. Again, by sim. tri. ceM LQH ce2 LQ2.

But, by cor. 5 prop. 19, the ceM = CET, and, by cor. 4 prop. 19, the LQH =

Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The squares of the ordinates to any diameter, are to one another as
the rectangles of their respective abscisses, or as the difference of the
squares of the semi-diameter and of the distance between the ordinate and
center. For they are all in the same ratio of CE2 to ce2.

COROL. 2. The above being the same property as that belonging to the two axes,
all the other properties before laid down, for the axes, may be understood of
any two conjugate diameters whatever, using only the oblique ordinates of these
diameters instead of the perpendicular ordinates of the axes; namely, all the
properties in propositions 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 and 19.

That is, if CR and Cr be Parallel to any two Lines PHQ, pHq; then shall CR2
Cr2 PH^HQ PH^Hq.

diagram

For draw the diameter CHE, and the tangent TE and its parallels PK, RI, MH,
meeting the conjugate of the diameter CR in the points T, K, I, M. Then,
because similar triangles are as the squares of their like sides, we have, by
sim. triangles, CR2 GP2 CRI GPK, and CR2 GH2 CRI GHM; theref. by division, CR2
GP2 - GH2 CRI KPHM. Again, by sim. tri. CE2 CH2 CTE CMH; and by division, CE2
CE2 - CH2 CTE TEHM. But, by cor. 5 prop. 19, the CTE = CIR, and by cor. 1 prop.
19, TEHG = KPHG, or TEHM = KPHM; theref. by equ. CE2 CE2 - CH2 CR2 GP2 - GH2 or
PH^HQ. In like manner CE2 CE2 - CH2 Cr2 pH^Hq. Theref. by equal CR2 Cr2 PH^HQ
pH^Hq. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. In like manner, if any other line pHq, parallel to Cr or to pq, meet
PHQ; since the rectangles PHQ, pHq are also in the same ratio of CR2 to Cr2;
theref. the rect. PHQ pHq PHQ pHq.

Also, if another line PhQ be drawn parallel to PQ or CR; because the
rectangles PhQ, phq are still in the same ratio, therefore, in general, the
rectangle PHQ pHq PhQ phq.

That is, the rectangles of the parts of two parallel lines, are to one
another, as the rectangles of the parts of two other parallel lines, any where
intersecting the former.

COROL. 2. And when any of the lines only touch the curve, instead of cutting
it, the rectangles of such become squares, and the general property still
attends them.

OF THE HYPERBOLA.
PROPOSITION I.
The Squares of the Ordinates of the Axis are to each other as the Rectangles
of their Abscisses.

Let AVB be a plane passing through the vertex and axis of the opposite cones;
AGIH another section of them perpendicular to the plane of the former; AB the
axis of the hyperbolic sections; and FG, HI ordinates perpendicular to it. Then
FG2 HI2 AF^FB AH^HB.

diagram

For, through the ordinates FG, HI draw the circular sections KGL, MIN parallel
to the base of the cone, having KL, MN for their diameters, to which FG, HI are
ordinates, as well as to the axis of the hyperbola.

Now, by the similar triangles AFL, AHN, and BFK, BHM, we have AF AH FL HN, and
FB HB KF MH; hence, taking the rectangles of the corresponding terms, we have
the rect. AF^FB AH^HB KF^FL MH^HN. But, by the nature of the circle, KF^FL =
FG2, and MH^HN = HI2; Therefore the rect. AF^FB AH^HB FG2 HI2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. All the parallel sections are similar figures, or have their two
axes in the same proportion; that is, AB ab DE de.

For, by sim. triang. AB ab AQ aq, and AB ab RB rb; Theref. by comp. AB2 ab2
AQ^RB aq^rb. But AQ^RB = DE2, and aq^rb = de2; Therefore AB2 ab2 DE2 de2, or AB
ab DE de.

COROL. 2. Hence also, as the property is the same for the ordinates on both
sides of the diameter, it follows, that

1st. At equal distances from the center, or from the vertices, the ordinates
on both sides are equal, or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis;
and that the whole figure, made up of all the double ordinates, is also
bisected by the axis.

2d. The two foci are equally distant from the center, or from either vertex.

COROL. 3. When the angle, which the plane of the section makes with the base
of the cone, decreases till it become equal to the angle made by the side of
the cone and the base, or till the section be parallel to the opposite side of
the base; then the axis becomes infinitely long, and the hyperbola degenerates
into a parabola; and because then the infinites FB and HB are in a ratio of
equality, the general property, namely AF^FB AH^HB FG2 HI2, becomes AF AH FG2
HI2, or, in the parabola, the abscisses are to each other, as the squares of
their ordinates.

That is, AB2 ab2 or AC2 ac2 AD^DB DE2.

diagram

For, by prop. 1. AC^CB AD^DB ca2 DE2; But, if C be the center, then AC^CB =
AC2, and ca is the semi-conj. Therefore AC2 AD^DB ac2 DE2; or, by permutation,
AC2 ac2 AD^DB DE2; or, by doubling, AB2 ab2 AD^DB DE2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Or, because the rectangle AD^DB = CA2 - CD2, the same property is
CA2 Ca2 CD2 - CA2 DE2, or AB2 ab2 CD2 - CA2 DE2.

COROL. 2. Or, by div. AB ab2/AB CD2 - CA2 DE2, that is, AB p AD^DB or CD2 -
CA2 DE2; where p is the parameter ab2/AB by the definition of it.

That is, As the transverse, Is to its parameter, So is the rectangle of the
abscisses, To the square of their ordinate.

COROL. 3. When the axis AB is infinitely long, the curve becomes a parabola,
and the insinites AB, DB are then in a ratio of equality; and then the last
property, namely AB p AD^DB DE2; or AB^DE AD^DB p DE, becomes DE AD p DE, or AD
DE DE p.

That is, in the parabola, the parameter is a third proportional to any absciss
and its ordinate.

That is, ca2 CA2 ca2 + cd2 dE2.

diagram

For draw the ordinate ED to the transverse AB.

Then, by prop. 1. CA2 ca2 CD2 - CA2 DE2.

But CD2 = dE2, and DE2 = cd2, therefore CA2 ca2 dE2 - CA2 cd2, or by
alternation, CA2 dE2 - CA2 ca2 cd2, and by composition, CA2 dE2 ca2 ca2 + cd2,
and by alter. and invers. ca2 CA2 ca2 + cd2 dE2. In like manner CA2 ca2 CA2 +
CD2 De2. Q.E.D.

COROL. By the last prop. CA2 ca2 CD2 - CA2 DE2, and by this prop. CA2 ca2 CD2
+ CA2 De2, therefore DE2 De2 CD2 - CA2 CD2 + CA2. In like manner de2 dE2 cd2 -
ca2 cd2 + ca2.

PROPOSITION IV.
The Square of the Distance of the Focus from the Center, is equal to the Sum
of the Squares of the Semi-axes.

Or, the Square of the Distance between the Foci, is equal to the Sum of the
Squares of the two Axes.

That is, CF2 = CA2 + ca2, or Ff2 = AB2 + ab2.

diagram

For, to the focus F draw the ordinate FE; which, by the definition, will be
the semi-parameter. Then by the nature of the curve CA2 ca2 CF2 - CA2 FE2; and
by the def. of the para. CA2 ca2 ca2 FE2; therefore ca2 = CF2 - CA2; and by
addit. CF2 = CA2 + ca2; or, by doubling, Ff2 = AB2 + ab2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The two semi-axes, and the focal distance from the center, are the
sides of a right angled triangle CAa; and the distance Aa is = CF the focal
distance.

For, as above, CA2 + ca2 = CF2, and by right angled s, ca2 + ca2 = Aa2,
therefore CF = Aa, and Ff = Aa + Ba.

COROL. 2. The conjugate semi-axis ca is a mean proportional between AF, FB, or
between Af, fB, the distances of either focus from the two vertices.

For ca2 = CF2 - CA2 = CF + CA^CF - CA = AF^FB.

COROL. 3. The same rectangle AF^FB of the focal distances from either vertex,
is also equal to the rectangle AC^FE under the semi-transverse and its
semi-parameter; since this last is equal to the square of the semi-conjugate by
the definition of the parameter.

Or AF FE AC FB.

PROPOSITION V.
The Difference between the Semi-transverse and a Line drawn from the Focus to
any Point in the Curve, is equal to a Fourth Proportional to the
Semi-transverse, the Distance from the Center to the Focus, and the Distance
from the Center to the Ordinate belonging to that Point of the Curve.

That is, AC - FE = CI, or FE = AI; and fE - AC = CI, or fE = BY.

Where CA CF CD CI the 4th proportional to CA, CF, CD.

diagram

For, by right angled triangles, FE2 = FD2 + DE2.

Now draw AG parallel and equal to ca the semi-conjugate; and join CG meeting
the ordinate DE produced in H.

Then, by prop. 2, CA2 AG2 CD2 - CA2 DE2; and, by sim. Ds, CA2 AG2 CD2 - CA2
DH2 - AG2; consequently DE2 = DH2 - AG2 = DH2 - ca2. Also FD = CF CD, and FD2 =
CF2 - 2CF^CD + CD2; therefore FE2 = CF2 - ca2 - 2CF^CD + CD2 + DH2.

But by prop. 4. CF2 + Ca2 = CA2 and, by supposition, 2CF^CD = 2CA^CI; theref.
FE2 = CA2 - 2CA^CI + CD2 + DH2.

But, by supposition CA2 CD2 CF2 or CA2 + AG2 CI2; and, by sim. s, CA2 CD2 CA +
AG2 CD2 + DH2; therefore CI2 = CD2 + DH2 = CH2; consequently FE2 = CA2 - 2CA^CI
+ CI2. And the root or side of this square is FE = CI - CA = AI.

In the same manner is found fE = CI + CA = BY. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence CH = CI is a 4th proportional to CA, CF, CD.

COROL. 2. And fE + FE = 2CH or 2CI; or FE, CH, fE are in continued
arithmetical progression, the common difference being CA the semi-transverse.

COROL. 3. From the demonstration it appears that DE2 = DH2 - AG2 = DH2 - Ca2.
Consequently DH is every where greater than DE; and so the asymptote CGH never
meets the curve, though they be ever so far produced: but DH and DE approach
nearer and nearer to a ratio of equality as they recede farther from the
vertex, till at an infinite distance they become equal, and the asymptote is a
tangent to the curve at an infinite distance from the vertex.

PROPOSITION VI.
The Difference of two Lines drawn from the Foci, to meet in any Point of the
Curve, is equal to the Transverse Axis.

That is, fE - FE = AB.

For, by the last prop. FE = CI - CA = AI, and, by the same, fE = CI + CA = BY;
theref. by subtraction, fE - FE = AB.

COROL. Hence is derived the common method of describing the curve mechanically
by points, thus.

In the transverse AB, produced, take the foci F, f, and any point 1. Then with
the radii AI, BY, and centers F, f, describe arcs intersecting in E, which will
be a point in the curve. In like manner, assuming other points 1, as many other
points will be found in the curve.

Then with a steady hand, draw the curve line through all the points of
intersection E.

In the same manner are constructed the other two hyperbolas, using the axis ab
instead of AB.

COROL. When the line IH, by revolving about the point 1, comes into the
position of the tangent IL, and the ordinate LM being drawn, then the points E
and H meet in the point L, and the points D, K, G, coincide with the point M;

PROPOSITION VIII.
If a Tangent and Ordinate be drawn from any Point in the Curve, meeting the
Transverse Axis; the Semitransverse will be a Mean Proportional between the
Distances of the said Two Intersections from the Center.

That is, CA is a mean proportion between CD and CT; or CD, CA, CT are
continued proportionals.

diagram

For, by cor. prop. 7, CD CT AD2 AT2, that is, ^, or CD2 + CA2 CA2 + CT2, and
CD2 CA2, and CA2 CT2; therefore CD CA CA CT. Q.E.D.
COROL. 1. Since CT is always a third proportional to CD, CA; if the points D,
A, remain constant, then will the point T be constant also; and therefore all
the tangents will meet in this point T, which are drawn from E, of every
hyperbola described on the same axis AB, where they are cut by the common
ordinate DEE drawn from the point D.

COROL. 2. Hence a tangent is easily drawn to the curve, from any point, either
in the curve or without it.

First, if the given point E be in the curve. Draw the ordinate DE of the
diameter AC; and in the diameter produced take CT a third proportional to CD,
CA. Then join TE for the tangent required.

But if the point T be given any where without the curve. Join CT, in which
take CD a third proportional to CT, CA; and draw the ordinate DE. Then join TE
as before.

PROPOSITION IX.
If there be any Tangent meeting Four Perpendiculars to the Axis drawn from
these four Points, namely the Center, the two Extremities of the Axis, and the
Point of Contact; those Four Perpendiculars will be Proportionals.

That is, AG DE CH BY.

For, by prop. 8, TC AC AC DC, theref. by div. TA AD TC AC or CB, and by comp.
TA TD TC TB, and by sim. tri. AG DE CH BY. Q.E.D.

For these are as AG, DE, CH, BY, by similar triangles.

PROPOSITION X.
If there be any Tangent, and two Lines drawn from the Foci to the Point of
Contact; these two Lines will make equal Angles with the Tangent.

That is, the FET = fEe.

For draw the ordinate DE, and fe parallel to FE. By cor. 1. prop. 5, CA CD CF
CA + FE, and by prop. 8, CA CD CT CA; therefore CT CF CA CA + FE; and by add.
and sub. TF Tf FE 2CA + FE or fE byprop. 6. But by sim. tri. TF Tf FE fe;
therefore fE = fe, and conseq. e = fEe. But, because FE is parallel to fe, the
e = FET; therefore the FET = fEe. Q.E.D.

COROL. As opticians find that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection, it appears from our proposition, that rays of light issuing from
the one focus, and meeting the curve in every point, will be reflected into
lines drawn from the other focus. So the ray fE is reflected into FE. And this
is the reason why the points F, f are called foci, or burning points.

PROPOSITION XI.
If a Line be drawn from either Focus, Perpendicular to a Tangent to any Point
of the Curve; the Distance of their Intersection from the Center will be equal
to the Semi-transverse Axis.

That is, if FP, fp be perpendicular to the Tangent TPp, then shall CP and Cp
be each equal to CA or CB.

diagram

For, through the point of contact E draw FE and fE meeting FP produced in G.
Then, the GEP = FEP, being each equal to the fEp, and the angles at P being
right, and the side PE being common, the two triangles GEP, FEP are equal in
all respects, and so GE = FE, and GP = FP. Therefore, since FP = FG, and FC =
Ff, and the angle at F common, the side CP will be = fG or AB, that is CP = CA
or CB.

And in the same manner Cp = CA or CB. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. A circle described on the transverse axis, as a diameter, will pass
through the points P, p; because all the lines CA, CP, Cp, CB, being equal,
will be radii of the circle.

COROL. 2. CP is parallel to fE, and cp parallel to FE.

COROL. 3. If at the intersections of any tangent, with the circumscribed
circle, perpendiculars to the tangent be drawn, they will meet the transverse
axis in the two foci. That is, the perpendiculars PF, pf give the foci F, f.

PROPOSITION XII.
The equal Ordinates, or the Ordinates at equal Distances from the Center, on
the opposite Sides and Ends of an Ellipse, have their Extremities connected by
one Right Line passing through the Center, and that Line is bisected by the
Center.

That is, if CD = CG, or the ordinate DE = GH; then shall CE = CH, and EACH will
be a right line.

diagram

For, when CD = CG, then also is DE = GH by cor. 2. prop. 1. But the D = G,
being both right angles; therefore the third side CE = ^^ and the DCE = GCH,
and consequently EACH is a right line.

COROL. 1. And, conversely, if EACH be a right line passing through the center;
then shall it be bisected by the center, or have CE = CH; also DE will be = GH,
and CD = CG.

COROL. 2. Hence also, if two tangents be drawn to the two ends E, H of any
diameter EH; they will be parallel to each other, and will cut the axis at
equal angles, and at equal distances from the center. For, the two CD, CA being
equal to the two CG, CB, the third pro portionals CT, CS will be equal also;
then the two sides CE, CT being equal to the two CH, CS, and the included angle
ECT equal to the included angle HCS, all the other corresponding parts are
equal: and so the T = S, and TE parallel to HS.

COROL. 3. And hence the four tangents, at the four extremities of any two
conjugate diameters, form a parallelogram circumscribing the ellipse, and the
pairs of opposite sides are each equal to the corresponding parallel conjugate
diameters.

For, if the diameter eh be drawn parallel to the tangent TE or HS, it will be
the conjugate to EH by the definition; and the tangents to eh will be parallel
to each other, and to the diameter EH for the same reason.

PROPOSITION XIII.
If two Ordinates ED, ed be drawn from the Extremities E, e, of two Conjugate
Diameters, and Tangents be drawn to the same Extremities, and meeting the Axis

Proportional between CD, DT.

For, by prop. 8, CD CA CA CT, and by the same cd CA CA CR; theref. by equality
CD cd CR CT.

But by sim. tri. DT cd CT CR; theref. by equality CD cd cd DT. In like manner
cd CD CD dR.

Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence CD cd CR CT.

COROL. 2. Hence also CD cd de DE.

And the rect. CD^DE = cd^de, or CDE = cde.

Or cd a mean proportional between CD, DT; and CD a mean proportional between
cd, dR.

In like manner dA dR dC dB.

Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence, and from cor. 3 to the last prop. we have

cd2 = CD^DT = AD^DB = CD2 - CA2, CD2 = cd^dR = Ad^dB = CA2 - cd2.

COROL. 2. Hence also CA2 = CD2 - cd2, and ca2 = de2 - DE2.

COROL. 3. Farther, because CA2 ca2 AD^DB or cd2 DE2, therefore CA ca cd DE.

parallelogram CEQE; theref. the rect. CA^Ca = the parallelogram CEQE; and, by
doubling, the rect. AB^ab = the paral. PQRS. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The rectangles of every pair of conjugate diameters, are to one
another reciprocally as the sines of their included angles. For the areas of
their parallelograms, which are all equal among themselves, are equal to the
rectangles of the sides, or conjugate diameters, multiplied by the sines of
their contained angles, the radius being 1. That is, the rectangle of every two
conjugate diameters, drawn into the sine of their contained angle, is equal to
the same constant quantity. And therefore the rectangle of the diameters is
inversely as the sine of their contained angle.

PROPOSITION XVII.
The Difference of the Squares of every Pair of Conjugate Diameters, is equal
to the same constant Quantity, namely the Difference of the Squares of the two

That is, AB2 - ab2 = EG2 - eg2, where EG, eg are any conjugate diameters.

diagram

For draw the ordinates ED, ed. Then, by cor. 8 prop. 9, CA2 = CD2 - cd2, and
ca2 = de2 - DE2; theref. the difference CA2 - Ca2 = CD2 + DE2 - Cd2 - de2. But,
by rt. ed s, CE2 = CD2 + DE2, and Ce2 = Cd2 + de2; therefore CE2 - Ce2 = CD2 +
DE2 - Cd2 - de2. consequently CA2 - Ca2 = CE2 - Ce2; Or, by doubling, AB2 - ab2
= EG2 - eg2. Q.E.D.

For, draw the ordinate DE. Then By sim. triangles CD CA CE CN; but, by prop.
8, CD CA CA CT; theref. by equal. CA CT CE CN.

The two triangles CET, CAN have then the angle C common, and the sides about
that angle reciprocally proportional; therefore those triangles are equal.

Namely the CET = CAN. Q.E.D.

Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The three spaces ANHG, TEHG, KQG are all equal.

COROL. 2. From the equals ANHG, KQG, take the equals ANhg, Kqg, and there

COROL. 5. And when, by the lines KQ, GH, moving with a parallel motion, KQ
comes into the position IR, where CR is the conjugate to CA; then the triangle
KQG becomes the triangle IRC, and the space ANHG becomes the triangle ANC; and
therefore the IRC = ANC = TEC.

COROL. 6. Also when the lines KQ and HQ, by moving with a parallel motion,
come into the position ce, Me, the triangle LQH becomes the triangle CeM, and
the space TELK becomes the triangle TEC; and theref. the CeM = TEC = ANC = IRC,

PROPOSITION XX.
Any Diameter bisects all its Double Ordinates, or the Lines drawn Parallel to
the Tangent at its Vertex, or to its Conjugate Diameter.

That is, if Qq be parallel to the Tangent TE, or to ce, then shall LQ = Lq.

diagram

For draw QH, qh perpendicular to the transverse. Then by cor. 3 prop. 19, the
LQH = Lqh; but these triangles are also equiangular; consequently their like
sides are equal, and therefore LQ = Lq. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Any diameter divides the ellipse into two equal parts.

For, the ordinates on each side being equal to each other, and equal in
number; all the ordinates, or the area, on one side of the diameter, is equal
to all the ordinates, or the area, on the other side of it.

COROL. 2. In like manner, if the ordinate be produced to the conjugate
hyperbolas at Q, q, it may be proved that LQ = Lq. Or if the tangent TE be
produced, then EV = EW. And the diameter GCEH bisects all lines drawn parallel
to TE or Qq, and limited either by one hyperbola, or by its two conjugate
hyperbolas.

For draw the tangent TE, and produce the ordinate QL to the transverse at K.
Also draw QH, eM perpendicular to the transverse, and meeting EG in H and M.

Then similar triangles being as the squares of their like sides, we shall
have, by sim. triangles, CET CLK CE2 CL2; or, by division, CET trap. TELK CE2
CL2 - CE2. Again, by sim. tri. ceM LQH ce2 LQ2. But, by cor. 5 prop. 19, the

CE2 Ce2 CL2 - CE2 LQ2, OF CE2 ce2 EL^LG LQ2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The squares of the ordinates to any diameter, are to one another as
the rectangles of their respective abscisses, or as the difference of the
squares of the semi-diameter and of the distance between the ordinate and
center. For they are all in the same ratio of CE2 to Ce2.

COROL. 2. The above being the same property as that belonging to the two axes,
all the other properties before laid down, for the axes, may be understood of
any two conjugate diameters whatever, using only the oblique ordinates of these
diameters instead of the perpendicular ordinates of the axes; namely, all the
properties in propositions 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 and 19.

COROL. 3. Likewise, when the ordinates are continued to the conjugate
hyperbolas at Q, q, the same properties still obtain, substituting only the sum
for the difference of the squares of CE and CL, That is, CE2 Ce2 CL2 + CE2 CQ2.
And so LQ2 LQ2 CL2 - CE2 CL2 + CE2.

COROL. 4. When, by the motion of LQ parallel to itself, that line coincides
with EV, the last corollary becomes CE2 Ce2 2CE2 EV2, or ce2 EV2 1 2, or ce EV
1 2, or as the side of a square to its diagonal.

That is, in all conjugate hyperbolas; and all their diameters, any diameter is
to its parallel tangent, in the constant ratio of the side of a square to its
diagonal.

For draw the diameter CHE, and the tangent TE and its parallels PK, RI, MH,
meeting the conjugate of the diameter CR in the points T, K, I, M. Then,
because similar triangles are as the squares of their like sides, we have, by
sim. triangles, CR2 GP2 CRI GPK, and CR2 GH2 CRI GHM; theref. by division, CR2
GP2 - GH2 CRI KPHM. Again, by sim. tri. CE2 CH2 CTE CMH; and by division, CE2
CH2 - CE2 CTE TEHM. But, by cor. 5 prop. 19, the CTE = CIR, and by cor. 1 prop.
19, TEHG = KPHG, or TEHM = KPHM; theref. by equ. CE2 CH2 - CE2 CR2 GP2 - GH2 or
PH^HQ. In like manner CE2 CH2 - CE2 Cr2 pH^Hq. Theref. by equal CR2 Cr2 PH^HQ
pH^Hq. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. In like manner, if any other line pHq, parallel to Cr or to pq, meet
PHQ; since the rectangles PHQ, pHq are also in the same ratio of CR2 to cr2;
theref. the rect. PHQ pHq PHQ pHq.

Also, if another line PhQ be drawn parallel to PQ or CR; because the
rectangles PhQ, phq are still in the same ratio, therefore, in general, the
rectangle PHQ pHq phQ phq.

That is, the rectangles of the parts of two parallel lines, are to one
another, as the rectangles of the parts of two other parallel lines, any where
intersecting the former.

COROL. 2. And when any of the lines only touch the curve, instead of cutting

PROPOSITION XXIII.
If a Line be drawn through any Point of the Curves, Parallel to either of the
Axes, and terminated at the Asymptotes; the Rectangle of its Segments, measured
from that Point, will be equal to the Square of the Semi-axis to which it is
parallel.

That is, the Rect. HEK or HeK = Ca2, and the Rect. hEK or hek = CA2.

For draw AL parallel to ca, and aL to CA. Then by the parallels, CA2 Ca2 or
AL2 CD2 DH2; and, by prop. 2, CA2 Ca2 CD2 - CA2 DE2; theref. by subtr. CA2 Ca2
CA2 DH2 - DE2 or HEK. But the antecedents CA2, CA2 are equal, theref. the
consequents Ca2, HEK must also be equal.

In like manner we have, again by the parallels, CA2 ca2 or AL2 CD2 DH2; and,
by prop. 3, CA2 ca2 CD2 + CA2 De2; theref. by subtr. CA2 ca2 CA2 De2 - DH2 or
HeK. But the antecedents CA2, CA2 are the same, theref. the consequents ca2,
HeK must be equal. In like manner, by changing the axes, is hEk or hek = CA2.
Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Because the rect. HEK = the rect. HeK. therefore EH eH eK EK. And
consequently HE is always greater than He.

COROL. 2. The rectangle hEK = the rect. HEk. For, by sim. tri. Eh EH Ek EK.

SCHOLIUM.
It is evident that this proposition is general for any line oblique to the
axis also, namely, that the rectangle of the segments of any line, cut by the
curve, and terminated by the asymptotes, is equal to the square of the
semi-diameter to which the line is parallel. Since the demonstration is drawn
from properties that are common to all diameters.

PROPOSITION XXIV.
All the Rectangles are equal which are made of the Segments of any Parallel
Lines cut by the Curve, and limited by the Asymptotes.

That is, the Rect. HEK = Rect. HeK. and the Rect. hEk = hek.

diagram

For each of the rectangles HEK or HeK is equal to the square of the parallel
semi-diameter CS; and each of the rectangles hEk or hek is equal to the square
of the parallel semi-diameter CI. And therefore the rectangles of the segments
of all parallel lines are equal to one another. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The rectangle HEK being constantly the same, whether the point E is
taken on the one side or the other of the point of contact 1 of the tangent
parallel to HK, it follows that the parts HE, KE, of any line HK, are equal.

And because the rectangle HeK is constant, whether the point e is taken in the
one or the other of the opposite hyperbolas, it follows that the parts He, Ke
are also equal.

COROL. 2. And when HK comes into the position of the tangent DIL, the last
corollary becomes IL = ID, and IM = IN, and LM = DN.

Hence also the diameter CIR bisects all the parallels to DL which are
terminated by the asymptote, namely RH = RK.

COROL. 3. From the proposition, and the last corollary, it follows that the
constant rectangle HEK or EHE is = IL2. And the equal constant rect. HeK or eHe
= MLN or IM2 - IL2.

COROL. 4. And hence IL = the parallel semi-diameter CS.

For the rect. EHE = IL2, and the equal rect. eHe = IM2 - IL2, theref. IL2 =
IM2 - IL2, or IM2 = 2IL2; but, by cor. 4 prop. 21, IM2 = 2CS2, and therefore IL
= CS.

And so the asymptotes passes through the opposite angles of all the inscribed
parallelograms.

PROPOSITION XXV.
The Rectangle of any two Lines drawn from any Point in the Curve, Parallel to
two given Lines, and Limited by the Asymptotes, is a Constant Quantity.

That is, if AP, EG, DI be Parallels, as also AQ, EK, DM Parallels, then shall
the rect. PAQ = rect. GEK = rect IDM.

diagram

For, produce KE, MD to the other asymptote at H, L. Then, by the parallels, HE
GE LD ID; but, EK EK DM DM; theref. the rectangle HEK GEK LDM IDM. But, by the
last prop. the rect. HEK = LDM; and therefore the rect. GEK = IDM = PAQ. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION XXVI.
All the Parallelograms are equal which are formed between the Asymptotes and
Curve, by Lines Parallel to the Asymptotes.

That is, the paral. CGEK = CPAQ.

diagram

For, by prop. 25, the rect. GEK or CGE = rect. PAQ or CPA. But the
parallelograms CGEK, CPAQ being equiangular, are as the rectangles CGE, CPA.
And therefore the parallelogram GK = PQ. That is, all the inscribed
parallelograms are equal to one another. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Because the rectangle GEK or CGE is constant, therefore GE is
reciprocally as CG, or CG CP PA GE. And hence the asymptote continually
approaches toward the curve, but never meets it for GE decreases continually
as CG increases; and ^t is always of some magnitude, except when CG is supposed
to be infinitely great, for then GE is infinitely small, or nothing. So that
the asymptote CG may be considered as a tangent to the curve at a point
infinitely distant from C.

diagram

COROL. 2. If the abscisses CD, CE, CG, etc, taken on the one asymptote, be in
geometrical progression increasing; then shall the ordinates DH, EI, GK, etc,
parallel to the other asymptote, be a decreasing geometrical progression,
having the same ratio. For, all the rectangles CDH, CEI, CGK, etc, being equal,
the ordinates DH, EI, GK, etc, are reciprocally as the abscisses CD, CE, CG,
etc, which are geometricals. And the reciprocals of geometricals are also
geometricals, and in the same ratio.

COROL. 3. But if the abscisses CD, CE, CG, etc, be arithmeticals, or in
arithmetical progression, then shall the ordinates DH, EI, GK, etc, be
harmonicals, or in harmonical progression. For the reciprocals of
arithmeticals, are harmonicals.

PROPOSITION XXVII.
Every Inscribed Triangle, formed by Any Tangent and the two Intercepted Parts
of the Asymptotes, is equal to a Constant Quantity; namely Double the Inscribed
Parallelogram.

That is, the triangle CTS = 2 paral. GK.

diagram

For, since the tangent TS is bisected by the point of contact E, and EK is
parallel to TC, and GE to CK; therefore CK, KS, GE are all equal, as are also
CG, GT, KE. Consequently the triangle GTE = the triangle KES, and each equal to
half the constant inscribed parallelogram GK. And therefore the whole triangle
CTS, which is composed of the two smaller triangles and the parallelogram, is
equal to double the constant inscribed parallelogram GK. Q.E.D.

= QAEK. Again, from the quadrilateral CAEK take the equal triangles CAQ, CEK,
and there remains the sector CAE = QAEK. Therefore CAE = QAEK = PAEG. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION XXIX.
If from the Point of Contact of any Tangent, and the two Intersections of the
Curve with a Line parallel to the Tangent, three parallel Lines be drawn in any
Direction, and terminated by either Asymptote; those three Lines shall be in
continued Proportion.

That is, if HKM and the tangent IL be parallel, then are the parallels DH, EI,
GK in continued proportion.

diagram

For, by the parallels, EI IL DH HM; and, by the same, EI IL GK KM; theref. by
compos. EI2 IL2 DH^GK HMK; but, by prop. 24, the rect. HMK = IL2; and theref.
the rect. DH^GK = EI2, or DH EI EI GK. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION XXX.
Draw the semi-diameters CH, CIN, CK; Then shall the sector CHI = the sector
CIK.

diagram

For, because HK and all its parallels are bisected by CIN, therefore the
triangle CNH = tri. CNK, and the segment INH = seg. INK; consequently the
sector CIH = sec. CIK.

COROL. 2. If the geometricals DH, EI, GK be parallel to the other asymptote,
the spaces DHIE, EIKG will be equal; for they are equal to the equal sectors
CHI, CIK.

So that by taking any geometricals CD, CE, CG, etc, and drawing DH, EI, GK,
etc, parallel to the other asymptote, as also the radii CH, CI, CK. then the
sectors CHI, CIK, etc, or the spaces DHIE, EIKG, etc, will be all equal among
themselves. Or the sectors CHI, CHK, etc, or the spaces DHIE, DHKG, etc, will
be in arithmetical progression.

And therefore these sectors, or spaces, will be analogous to the logarithms of
the lines or bases CD, CE, CG, etc; namely CHI or DHIE the log. of the ratio of
CD to CE, or of CE to CG, etc; or of EI to DH, or of GK to EI, etc; and CHK or
DHKG the log. of the ratio of CD to CG, etc, or of GK to DH, etc.

OF THE PARABOLA.
PROPOSITION I.
The Abscisses are Proportional to the Squares of their Ordinates.

Let AVM be a section through the axis of the cone, and AGIH a parabolic
section by a plane perpendicular to the former, and parallel to the side UN of
the cone; also let AFH be the common intersection of the two planes, or the
axis of the parabola, and FG, HI ordinates perpendicular to it.

diagram

Then I say that AF AH FG2 HI2.

For, through the ordinates FG, HI draw the circular sections KGL, MIN parallel
to the base of the cone, having KL, MN for their diameters, to which FG, HI are
ordinates, as well as to the axis of the parabola.

Then by similar triangles AF AH FL HN; but, because of the parallels, KF = MH;
therefore AF AH KF^FL MH^HN. But, by the circle, KF^FL = FG2, and MH^HN = HI2;
Therefore AF AH FG2 HI2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence the third proportional EG2/AE or HI2/AH is a constant
quantity, and is equal to the parameter of the axis by cor. 5 prop. 1 of the
ellipse.

Or AE EG EG P the parameter.

Or the rectangle P^AE = EG2

COROL. 2. Hence also as the property is the same for the ordinates on both
sides of the diameter, it follows that the ordinates DH, HI, on both sides of
the axis are equal, or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis; and
that the whole figure, made up of all the double ordinates, is also bisected by
the axis.

PROPOSITION II.
As the Parameter of the Axis Is to the Sum of any Two Ordinates So is the
Difference of those Ordinates To the Difference of their Abscisses

That is, P GH + DE GH - DE DG, Or, P KI IH EI.

diagram

For, by cor. 1 prop. 1, P^AG = GH2, and P^AD = DE2; theref. by subtrac. P^DG =
GH2 - DE2. But ^, theref. the rectangle P^DG = KI^IH, or P KI IH DG or EI.
Q.E.D.

COROL. Hence because P^EI = KI^IH, and, by cor. 1 prop. 1, P^AG = GH2,
therefore AG EI GH2 KI^IH.

And so any diameter EI is as the rectangle of the segments KI, IH of the
double ordinate KH.

PROPOSITION III.
The Distance from the Vertex to the Focus is equal to of the Parameter, or to
Half the Ordinate at the Focus.

That is, AF = FE = P.

diagram

For, the general property is AF FE FE P. But, by the definition, FE = P;
therefore also AF = FE = P. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION IV.
A Line drawn from the Focus to any Point in the Curve, is equal to the Sum of
the Focal Distance and the Absciss of the Ordinate to that Point.

That is, FE = FA + AD = GD, taking AG = AF.

diagram

For since FD = AD AF, theref. by squaring, FD2 = AF2 - 2AF^AD + AD2, But, by
cor. 1 prop. 1, DE2 = P^AD = 4AF^AD; theref. by addition, FD2 + DE2 = AF2 +
2AF^AD + AD2, But, by rt. angled s, FD2 + DE2 = FE2; therefore FE2 = AF2 +
2AF^AD + AD2, and the root or side is FE = AF + AD, or FE = GD, by taking AG =
AF. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The difference FE - FE is always equal to DD the difference of the
abscisses.

COROL. 2. Hence also the curve is easily described diagram by points. Namely,
in the axis produced take AG = AF the focal distance, and draw a number of
lines EE perpendicular to the axis AD; then with the distances GD, GD, GD, etc,
as radii, and the center F, draw arcs crossing the parallel ordinates in E, E,
E, etc. Then draw the curve through all the points E, E, E.

PROPOSITION V.
If a Line be drawn from any Point in the Axis produced, to cut the Curve in
two Points; then shall the external Part of the Axis be a Mean Proportional
between the two Abscisses of the Ordinates to the two Points of Intersection.

That is, AI a mean proportional between AD, AG, or, AD AI AI AG.

diagram

For, by prop. 1, AD AG DE2 GH2; and, by sim. tri. ID2 IG2 DE2 GH2;* theref. by
equal. AD AG ID2 IG2; and, by division, ^ or AD ID ID ID + IG; and by division
AD AI ID IG*, and again by div. AD AI AI AG. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. * Hence we have AD AI DE GH.

COROL. 2. If the line be supposed to revolve about the point 1; then as it
recedes farther from the axis, the points E and H approach toward each other,
the point E descending, and the point H ascending, till at last they meet in
the point C when the line becomes a tangent to the curve at C. And then the
points D and G meet in the point M, and the ordinates DE, GH in the ordinate
CM. Consequently AD, AG, becoming each equal to AM, their mean proportional AI
will be equal to the absciss AM. That is, the external part of the axis, cut
off by a tangent, is equal to the absciss of the ordinate to the point of
contact.

diagram

COROL. 3. Hence the tangents to all parabolas, which have the same abscisses,
meet the axis produced in the same point. For if the absciss AM be the same in
all, the external axis AI, which is equal to it, will be the same also.

COROL. 4. And hence also a tangent is easily drawn to the curve.

For if the point of contact C be given; draw the ordinate CM, and produce MA
till AI be = AM; then join IC the tangent.

Or if the point 1 be given; take AM = AI, and draw the ordinate MC, which will
give the point of contact C, to which draw IC the tangent.

PROPOSITION VI.
If a Tangent to the Curve meet the Axis produced; then the Line drawn from the
Focus to the Point of Contact, will be equal to the Distance of the Focus from
the Intersection of the Tangent and Axis.

That is, FC = FT.

diagram

For draw the ordinate DC to the point of contact.

Then, by cor. 1 prop. 5, AT = AD; therefore FT = AF + AD. But, by prop. 4, FC
= AF + AD; therefore by equality, FC = FT. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. If CG be drawn perpendicular to the curve, or to the tangent, at C;
then shall FG = FC = FT.

For draw FH perpendicular to TC, which will also bisect TC, because FT = FC;
and therefore, by the nature of the parallels, FH also bisects TG in F. And
consequently FG = FT = FC.

So that F is the center of a circle passing through T, C, G.

COROL. 2. The subnormal DG is every where equal to the constant quantity 2FA,
or FT, or P the semi-parameter.

For draw the tangent AH parallel to DC, making the triangle FHA similar to GCD.

Then DC = 2AH, because DT = 2DA consequently DG = 2FA = P.

COROL. 3. The tangent at the vertex AH, is a mean proportional between AF and
AD.

For because FHT is a right angle, therefore AH is a mean between AF, AT, or
between AF, AD, because AD = AT. Likewise FH is a mean between FA, FT, or
between FA, FC.

COROL. 4. The tangent TC makes equal angles with FC and the axis FT, or with
the line ICK drawn parallel to the axis.

For because FT = FC, therefore the FCT = FTC = its altern. ICT. Also the angle
GCF = the angle GCK.

COROL. 5. And because the angle of incidence GCK is = the angle of reflection
GCF; therefore a ray of light falling upon the curve in the direction KC, will
be reflected to the focus F. That is, all rays parallel to the axis, are
reflected to the focus, or burning point.

PROPOSITION VII.
If an Ordinate be drawn to the Point of Contact of any Tangent, and another
Ordinate produced to cut the Tangent; It will be as the Difference of the
Ordinates Is to the Difference added to the external Part So is Double the
first Ordinate To the Sum of the Ordinates.

That is, KH KI KL KG.

diagram

For, by cor. 1 prop. 1, P DC DC DA, and P 2DC DC DT or 2DA. But, by sim.
triangles, KI KC DC DT; therefore by equality, P 2DC KI KC, or, P KI KL KC.
Again, by prop. 2, P KH KG KC; therefore by equality, KH KI KL KG. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence, by composition and division, we have KH KI GK GI, and HI HK
HK KL, also IH IK IK IG; that is, IK is a mean proportional between IG and IH.

COROL. 2. And from this last property we can easily draw a tangent to the
curve from any given point 1. Namely, draw IHG perpendicular to the axis, and
take IK a mean proportional between IH, IG; then draw KC parallel to the axis,
and C will be the point of contact, through which and the given point 1 the
tangent IC is to be drawn.

PROPOSITION VIII.
If there be any Tangent, and a Double Ordinate drawn from the Point of
Contact, and also any Line parallel to the Axis, limited by the Tangent and
Double Ordinate then shall the Curve divide that Line in the same Ratio, as the
Line divides the Double Ordinate.

That is, IE EK CK KL.

diagram

For, by sim. triangles, CK KI CD DT or 2DA; but, by the def. the param. P CL
CD 2DA; therefore by equality, P CK CL KI. But, by prop. 2, P CK KL KE;
therefore by equality, CL KL KI KE; and, by division, CK KL IE EK. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION IX.
The same being supposed as in Prop. VIII: then shall the External Part of the
Line between the Curve and Tangent, be proportional to the Square of the
intercepted Part of the Tangent, or to the Square of the intercepted Part of
the Double Ordinate.

That is, IE is as CI2 or as CK2. and IE, TA, ON, PL, etc, are as CI2, CT2,
CO2, CP2, etc, or as CK2, CD2, CM2, CL2, etc.

diagram

For, by prop. 8, IE EK CK KL, or, by equality, IE EK CK2 CK^KL. But, by cor.
prop. 2, EK is as the rect. CK^KL, and therefore IE is as CK2, or as CI2. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. As this property is common to every position of the tangent, if the
lines IE, TA, ON, etc, be appended to the points I, T, O, etc, and movable
about them, and of such lengths as that their extremities E, A, N, etc, be in
the curve of a parabola in some one position of the tangent; then making the
tangent revolve about the point C, the extremities E, A, N, etc, will always
form the curve of some parabola, in every position of the tangent.

COROL. 2. The parameter of the axis is also a third proportional to IE and CK.

For, by this prop. EK KL IE CK; and, by prop. 2, EK KL CK P; therefore by
equality, IE CK CK P.

PROPOSITION X.
The Abscisses of any Diameter, are as the Squares of their Ordinates.

That is, CQ, CR, CS, etc, are as QE2, RA2, SN2, etc. Or CQ CR QE2 RA2, etc.

diagram

For, draw the tangent CT, and the externals EI, AT, NO, etc, parallel to the
axis, or to the diameter CS.

Then, because the ordinates QE, RA, SN, etc, are parallel to the tangent CT,
by the definition of them, therefore all the figures IQ, TR, OS, etc are
parallelograms, whose opposite sides are equal, namely IE, TA, ON, etc, are
equal to CQ, CR, CS, etc. Therefore by prop. 9, CQ, CR, CS, etc, are as CI2,
CT2, CO2, etc, or as their equals QE2, RA2, SN2, etc. Q.E.D.

COROL. Here, like as in prop. 2, the difference of the abscisses, are as the
difference of the squares of their ordinates, or as the rectangles under the
sum and difference of the ordinates, the rectangle under the sum and difference
of the ordinates being equal to the rectangle under the difference of the
abscisses and the parameter of that diameter, or a third proportional to any
absciss and its ordinate.

PROPOSITION XI.
If a Line be drawn parallel to any Tangent, and cut the Curve in two Points;
then if two Ordinates be drawn to the Intersections, and a third to the Point
of Contact, these three Ordinates will be in Arithmetical Progression, or the
Sum of the Extremes will be equal to Double the Mean.

That is EG + HI = 2CD.

diagram

For draw EK parallel to the axis, and produce HI to L. Then, by sim.
triangles, EK HK TD or 2AD CD; but, by prop. 2, EK HK KL P the param. theref.
by equality, 2AD KL CD P. But, by the defin. 2AD 2CD CD P; theref. the 2d terms
are equal, KL = 2CD, that is EG + HI = 2CD. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION XII.
Any Diameter bisects all its Double Ordinates, or Lines parallel to the
Tangent at its Vertex.

That is, ME = MH.

diagram

For to the axis AI draw the ordinates EG, CD, HI, and MN parallel to them,
which is equal to CD.

Then, by prop. XI, 2MN or 2CD = EG + HI, therefore M is the middle of EH.

And for the same reason all its parallels are bisected. Q.E.D.

SCHOLIUM.
Hence as the abscisses of any diameter and their ordinates have the same
relations as those of the axis, namely, that the ordinates are bisected by the
diameter, and their squares proportional to the abscisses; so all the other
properties of the axis and its ordinates and abscisses, before demonstrated,
will likewise hold good for any diameter and its ordinates and abscisses. And
also those of the parameters, understanding the parameter of any diameter, as a
third proportional to any absciss and its ordinate. Some of the most material
of which are demonstrated in the following propositions.

PROPOSITION XIII.
The Parameter of any Diameter is equal to four Times the Line drawn from the
Focus to the Vertex of that Diameter.

That is, 4FC = p the param. of the diam. CM.

diagram

For draw the ordinate MA parallel to the tangent CT; as also CD, MN
perpendicular to the axis AN, and FH perpendicular to the tangent CT.

Then the abscisses AD, CM or AT being equal by cor. 2 to prop. 5, the
parameters will be as the squares of the ordinates CD, MA or CT, by the
definition; that is, P p CD2 CT2, But, by sim. tri. FH FT CD CT; therefore P p
FH2 FT2.

But, by cor. 3 prop. 6, FH2 = FA^FT; therefore P p FA^FT FT2, or, by equal. P
p FA FT or FC. But, by prop 3, P = 4FA, and therefore p = 4FT or 4FC. Q.E.D.

COROL. Hence the parameter p of the diameter CM is equal to 4FA + 4AD, or to P
+ 4AD, that is, the parameter of the axis added to 4AD.

PROPOSITION XIV.
If an Ordinate to any Diameter pass through the Focus, it will be equal to
Half its Parameter; and its Absciss equal to One Fourth of the same Parameter.

That is, CM = p, and ME = p.

diagram

For join FC, and draw the tangent CT. By the parallels, CM = FT; and, by prop.
6, FC = FT; also, by the last prop. FC = p; therefore CM = p. Again, by the
defin. CM or p ME ME p, and consequently ME = p = 2CM.

COROL. Hence, of any diameter, the double ordinate which passes through the
focus, is equal to the parameter, or to quadruple its absciss.

PROPOSITION XV.
If there be a Tangent, and any Line drawn from the Point of Contact and
meeting the Curve in some other Point, as also another Line parallel to the
Axis, and limited by the First Line and the Tangent then shall the Curve divide
this Second Line in the same Ration, as the Second Line divides the First Line.

That is, IE EK CK KL.

diagram

For draw LP parallel to IK or to the axis. Then, by prop. 9, IE PL CI2 CP2, or
by sim. tri. IE PL CK2 CL2. Also, by sim. tri. IK PL CK CL, or IK PL CK2 CK ^
CL; therefore by equality, IE IK CK ^ CL CL2, or IE IK CK CL; and, by division,
IE EK CK KL. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION XVI.
If a Tangent cut any Diameter produced, and if an Ordinate to that Diameter be
drawn from the Point of Contact; then the Distance in the Diameter produced,
between the Vertex and the Intersection of the Tangent, will be equal to the
Absciss of that Ordinate.

That is, IE = EK.

diagram

For, by the last prop. IE EK CK KL. But, by prop. 12, CK = KL, and therefore
IE = EK. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. The two tangents CI, LI, at the extremities of any double ordinate
CL, meet in the same point of the diameter of that double ordinate produced.
And the diameter drawn through the intersection of two tangents, bisects the
line connecting the points of contact.

COROL. 2. Hence we have another method of drawing a tangent from any given
point 1 without the curve. Namely, from 1 draw the diameter IK, in which take
EK = EI, and through K draw CL parallel to the tangent at E; then C and L are
the points to which the tangents must be drawn from 1.

PROPOSITION XVII.
If from any Point of the Curve there be drawn a Tangent, and also Two Right
Lines to cut the Curve; and Diameters be drawn through the Points of
Intersection E and L, meeting those Two Right Lines in two other Points G and
K: Then will the Line KG joining these last Two Points be parallel to the
Tangent.

diagram

For, by prop. 15, CK KL EI EK; and by comp. CK CL EI KI GH LH by parallels
But, by sim. tri. CK CL KI LH; theref. by equal. KI LH GH LH; consequently KI =
GH, and therefore KG is parallel and equal to IH. Q.E.D.

OTHERWISE.

By prop. 15, EI EK CK KL CE EG by the parallels. So that the two triangles
CEI, KEG have their angles at E equal, and the sides about those angles
proportional; they are therefore similar; consequently the angle at C is equal
to the angle at G, and KG parallel to CHAPTER Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Hence we have KI = GH.

COROL. 2. Also KI or GH is a mean proportional between EI and LH.

For, by the parallels, EI KI GH or KI LH.

PROPOSITION XVIII.
If a Line be drawn from the Vertex of any Diameter to cut the Curve in some
other Point, and an Ordinate of that Diameter be drawn to that Point, as also
another Ordinate any where cutting the Line, both produced if necessary: The
Three will be continual Proportionals, namely, the two Ordinates and the Part
of the Latter limited by the said Line drawn from the Vertex.

That is, DE, GH, GI are continual Proportionals, Or DE GH GH GI.

diagram

For, by prop. 10, DE2 GH2 AD AG; and, by sim. tri. DE GI AD AG; theref by
equality DE GI DE2 GH2, that is, of the three DE, GH, GI, 1st 3d 1st2 2d2;
therefore 1st 2d 2d 3d, that is DE GH GH GI. Q.E.D.

COROL. 1. Or their equals GK, GH, GI are proportionals; where EK is parallel
to the diameter AD.

COROL. 2. Hence we have DE AG p GI, where p is the parameter, or AG GI DE p.
For, by the defin. AG GH GH p.

COROL. 3. Hence also the three MN, MI, MO are proportionals, where MO is
parallel to the diameter, and AM parallel to the ordinates.

For, by prop. 10, MN, MI, MO, or their equals AP, AG, AD, are as the squares
of PN, GH, DE, or of their equals GI, GH, GK, which are proportionals by cor. 1.

PROPOSITION XIX.
If a Diameter cut any Parallel Lines terminated by the Curve; the Segments of
the Diameter will be as the Rectangle of the Segments of those Lines.

That is, EK EM CK^KL NM^MO.

Or, EK is as the rectangle CK^KL.

diagram

For draw the diameter PS to which the parallels CL, NO are ordinates, and the
ordinate EQ parallel to them.

Then CK is the difference, and KL the sum of the ordinates EQ, CR; also NM the
difference, and MO the sum of the ordinates EQ, NS. And the differences of the
abscisses, are QR, QS, or EK, EM.

Then by cor. prop. IO, QR QS CK^KL NM^MO, that is EK EM CK^KL NM^MO.

COROL. 1. The rect. CK^KL = rect. EK and the param. of PS.

For the rect. CK^KL = rect. QR and the param. of PS.

COROL. 2. If any line CL be cut by two diameters EK, GH; the rectangles of the
parts of the line, are as the segments of the diameters.

For EK is as the rectangle EK^KL, and GH is as the rectangle CH^HL; therefore
EK GH CK^KL CH^HL.

COROL. 3. If two parallels CL, NO be cut by two diameters EM, GI; the
rectangles of the parts of the parallels will be as the segments of the
respective diameters.

For EK EM CK^KL NM^MO, and EK GH CK^KL CH^HL, theref. by equal. EM GH NM^MO
CH^HL.

COROL. 4. When the parallels come into the position of the tangent at P, their
two extremities, or points in the curve, unite in the point of contact P; and
the rectangle of the parts becomes the square of the tangent, and the same
properties still follow them.

So that, EV PV PV p the param.

GW PW PW p, EV GW PV2 PW2, EV GH PV2 CH^HL.

PROPOSITION XX.
If two Parallels intersect any other two Parallels; the Rectangles of the
Segments will be respectively Proportional.

That is, CK^KL DK^KE GI^IH NI^IO.

diagram

For, by cor. 3 prop. 19, PK QI CK^KL GI^IH; and by the same, PK QI DK^KE
NI^IO; theref. by equal. CK^KL DK^KE GI^IH NI^IO.

COROL. When one of the pairs of intersecting lines comes into the position of
their parallel tangents meeting and limiting each other, the rectangles of
their segments become the squares of their respective tangents. So that the
constant ratio of the rectangles, is that of the square of their parallel
tangents, namely, CK^KL DK^KE sq. tang. parallel to CL sq. tang. parallel to DE.

PROPOSITION XXI.
If there be Three Tangents intersecting each other; their Segments will be in
the same Proportion.

That is, GI IH CG GD DH HE.

For through the points G, I, D, H, draw the diameters GK, IL, DM, HN; as also
the lines CI, EI, which are double ordinates to the diameters GK, HN, by cor. 1
prop. 16; therefore the diameters GK, DM, HN, bisect the lines CL, CE, LE;
hence KM = CM - CK = CE - CL = LE = LN or NE, and MN = ME - NE = CE - LE = CL =
CK or KL.

But, by parallels, GI IH KL LN, and CG GD CK KM, also DH HE MN NE.

But the 3d terms KL, CK, MN are all equal; as also the 4th terms LN, KM, NE.

Therefore the first and second terms, in all the lines, are proportional,
namely GI IH CG GD DH HE. Q.E.D.

OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY.
THE specific gravities of bodies, are their relative weights contained under
the same given magnitude; as a cubic foot, or a cubic inch, etc.

The specific gravities of several sorts of matter are expressed by the numbers
annexed to their names in the following table.

A Table of the Specific Gravities of Bodies.
Fine gold 19640 Standard gold 18888 Quicksilver 14000 Lead 11325 Fine silver
11091 Standard silver 10535 Copper 9000 Gun metal 8784 Cast brass 8000 Steel
7850 Iron 7645 Cast iron 7425 Tin 7320 Marble 2700 Common stone 2520 Loom 2160

Maple 755 Elm 600 Fir 550 Cork 240 Air at a mean state 1

Note. The several sorts of wood are supposed to be dry. Also, as a cubic foot
of water weighs just 1000 ounces avoirdupois, the numbers in this table
express, not only the specific gravities of the several bodies, but also the
weight of a cubic foot of each, in avoirdupois ounces; and thence, by
proportion, the weight of any other quantity, or the quantity of any other
weight, may be known, as in the following problems.

PROBLEM I. To find the Magnitude of any Body from its Weight.

CASE 1. When the body is heavier than water, weigh it both in water and out of
water, and take the difference, which will be the weight lost in water. Then As
the weight lost in water, Is to the whole weight, So is the specific gravity of
water, To the specific gravity of the body.


EXAMPLE.

A piece of stone weighed 10 lb, but in water only 6 lb, required its specific
gravity.

Ans. 3077.

CASE 2. When the body is lighter than water, so that it will not quite sink;
affix to it a piece of another body heavier than water, so that the mass
compounded of the two may sink together. Weigh the heavier body, and the
compound mass, separately, both in water and out of it; then find how much each
loses in water, by subtracting its weight in water from its weight in air; and
subtract the less of these remainders from the greater. Then As this last
remainder, Is to the weight of the light body in air, So is the specific
gravity of water, To the specific gravity of the body.


EXAMPLE.

Suppose a piece of elm weighs 15 lb in air, and that a piece of copper, which
weighs 18 lb in air and 16 lb in water, is affixed to it, and that the compound
weighs 8 lb in water; required the specific gravity of the elm.

Ans. 600.

PROBLEM IV. To find the Quantities of Two Ingredients in a given Compound.
Take the three differences of every pair of the three specific gravities,
namely, the specific gravities of the compound and each ingredient; and
multiply the difference of every two specific gravities by the third. Then, as
the greatest product is to the whole weight of the compound, so is each of the
other products to the two weights of the ingredients.

EXAMPLE.

A composition of 112 lb being made of tin and copper, whose specific gravity
is found to be 8784; required the quantity of each ingredient, the specific
gravity of tin being 7320, and of copper 9000.

Answer, there is 100 lb of copper and conseq. 12 lb of tin in the composition.

OF THE PILING OF BALLS AND SHELLS.
IRON balls and shells are commonly piled, by horizontal courses, either in a
pyramidical or wedge-like form; the base being either an equilateral triangle,
a square, or a rectangle. In the triangle and square, the pile will finish in a
single ball; but in the rectangle, it will finish in a single row of balls,
like an edge.

In triangular and square piles, the number of horizontal rows, or courses, is
always equal to the number of balls in one side of the bottom row. And in
rectangular piles, the number of rows is equal to the number of balls in the
breadth of the bottom row. Also in the number in the top row, or edge, is one
more than the difference between the length and breadth of the bottom row.

PROBLEM I. To find the Number of Balls in a Triangular Pile.
Multiply continually together the number in one side of the bottom row, that
number increased by 1, and the same number increased by 2; and of the last
product will be the answer.

That is, ^ is the number or sum; where n is the number in the bottom row.

Ex. 1. Required the number of balls in a triangular pile, each side of the
base containing 30 balls.

Ans. 4960.

Ex. 2. How many balls are in the triangular pile, each side of the base
containing 20?

Ans. 1540.

PROBLEM II. To find the Number of Balls in a Square Pile.
Multiply continually together the number in one side of the bottom course,
that number increased by 1, and double the same number increased by 1; then of
the last product will be the answer.

That is, ^ is the number.

EXAMPLES.

Ex. 1. How many balls are in a square pile of 30 rows?

Ans. 9455.

Ex. 2. How many balls are in a square pile of 20 rows?

Ans. 2870.

PROBLEM III. To find the Number of Balls in a Rectangular Pile.
From 3 times the number in the length of the base row, subtract one less than
the breadth of the same, multiply the remainder by the said breadth, and the
product by one more than the same; and divide by 6 for the answer.

That is, ^ is the number; where l is the length, and b the breadth of the
lowest course.

Note. In all the piles, the breadth of the bottom is equal to the number of
courses. And in the oblong or rectangular pile, the top row is one more than
the difference between the length and breadth of the bottom.

EXAMPLES.

Ex. 1. Required the number of balls in a rectangular pile, the length and
breadth of the base row being 46 and 15.

Ans. 4960.

Ex. 2. How many shot are in a rectangular complete pile, the length of the
bottom course being 59, and its breadth 20?

Ans. 11060.

PROBLEM IV. To find the Number of Balls in an Incomplete Pile.
From the number in the whole pile, considered as complete, subtract the number
in the upper pile which is wanting at the top, both computed by the rule for
their proper form; and the remainder will be the number in the frustum, or
incomplete pile.

EXAMPLES.

Ex. 1. To find the number of shot in the incomplete triangular pile, one side
of the bottom course being 40, and the top course 20.

Ans. 10150.

Ex. 2. How many shot are in the incomplete triangular pile, the side of the
base being 24, and of the top 8?

Ans. 2516.

Ex. 3. How many balls are in the incomplete square pile, the side of the base
being 24, and of the top 8?

Ans. 4760.

Ex. 4. How many shot are in the incomplete rectangular pile, of 12 courses,
the length and breadth of the base being 40 and 20?

Ans. 6146.

OF DISTANCES BY THE VELOCITY OF SOUND.
BY various experiments it has been found that sound flies, through the air,
uniformly at the rate of about 1142 feet in 1 second of time, or a mile in 4
seconds. And therefore, by proportion, any distance may be found corresponding
to any given time; namely, multiply the given time, in seconds, by 1142, for
the corresponding distance in feet; or take 3/14 of the given time for the
distance in miles.

Note. The time for the passage of sound in the interval between seeing the
flash of a gun, or lightning, and hearing the report, may be observed by a
watch, or a small pendulum. Or it may be observed by the beats of the pulse in
the wrist, counting, on an average, about 70 to a minute for persons in
moderate health, or 5 pulsations to a mile; and more or less according to
circumstances.

PRACTICAL EXERCISES CONCERNING FORCES; WITH THE RELATION BETWEEN THEM AND THE
TIME, VELOCITY, AND SPACE DESCRIBED.
BEFORE entering upon the following problems, it will be convenient here to lay
down a synopsis of the theorems which express the several relations between any
forces, and their corresponding times, velocities, and spaces described; which
are all comprehended in the following 12 theorems.

Let f, F be any two constant accelerative forces, acting on any body, during
the respective times t, T, at the end of which are generated the velocities v,
v, and described the spaces s, S. Then, because the spaces are as the times and
velocities conjointly, and the velocities as the forces and times; we shall
have,

I. In Constant Forces,
1. s/S = tv/TV = t2 f/T2F = v2F / V2 f. 2. v/V = ft/FT = sT / S t = fs/FS. 3.
t/T = F v/ fV = sV / S v = F s/ fS. 4. f/F = T v/ tV = T2 s/ t2S = v2/V2 s.
And if one of the forces, as F, be the force of gravity at the surface of the
earth, and be called 1, and its time T be = 1; then it is known by experiment
that the corresponding space S is = 16 1/12 feet, and consequently its velocity
V = 2S = 32, which call 2 g, namely g = 16 1/12 feet or 193 inches. Then the
above four theorems, in this case, become as follows:

5. s = tv/2 = gft2 = v2/4 gf. 6. v = 2 gft = 2 s/ t = 4 gfs. 7. t = v/2 gf = 2
s/ v = s/ gf. 8. f = v/2 gt = s/ gt2 = v2/4 gs.
And from these are deduced the following four theorems, for variable forces,
viz.

II. In Variable Forces,
9. s = vv/2 gf = vt. 10. v = 2 gfs/ v = 2 gft. 11. t = s/ v = v/2 gf. 12. f =
vv/2 gs = v/2 gt.
In these four theorems, the force f, though variable, is supposed to be
constant for the indefinitely small time t; and they are to be used in all
cases of variable forces, as the former ones in constant forces; namely, from
the circumstances of the problem under consideration, deduce an expression for
the value of the force f, which substitute in one of these theorems, which
shall be proper to the case in hand, and the equation thence resulting will
determine the corresponding values of the other quantities required in the
problem.

Note. That the motive force m, of a body, is equal to fq, the product of the
accelerative force, and the quantity of matter in it; and, therefore, m will be
found by substituting m/ q for f in the theorems above.

Also the momentum, or quantity of motion, is q v, the product of the velocity
and matter.

It is also to be observed, that the theorems equally hold good for the
destruction of motion and velocity, by means of retarding forces, as for the
generation of the same by means of accelerating forces.

And to the following problems, which are all resolved by the application of
these theorems, it has been thought proper to subjoin their solutions, for the
better information and convenience of the student.

The following table of the most common and useful forms of fluxions and
fluents, is inserted, as it will be found very useful for assigning the fluents
found in many of the following problems.

Note. The logarithms mentioned in the fluents, are the hyperbolic ones, and
the radius of the circle is 1.

PROBLEM I.
To determine the time and velocity of a body descending, by the force of
gravity, down an inclined plane; the length of the plane being 20 feet, and its
height 1 foot.

Here, by mechanics, 20 1 1, the force of gravity: 1/20 = f, the force on the
plane.

Theref. by theor. 6, v or 4 gfs is 4 x 16 1/12 x 1/20 x 20 = 4 x 16 1/12 = 2 x
4 1/96 = 8 1/48 feet, the last velocity per second, And, by theor. 7, t or s/
gf is ^ seconds, the time of descending.

PROBLEM II.
If a cannon ball be fired with a velocity of 1000 feet per second, in the
direction of, and up, a smooth inclined plane, that arises 1 foot in 20: it is
proposed to assign the length which it will ascend up the plane before it stops
and begins to return down again, and the time of its ascent.

Here f = 1/20 as before.

Then, by theor. 5, ^ feet, or nearly 59 miles, the distance moved.

And, by theor. 7, ^, the time of ascent.

PROBLEM III.
If a ball be projected up a smooth inclined plane, which rises 1 foot in 10,
and ascend 100 feet before it stop: required the time of ascent, and the
velocity of projection.

First, by theor. 6, v = 4 gfs = 4 x 16 1/12 x 1/10 x 20 = 8 1/48 10 = 25.36408
feet per second, the velocity.

And, by theor. 7, ^ seconds, the time in motion.

PROBLEM IV.
If a ball be observed to ascend up a smooth inclined plane, 100 feet in ten
seconds, before it stop, to return back again: required the velocity of
projection, and the angle of the plane's inclination.

First, by theor. 6, v = 2 s/ t = 200/10 = 20 feet per sec. the velocity.

And, by theor. 8, ^. That is, the length of the plane is to its height, as 193
to 12.

Therefore, 193 12 100 6.2176 the height of the plane, or the fine of elevation
to radius 100, which answers to 3 34, the angle of elevation of the plane.

PROBLEM V.
By a mean of several experiments, I have found that a cast iron ball, of 2
inches diameter, impinging perpendicularly on the face or end of a block of elm
wood, or in the direction of the fibers, with a velocity of 1500 feet per
second, penetrated 13 inches deep into its substance. It is proposed then to
determine the time of the penetration, and the resisting force of the wood as
compared to the force of gravity, supposing that force to be a constant
quantity.

First, by theor. 7, ^ part of a second, the time.

And, by th. 8, ^. That is, the resisting force of the wood, is to the force of
gravity, as 32284 to 1.

But this number will be different, according to the diameter of the ball, and
its density or specific gravity. For, since f is as v2/ s by theor. 4, the
density and size of the ball remaining the same; if the density, or specific
gravity, n, vary, and all the rest be constant, it is evident that f will be as
n; and therefore f as nv2/ s when the size of the ball only is constant. But
when only the diameter d varies, all the rest being constant, the force of the
blow will vary as d3, or as the magnitude of the ball; and the resisting
surface, or force of resistance, varies as d2; therefore f is as d3/ d2, or as
d only when all the rest are constant. Consequently f is as dnv2/ s when they
are all variable.

And so f/F = dnv2S / DNV2 s, and s/S = dnv2F / DNV2 f; where f denotes the
strength or firmness of the substance penetrated, and is here supposed to be
the same, for all balls and velocities, in the same substance, which it is
either accurately or nearly so. See pa. 264 etc. of my Tracts, vol. 1.

Hence, taking the numbers in the problem, it is ^ the value of f for elm wood.
Where the specific gravity of the ball is taken 7, which is a little less than
that of solid cast iron, as it ought, on account of the air bubble that is cast
in all balls.

PROBLEM VI.
To find how far a 24 lb ball of cast iron will penetrate into a block of sound
elm, when fired with a velocity of 1600 feet per second.

Here, because the substance is the same as in the last problem, both of the
balls and wood, N = n, and F = f; therefore S / s = DV2/ dv2, or ^ inches
nearly, the penetration required.

PROBLEM VII.
It was found by Mr. Robins (vol. 1 pa. 273) that an 18 pounder ball, fired
with a velocity of 1200 feet per second, penetrated 34 inches into sound dry
oak. It is required then to ascertain the comparative strength or firmness of
oak and elm.

The diameter of an 18 lb ball is 5.04 inches = D. Then, by the numbers given
in this problem for oak, and in prob. v for elm, we have ^ or = 7/5 nearly.

From which it would seem that elm resists more than oak, in the ratio of about
7 to 5; which is not probable, as oak is a much firmer and harder wood. But it
is to be suspected that Mr. Robins's great penetration was owing to the
splitting of his timber in some degree.

PROBLEM VIII.
A 24 pounder ball being fired into a bank of firm earth, with a velocity of
1300 feet per second, penetrated 15 feet: It is required then to ascertain the
comparative resistances of elm and earth.

Comparing the numbers here with those in prob. 5, it is ^ nearly = 6 nearly.
That is, elm resists about 6 times more than earth.

PROBLEM IX.
To determine how far a leaden bullet, of of an inch diameter, will penetrate
dry elm; supposing it fired with a velocity of 1700 feet per second, and that
the lead does not change its figure by the stroke against the wood.

Here D =, N = 11, n = 7. Then by the numbers and theorem in prob. 5, it is ^
inches nearly, the depth of penetration.

But as Mr. Robins found this penetration, by experiment, to be only 5 inches;
it follows, either that his timber must have resisted about twice as much; or
else, which is very probable, that the defect in his penetration arose from the
change of figure in the leaden ball from the blow against the wood.

PROBLEM X.
A one pound ball, projected with a velocity of 1500 feet per second, having
been found to penetrate 13 inches deep into dry elm: It is required to
ascertain the time of passing through every single inch of the 13, and the
velocity lost at each of them; supposing the resistance of the wood constant or
uniform.

The velocity v being 1500 feet, or 1500 x 12 = 9000 inches, and velocities and
times being as the roots of the spaces, in constant retarding forces, as well
as in accelerating ones, and t being ^ part of a second, the whole time of
passing through the 13 inches; therefore as

13 13 - 12 v veloc. lost Time In the ^ ^ 1st ^ ^ 2d ^ ^ 3d ^ ^ 4th ^ ^ 5th ^ ^
6th ^ ^ 7th ^ ^ 8th ^ ^ 9th ^ ^ 10th ^ ^ 11th ^ ^ 12th ^ ^ 13th Sum 1500.0 Sum
1/692 or.00144 inch

Hence, as the motion lost at the beginning is very small; and consequently the
motion communicated to any body, as an inch plank, in passing through it, is
very small also; we can conceive such a plank shot through, without oversetting
it; and may easily compute the height and breadth of such a plank as will just
stand without being overset by the ball in passing through it.

PROBLEM XI.
To determine the circumstances of space, penetration, velocity, and time,
arising from a ball moving with a given velocity, and striking a moveable block
of wood, or other substance.

diagram

Let the ball move in the direction AE passing through the center of gravity of
the block B, impinging on the point C; and when the block has moved through the
space CD, in consequence of the blow, let the ball have penetrated to the depth
DE.

Let B = the mass or matter in the block,

b = the same in the ball,

s = CD the space moved by the block,

x = DE the penetration of the ball, and theref.

s + x = CE the space described by the ball,

a = the first velocity of the ball,

v = the velocity of the ball at E,

u = veloc. of the block at the same instant,

t = the time of penetration, or of the motion,

r = the resisting force of the wood.

Then shall r/B be the accelerating force of the block, and r/ b the retarding
force of the ball.

Now because the momentum B u, communicated to the block in the time t, is that
which is lost by the ball, namely - bv, therefore B u = - bv, and B u = - bv.
But when v = a, u = a; therefore, by correcting, B u = b( a - v); or the
momentum of the block is every where equal to the momentum lost by the ball.
And when the ball has penetrated to the utmost depth, or when u = v, this
becomes B u = b( a - u), or ab = (B + b) u; that is, the momentum before the
stroke, is equal to the momentum after it. And the velocity communicated will
be the same, whatever be the resisting force of the block, the weight being the
same.

Again, by theor. 6, it is u2 = 4 grs/B, and - v2 = 4 gr/ b x ( s + x), or
rather, by correction, a2 - v2 = 4 gr/ b ( s + x). Hence the penetration or ^.
And when v = u, by substituting u for v, and B u2 for 4 grs, the greatest
penetration becomes ^; and this again, by writing ab for its value (B + b) u,
gives the greatest penetration ^. Which is barely equal to ba2/4 gr when the
block is fixed, or infinitely great; and is always very nearly equal to the
same ba2/4 gr when B is very great in respect of b. Hence ^.

And therefore B + b B + 2 b x s + x, or B + b b x s, and ^.

Ex. When the ball is iron, and weighs 1 pound, it penetrates elm about 13
inches when it moves with a velocity of 1500 feet per second, in which case, ^
nearly.

When B = 500lb, and b = 1; then ^ feet nearly per second, the velocity of the
block.

Also s = ^ part of a foot, or 2/77 of an inch, which is the space moved by the
block when the ball has completed its penetration.

And t = ^ part of a second, or ^ part of a second, the time of penetration.

For the circumstances relating to the motion of a block, hung by, and
vibrating on, an axis, when struck by a ball, see my Tracts, pa. 116, etc.

PROBLEM XII.
The force of attraction, above the earth, being inversely as the square of the
distance from the center; it is proposed to determine the time, velocity, and
other circumstances, attending a heavy body falling from any given height; the
descent at the earth's surface being 16 1/12 feet, or 193 inches, in the first
second of time.

Put r = CS the radius of the earth, a = CA the did. fallen from, x = CP any
variable distance, v = the velocity at P, t = time of falling there, and g = 16
1/12, half the veloc. or force at A, f = the force at the point P.


diagram

Then we have the three following equations, x2 r2 2 g f = 2 gr2/ x2 the force
at P, or the velocity per second that would be generated by the force there, tv
= - x, and vv = - fx = - 2 gr2 x/ x2.

The fluents of the last equation give v2 = 4 gr2/ x. But when x = a, the
velocity v = 0; therefore, by correction, ^; or ^, a general expression for the
velocity at any point P.

When x = r, this gives ^ for the greatest velocity, or the velocity when the
body strikes the earth.

When a is very great in respect of r, the last velocity becomes (1 - r/2 a)
very nearly, or nearly 4 gr only, which is accurately the greatest velocity by
falling from an infinite height. And this, when r = 3965 miles, is 6.9506 miles
per second. Also the velocity acquired in falling from the distance of the sun,
or 12000 diameters of the earth, is 6.9505 miles per second. And the velocity
acquired in falling from the distance of the moon, or 30 diameters, is 6.8924
miles per second.

Again, to find the time, since tv = - x, therefore ^; the correct fluent of
which gives ^ arc to diameter a and verse. a - x); or the time of falling to any
point P = 1/2 r a/ g x (AB + BP). And when x = r, this becomes ^ for the whole
time of falling to the surface at s; which is evidently infinite when a or AC
is infinite, although the velocity is then only the finite quantity 4 gr.

When the height above the earth's surface is given = g; because r is then
nearly = a, and AD nearly = DS, the time t for the distance g will be nearly
r/4 gr2 x 2DS = 1/4 gr x 4 gr = 1n, as it ought to be.

If a body at the distance of the moon at A fall to the earth's surface at s.
Then r = 3965 miles, a = 60 r, and t = 416806 = 4da. 19h. 46 46, the time of
falling from the moon to the earth.

When the attracting body is considered as a point C; the whole time of
descending to C will be 1/2 r a/ g x ABDC =.7854 a/ r a/ g.

PROBLEM XIII.
The force of attraction below the earth's surface being directly as the
distance from the center; it is proposed to determine the circumstances of
velocity, time, and space fallen by a heavy body from the surface, through a
perforation made straight to the center of the earth; abstracting from the
effect of the earth's rotation, and supposing it to be a homogeneous sphere of
3965 miles radius.

Put r = AC the radius of the earth, x = CP the distance fallen, v = the
velocity at P, t = the time there, g = 16 1/12, half the force at A, f = the
force at P.


Then CA CP 2 g f; and the three equations are rf = 2 gx, and vv = - fx and tv
= - x. Hence f = 2 gx/r, and vv = - gxx/ r; the correct fluent of which gives ^
the velocity at the point P; where PD and CE are perpendicular to CA. So that
the velocity at any point P, is as the perpendicular PD at that point.

diagram

When the body arrives at C, then ^ feet or 4.9148 miles per second, which is
the greatest velocity, or that at the center C.

Again, for the time, ^, and the fluents give t = r/2 g x arc to cosine x/ r =
1/2 gr x arc AD. So that the time of descent to any point P, is as the
corresponding arc AD.

When P arrives at C, the above becomes t = 1/2 gr x quadrant AE = AE / AC r/2
g = 1.5708 r/2 g = 1267 seconds = 21 7, for the time of falling to the center C.

The time of falling to the center is the same quantity 1.5708 r/2 g, from
whatever point in the radius AC the body begins to move. For let n be any given
distance from C at which the motion commences: then, by correction, ^; and
hence ^, the fluents of which give t = r/2 g x arc to cosine x/ n; which, when
x = 0, gives t = r/2 g x quadrant = 1.5708 r/2 g for the time of descent to the
center C.

As an equal force, acting in contrary directions, generates or destroys an
equal quantity of motion, in the same time; it follows that, after passing the
center, the body will just ascend to the opposite surface at B, in the same
time in which it fell to the center from A; then from B it will return again in
the same manner, through C to A; and so vibrate continually between A and B,
the velocity being always equal at equal distances from C on both sides; and
the whole time of a double oscillation, or of passing from A and arriving at A
again, will be quadruple the time of passing over the radius AC, or = 2 x
3.1416 r/2 g = 1h 24 29.

PROBLEM XIV.
To find the Time of a Pendulum vibrating in the Arc of a Cycloid.

diagram

Let S be the point of suspension, SA = the arc SB or SC the length of the
pendulum, CA = AB = SB or SC the semi-cycloid, AD = DS the diameter of its
generating circle, to which FKE, HIG are perpendiculars.


To any point G draw the tangent GP, also draw GQ parallel and PQ perpendicular
to AD. Then PG is parallel to the chord AI by the nature of the curve. And, by
the nature of forces, the force of gravity force in direct. GP GP GQ AI AH AD
AI; in like manner, the force of grav. force in curve at E AD AK; that is, the
accelerative force in the curve, is as the corresponding chord AI or AK of the
circle, or as the arc AG or AE of the cycloid, since AG is always = 2AI. So
that the process and conclusions for the velocity and time of describing any
arc in this case, will be the same as in the last problem.

From whence it follows that the time of a semi-vibration, in all arcs, AG, AE,
etc, is the same constant quantity 1.5708 r/2 g = 1.5708 A / 2 g = 1.5708 l/2
g, and the time of a whole vibration from B to C, or from C to B, is 3.1416 l/2
g, where l = AS = AB is the length of the pendulum, g = 16 1/12 feet or 193
inches, and 3.1416 the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 1.

Since the time of a body's falling by gravity through l, or half the length of
the pendulum, is l/2 g, which being in proportion to 3.1416 l/2 g, as 1 to
3.1416; therefore the diameter of a circle is to its circumference, as the time
of falling through half the length of a pendulum, to the time of one vibration.

If the time of the whole vibration be 1 second, this equation arises, 1 =
3.1416 l/2 g, and hence l = 2 g/3.14162 = g/4.9348, and g = 3.14162 x l =
4.9348 l. So that if one of these, g or l, be given by experiment, these
equations will give the other. When g, for instance, is supposed to be 16 1/12
feet, or 193 inches, then is l = g/4.9348 = 39.11 the length of a pendulum to
vibrate seconds. Or if l = 39, the length of the seconds pendulum for the
latitude of London, then is g = 4.9348 l = 193.07 inches = 16 107/1200 feet, or
nearly 16 1/12 feet, for the space descended by gravity in the first second of
time in the latitude of London.

Hence the times of vibration of pendulums, are as the square roots of their
lengths; and the number of vibrations made in a given time, reciprocally as the
square roots of the lengths. And hence the length of a pendulum vibrating n
times in a minute, or 60, is l = 39 1/8 x 602/ n2 = 140850/ nn.

When a pendulum vibrates in a circular arc, as the length of the string is
constantly the same, the time of vibration will be longer than in a cycloid;
but the two times will approach nearer together as the circular arc is smaller;
so that when it is very small, the times of vibration will be nearly equal. And
hence 39 inches is the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in the very small
arc of a circle.

PROBLEM XV.
To find the Velocity and Time of a Heavy Body descending down the Arc of a
Circle, or vibrating in the Arc by a Line fixed in the Center.

Let D be the beginning of the descent, C the center, and A the lowest point of
the circle; draw DE and PQ perpendicular to AC. Then the velocity in P being
the same as in Q by falling through EQ, it will be ^, when a = AE, x = AQ, and
g = 16 1/12.

diagram

But the fluxion of the time t is = -AP / v, and ^, where r = the radius AC.
Therefore ^, where d = 2 r the diameter. Or ^ etc).

But the fluent of ^ is 2/ a x arc to rad. a and verse. x, or it is the arc
whose rad. is 1 and verse. 2 x/ a: which call A. And let the fluents of the
succeeding terms, without the coefficients, be B, C, D, E, etc. Then will the
fluxion of any one, as Q, at n distance from A, be Q = xnA = xP which suppose
also = the fluxion of ^.

Hence, by equating the coefficients of the like terms, ^; and ^. Which being
substituted, the fluential terms become ^.

But when x = a, those terms become barely ^; which being subtracted, and x
taken = 0, there arises for the whole time of descending down DA, or the
corrected value of ^.

When the arc is small, as in the vibration of the pendulum of a clock, all the
terms of the series may be omitted after the second, and then the time of a
vibration t is nearly = 1.5708 r/2 g x (1 + a/8 r). And therefore the times of
vibration of a pendulum, in different arcs, are as 8 r + a, or 8 times the
radius added to the versed sine of the arc.

If D be the degrees of the pendulum's vibration, on each side of the lowest
point of the small arc, the radius being r, the diameter d, and 3.1416 = p;
then is the length of that arc A = prD / 180. But the versed sine in terms of
the arc is a = A2/2 r - A4/24 r3 + etc = A2/ d - A4/3 d3 + etc. Therefore a/ d
= A2/ d2 - A4/3 d4 + etc = p2D2/3602 - p4D4/3604 + etc, or only = p2D2/3602 the
first term, by rejecting all the rest of the terms on account of their
smallness, or a/ d = a/2 r nearly = D2/12787. This value then being substituted
for a/ d or a/2 r in the last near value of the time, it becomes t = 1.5708 r/2
g x (1 + D2/51150) nearly. And therefore the times of vibration in different
small arcs, are as 51150 + D2, or as 51150 added to the square of the number of
degrees in the arc.

Hence it follows that the time lost in each second, by vibrating in a circle,
instead of the cycloid, is D2/51150; and consequently the time lost in a whole
day of 24 hours, or 24 x 60 x 60 seconds, is 5/3 D2 nearly. In like manner, the
seconds lost per day by vibrating in the arc of degrees, is 5/3 2. Therefore,
if the pendulum keep true time in one of these arcs, the seconds lost or gained
per day, by vibrating in the other, will be 5/3 (D2 - 2). So, for example, if a
pendulum measure true time in an arc of 3 degrees, it will lose 11 seconds a
day by vibrating 4 degrees; and 26 seconds a day by vibrating 5 degrees; and so
on.

And in like manner, we might proceed for any other curve, as the ellipse,
hyperbola, parabola, etc.

PROBLEM XVI.
To determine the Time of a Body descending down the Chord of a Circle.

Let C be the center, AB the vertical diameter, AP any chord down which a body
is to descend from P to A, and PQ perpendicular to AB. Now as the natural force
of gravity in the vertical direction BA, is to the force urging the body down
the plane PA, as the length of the plane AP, is to its height AQ; therefore the
velocity in PA and QA, will be equal at all equal perpendicular distances below
PQ; and consequently the time in PA time in QA PA QA BA PA; but time in BA time
in QA BA QA BA PA; hence, as three of the terms in each proportion are the
same, the fourth terms must be equal, namely the time in BA = the time PA.

diagram

And in like manner the time in BP = the time in BA. So that, in general, the
times of descending down all the chords BA, BP, BR, BS, etc, or PA, RA, SA,
etc, are all equal, and each equal to the time of falling freely through the
diameter. Which time is 2 r/ g where g = 16 1/12 feet, and r = the radius AC;
for g 2 r 1 2 r/ g.

SCHOLIUM. By comparing this with the results of the two preceding problems, it
will appear that the times in the cycloid, and in the arc of a circle, and in
any chord of the circle, are respectively as the three quantities 1, 1 + a/8 r
etc, and 1/.7854 or nearly as the three quantities 1, 1 + a/8 r, 1.27324; the
first and last being constant, but the middle one, or the time in the circle,
varying with the extent of the arc of vibration. Also the time in the cycloid
is the least, but in the chord the greatest; for the greatest value of the
series, in prob. 15, when a = r, or the arc AD is a quadrant, is 1.18014; and
in that case the proportion of the three times is as the numbers 1, 1.18014,
1.27324. Moreover the time in the circle approaches to that in the cycloid, as
the arc decreases, and they are very nearly equal when that arc is very small.

PROBLEM XVII.
To find the Time and Velocity of a Chain, consisting of very small links,
descending from a smooth horizontal plane; the Chain being 100 inches long, and
1 Inch of it hanging off the Plane at the Commencement of Motion.

Put a = 1 inch, the length at the beginning; l = 100 the whole length of the
chain; x = any variable length off the plane.


Then x is the motive force to move the body, and x/ l = f the accelerative
force.

Hence vv = 2 gfs = 2 g x x/ l x x = 2 gxx/ l.

The fluents give v2 = 2 gx2/ l. But v = O when x = a, therefore, by
correction, ^, and ^ the velocity for any length x. And when the chain just
quits the plain, x = l, and then the greatest velocity is ^ inches, or
16.371585 feet, per second.

Again t or ^; the correct fluent of which is ^, the time for any length x. And
when x = l = 100, it is ^ seconds, the time when the last of the chain just
quits the plane.

PROBLEM XVIII.
To find the Time and Velocity of a Chain, of very small Links, quitting a
Pulley, by passing freely over it: the whole Length being 200 Inches, and the
one End hanging 2 Inches below the other at the Beginning.

Put a = 2, l = 200, and x = BD any variable difference of the two parts AB, AC.

Then x/ l = f, and vv or 2 gfs = 2 g ^ x/ l ^ x = gxx/ l.

Hence the correct fluent is ^, and ^, the general expression of the velocity.
And when x = l, or C arrives at A, it is ^ inches, or 16.371585 feet, for the
greatest velocity when the chain just quits the pulley.

diagram

Again, t or ^. And the correct fluent is ^, the general expression for the
time. And when x = l, it becomes ^ seconds, the whole time when the chain just
quits the pulley.

So that the velocity and time at quitting the pulley in this prob. and the
plane in the last prob. are the same; the distance descended 99 being the same
in both. For, although the weight l moved in this latter case, be double of
what it was in the former, the moving force x is also double, because here the
one end of the chain shortens as much as the other end lengthens, so that the
space descended x is doubled, and becomes x; and hence the accelerative force
x/ l or f is the same in both; and of course the velocity and time the same for
the same distance descended.

PROBLEM XIX.
To find the Number of Vibrations made by two Weights, connected by a very fine
Thread, passing freely over a Tack or a Pulley, while the less Weight is drawn
up to it by the Descent of the heavier Weight at the other End.

Suppose the motion to commence at equal distances below the pulley at B; and
that the weights are 1 and 2 pounds.

Put a = AB, half the length of the thread; b = 39 inc. or 3 25/96 feet, the
second's pend. x = B w = BW, any space passed over; z = the number of
vibrations:


diagram

Then ^ is the accelerating force. And hence v or 4 gfs = 4 gfx, and t or x/ v
= x/4 gfx. But, by the nature of pendulums, ^ the vibrations per second made by
either weight, namely, the longer or shorter, according as the upper or under
sign is used, if the threads were to continue of that length for 1 second.
Hence, then, as ^, the fluxion of the number of vibrations.

Now when the upper sign + takes place, the fluent is ^. And when x = a, the
same then becomes z = b/ gf x log. 1 + 2 = 3 b/ g x log. 1 + 2 = 117 / 193 x
log. 1 + 2 =.688511, the whole number of vibrations made by the descending
weight.

But when the lower sign, or -, takes place, the fluent is b/4 gf x arc to rad.
1 and verse. 2 x/ a. Which, when x = a, gives ^, the whole number of vibrations
made by the lesser or ascending weight.

SCHOL. It is evident that the whole number of vibrations, in each case, is the
same, whatever the length of the thread is. And that the greater number is to
the less, as 1.5708 to hyp. log. 1 + 2.

Farther, the number of vibrations performed in the same time t, by an
invariable pendulum, constantly of the same length a, is b/ gf =.781190. For
the time of descending the space a, or the fluent of t = x/4 gfx, when x = a,
is t = a/ gf. And, by the nature of pendulums, a b 1 vibr. ^ the number of
vibrations performed in 1 second; hence 1 t b/ a t b/ a = b/ gf, the constant
number of vibrations.

So that the three numbers of vibrations, namely, of the ascending, constant,
and descending pendulums, are proportional to the numbers 1.5708, 1, and hyp.
log. 1 + 2, or as 1.5708, 1, and.88137; whatever be the length of the thread.

PROBLEM XX.
To determine the Circumstances of the Ascent and Descent of two unequal
Weights, suspended at the two Ends of a Thread passing over a Pulley: the
Weight of the Thread and of the Pulley being considered in the Solution. Let l
= the whole length of the thread; a = the weight of the same; b = A w the dif.
of lengths at first; d = w - w the dif. of the two weights; c = a with. applied
to the circumference, such as to be equal to its whole with. and friction reduced
to the circumference; s = w + w + a + c the sum of the weights moved.


diagram

Then the weight of b is ab/ l, and d - ab/ l is the moving force at first. But
if x denote any variable space descended by w, or ascended by w, the difference
of the lengths of the thread will be altered 2 x; so that the difference will
then be b - 2 x, and its weight ^; consequently the motive force there will be
^, and theref. ^ the accelerating force there. Hence then ^; the fluents of
which give ^, or ^ the general expression for the velocity, putting ^. And when
x = b, or w becomes as far below w as it was above it at the beginning, it is
barely v = 2 bdg/ s for the velocity at that time. Also, when a, the weight of
the thread, is nothing, the velocity is only 2 dgx/ s, as it ought.

Again, for the time, t or ^; the fluents of which give ^ the general
expression for the time of descending any space x.

And if the radicals be expanded in a series, and the log. of it be taken, the
same time will become ^. Which, therefore, becomes barely sx/ dg when a, the
weight of the thread, is nothing; as it ought.

PROBLEM XXI.
To find the Velocity and Time of Vibration of a small Weight, fixed to the
middle of a Line, or fine Thread void of Gravity, and stretched by a given
Tension; the Extent of the Vibration being very small.

diagram

Let l = AC half the length of the thread; a = CD the extent of the vibration;
x = CE any variable distance from C; w = with. of the small body fixed to the
middle; w = a with. which, hung at each end of the thread, will be equal to the
constant tension at each end, acting in the direction of the thread.


Now, by the nature of forces, AE CE W the force in direction EA the force in
direction EC. Or, because AC is nearly = AE, the vibration being very small,
taking AC instead of AE, it is AC CE W W x/ l the force in EC arising from the
tension in EA. Which will be also the same for that in EB. Therefore the sum is
2W x/ l = the whole motive force in EC arising from the tensions on both sides.
Consequently 2W x/ lw = f the accelerative force there. Hence the equation of
the fluxions is vv or 2 gfs = -4 gw xx/ lw; and the fluents v2 = - 4 gW x2/ lw.
But when x = a, this is - 4 gW a2/ lw, and should be = O; therefore the correct
fluents are ^, and ^ the velocity of the little body w at any point E. And when
x = O, it is v = 2 a gW / lw for the greatest velocity at the point c.

Now if we suppose w = 1 grain, W = 5 lb troy, or 28800 grains, and 2 l = AB =
3 feet; the velocity C becomes ^. So that if a = 1/10 inc. the greatest veloc.
is 9ft. per sec. if a = 1 inc. the greatest veloc. is 92 37/60 ft. per sec. if
a = 6 inc. the greatest veloc. is 555 7/10 ft. per sec.
To find the time t, it is t or ^. Hence the correct fluent is t = wl/W g x arc
to cosine x/ a and radius 1, the time in DE. And when x = O, the whole time in
DC, or of half a vibration, is.7854 wl/W g; and consequently the time of a
whole vibration through D d is 1.5708 wl/W g.

Using the foregoing numbers, namely w = 1, W = 28800, and 2 l = 3 feet; this
expression for the time is ^, the number of vibrations per second. But if w =
2, there would be 250 vibrations per second; and if w = 100, there would be 35
16/45 vibrations per second.

PROBLEM XXII.
To determine the same as in the last Problem, when the Distance CD bears some
sensible Proportion to the Length AB; the Tension of the Thread however being
still supposed a Constant Quantity.

diagram

Using here the same notation as in the last problem, and taking the true
variable length AE for AC, it is AE or ^ the whole motive force from the two
equal tensions w in AE and EB; and therefore ^ is the accelerative force at E.
Therefore the fluxional equation is vv or ^; and the fluents ^. But when x = a,
these are ^; therefore the correct fluents are ^. And hence ^ the general
expression for the velocity at E. And when E arrives at C, it gives the
greatest velocity there ^. Which, when w = 28800, w = 1, 2 l = 3 feet, and CD =
6 inches or a foot, is ^ feet per second. Which came out 555 7/10 in the last
problem, by using always AC for AE in the value of f. But when the extent of
the vibrations is very small, as 1/10 of an inch, as it commonly is, this
greatest velocity here will be 8 x 28800 x 16 1/12 x 1/43200 = 9 nearly, which
in the last problem was 9.

To find the time, it is ^, making ^. To find the fluent the easier, multiply
the numerator and denominator both by ^, so shall ^. Expand now the quantity ^
in a series, and put d = c + l, so shall ^ Now the fluent of the first term ^
is = the arc to sine x/ a and radius 1, which arc call A; and let P, Q be the
fluents of any other two successive terms, without the coefficients, the
distance of Q from the first term A being n; then it is evident that Q = x2P =
x2n A, and P = x2n^-2A. Assume therefore ^; then is Q or ^. Then, comparing the
coefficients of the like terms, we find 1 = 2 en, and b = (2 n - 1) ea2; from
which are obtained e = 1/2 n, and b = 2 n - 1/2 n a2. Consequently ^, the
general equation between any two successive terms, and by means of which the
series may be continued as far as we please. And hence, neglecting the
coefficients, putting A = the first term, namely the arc whose sine is x/ a,
and B, C, D, etc, the following terms, the series is as follows, ^. Now when x
= o, this series = 0; and when x = a, the series becomes p + a2A / 2 + 3 a2B /
4 + 5 a2c / 6 etc, where p = 3.1416, or the series is ^

So that, by taking in the coefficients, the general time of passing over any
distance DE will be ^ etc.

And hence, taking x = 0, and doubling, the time of a whole vibration, or
double the time of passing over CD will be equal to ^ Which, when a = 0, or c =
l, becomes only p wl/W g, the same as in the last problem, as it ought.

Taking here the same numbers as in the last problem, viz. l = 3/2, a =, w = 2,
w = 28800, g = 16 1/12; then ^, and the series is 1 +.006762 -.000175 +.000003
etc = 1.006590; therefore.0040514 x 1.006590 =.0040965 = 1/245 is the time of
one whole vibration, and consequently 245 vibrations are performed in a second:
which were 250 in the last problem.

PROBLEM XXIII.
It is proposed to determine the Velocity, and the Time of Vibration, of a
Fluid in the Arms of a Canal or bent Tube.

Let the tube ABCDEF have its two branches AC, GE vertical, and the lower part
CDE in any position whatever, the whole being of a uniform diameter or width
throughout. Let water, or quicksilver, or any other fluid, be poured in, till
it stand in equilibrio, at any horizontal line BF. Then let one surface be
pressed or pushed down by shaking, from B to C, and the other will ascend
through the equal space FG; after which let them be permitted freely to return.
The surfaces will then continually vibrate in equal times between AC and EG.
The velocity and times of which oscillations are therefore required.

diagram

When the surfaces are any where out of a horizontal line, as at P and Q, the
parts of the fluid in QDR, on each side, below QR, will balance each other; and
the weight of the part in PR, which is equal to 2PF, gives motion to the whole
So that the weight of the part 2PF is the motive force by which the whole fluid
is urged, and therefore with of 2PF / whole with. is the accelerative force. Which
weights being proportional to their lengths, if l be the length of the whole
fluid, or axis of the tube filled, and a = FG or BC; then is a/ l the
accelerative force. Putting therefore x = GP any variable distance, v the
velocity, and t the time; then PF = a - x, and ^ the accelerative force; hence
vv or 2 gfs = 4 g/ l ( ax - xx); the fluents of which give v2 = 4 g/ l (2 ax -
x2), and ^ is the general expression for the velocity at any term. And when x =
a, it becomes v = 2 a g/ l for the greatest velocity at B and F.

Again, for the time, we have t or ^; the fluents of which give t = l/ g x arc
to versed sine x / a and radius 1, the general expression for the time. And
when x = a, it becomes t = p l/ g for the time of moving from G to F, p being =
3.1416; and consequently p l/ g the time of a whole vibration from G to E, or
from C to A. And which therefore is the same, whatever AB is, the whole length
l remaining the same.

And the time of vibration is also equal to the time of the vibration of a
pendulum whose length is l, or half the length of the axis of the fluid. So
that if the length l be 78 inches, it will oscillate in 1 second.

SCHOL. This reciprocation of the water in the canal, is nearly similar to the
motion of the waves of the sea. For the time of vibration is the same, however
short the branches are, provided the whole length be the same. So that when the
height is small, in proportion to the length of the canal, the motion is
similar to that of a wave, from the top to the bottom or hollow, and from the
bottom to the top of the next wave; being equal to two vibrations of the canal;
the whole length of a wave, from top to top, being double the length of the
canal. Hence the wave will move forward by a space nearly equal to its breadth,
in the time of two vibrations of a pendulum whose length is ( l) half the
length of the canal, or one fourth of the breadth of a wave, or in the time of
one vibration of a pendulum whose length is the whole breadth of the wave,
since the times of vibration are as the square roots of their lengths.
Consequently, waves whose breadth is equal to 39 inches, or 3 25/96 feet, will
move over 3 2/9 feet in a second, or 195 feet in a minute, or nearly 2 miles
and a quarter in an hour. And the velocity of greater or less waves will be
increased or diminished in the subduplicate ratio of their breadths.

PROBLEM XXIV.
To determine the Time of filling the Ditches of a Work with Water at the Top,
by a Sluice of 2 Feet square; the Head of Water above the Sluice being 10 Feet,
and the Dimensions of the Ditch being 20 Feet wide at Bottom, 22 at Top, 9
deep, and 1000 Feet long.

The capacity of the ditch is 189000 cubic feet.

But g 10 2 g 210 g the velocity of the water through the sluice, the area of
which is 4 square feet; therefore 810 g is the quantity per second running
through it; and consequently 810 g 189000 1 23625/10 g = 1863 or 31 3 nearly is
the time filling the ditch.

PROBLEM XXV.
To determine the Time of emptying a Vessel of Water by a Sluice in the Bottom
of it, or in the Side near the Bottom, the Height of the Aperture being very
small in respect of the Altitude of the Fluid.

Put a = the area of the aperture or sluice; 2 g = 32 feet, the force of
gravity; d = the whole depth of water; x = the variable alt. of the surface
above the aperture; A = the area of the surface of the water.


Then g x 2 g 2 gx the velocity with which the fluid will issue at the sluice;
and hence A a 2 gx 2 a gx/A the velocity with which the surface of the water
will descend at the altitude x, or the space it would descend in 1 second with
the velocity there. Now in descending the space x, the velocity may be
considered as uniform; and uniform descents are as their times; therefore 2 a
gx/A x 1 A x/2 a gx the time of descending x space, or the fluxion of the time
of exhausting. That is, t = -A x/2 a gx.

Then when the nature or figure of the vessel is given, there will be given A
in terms of x; which value of A being substituted into this fluxion of the
time, the fluent of the result will be the time of exhausting sought.

So if, for example, the vessel be any prism, or every where of the same
breadth; then A is a constant quantity, and therefore the fluent is - A / a x/
g. But when x = d, this becomes - A / a d/ g, and should be o; therefore the
correct fluent is ^ for the time of the surface descending till the depth of
the water be x. And when x = o, the whole time of exhausting is barely A / a d/
g.

And hence if A be 10000 square feet, a = 1 square foot, and d = 10 feet; the
time is 7885 seconds, or 2b 11 25.

Again, if the vessel be a ditch, or canal, of 20 feet broad at the bottom, 22
at the top, 9 deep, and 1000 feet long; then is ^ the breadth of the surface of
the water when its depth in the canal is x; and consequently ^ is the surface
at that time. Consequently t or ^ is the fluxion of the time; the correct
fluent of which, when x = o, is ^ nearly, or 4h 17 39 2/^, the whole time of
exhausting by a sluice of 1 foot square.

PROBLEM XXVI.
To determine the Time of emptying any Ditch, or Inundation, etc, by a Cut or
Notch, from the Top to the Bottom of it.

Let AB = x the variable height of water at any time; AC = b the breadth of the
cut; d = the whole or first depth of water; A = the area of the surface of the
water in the ditch; g = 16 1/12 feet.


diagram

The velocity at any point D, is as BD, that is, as the ordinate DE of a
parabola BEC, whose base is AC, and altitude AB. Therefore the velocities at
all the points in AB, are as all the ordinates of the parabola. Consequently
the quantity of water running through the cut ABGC, in any time, is to the
quantity which would run through an equal aperture placed all at the bottom in
the same time, as the area of the parabola ABC, to the area of the
paralellogram ABGC, that is as 2 to 3.

But g x 2 g 2 gx the velocity at AC; therefore x 2 gx x bx = 4/3 bx gx is the
quantity discharged per second through ABGC; and consequently 4 bx gx/3A is the
velocity per second of the descending surface. Hence then 4 bx gx/3A - x 1 -3A
x/4 bx gx = t, the fluxion of the time of descending.

Now when A the surface of the water is constant, or the ditch is equally broad
throughout, the correct fluent of this fluxion gives ^ for the general time of
sinking the surface to any depth x. And when x = 0, this expression is
infinite; which shows that the time of a complete exhaustion is infinite.

But if d = 9 feet, b = 2 feet, A = 21 x 1000 = 21000, and it be required to
exhaust the water down to 1/10 of a foot deep; then x = 1/10, and the above
expression becomes ^, or just 4 hours for that time. And if it be required to
depress it 8 feet, or till 1 foot depth of water remain in the ditch, the time
of sinking the water to that point will be 43 38.

Again, if the ditch be the same depth and length as before, but 20 feet broad
at bottom, and 22 at top; then the descending surface will be a variable
quantity, and, by prob. 25, it will be ^; hence in this case the fluxion of the
time, or -3A x/4 bx gx, becomes ^; the correct fluent of which is ^ for the
time of sinking the water to any depth x.

Now when x = 0, this expression for the complete exhaustion becomes infinite.

But if x = 1 foot, the time t is 42 56.

And when x = 1/10 foot, the time is 3h 50 28.

PROBLEM XXVII.
To determine the Time of filling the Ditches of a Fortification 6 Feet deep
with Water, through the Sluice of a Trunk of 3 Feet square, the Bottom of which
is level with the Bottom of the Ditch, and the Height of the supplying Water is
9 Feet above the Bottom of the Ditch.

Let ACDB represent the area of the vertical sluice, being a square of 9 square
feet, and AB level with the bottom of the ditch. And suppose the ditch filled
to any height AE, the surface being then at OF.

diagram

Put a = 9 the height of the head or supply; b = 3 = AB = AC; g = 16 1/12; A =
the area of a horizontal section of the ditches; x = a - AE, the height of the
head above OF.


Then g x 2 g 2 gx the velocity with which the water presses through the part
AEFB; and therefore 2 gx x AEFB = 2 b gx ( a - x) is the quantity per second
running through AEFB. Also, by the last problem, the quantity running per
second through ECDF is 2 gx x ECDF = 4/3 b gx ( b - a + x). Consequently the
sum of the two, or b gx ( a + 2 b - x) is the quantity per second running in by
the whole sluice ACDB. Hence then ^ is the rate or velocity per second with
which the water rises in the ditches; and so ^ the fluxion of the time of
filling to any height AE, putting c = a + 2 b.

Now when the ditches are of equal width throughout, A is a constant quantity,
and in that case the correct fluent of this fluxion is ^ the general expression
for the time of filling to any height AE, or a - x, not exceeding the height AC
of the sluice. And when x = AC = a - b = d suppose, then ^ is the time of
filling to CD the top of the sluice.

Again, for filling to any height GH above the sluice, x denoting as before a -
AG the height of the head above GH, 2 gx will be the velocity of the water
through the whole sluice AD; and therefore 2 b2 gx the quantity per second, and
2 b2 gx/A = v the rise per second of the water in the ditches; consequently v -
x 1 t = - x/ v = -A / 2 b2 g x x/ x the general fluxion of the time; the
correct fluent of which, being o when x = a - b = d, is t = A / b2 g ( d - x)
the time of filling from CD to GH.

Then the sum of the two times, namely, that of filling from AB to CD, and that
of filling from CD to GH, is ^ for the whole time required. And, using the
numbers in the problem, this becomes ^, A, the time in terms of A the area of
the length and breadth, or horizontal section of the ditches. And if we suppose
that area to be 200000 square feet, the time required will be 7661, or 2h 7 41.

And if the sides of the ditch slope a little, so as to be a little narrower at
the bottom than at top, the process will be nearly the same, substituting for A
its variable value, as in prob. 25 and 26. And the time of filling will be very
nearly the same as that above determined.

PROBLEM XXVIII.
But if the Water from which the Ditches are to be filled, is the Tide, which
at Low Water is below the Bottom of the Trunk, and rises to 9 Feet above the
Bottom of it by a regular Rise of One Foot in Half an Hour; It is required to
ascertain the Time of Filling it to 6 Feet high as before in the last Problem.

Let ACDB represent the sluice; and when the tide has risen to any height GH,
below CD the top of the sluice, without the ditches, let OF be the mean height
of the water within. And

diagram

Put b = 3 = AB = AC; g = 16 1/12; A = horizontal section of the ditches; x =
AG; z = AE.


Then ^ the veloc. of the water through AEFB; and ^ the mean veloc. through EGHF;
theref. ^ is the quantity per second through AEFB; and ^ is the same through
EGHF; conseq. ^ is the whole through AGHB per sec. This quantity divided by the
surface A, gives ^ the velocity per second with which OF, or the surface of the
water in the ditches, rises.

Theref. ^.

But, as GH rises uniformly 1 foot in 30 or 1800, theref. 1 AG 1800 1800 x = t
the time the tide is in rising through AG; conseq. ^, or ^ is the fluxional
equation expressing the relation between x and z; when m = A / 1200 b g =
3200/231 or 13 ^^^/^^^ when A = 200000 square feet.

Now to find the fluent of this equation, assume z = A x5^/^ + B x8^/2 + C
x11^/2 + D x14^/2 etc. So shall ^ etc, 2 x + z = 2 x + A x5^/2 + B x8^/2 + C
x11^/2 etc, ^ etc, and mz = ^/^ mA x3^/2 x + 8/2 mB x^^/2 x + 11/^ mC x^^/^ ^ +
14/2 mD x12^/2 x etc.

Then equate the coefficients of the like terms, so shall and consequently 5/2
mA = 2, A = 4/5 m, 3/2 mB = O, B = O, 11/2 mC = - A2, C = - 24/275 m3, 14/2 mD
= - A3 - 3/2 AB, D = - 16/875 m4, etc; etc. Then these values of A, B, C, etc,
substituted in the assumed value of z, give ^ etc; or ^ very nearly. And when x
= 3 = AC, than z =.886 of a foot, or 10 inches, = AE, the height of the water
in the ditches when the tide is at CD or 3 feet high without, or in the first
hour and half of time.

Again, to find the time, after the above, when OF arrives at CD, or when the
water in the ditches arrives as high as the top of the sluice.

The notation remaining as before, then ^ per sec. runs through AF, and ^ per
sec. through ED; theref. ^ is the whole per sec. through AD. conseq. ^ the veloc.
per sec. of the point E; and theref. ^, or ^, where m = ^^00/2^^ as before.

diagram

Assume z = A x3^/2 + B x4^/2 + C x5^/2 + D x6^/2 etc. So shall ^ etc, ^ etc, ^
etc. Then, equating the like terms, etc, we have A = 4/ m, B = - 6/ m2, C =
12/5 m3, D = 4/3 m2 nearly, E = -36/7 m3 nearly, etc. Hence ^ etc. Or z = 4/ m
x3/2 nearly.

But, by the first process, when x = 3, z =.886; which substituted for them, we
have z =.886, and the series = 1.36; therefore the correct fluents are ^ etc,
or ^ etc.

And when z = 3 = AC, it gives x = 5.463 for the height of the tide without,
when the ditches are filled to the top of the sluice, or 3 feet high; which
answers to 2h 43 53.

Lastly, to find the time of rising the remaining 3 feet above the top of the
sluice; let

x = CG the height of the tide above CD, z = CE the height in the ditches above
CD; and the other dimensions as before.

diagram

Then ^ the velocity with which the water runs through the whole sluice AD;
consequently ^ is the quantity per second running through the sluice, and ^ the
velocity of z, or the rise of the water in the ditches, per second; hence ^,
and ^ is the fluxional equation; where n = A / 1802 g = m/9 = 3200/2079. To
find the fluent, Assume z = A x3/2 + B x4/2 + C x5/2 + D x6/2 etc. Then x - z =
x - A x3/2 - B x4/2 - C x5/2 etc, ^ etc, nz = 3/2 nA x x + 4/2 nB x2/2 x + 5/2
nC x3/2 x etc. Then equating the like terms gives A = 2/3 n, B = -1/6 n2, C =
1/90 n3, D = -1/810 n4, etc. Hence ^ etc.

But, by the second case, when z = 0, x = 2.463; which being used in the
series, it is 1.273; therefore the correct fluent is ^ etc, or z + nearly. And
when z = 3, x = 6.25 or 6; the heights above the top of the sluice; answering
to 6 and 9 above the bottom of the ditches. That is, for the water to rise to
the height of 6 feet within the ditches, it is necessary for the tide to rise
to 9 without, which answers to 4h 37 minutes; and so long it would take to fill
the ditches 6 feet deep with water, their horizontal area being 200000 square
feet.

Moreover, when x = 6, then z = 2.789 the height above the top of the sluice;
to which add 3, the height of the sluice, and the sum 5.789, or nearly 5 feet,
is the depth of water in the ditches in 4 hours and a half, or when the tide
has risen to the height of 9 feet without the ditches.

OF THE MOTION OF BODIES IN FLUIDS.
PROBLEM XXIX.
To determine the Force of Fluids in Motion. And the Circumstances attending
Bodies moving in Fluids.

1. It is evident that the resistance to a plane, moving perpendicularly
through an infinite fluid, at rest, is equal to the pressure or force of the
fluid upon the plane at rest, and the fluid moving with the same velocity, and
in the contrary direction, to that of the plane in the former case. But the
force of the fluid in motion, must be equal to the weight or pressure which
generates that motion; and which, it is known, is equal to the weight or
pressure of a column of the fluid, whose base is equal to the plane, and its
altitude equal to the height through which a body must fall, by the force of
gravity, to acquire the velocity of the fluid: and that altitude is, for the
sake of brevity, called the altitude due to the velocity. So that, if a denote
the area of the plane, v the velocity, and n the specific gravity of the fluid;
then, the altitude due to the velocity v being v2/4 g, the whole resistance, or
motive force m, will be a x n x v2/4 g = anv2/4 g; g being 16 1/12 feet. And
hence, caeteris paribus, the resistance is as the square of the velocity.

2. This ratio, of the square of the velocity, may be otherwise derived thus.
The force of the fluid in motion, must be as the force of one particle
multiplied by the number of them: but the force of a particle is as its
velocity; and the number that strikes the plane in a given time, is also as the
velocity; therefore the whole force is as v x v or v2, that is, as the square
of the velocity.

3. If the direction of motion, instead of being perpendicular to the plane, as
above supposed, were inclined to it in any angle, the sine of that angle being
s, to the radius 1; then the resistance to the plane, or the force of the fluid
against the plane, in the direction of the motion, as assigned above, will be
diminished in the triplicate ratio of radius to the sine of the angle of
inclination, or in the ratio of 1 to s3. For, AB being the direction of the
plane, and BD that of the motion, making the angle ABD, whose sine is s; the
number of particles, or quantity of the fluid, striking the plane, will be
diminished in the ratio of 1 to s, or of radius to the sine of the angle B of
inclination; and the force of each particle will also be diminished in the same
ratio of 1 to s; so that, on both these accounts, the whole resistance will be
diminished in the ratio of 1 to s2, or in the duplicate ratio of radius to the
sine of the said angle. But again, it is to be considered that this whole
resistance is exerted in the direction BE perpendicular to the plane; and any
force in the direction BE, is to its effect in the direction AE, parallel to
BD, as AE to BF, that is as 1 to s. So that finally, on all these accounts, the
resistance in the direction of motion, is diminished in the ratio of 1 to s3,
or in the triplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination. Hence,
comparing this with article 1, the whole resistance, or the motive force on the
plane, will be m = anv2 s3/4 g.

4. Also if w denote the weight of the body, whose plane face a is resisted by
the absolute force m; then the retarding force f, or m/ w, will be anv2 s3/4 gw.

5. And if the body be a cylinder, whose face or end is a, and diameter d, or
radius r, moving in the direction of its axis; because then s = 1, and a = pr2
= pd2, where p = 3.1416; the resisting force m will be npd2 v2/16 g = npr2 v2/4
g, and the retarding force f = npd2 v2/16 gw = npr2 v2/4 gw.

6. This is the value of the resistance when the end of the cylinder is a plane
perpendicular to its axis, or to the direction of motion. But were its face a
conical surface, or an elliptic section, or any other figure every where
equally inclined to the axis, the fine of inclination being s then, the number
of particles of the fluid striking the face being still the same, but the force
of each, opposed to the direction of motion, diminished in the duplicate ratio
of radius to the fine of inclination, the resisting force m will be npd2 v2
s2/16 g = npr2 v2 s2/4 g. But if the body were terminated by an end or face of
any other form, as a spherical one, or such like, where every part of it has a
different inclination to the axis, then a farther investigation becomes
necessary, such as in the following proposition.

PROBLEM XXX.
To determine the Resistance of a Fluid to any Body, moving in it, of a Curved
End, as a Sphere, or a Cylinder with a Hemispherical End, etc.

1. Let BEAD be a section through the axis CA of the solid, moving in the
direction of that axis. To any point of the curve draw the tangent EG, meeting
the axis produced in G: also draw the perpendicular ordinates OF, of
indefinitely near to each other; and draw ae parallel to CG. Putting CF = x, OF
= y, BE = z, s = fine G to radius 1, and p = 3.1416; then 2 py is the
circumference whose radius is OF, or the circumference described by the point
E, in revolving about the axis CA; and 2 py x Ee or 2 pyz is the fluxion of the
surface, or the surface described by Ee, in the said revolution about CA, and
which is the quantity represented by a in art. 3 of the last problem: hence nv2
s3/4 g x 2 pyz or pnv2 s3/2 g x yz is the resistance on that ring, or the
fluxion of the resistance to the body, whatever the figure of it may be. And
the fluent of which will be the resistance required.

diagram

2. In the case of a spherical form, putting the radius CA or CB = r, we have
^, and yz or OF x E^ = CE x a^ = rx; therefore the general fluxion ^ becomes ^;
the fluent of which, or ^, is the resistance to the spherical surface generated
by BE. And when x or CF is = r or CA, it becomes pnv3 r2/8 g for the resistance
on the whole hemisphere; which is also equal to pnv2 d2/32 g, where d = 2 r the
diameter.

3. But the perpendicular resistance to the circle of the same diameter d or
BD, by art. 5 of the preceding problem, is pnv2 d2/16 g; which, being double
the former, shows that the resistance to the sphere, is just equal to half the
direct resistance to a great circle of it, or to a cylinder of the same
diameter.

4. Since pd3 is the magnitude of the globe, if N denote its density or
specific gravity, its weight w will be = pd3 N, and therefore the retardive
force f or m/ w = pnv2 d2/32 g x 6/ pN d3 = 3 nv2/16 gN d; which is also = v2/4
gs by art. 8 of the general theorems in page 169; hence then 3 n/4N d = 1/ s,
and s = N / n x 4/3 d, which is the space that would be described by the globe,
while its whole motion is generated or destroyed by a constant force which is
equal to the force of resistance, if no other force acted on the globe to
continue its motion. And if the density of the fluid were equal to that of the
globe, the resisting force is such, as, acting constantly on the globe without
any other force, would generate or destroy its motion in describing the space
4/3 d, by that accelerating or retarding force.

5. Hence the greatest velocity that a globe will acquire by descending in a
fluid, by means of its relative weight in the fluid, will be found by making
the resisting force equal to that weight. For after the velocity is arrived at
such a degree, that the resisting force is equal to the weight that urges it,
it will increase no longer, and the globe will afterward continue to descend
with that velocity uniformly. Now, N and n being the separate specific
gravities of the globe and fluid, N - n will be the relative gravity of the
globe in the fluid, and therefore w = pd3 (N - n) the weight by which it is
urged; also m = pnv2 d2/32 g is the resistance; consequently pnv2 d2/32 g = 1/6
pd3 (N - n) when the velocity becomes uniform; from which is found ^ for the
said uniform or greatest velocity.

And by comparing this form with that in art. 6 of the general theorems in page
169, it will appear that its greatest velocity is equal to the velocity
generated by the accelerating force ^ in describing the space 4/3 d, or equal
to the velocity generated by gravity in freely describing the space ^, or the
specific gravity of the globe be double that of the fluid, then ^ = 1 = the
natural force of gravity; and then the globe will attain its greatest velocity
in describing 4/3 d, or 4/3 of its diameter. -- It is farther evident that if
the body be very small, it will very soon acquire its greatest velocity,
whatever its density may be.

Ex. If a leaden ball, of 1 inch diameter, descend in water, and in air of the
same density as at the earth's surface, the three specific gravities being as
11, and 1, and 3/2500. Then ^ feet, is the greatest velocity per second the
ball can acquire by descending in water. And ^ nearly ^ is the greatest
velocity it can acquire in air.

But if the globe were only 1/100 of an inch diameter, the greatest velocities
it could acquire, would be only 1/10 of these, namely 86/100 of a foot in
water, and 26 feet nearly in air. And if the ball were still farther
diminished, the greatest velocity would also be diminished, and that in the
subduplicate ratio of the diameter of the ball.

PROBLEM XXXI.
To determine the Relations of Velocity, Space, and Time, of a Ball moving in a
Fluid in which it is projected with a given Velocity.

1. Let a = the first velocity of projection, x the space described in any time
t, and v the velocity then. Now, by art. 4 of the last problem, the
accelerative force f = 3 nv2/16 gN d, where N is the density of the ball, n
that of the fluid, and d the diameter. Therefore the general equation vv = 2
gfs becomes vv = -3 nv2/8N d x, and hence v/ v = -3 n/8N d x = - bx, putting b
for 3 n/8N d. And the correct fluent of this is log. a - log. v or log. a/ v =
bx. Or, put c = 2.718281828, the number whose hyp. log. is 1, then is a/ v =
cbx, and the velocity v = a/ cbx = ac-bx.

2. The velocity v at any time being the c^- bx part of the first velocity,
therefore the velocity lost in any time will be the 1 - c^- bx part, or the ^
part of the first velocity.

Ex. 1. If a globe be projected, with any velocity, in a medium of the same
density with itself, and it describe a space equal to 3 d or 3 of its
diameters. Then x = 3 d, and 3 n/8N d = 3/8 d; therefore bx = 9/8, and the
velocity lost is ^, or nearly of the projectile velocity.

Ex. 2. If an iron ball of 2 inches diameter were projected with a velocity of
1200 feet per second, to find the velocity lost after moving through 500 feet
of air; we should have d = 2/12 =, a = 1200, x = 500, N = 7, n =.0012; and
therefore ^, and ^ feet per second: having lost 207 feet, or nearly of its
first velocity.

Ex. 3. If the earth revolved about the sun in a medium as dense as the
atmosphere near the earth's surface; and it were required to find the quantity
of motion lost in a year. Then, since the earth's mean density is about 4, and
its distance from the sun 12000 of its diameters, we have 24000 x 3.1416 =
75398 diameters = x, and ^; hence ^ parts are lost of the first motion in the
space of a year, and only the 1/2576 part remains.

Ex. 4. If it be required to determine the distance moved, x, when the globe
has lost any part of its motion, as suppose, and the density of the globe and
fluid equal: The general equation gives x = 1/6 x log. a/ v = 8 d/3 x log. of 2
= 1.8483925 d. So that the globe loses half its motion before it has described
twice its diameter.

3. To find the time t, we have t = s/ v = x/ v = cbx x/ a. Now to find the
fluent of this, put z = cb x; then is bx = log. z, and bx = z/ z, or x = z/ bz;
consequently t or cbx x/ a = zx/ a = z/ ab, and hence t = z/ ab = cbx / ab. But
as t and x vanish together, and when x = 0, the quantity cbx / ab = 1/ ab,
therefore, by correction, ^ the time sought; where b = 3 n/8N d, and v = a/ cb
x the velocity.

Ex. If an iron ball of 2 inches diameter were projected in the air with a
velocity of 1200 feet per second; and it were required to determine in what
time it would pass over 500 yards or 1500 feet, and what would be its velocity
at the end of that time: We should have, as in ex. 2 above, ^, and bx =
1500/2716 = 375/679; hence 1/ b = 2716/1, and 1/ a = 1/1200, and 1/ v = cbx / a
= 1.7372/1200 = 1/690 nearly. Consequently v = 690 is the velocity, and t 1/ b
(1/ v - 1/ a) = 2716 x (1/690 - 1/1200) = 1 31/46 seconds is the time required,
or 1 and nearly.

PROBLEM XXXII.
To determine the Relations of Space, Time, and Velocity, when a Globe
descends, by its own Weight, in an infinite Fluid.

The foregoing notation remaining, viz. d = diameter, N and n the density of
the ball and fluid, and v, s, t, the velocity, space, and time, in motion; we
have pd3 = the magnitude of the ball, and pd3 (N - n) = its weight in the
fluid, also m = pnd2 v2/32 g = its resistance from the fluid; consequently 1/6
pd3 (N - n) - pnd2 v2/32 g is the force by which the ball is urged; which being
divided by pN d3, the quantity of matter moved, gives f = 1 - n/N - 3 nv2/16 gN
d for the accelerative force.

2. Hence vv = 2 gfs, and ^, putting b = 3 n/8N d, and ^, or ab = 2 g; the
fluent of which is ^, an expression for the space s in terms of the velocity v.

3. But now to determine v in terms of s, put c = 2.718281828; then since ^,
therefore ^, or ^; and hence ^ the velocity sought.

4. The greatest velocity is to be found, as in art. 5 of prob. 30, by making f
or 1 - n/N - 3 nv2/16 gN d = 0, which gives ^. The same value is also obtained
by making the fluxion of v2 or a - ac^-2 bs = o. And the same value of v is
obtained by making s infinite, for then c^-2 bs = 0. But this velocity a cannot
be attained in any finite time, and it only denotes the velocity to which the
general value of v or ^ continually approaches. It is evident, however, that it
will approximate toward it the faster, the greater b is, or the less d is; and
that, the diameters being very small, the bodies descend by nearly uniform
velocities, which are directly in the subduplicate ratio of the diameters. See
also art. 5 prob. 30 for other observations on this head.

5. Since c^-2bs is the number whose log is - 2 bs, it will be ^ etc, putting e
= 2 bs = 3 ns/4N d; hence 1 - c^-e = e - e2 + e3 - etc, and ^. And when N is
very great in respect of n, then, all the terms after the first being very
small, v will be nearly ^ nearly, that is the velocity freely generated by
gravity, as it ought.

6. To find the time t; we have ^. Then to find the fluent of this fluxion, put
^; hence ^, and ^; consequently ^, and therefore the fluent is ^, which is the
general expression for the time.

7. When N is very great in respect of n; then, as in art. 5, v = 2 abs, and
log. ^; and therefore t = 22 bs/2 ^ ^ = 2 s/ ab = s/ g, the same as the time of
descending freely by gravity, as it ought.

Ex. If it were required to determine the time and velocity, by descending in
air 1000 feet; the ball being of lead, and 1 inch diameter.

Here N = 11, n = 3/2500, d = 1/12, and s = 1000. Hence ^, and ^; conseq. ^ the
velocity. And ^, the time.

NOTE. If the globe be so light as to ascend in the fluid; it is only necessary
to change the signs of the first two terms in the value of f, or the
accelerating force, by which it becomes f = n/N - 1 - 3 nv2/16 gN d; and then
proceeding in all respects as before.

SCHOLIUM.
To compare this theory, contained in the last four problems, with experiment,
I shall here extract the few following numbers from extensive tables of
velocities and resistances, resulting from a course of many hundred very
accurate experiments, made by me in the course of the year 1786; of which a
particular account will be given elsewhere.

In the first column are contained the mean uniform or greatest velocities
acquired in air, by globes, hemispheres, cylinders, and cones, all of the same
diameter, and the altitude of the cone nearly equal to the diameter also, when
urged by the several weights, expressed in avordupois ounces, and standing on
the same line with the velocities, each in their proper columns. So, in the
first line, the numbers show that, when the greatest or uniform velocity was
accurately 3 feet per second, the bodies were urged by these weights, according
as their different ends went foremost; namely, by.028oz when the vertex of the
cone went foremost; by.064oz when the base of the cone went foremost; by.027oz
for a whole sphere; by.045oz for a cylinder; by.051oz for the flat side of the
hemisphere; and by.020oz for the round or unequal side of the hemisphere. Also,
at the bottom of all, are placed the mean proportions of the resistances of
these figures, in the nearest whole numbers. Note, the common diameter of all
the figures, was 6.375 or 6 inches; so that the area of the circle of that
diameter is just 32 square inches, or 2/9 of a square foot; and the altitude of
the cone was 6 inches. Also the diameter of the small hemisphere was 4 inches,
and consequently the area of its base is 17 square inches, or of a square foot
nearly.

The mean height of the barometer at the times of making the experiments, was
nearly 30.1 inches, and of the thermometer 62; and consequently the weight of a
cubic foot of air was equal to 1 oz nearly in those circumstances.

From this table of resistances, several practical inferences may be drawn. As,

1. That the resistance is nearly as the surface; the resistance increasing but
a very little above that proportion in the greater surfaces. Thus, by comparing
together the numbers in the 6th and last columns, for the bases of the two
hemispheres, the areas of which are in the proportion of 17 to 32, or as 5 to 9
very nearly; but the numbers in those two columns, expressing the resistances
are nearly as 1 to 2, or as 5 to 10, as far as to the velocity of 12 feet;
after which the resistances on the greater surface increase gradually more and
more above that proportion. And the mean resistances are as 140 to 288, or as 5
to 10 2/7. This circumstance therefore agrees nearly with the theory.

2. The resistance to the same surface, is nearly as the square of the
velocity; but gradually increases more and more above that proportion as the
velocity increases. This is manifest from all the columns. And therefore this
circumstance also nearly agrees with the theory, in small velocities.

3. When the hinder parts of bodies are of different forms, the resistances are
different, though the fore parts be alike; owing probably to the different
pressures of the air on the hinder parts. Thus, the resistance to the fore part
of the cylinder is less than that on the flat base of the hemisphere, or of the
cone; because the hinder part of the cylinder is more pressed or pushed, by the
following air, than those of the other two figures.

4. The resistance on the base of the hemisphere, is to that on the unequal
side, nearly as 2 to 1, instead of 2 to 1, as the theory assigns the
proportion. And therefore in this particular, the theory is attended with a
considerable error.

5. The resistance on the base of the cone, is to that on the vertex, nearly as
2 3/10 to 1, instead of 5 to 1, as the theory in pa. 223 art. 6 requires it to
be. So that the theory in this instance gives less than half the true
experimented resistance.

6. Hence we can find the altitude of a column of air, whose pressure shall be
equal to the resistance of a body, moving through it with any velocity.

Let a = the area of the section of the body, similar to any of those in the
table, perpendicular to the direction of motion; r = the resistance to the
velocity in the table; and x = the altitude sought, of a column of air, whose
base is a, and its pressure r. Then ax = the content of the column in feet, and
1 ax or 6/5 ax its weight in ounces; therefore 6/5 ax = r, and x = x r/ a is
the altitude sought in feet, namely of the quotient of the resistance of any
body divided by its transverse section; which is a constant quantity for all
similar bodies, however different in magnitude, since the resistance r is as
the section a, as we have found in art. 1. When a = 2/9 of a foot, as in all
the figures in our table, except the small hemisphere; then x = x r/ a becomes
x = 15/4 r, where r is the resistance in our table to the similar body. If, for
example, we take the unequal side of the large hemisphere, whose resistance
is.634 oz to a velocity of 16 feet per second; then r =.634, and x = 15/4 r =
2.3775 feet, is the altitude of the column of air whose pressure is equal to
the resistance on a spherical surface with a velocity of 16 feet. And to
compare the above altitude with that which is due to the given velocity, it
will be 322 162 16 4 the altitude due to the velocity 16; which is near double
the altitude that is equal to the pressure. And as the altitude is proportional
to the square of the velocity, therefore, in small velocities, the resistance
to any spherical surface, is equal to the pressure of a column of air on its
great circle, whose altitude is 19/32 or.594 of the altitude due to its
velocity.

7. Hence we may infer the great resistance suffered by military projectiles.
For we find in the table that a globe of 6 inches diameter, which is equal to
the size of an iron ball weighing 36 lb, moving with a velocity of only 16 feet
per second, meets with a resistance equal to the pressure of of an ounce
weight; and therefore, computing only according to the square of the velocity,
the least resistance that such a ball would meet with, when moving with a
velocity of 1600 feet, would be equal to the pressure of 417 lb, and that
independent of the pressure of the atmosphere itself on the fore part of the
ball, which would be 480 lb more, as there would be no pressure from the
atmosphere on the hinder part, in the case of so great a velocity as 1600 feet
per second. So that the whole resistance would not be less than about 900 lb to
such a velocity.

8. Having said in the last article that the pressure of the atmosphere is
taken entirely off the hinder part of the ball, moving with a velocity of 1600
feet per second; which must happen when the ball moves faster than the
particles of air can follow by rushing into the place quitted and left void by
the ball, or when the ball moves faster than the air rushes into a vacuum from
the pressure of the incumbent air. Let us therefore inquire what this velocity
is. Now the velocity with which any fluid issues, depends upon its altitude
above the orifice, and is indeed equal to the velocity acquired by a heavy body
in falling freely through that altitude. But, supposing the height of the
barometer to be 30 inches or 2 feet, the height of an uniform atmosphere, all
of the same density as at the earth's surface, would be 2 x 14 x 833 or 29166
feet; therefore 16 29166 32 829166 = 1366 feet, which is the velocity sought.
And therefore with a velocity of 1600 feet per second, or any velocity above
1366 feet, the ball must continually leave a vacuum behind it, and so must
sustain the whole pressure of the atmosphere on its fore part, as well as the
resistance arising from the vis inertia of the particles of air struck by the
ball.

9. Upon the whole we find that the resistance of the air, as determined by our
experiments, differs very widely, both in respect to the quantity of it on all
figures, and in respect to the proportions of it on oblique surfaces, from the
same as determined by the preceding theory, which is the same as that of Sir
Isaac Newton, and most modern philosophers. Neither should we succeed better if
we have recourse to the theory given by professor Gravesande, or others, as
similar differences and inconsistencies still occur.

We conclude therefore that all the theories of the resistance of the air
hitherto given, are very erroneous. And I have only laid down the preceding
one, till further experiments on this important subject shall enable us to
deduce from them, another, that shall be more consonant to the true phenomena
of nature.
