EDWIN AND ANGELINA.
A BALLAD.
BY MR. GOLDSMITH.
Printed for the Amusement of the COUNTESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND.
DEIGN, saint-like tenant of the dale,
To guide my nightly way
To yonder fire, that chears the vale
With hospitable ray.
For here, deserted, as I tread
With fainting steps and slow,
The wild, immeasurably spread,
Seems lengthening as I go.
Forbear, my son, the sage replies,
To tempt the lonely gloom,
For yonder faithless phantom flies
To lure thee to thy doom.
Here to the houseless child of want
My door is open still,
And though my portion is but scant,
I give it with good will.
Then turn tonight, and freely share
Whatever my cell bestows,
My rushy couch and frugal fare,
My blessing and repose.
No flocks, that range the valley free,
To slaughter I condemn;
Taught by that Power that pities me,
I learn to pity them.
But from the mountain's grassy side
A guiltless feast I bring,
A scrip with herbs and fruits supplied,
And water from the spring.
Then turn tonight, thy cares forego,
All earth-born cares are wrong;
"Man wants but little here below,
"Nor wants that little long."
Soft as the dew from heaven descends,
His gentle accents fell,
The modest stranger lowly bends,
And follows to the cell.
Far in a wilderness obscure
The lonely mansion lay,
A refuge to the unshelter'd poor
And strangers led astray.
No stores beneath its humble thatch
Required a master's care,
The wicket, opening with a latch,
Received the harmless pair.
And now, when busy crowds retire
To take their evening rest,
The hermit trimmed his little fire,
And cheered his pensive guest;
And spread his vegetable store,
And gaily pressed and smiled,
And, skilled in legendary lore,
The lingering hours beguiled.
While round, in sympathetic mirth,
Its tricks the kitten tries,
The cricket chirrups in the hearth,
The crackling faggot flies.
But nothing mirthful could assuage
The pensive stranger's woe,
For grief had seized his early age,
And tears would often flow.
His rising cares the hermit spied,
With answering care oppressed;
And whence, unhappy youth, he cried,
The sorrows of thy breast?
From better habitations spurned,
Reluctant do thou rove,
Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd,
Or unregarded love?
Say, what is friendship? but a name,
A charm that lulls to sleep,
A shade that follows wealth or fame,
But leaves the wretch to weep.
And what is love? an empty sound,
The modern fair one's jest;
On earth unseen, or only found
To warm the turtle's nest.
For shame, fond youth, thy sorrows hush,
And spurn the sex, he said,
But while he spoke, a rising blush
His love-lorn guest betrayed.
Surpised he sees new beauties rise
Expanding to the view,
Like colors over the morning skies,
As bright, as transient too.
The bashful look, the rising breast
Alternate spread alarms,
The lovely stranger stands confessed
A maid in all her charms.
And ah! forgive a stranger rude,
A thing forlorn, she cried,
Whose feet unhallowed thus intrude
Where heaven and you reside.
Forgive, and let thy pious care
An heart's distress allay,
That seeks repose, but finds despair
Companion of the way.
My father lived, of high degree
Remote beside the Tyne,
And as he had but only me,
Whatever he had was mine.
To win me from his tender arms
Unnumber'd suitors came,
Their chief pretense my flattered charms,
My wealth perhaps their aim.
Each hour the mercenary crowd
With glittering proffers strove;
Among the rest young Edwin bowed,
Who offered only love.
In humble simplest habit clad,
No wealth nor power had he;
Wisdom and worth were all he had,
And these were all to me.
Whenever he spoke amidst the train,
How would my heart attend!
And still delighted even to pain,
How sigh for such a friend!
And when a little rest I sought
In sleep's refreshing arms,
How have I mended what he taught,
And lent him fancied charms!
Yet still (and woe betide the hour)
I spurned him from my side,
And still with ill dissembled power,
Repaid his love with pride.
'Till, quite dejected with my scorn,
He left me to deplore,
And sought a solitude forlorn,
And never was heard of more.
Then since he perished by my fault,
This pilgrimage I pay,
I Will seek the solitude he sought,
And stretch me where he lay.
And there in sheltering thickets hid,
I Will linger till I die;
'Twas thus for me my lover did,
And so for him will I.
Thou shall not thus, the hermit cried,
And clasped her to his breast.
The astonished fair-one turned to chide,
'Twas EDWIN's self that pressed.
For now no longer could he hide
What first to hide he strove,
His looks resume their youthful pride,
And flush with honest love.
Turn, ANGELINA, ever dear,
My charmer, turn to see
Thy own, thy long-lost EDWIN here,
Restored to love and thee.
Thus let me hold thee to my heart,
And every care resign,
And shall we never, never part,
My life, my all that is mine.
No, never from this hour to part,
Our love shall still be new,
And the last sigh that rends thy heart
Shall break thy EDWIN's too.
Here amidst sylvan bowers we'll rove,
From lawn to woodland stray,
Blessed as the songsters of the grove,
And innocent as they.
To all that want, and all that wail,
Our pity shall be given,
And when this life of love shall fail,
We'll love it again in heaven.
THE END.
