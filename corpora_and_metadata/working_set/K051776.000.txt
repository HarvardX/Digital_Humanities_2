Extract of a Letter from the AUTHOR, to his Friend in LONDON.
Dear Sir,
THE Interlude of the Magic Girdle, which Mr. Barthelemon left in my hands for
correction, furnished me with the first hint of this Drama. I send you the
original, that you may see my great reserve in borrowing from it; at the same
time, humbly begging pardon of the gentleman, unknown, with whose hasty sketch
I have taken so many liberties. This Plot is here totally changed, and his
Personages thrown into a different cast of character: I have availed myself but
very sparingly of his words; scarce at all of his poetry.

I hope he will have the goodness to forgive me for what I have retained and
what I have rejected, assuring him that, he is welcome to use still greater
license with any work of mine.

I adopt the laconic Dialogue of Italian Burletta, in order to comprise my
Fable within the narrow limits of late prescribed by the taste of your
audiences. This is short enough to admit their being indulged with some popular
Petite Piece after it.

I am, dear Sir, etc.

They rise and come forward laughing. RECITATIVE. Matil. But apropos, child! --
This same Hymen's torch --
'Twere time you think about it.

Ceph. (somewhat disconcerted) Think! -- think, aunt?


Matil. Yes, think -- come, tell not me; -- you girls, do think,
And oft'times think, the hours of celibacy
So many ages.

Ceph. (confused) Bless me, dear ma'am!


Matil. Nay, nay,
Unless you think on it young, when old, you will think,
And not be thought upon -- why, here stand I now.

AIR. I, in my giddy days -- yes, I
Have had admirers -- many;
Yet, was so nice, forsooth -- so shy --
I scorned to fix on any.
One -- too lean -- one -- too fat --
He -- too tall -- he -- too squat --
Or -- too this -- or -- too that --
That I never knew, what
I Would be at --
But now from my tantrums emerging,
I feel to my cost,
What offers I Have lost;
And am, to my grief a stale virgin.
RECITATIVE. Ceph. Alas! poor aunty.


Matil. Why, the case is piteous; (sighing) But you, my dear! are, by your
father's will, Secured against it.


Ceph. (afflicted) Oh! that will! -- that will --
That -- "if within the year no match be offered,
"To which my frightful guardian, Buffalo,
"Should grant consent, I must, perforce, consent
"TO accept the odious brute himself."

Matil. Too true --
Further -- "if you refuse, then your whole fortune
"Devolves on Buffalo; -- and you, for life,
"Immured -- in some lone cloyster's cell."

Ceph. (resentfully) A cloister!


AIR. How could my fond papa
Be cheated by this elf,
And thus allot
To such a sot,
His daughter and his pelf?
He surely had forgot
That were I like mamma,
Like her I Would please myself.
RECITATIVE. Matil. Choose quickly, then -- you have but this night to choose in.
What do you purpose?

Ceph. (embarrassed) Purpose, aunt? I purpose --
That is, I wish -- but no -- and yet -- a maiden --
You take me? --

Matil. (ironically) Doubtless, child -- you're so explicit.
(serious) Do You purpose to take Buffalo?

Ceph. (resolutely) The veil first.


Matil. Well judged! though both, perhaps, you yet might shun.


Ceph. (eagerly) How? How, dear aunt?


Matil. (with a look of significance) (aside) I Will try her -- (to her) pray
Cephisa!
Last Sunday, in the circus, from our window --
AIR. Did you mark,
A gay spark
In a sash?
On his phaeton reared,
How genteel he appeared,
And how gracefully flourished his lash!
So handsome! so young,
And cut such a flash
As he pranc'd it along!
All the rest seemed but trash;
And my very heart sprung,
To the youth in the sash.

RECITATIVE. Ceph. (affecting indifference) A pair of dappled greys! I think, I
did.
Bowed to us --

Matil. Yes.


Ceph. His name Folatre, an't it?
Lives -- a-la-place Roiale?

Matil. The same.


Ceph. (with affected importance) Well, aunt,
If this Folatre, with the dappled greys,
Lives, a-la-place Roiale --

Matil. (impatiently) He does -- he does.


Ceph. Then -- I know -- nothing of him.


laughing. Matil. (pettishly) 'Psha, don't trifle.


Ceph. (checked) Pardon, sweet aunt! -- this little pleasantry;
And I Will confess -- ( hesitates)

Matil. Out with it, child!


Ceph. (in confusion) That -- I --
Do -- know him -- and --

Matil. (smiling) And -- don't dislike him -- eh?


Ceph. Why -- no -- yes -- cannot you guess? -- in short, dear aunt --

AIR. My heart is so harrast,
My mind so embarrast,
That, how to get out of this pucker,
Or what scheme engage in,
I cannot imagine,
Unless you afford me your succor. --
My guardian I hate,
As the nunnery grate:
Folatre I prize,
As the light of my eyes.
There Is your clue,
So, adieu!

Exit. RECITATIVE. Matil. A clue, indeed. -- Their flame, I find is mutual!
Equal their trust in me -- I Will not forsake them --
Our don's a dolt, a vain chick-hearted bully:
His pride, with slatt'ry first, I Will sooth: that failing,
His fear I will alarm. Next, on his folly,
By stratagem, I Will practice -- hush! I hear him --

steps aside. (Buffalo is heard blustering behind the scene.) Buff. (strutting
in) To day -- it is April Day --
I will be wroth.
(calls aloud) Hoa! Dunberblixen, charge my blunderbuss -- my rapier,
Scolopendroz!
swaggers Enter a scald Ragamuffin, who kneels, and presents him a sword, then
sneaks off, trembling; he draws it arrogantly. Forth, Toledo!
(kissing the sword) Now, by thy blade, thy fate-dispensing blade!
(fiercely) What Caitiff grins this day, shall grin in -- death.

Matil. (aside) Swollen turkey cock!
(laughing then advances with a low curtsy) Magnanimous and sapient Don Buffalo!
(curtsies) With all humility I crave an audience.

(curtsies) Buff. (flinging himself proudly on a chair) It Is indulged thee --
Say.


Matil. (curtsy) Signior, to you, as guardian of Cephisa,
I -- modestly remonstrate that -- my niece
Is now arrived at marriageable years -- (curtsy)

Buff. (superciliously) The maid is nubile -- ( nods) -- on!


Matil. (curtsies) And -- that -- her term
For option -- tends -- this evening -- to its close.

curtsies. Buff. Proceed.

(with a nod)
Matil. (curtsies) Then, Signior, is it your good pleasure
To doom her to the veil?

Buff. (sullenly) No.


Matil. (cheerfully) You consent then,
She listens to the vows of -- Count Folatre?

curtsies. Buff. (starting up) Folatre! (in a thundering tone) No.


Matil. (mildly, curtsying) Your reason, Signior?


Buff. (in rage) Reason?
Reason from me?
(strides about furious)
Matil. (curtsying with a sneer) True; pardon the mistake!


Buff. My will -- is reason -- and my will it is,
Cephisa to exalt to -- higher honors --
(struts)
Matil. Higher, Signior!

(with affected surprise)
Buff. Yea, to the first, my hand.


Matil. (scornfully) Your hand! the honor!


Buff. (haughtily) Woman! yes -- an honor,
To set contesting princesses at variance.
AIR. Lives there -- whose valor, blood, and talents,
Against Buffalo's can poise the balance?
Your Coesars, Platos, Alexanders,
And Senecas, though great commanders,
To Buffalo must vail the bonnet,
If Buffalo insist upon it. --
To whom, for lineage high, Nassau
Must strike the flag, and yield the pas.

(He swaggers, she eyes him with the utmost disdain, then breaks out.)
RECITATIVE. Matil. Valor! -- thou whipping post! valor! -- where slept it,
When on the grand parade, this same Folatre
Can'd you? and tweak'd your nose?

Buff. (with strained importance) He was ignoble; --
Would have debased my sword.

Matil. 'Slife, he would have broke it
Cross your thick skull.

Buff. (with haughty solemnity) Learn, thou impertinent!
That Buffalo delib'rates, ere he acts.

Matil. (sneering) So't seems.


A sarcastical laugh. Buff. So, while I mused, his rashness,
How with due dignity -- best to chastise,
The coward slunk away.
(struts)
Matil. (much exasperated) Coward? -- no, braggart!


AIR. DUET. Matil. That title's quite your own,
Your own -- of right inherent;
Whereby so well you're known,
That he can claim no share in it.

Buff. That he is a rank poltroon,
This sword shall make apparent;
He quakes, if I but frown.

Matil. You frown on him! you daren't.


Matil. That title's, etc.
That he is, etc.

Buff. That title's, etc.
That he is, etc.
He Is a pet of your niece's;
For which
I Will cut him to pieces.

Matil. That tongue yo' 'ad best rein in --
Do You itch
For the other good caning?

Buff. By Styx, when I meet him, I Will beat him.


Matil. Yet, let me entreat you! not eat him.


Buff. By Styx, etc.
Yet let, etc.

Matil. By Styx, etc.
Yet let, etc.
You may find him plaguey tough.

Buff. I shall find him, that is enough.

Matil. You may, etc.
I shall, etc.

Buff. You may, etc.
I shall, etc.

Exeunt severally. End of the FIRST ACT.
ACT II. The Street before BUFFALO's house.
Enter COUNT FOLATRE, his servant DAVO following. They walk along, looking up
to the window. FOLATRE, anxious. NO signal yet?


Davo. Her aunt, my Lord, comes forth.


Enter MATILDA, dissatisfied. FOLATRE runs to meet her. Fola. Well, my kind
patroness!

(eagerly.)
Matil. (sorrowfully.) Count! your proposals I tendered to the Don.


Fola. Well!


Matil. He rejects 'em.

Declares he will marry her himself.


Fola. (stunned) Himself! (in dejection) I Am lost -- ay, this I feared. She --
She Is a treasure Not to be yielded.

(in despair)
Matil. Why then yield it you?


Fola. What can I do?

(desponding)
Matil. Do, Count? rouse! use your wits! Use stratagem, disguise! Our oaf's a
subject For any, any practice.


Fola. (pondering) I Am bewildered.

AIR. Hope, despair, and rage surrounding,
Justling,
Bustling,
And confounding,
Make a chaos in my breast.
Cupid, aid me! -- Venus, smile!
O Jove! versed in amorous wile,
Now, some device suggest!

FOLATRE plunged in meditation, DAVO steps forward bowing. Davo. Pardon my lord
-- I see you're posed -- permit me

To start a project.


Fola. (hopelessly) You!


Davo. ( to Matil.) Madam -- I Am told, This Don has faith in the Black Art.


Matil. (attentive) Religious!


Davo. Astrology -- and magic?


Matil. Yes, his creed.


Davo. On that I build -- I play the Astrologer:
You puff me off t'him; -- he comes to consult me.
If my resonses make him not as eager
T'espouse Miss -- Beelzebub, as Miss Cephisa,
Say, I Am -- no Conjuror.

Matil. (much pleased) I like it vastly.

(laughing) 'Twill make the fool run mad -- I Will call Cephisa.

(goes in)
Fola. (hastily) Dispatch good Davo! run man! hire a chamber, Provide your
properties. --


Davo. (with alacrity going) All shall be ready. --

AIR. Dancer of puppets have I been,
And Mountebank, and Harlequin,
And fortune-telling Wizard. --
If some or other of these shapes,
To gull one formal jackanapes,
Cannot equip me -- it is hard.
I Will enchant,
I Will amaze him;
I will daunt,
I will craze him;
I will make him believe
I Have an imp in my sleeve
Just ready to pop out and seize him.

Exit in a hurry. Re-enter MATILDA with CEPHISA. Ceph. (to Fola.) My aunt

AIR, DUETT, which changes to a TRIO, and afterward a QUARTETTO. Fola. Say,
maid adored! Say! Heavenly Fair!
What may I hope?

Ceph. Hope, whatsoever
Honor can grant, and love demand.

Fola. They claim -- in me they claim -- your hand.


Ceph. My hand? -- alas -- that is not mine.


Fola. Your heart at least.

The little all I can, I give.

Exit Buffalo, and afterward the others. SCENE, A Chamber, Buffalo solus,
musing, RECITATIVE, accompanied. Buss Certes, of brain moon-smitten
Must be -- this Calcitrator,
This Hotspur Count Folatre --
Would else the puny kitten
Ever have faced audacious,
(draws) This blade, or these Moustachios?
(feigns) Sa, sa! There I could drill him. -- Puts up.
I Will swear him lunatic, possessed;
Get him laid under an arrest:
And lower so his crest.
(Swaggers.) AIR How great a blessing to my foes,
That, when my wrath could tear'em,
I let my mercy interpose,
And, in compassion, spare'em!
Then prudence here shines,
(As in all my designs)
And wisdom atones
For my ward, fame, and bones.

Enter Matilda, as out of breath. DIALOGUE in Music. Buff. (angrily.) A fine
time o'day,
To be out of the way,
Where a plague could you stay?

Matil. Sure I made no delay.


Buff. Two hours at least,
Now, when time pressed,

Matil. You might have guessed,
I'a' go t'engage the priest.

Buff. (still chiding) You crept,
You slept,

Matil. (apologizing) I but to the Conj'ror stepped,
And there was kept.

Buff. (inquisitively) The Conjuror?


Matil. Yes, Sir.


Buff. (solicitously) What Conj'ror?


Matil. (solemnly) Oh! an adepl,
Newly slipped down from the regious
Of Luna, attended by legions
Of spirits of every hue.

Buff. (with surprise) Indeed!


Matil. Aye, Sir! a mystic,
Deep read
In Cabalistic,
Astrology,
Necrology,
Tautology, --

Buff. Is this all true?
(Eagerly) And can divine?

Matil. Yes, Signior, mine.
He, at a wink,
Sees all you think;
Knows all you do,
Better than you.
AIR. He told me the secrets of all my past life:
He told me how often I might have been a wife;
Told how this Knight wheedled, and how that Lord swore,
With the kneelings,
The sighings,
The feelings,
The dyings;
He told me whut followed, told what went before;
At last, in a whisper, he told something more,

RECITATIVE. Buff. (aside, ruminating) This is past coz'nage, no juggling here.
(To her, looking wise) Astrology was ever held a science.
Inscrutable, infallible, incredible.
Such hold it I, and therefore hold firm faith in it.

Matil. (cajoling him) Most justy reasoned, Signior!

Buff. (flattered) Yes, I propose
To commune with this Sage, from him to learn
All, what my love, or fortunes may concern. --
(Going, stops) AIR. Yet, what need I
Consult the sky,
On stars above dependant?
Are not Cephisa's eyes
My stars, my destinies,
And lords of my ascendant?

Exit. As Buffalo goes out, enter (at another Door) Cephisa.

RECITATIVE. Ceph. Lord, Aunt! I thought your conf'rence with the Don
Would never end. Where went he?

Matil. (with affected carelessness) Just to's Notary,
To perfect a small bond to me.

Ceph. (amazed) To you?


Matil. Yes, poor ten thousand crowns, conditioned solely
That I win you, to place your love on him,
And to discard the Count; that is all. Now, Cephisa!
(As if in earnest) You must be desperate fond.

Ceph. (with indignation) Of him? good Heavens!
And you -- you to betray me? -- it is too much.
AIR. (in agitation) No -- believe it, I cannot,
That my friend -- that my aunt
Who professed
Such a care
Of my interest,
Her niece would have sold,
For a handful of gold,
Like her slave, or her beast;
But I swear
And declare,
All friendship's a jest,
And some but speak fair,
To cozen the rest.

RECITATIVE. Matil. You thought me serious.


Laughs heartily. Ceph. (disconcerted) Were you not?


Matil. Mere joke.
Nay more, we have a plot to terrify him.
Davo will boast the powers of magic art,
And thus disguised so work upon his fears,
That he shall trembie at the thoughts of marriage,
And beg Folatre to accept your hand.
AIR. His doughty Donship,
I Have got on the hip,
I Will silence his Rhodomantadoes,
The Conj'ror's a whip,
To make a knave skip,
And humble a bully's bravadoes.

Exit Ceph. (smiling) She Has hooked her gudgeon. --
Now, the playing's all.
I Will follow, to be ready at the landing.
(with emotion) Why palpitates my heart? do I not see
That this clod's pride, and fear, and superstition,
All op'rate to our aid? (sighs) would 'twere well over!
AIR. The merchant whose whole stock,
One crazy bark conveys,
Each moment feels the shock,
Of shelves, shoa^s, winds, and seas.
My cargo's love; wedlock, my port;
Blow fair, kind gale!
For if thou fail,
My dismal resort
Is -- the Veil.

Exit. End of the SECOND ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE, Davo's Apartment. Enter Matilda, conducting Buffalo. mysteriously
MATIL. (in a low voice.) THESE are the conj'ror's chambers. Here I leave you.

going.
Buff. (afraid) Alone? Leave me alone?


Matil. He sees but one at once -- good stars to ye!


Exit. Davo, behind the Skreen. Davo. (aloud, solemnly) The stars announce
Don Buffalo's approach.

Buff. (aside, awed) Unseen, to know and name me -- Strange indeed!


Davo. (louder) Open locks,
Ere he knocks.

The stage is darkened, and the scene flying open, Davo is seen sitting gravely
at the table in a magician's habit, awfully waving his wand, while Buffalo
stands silent in terror and amaze. Davo. (solemn) Be Jupiter predominant in
Virgo,
Aspect benign! [Thunder] A gracious omen. --
(Rises and bows.)
Buff. (quaking as Davo advances toward him) -- (Aside) Save us!


Davo. In me, Don Buffalo! in me thou see
The type, the proto-type, the arche-type
Of The mystic Cabala -- Me, the nine planets,
Their Major Domo -- Me, the ecliptic comets,
Their aid-de-camp -- Me, the bear's arctic, catarctic,
Saturnus, Urnus, Ops, Hydrops, Libra, Zebra,
(Wi' the rest of the menagerie celestial)
Their warden recognize.

Buff. (in a tremulous voice, and bowing low) -- Yes, Sir!


Davo. (continuing) -- All science,
Lucid, abstruse, natural, praeter-natural,
Occult, incult, difficult, excult, I fathom;
Chiromance, Stultomance, and Necromance.

Buff. (bowing) Sir! I believe it well.


Davo. (with a nod of approbation) -- You Are wise -- confide.
I can erect, deject, detect, direct,
Correct thee, or protect thee.
AIR.
For I -- am Daemogorgon,
Of Destiny the organ;
By me, the fatal Sisters
(Of weal and woe the twisters)
Their privy council square.
By me, past, present, future,
Fortunes good, bad, or neuter,
To all who trust, declare.

Buff. (Aside, with uplift hands and eyes) RECITATIVE.
Fate's Premier! --
( bowing with reverend dread, and laying his purse at Davo's feet)
[tremulously] Sage Daemogorgon, central point of science!
Deign to accept this offering.

Davo. (with supercilious condescension) Buffalo!
Thy liberality has won our favor.

Buff. (bowing) Wife Sir! -- there is --


Davo. (authoritatively interrupting) Basta! I read thy inmost.
There is -- I know it -- a maid, thy ward, Cephisa,
Whom thou would wed.

Buff (amazed) O heavens!


Davo. (in a significant half whisper) Have forged a will
To bind her thine.

Buff. (in consternation, aside) Nay then, the Devil's his prompter.


Davo. (solemnly) The stars frown on that union -- wed her not.


AIR. DUET. Buff. Not wed her?


Dav. No.


Buff. Not bed her?


Dav. No.
No, no, no, no.

Buff. Why so? why so?


Davo. She has a spell upon her.


Buff. Not she, upon my honor.


Davo. I say, a spell upon her.
I say no spell, 'pon honor.

Buff. I say, a spell upon her.
I say no spell, 'pon honor.

Davo. (angry.) Audacious! such defiance!
Of Stars! of Arts! of Science*

Buff. (piqued) I think my post compliance
Might claim the stars' compliance

Davo. Audacious! etc.
I think my, etc.

Buff. Audacious! etc.
I think my, etc.

Davo. No, no.


Buff. Why so?


Davo. They know full well
She has a spell.

Buff. What spell? pray tell.


Davo. Hear thou the spell;
And mark it well.

Buff. What spell? etc.
Now mark. etc.

Davo What spell? etc.
Now mark. etc.
"The first who tastes her charms,
"Shall perish in her arms."

Buff. Once there, I dread no harms,
These are but false alarms.

Davo. The first who, etc.
Once there, I, etc.

Buff. The first who, etc.
Once there, I, etc.
False, very false alarms.

RECITATIVE. Davo. (as in rage) Rebel! since my 'monitions thou regard'st not,
Demons themselves shall speak to thee. Stand clear!

Waves his wand, and draws a circle on the floor. -- Buffalo spring aside,
trembling INCANTATION. RECITATIVE, accompanied by Magical Music. Davo. Up from
the murky den of night,
Hither Hob nob-gob expedite
Thine instantaneous slight!

Thunder -- a flash, Folatre rises, disguised as a frightful Demon. Fola. I
come -- I come --


Buff. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us!


Fola. List, Buffalo, list, Oh list!
But tremble not, and be your fears dismissed.
AIR. Nay, Buffalo, be not afraid,
By my terrific form dismayed,
Nor scared by my grim feature!
Know, Don, I come, your life to save,
To drag you from the yawning grave,
For I Am a gentle creature.
Me, Buffalo, be sure to prove,
In all the offices of love,
As soft as Southern breezes;
My services can scarce be told,
The fearful lover I make bold,
And warm the heart that freezes.

RECITATIVE. Davo. "'It Is well, a gentle sprite!
"In order, now recite
"The pains, fore doomed to blight
"That woe-worn wight,
"Whom first, by nuptial rite,
"Hymen to fair Cephisa shall unite."

Fola. Within this scroll,
His fate I enroll.

Davo. (taking the scroll, says to Buffalo) Hear then.


AIR. Ere he can snatch one kiss,
In prelude to his bliss,
He will be struck -- Hepatic,
Sciatic;
He will be struck -- Ascetic,
Ph^enetic;
He will be struck -- Athritic,
Pleuritic;
He will be struck -- Leprotic,
Schler^tic;
He will be struck -- Sc^r^utic,
M^rb^tic.
Last -- drop -- beside her bed,
Stone dead -- dead -- dead.
RECITATIVE. Davo. (to Buffalo) Now infidel! st^ll doubt'st thou?


Buff. (venturing to look up, but trembling) Pardon!

Pardon! great sage! I am convinced -- not worlds
Should tempt me wed her.

Davo (importantly) Not first -- no -- not first. (touching him with the wand)
Rise, Don! now list the words of inspiration.
In Mars they are charactered.

Gazing, and pointing. Buff. (raising himself on his knees, with up-lighted
hands) Read them, great sage.


Davo. Thus they -- "Thou have one mortal "foe -- a count;
"He loves the maid -- thou hat'st him."

Buff. aside, more astonished) Intuition!

Davo. "Instant consent -- He wed her; so he "dies;
"So is she freed, and so the spell dissolves."

AIR. Fola. Who first ascends her bed,
His bliss shall be his bane;
He Will find the marriage bed
A couch for death and pain.
But the second, Oh Heaven! the second,
The happiest of men shall be reckoned;
The second blessed spouse she is decreed to,
Shall find her a virgin and widow.

disappears RECITATIVE. Buff. (bouncing up in transport) Thanks, thanks, kind
Doemogorgon! -- Yes, I do;
I do consent.

Davo waves his wand, a roll of parchment falls from above: he takes it upand
unrolls it. Davo. (presenting it to Buffalo) A deed in form! -- down darted
From Mars's orbit -- sign thou this.

Buff. (eargerly) With joy.
There sage! it is signed. (delivers it) Folatre be the first,
And Buffalo, the happy second spouse!
AIR.
In terror, fear and sadness,
Apoplexy, palsy, madness,
His marriage he shall cue,
The fates his promised joys shall blight;
Furies the nuptial torch shall light;
And on the bed, where Cupids play,
Black imps a winding sheet shall lay,
And give the devil his due.
II.
And then, the pride of story,
Rapture tasting, snatching glory,
Her charms shall I possess:
The loves and graces shall attend,
Venus her hero shall befriend;
Each flying hour on purple wing,
New joy, new revelry, shall bring,
And all conspire to bless

After the Air, Matilda, Cephisa, and Folatre, in his own habit, come from
behind the skreen. RECITATIVE. Matil. Yes, Don, we'll witness to your deed and
bliss;
When the Count dies, you're sure of Cephisa.

A general laugh. Buff. (staring round in vexation and shame) Confusion!
Gulled!

Fola (slouchingly) But an April masque -- I played the Demon!


Davo. (bowing ludicrously) The conj'ror I, sage Davo, at your service.


Buffalo hangs down his head; then, in desperation, runs with his drawn sword
at Davo. Buff. This pay thy wages, cheat!


Davo. (presenting a pocket pistol) This pay my thanks!


Buff. (on his knees) Mercy! oh mercy!


Flings away his sword. Matil. (with contemptuous indignation) Foh! you baited
bull!
This day is Folly's festival -- You, Signior,
Though not the only one, perhaps the chief
Of our examples -- from our plot amend!

AIR. QUINTETTO. Matil. Now you're pinned to the stake,
What a figure you make!

Davo. Nay, leave me to deal with our sir there.


Buff. (aside) I tremble, I quake.


Ceph. (ironically, to Davo) Hold, hold, for my sake!
My sweet second spouse would you murder?

Fola. (scornfully) On a reptile so weak,
What revenge can one take?

Buff. (to all, plaintively) Ye have humbled me -- what would ye further?

Matil. Now you're, etc
Nay, leave, etc
I tremble, etc
Hold, hold, etc
On a, etc

Davo. Now you're, etc
Nay, leave, etc
I tremble, etc
Hold, hold, etc
On a, etc

Buff. Now you're, etc

I tremble, etc

(embracing Davo) Thanks kind Davo!

Davo. (with a ludicrous bow) Sir! your Schiavo!


Matil. (applauding) Bravo! bravo!


Buff. (again embracing Davo) Generous Davo!


Ceph. Bravo! bravo!


Matil. Bravo! bravo!
