A POEM. Humbly Presented TO His most Sacred Majesty GEORGE, King of GREAT
BRITAIN, FRANCE, and IRELAND. UPON His Accession to the THRONE. By SUSANNA
CENTLIVRE.

LONDON: Printed for T. Woodward at the Inner Temple Gate, Fleetstreet, 1715.

A POEM. Humbly Presented to His most Sacred Majesty
THE LARK, while she her Gratitude to prove,
Lauds with her sprightly Notes, immortal Jov
Shuts not his Ear against the SPARROWS Lays;
Whose tuneless Pipe can only chirp his Praise.
Thus I, though Learned Bards before have strung
Their sounding Lyres, and most divinely Sung,
Fear not the Dictates of my Soul to own;
The less of Art, the more of Love is shown:
Vouchsafe, Great Prince, to hear my humble Muse,
And let my Zeal my Want of Skill excuse.
HAIL! Hero born to rule, and reconcile
The fatal Discords of our English Isle!
Our pure Religion, long the Mark of Rome,
Reprieved by YOU Escapes her final Doom.
Innumber'd Joys YOU to Britannia bring,
And lo Paeans through the Nation ring.
Delightful Liberty, with Fears half dead,
Hears the glad Noise, and rears her pleasing Head;
Her slackened Nerves their former Strength regain,
And she her Life redates from GEORGE's Reign.
SO Cruel Faction tore Rome's ancient State,
And all her Glories seemed the Sport of Fate;
When by Adoption Trajan took the Reins,
And checked his People's Heats, and quenched the Flames;
Enlarged her Bounds to distant India's Shore,
And taught her Drooping Eagles how to soar.
YOU Sir, like him, the British Throne ascend;
May equal Victories your Reign attend.
When round the Continent the Trump of Fame
Did Britain's Glory in your Right proclaim,
Tyrannick Monarchs, as with Thunder scared,
Sent up their Prayers impending Fates to ward;
Whilst BELGIA's LION braved his threatened Chain,
Rolled his Glad Eyes, and stretched his Paws again.
BY your famed Justice, and your prudent Sway,
France shall be taught to Love, or to Obey;
Whilst YOU the Right of Liberty assert,
And all the Ills of broken Faith avert;
To Barcelona may Your Succors fly,
Before her Champions 'midst her Ruins dye.
PROPHETIC Sages had this Day in View,
And named our PATRON as a Type of You:
So Men to Oracles had once Regard,
'Till the Great Savior of the World appeared.
THE swelling Waves, which often heretofore
Our yet loved King, the Glorious WILLIAM, bore,
Proud in conveying his Adopted Son,
Part with Regret, and murmur as they run.
WELCOME great Guardian of our British Land;
Receive the Nation rescued by thy Hand.
A wicked Race of Men, for private Ends,
Had raised her baffled Foes, and sunk her Friends,
Dispersed her Strength, and Royal ANN betrayed
Whilst in the Sunshine of her Smiles they played;
The Ruin rolled too fast for her to stem,
Whose greatest Weakness was her Choice of Them:
When Heaven, in Pity to those suppliant Few,
Who owned its Power, and kept their Vows to YOU,
Came to our Aid, reversed our lowering Fate,
And by thy destined ARM retrieved the State.
HAIL great Deliverer, much loved MONARCH Hail!
No more shall France, no more shall Rome prevail:
By Heavens Decree, YOU and your Issue stand
Sure Signs of future Safety to this Land.
So when the Almighty caused the Floods to cease,
He fixed his Bow in Token of the Peace.
I am with the profoundest Respect, Your Majesty's Most Dutiful and Most
Devoted Subject, Susanna Centlivre.

FINIS.
