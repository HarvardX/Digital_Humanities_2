PROLOGUE,
Written by Mr. GARRICK, and spoken by him in the Character of a Country Boy.
Measter! Measter!

IS not my Measter here among you, pray?
Nay, speak -- my Measter wrote this fine new Play --
The Actor-Folks are making such a Clatter!
They want the Pro-log -- I know naught of the Matter!
He must be there among you -- look about --
A Weezen, pale-faced Man, do -- find him out --
Pray, Measter, come -- or all will fall to Sheame
Call Mister -- hold -- I must not tell his Name.
Law! what a Crowd is here! what Noise and Pother!
Fine Lads and Lasses! one of top o't'other.
[Pointing to the Rows of Pit and Gallery.] I could for ever here with Wonder
geaze!
I never saw Church so full in all my Days! --
Your Servunt, Surs! -- what do you laugh for? Eh!
You donna take me sure for one of the Play?
You should not flout an honest Country-Lad, --
You think me fool, and I think you half mad:
You're all as strange as I, and stranger too,
And, if you laugh at me, I Will laugh at you.
[Laughing. I donna like your London Tricks, not I,
And since you have raised my Blood, I Will tell you why?
And if you wull, since now I am before ye,
For want of Pro-log, I Will relate my Story.
I came from Country here to try my Fate,
And get a Place among the Rich and Great;
But troth I Am sick of the Journey I have taken,
I like it not -- would I were whoame again.
First, in the City I took up my Station,
And got a Place with one of the Corporation,
A round big Man -- he eat a plagy deal,
Zooks! he would have beat five P^oomen at a Meal!
But long with him I could not make abode,
For, could you think it? -- He eat a great Sea-Toad!
It came from Indies -- 'twas as big as me,
He called it Belly-patch, and Capapce:
Law! how I star'd! -- I thought, -- who knows, but I,
For want of Monsters, may be made a Pie;
Rather than tarry here for Bribe or Gain,
I Will back to whoame, and Country-Farc again.
I left Toad-eater; then I sarv'd a Lord,
And there they promised! -- but never kept their Word.
While among the Great, this Geaming Work the Trade is,
They mind no more poor Servants, than their Ladies.
A Lady next, who liked a smart young Lad,
Hired me forthwith -- but, troth, I thought her mad.
She turned the World top down, as I may say,
She changed the Day to Neet, the Neet to Day!
I was so sheam'd with all her freakish Ways,
She wore her Gear so short, so low her Stays --
Fine Folks show all for Nothing Nowadays!
Now I Am the Poet's Man -- I find with Wits,
There Is Nothing sartain -- Nay, we eat by Fits.
Our Meals, indeed, are slender, -- what of that?
There are but three on's -- Measter, I, and Cat.
Did you but see us all, as I Am a Sinner,
You Would searcely say, which of the three is thinner.
My Wages all depend on this Night's Piece,
But should you find that all our Swans are Geese!
E'feck I Will trust no more to Measter's Brain,
But pack up all, and whistle whoame again.
EPILOGUE,
Written by Mr. GARRICK.
Spoken by Mr. WOODWARD in the Character of a fine Gentleman. Enter. --
speaking without. PSHAW! -- damn your Epilogue -- and hold your Tongue --
Shall we of Rank be told what is right and wrong?
Had you ten Epilogues you should not speak 'em,
Though he had writ 'em all in Linguum Grecum.
I Will do it by all the Gods! -- (you must excuse me)
Though Author, Actors, Audience, all abuse me!
To the Audience. Behold a Gentleman! -- and that is enough! --
Laugh if you please -- I Will take a Pinch of Snuff!
I come to tell you -- (let it not surprise you)
That I Am a Wit -- and worthy to advise you. --
How could you suffer that same Country Booby,
That Pro-logue speaking Savage, -- that great Looby,
To talk his Nonsense? -- give me Leave to say
'Twas low -- damned low! -- but save the Fellow's Play --
Let the poor Devil eat, -- allow him that,
And give a Meal to Measter, Mon, and Cat,
But why attack the Fashions? -- Senseless Rogue! --
We have no Joys but what result from Vogue:
The Mode should all Control -- nay, every Passion,
Sense, Appetite, and all, give way to Fashion;
I hate as much as he, a Turtle-Feast,
But 'till the present Turtle-Rage has ceased,
I Would ride a hundred Miles to make myself a Beast.
I have no Ears, -- yet Op'ras I adore! --
Always prepared to die -- to sleep -- no more!
The Ladies too were carp'd at, and their Dress,
He wants 'em all ruff'd up like good Queen Bess!
They are, forsooth, too much exposed, and free --
Were more exposed, no ill Effects I see,
For more, or less, it is all the same to me.
Poor Gaming too, was mauld among the rest,
That precious Cordial to a high-life Breast!
When Thoughts arise I always game, or drink,
An English Gentleman should never think --
The Reason's plain, which every Soul might hit on --
What trims a Frenchman, oversets a Briton;
In us Reflection breeds a sober Sadness,
Which always ends in Politics or Madness:
I therefore now propose -- by your Command,
That Tragedies no more shall cloud this Land;
Send over your Shakespears to the Sons of France,
Let them grow grave -- Let us begin to dance!
Banish your gloomy Scenes to foreign Climes,
Reserve alone to bless these golden Times,
A Farce or two -- and Woodward's Pantomimes!
The Author of the Prologue and Epilogue, would not have published them had it
not been customary to print them with the Play. He is very sensible that they
can have little or no Merit in the Reading, their Effect wholly depending upon
the Characters which speak them, and the Novelty of introducing them. They were
likewise written at a very short Warning, for the Author of the Play, had not
provided these usual, and therefore necessary, Parts of the Performance, which
Mr. GARRICK thought proper to provide at all Events.

ADVERTISEMENT.
"TRAGEDY, as it was anciently composed, has been ever held the gravest,
moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems. Hence Philosophers, and other
gravest Writers, as, Cicero, Plutarch, and others, frequently cite out of
Tragic Poets, both to adorn and illustrate their Discourse The Apostle Paul
himself, thought it not unworthy to insert a Verse of a Greek Poet into the
Text of Holy Scripture. -- Heretofore, Men in highest Dignity have labored,
not a little, to be thought able to compose a Tragedy. Of that Honor Dionysius
the Elder, was no less ambitious, than before, of his attaining to the Tyranny.
Augustus Caesar also had begun his Ajax, but unable to please his own Judgment,
left it unfinished. Sencca the Philosopher, is by some thought the Author of
those Tragedies, at least the best of them that go under that Name. Gregory
Nazianzen, a Father of the Church, thought it not unbeseeming the Sanctity of
his Person to write a Tragedy, which is entitled, Christ Suffering. This is
mentioned, to vindicate Tragedy from the small Esteem, or rather Infamy, which
in the Account of many, it undergoes at this Day,"

So sar the great Milton: who strengthened these Examples by his own. The
Author has nothing more to add, save only, that he has aimed to write this
Piece, in its essential Parts, according to the Model of ancient Tragedy, so
far as modern Ideas and Manners would permit. And he is so gratefully senssble
of that favorable Reception it has met with from the Public, that in every
future Attempt, he will assuredly labor to merit their farther Regarcs, by
keeping in his Eye the same great Originals.

BARBAROSSA.
ACT 1.
Enter OTHMAN and a SLAVE. OTHMAN. A Stranger, say thou, that inquires of
OTHMAN?

SLAVE. He does; and waits Admittance.

OTHMAN. Did he tell
His Name and Quality?

SLAVE. That, he declined:
But called himself thy Friend.

OTHMAN. Where did thou see him?

SLAVE. Even now, while Twilight closed the Day, I spied him
Musing amid' the Ruins of yon Tower
That overhangs the Flood. On my Approach,
With Aspect stern, and Words of Import dark,
He questioned me of OTHMAN. Then the Tear
Stole from his Eye. But when I talked of Power
And courtly Honors here conferred on thee,
His Frown grew darker: All I wished, he cried,
Is to confer with him, and then to die.

OTHMAN. What may this mean? -- Conduct the Stranger to me.
[Exit Slave. Perhaps some worthy Citizen, returned
From voluntary Exile to ALGIERS,
Once known in happier Days.
Enter SADI. Ah, SADI here!
My honored Friend!

SADI. Stand off -- pollute me not.
These honest Arms, though worn with Want, disdain
Thy gorgeous Trappings, earned by foul Dishonor.

OTHMAN. Forbear thy rash Reproaches: for beneath
This Habit, which to thy mistaken Eye
Bespeaks my Guilt, I wear a Heart as true
As SADI's to my King.

SADI. Why then beneath
This cursed Roof, this black Usurper's Palace,
Dare thou to draw infected Air, and live
The Slave of Insolence! Why lick the Dust
Beneath his Feet, who laid ALGIERS in Ruin?
But Age, which should have taught thee honest Caution,
Has taught thee Treachery!

OTHMAM. Mistaken Man!
Could Passion prompt me to licentious Speech
Like thine --

SADI. Peace, false one! Peace! The Slave to Power
Still wears a pliant Tongue. -- O Shame to dwell
With Murder, Lust, and Rapine! -- Did he not
Come from the Depths of BARCA's Solitude,
With fair Pretense of Faith and firm Alliance?
Did not our grateful King, with open Arms,
Receive him as his Guest? O fatal Hour!
Did he not then with hot, adult'rous Eye,
Gaze on the Queen ZAPHIRA? Yes, 'twas Lust,
Lust gave the infernal Whisper to his Soul,
And bade him Murder, if he would enjoy!
O, complicated Horrors! hell-born Treach'ry!
Then fell our Country, when good SELIM died!
Yet thou, pernicious Traitor, unabash'd
Can wear the Murd'rer's Badge.

OTHMAN. Yet hear me, SADI --

SADI. What can Dishonor plead?

OTHMAN. Yet blame not Prudence.

SADI. Prudence! the stale Pretense of every Knave!
The Traitor's ready Mask!

OTHMAN. Yet still I love thee:
Yet unprovoked by thy intemperate Zeal.
Bethink thee! -- might I not insult thy Flight
With the Foul Names of Fear or Perfidy?
Did thou not fly, when BARBAROSSA's Sword
Reek'd with the Blood of thy brave Countrymen?
What then did I? -- Beneath this hated Roof,
In Pity to my widowed Queen --

SADI. In Pity?

OTHMAN. Yes, SADI: Heaven is Witness, Pity swayed me.

SADI. Words, Words! Dissimulation all, and Guilt!

OTHMAN. With honest Guile I did inroll my Name
In the black List of BARBAROSSA's Friends:
In hope, that some propitious Hour might rise,
When Heaven would dash the Murderer from his Throne,
And give young SELIM to his orphan'd People.

SADI. Indeed! can thou be true?

OTHMAN. By Heaven, I am.

SADI. Why then dissemble thus?

OTHMAN. Have I not told thee?
I held it vain, to stem the Tyrant's Power
By the weak Sallies of an ill-timed Rage.

SADI. Enough: I find thee honest: And with Pride
Will join thy Councils. This, my faithful Arm,
Wasted with Misery, shall gain new Nerves
For brave Resolves. Can aught, my Friend, be done?
Can aught be dared?

OTHMAN. We groan beneath the Scourge.
This very Morn, on false Pretense of Vengeance,
For the foul Murder of our honored King,
Five guiltless Wretches perished on the Rack.
Our long-lov'd Friends, and bravest Citizens,
Self-banish'd to the Desert, mourn in Exile:
While the fell Tyrant lords it over a Crew
Of abject Sycophants, the needy Tools
Of Power usurped; and a degenerate Train
Of Slaves in Arms.

SADI. O my devoted Country! --
But say, the widowed Queen -- my Heart bleeds for her.

OTHMAN. If Pain be Life, she lives: But in such Woe,
As Want and Slavery might view with Pity,
And bless their happier Lot! Hemmed round by Terrors,
Within this cruel Palace, once the Seat
Of every Joy, through sev'n long tedious Years,
She weeps her murdered Lord, her exiled Son,
Her People fallen: the Murderer of her Lord,
Returning now from Conquest over the MOORS,
Tempts her to Marriage; spurred at once by Lust,
And black Ambition. But with noble Firmness,
Surpassing the female, she rejects his Vows,
Scorning the horrid Union. Meantime he,
With ceaseless Hate, pursues her exiled Son;
And -- Oh! detested Monster!
[He weeps.
SADI. Yet more Deeds
Of Cruelty! Just Heaven!

OTHMAN. His Rage pursues
The virtuous Youth, even into foreign Climes.
Ere this, perhaps, he bleeds. A murdering Ruffian
Is sent to watch his Steps, and plunge the Dagger
Into his guiltless Breast.

SADI. Is this thy Faith!
Tamely to witness to such Deeds of Horror!
Give me thy Poignard; lead me to the Tyrant.
What though surrounding Guards --

OTHMAN. Repress thy Fury.
Thou will alarm the Palace, wilt involve
Thyself, thy Friend, in Ruin. Haste thee hence;
Haste to the Remnant of our loyal Friends,
And let maturer Councils rule thy Zeal.

SADI. Yet let us never forget our Prince's Wrongs.
Remember, OTHMAN, (and let Vengeance rise)
How in the Pangs of Death, and in his Gore
Welt'ring, we found our Prince! The deadly Dagger
Deep in his Heart was fixed! His royal Blood,
The Lifeblood of his People, over the Bath
Ran purple! O remember! and revenge!

OTHMAN. Doubt not my Zeal. But haste and seek our Friends.
Near to the western Port ALMANZOR dwells,
Yet unseduc'd by BARBAROSSA's Power.
He will disclose to thee, if aught be heard
Of SELIM's Safety, or (what more I dread)
Of SELIM's Death. Thence best may our Resolves
Be drawn hereafter. But let Caution guide thee.
For in these Walks, where Tyranny and Guilt
Usurp the Throne, wakeful Suspicion dwells,
And squint-eyed Jealousy, prone to pervert
Even Looks and Smiles to Treason.

SADI. I obey thee.
Near to the western Port, thou say.

OTHMAN. Even there.
Close by the blasted Palm Tree, where the Mosque
O'erlooks the City. Haste thee hence, my Friend.
I would not have thee found within these Walls.
[Flourish. And hark -- these warlike Sounds proclaim the Approach
Of the proud BARBAROSSA, with his Train.
Begone --

SADI. May dire Disease and Pestilence
Hang over his Steps! -- Farewell -- Remember, OTHMAN,
Thy Queen's, thy Prince's, and thy Country's Wrongs.

[Exit SADI. OTHMAN. When I forget them, be Contempt my Lot!
Yet, for the Love I bear them, I must wrap
My deep Resentments in the specious Guise
Of Smiles, and fair Deportment.

Enter BARBAROSSA, Guards, etc. BARBAROSSA. Valiant OTHMAN,
Are these vile Slaves impaled?

OTHMAN. My Lord, they are.

BARBAROSSA. Did not the Rack extort Confession from them?

OTHMAN. They died obdurate: while the melting Crowd
Murmured out Pity for their Groans and Anguish.

BARBAROSSA. Curse on their womanish Hearts! what, pity Slaves
Whom my supreme Decree condemned to Torture?
Are you not all my Slaves, to whom my Nod
Gives Life or Death?

OTHMAN. To doubt thy Will, is Treason.

BARBAROSSA. I love thee, faithful OTHMAN: But why sits
That Sadness on thy Brow? For often I find thee
Musing and sad; while Joy for my Return,
My Sword victorious, and the MOOR to'erthrown,
Resounds through all my Palace.

OTHMAN. Mighty Warrior!
The Soul, intent on Offices of Love,
Will often neglect, or scorn the weaker Proof
Which Smiles or Speech can give.

BARBAROSSA. Well: Be it so.
To guard ALGIERS from Anarchy's Misrule,
I sway the regal Scepter. Who deserves,
Shall meet Protection: And who merits not,
Shall meet my Wrath in Thunder. -- But it is strange,
That when with open Arms, I would receive
Young SELIM; would restore the Crown, which Death
Reft from his Father's Head. -- He scorns my Bounty;
Shuns me with sullen and obdurate Hate,
And proudly kindles War in foreign Climes,
Against my Power, who saved his bleeding Country.

OTHMAN. It Is strange indeed --

Enter ALADIN. ALADIN. Brave Prince, I bring thee Tidings
Of high Concernment to ALGIERS and Thee.
Young SELIM is no more.

OTHMAN. Indeed!

BARBAROSSA. Indeed! -- why that Astonishment?
He was our bitterest Foe.

OTHMAN. So perish all
Thy causeless Enemies!

BARBAROSSA. What says the Rumor?
How died the Prince, and where?

ALADIN. The Rumor tells,
That flying to ORAN, he there begged Succors
From FERDINAND of SPAIN, t'invade ALGIERS.

BARBAROSSA. From Christian Dogs!

OTHMAN. How! league with Infidels!

ALADIN. And there held Council with the haughty SPANIARD,
To conquer and dethrone thee: But in vain:
For in a dark Encounter with two Slaves,
Wherein the one fell by his dauntless Valor,
SELIM at length was slain.

BARBAROSSA. Ungrateful Boy!
Often have I courted him to meet my Kindness;
But still in vain: he shunned me like a Pestilence:
Nor could I ever behold him, since the Down
Covered his manly Cheek. -- How many Years
Numbered he?

OTHMAN. I think, scarce thirteen, when his Father died,
And now, some twenty.

BARBAROSSA. OTHMAN, now for Proof
Of undissembled Service. -- Well I know,
Thy long-experienc'd Faith has placed thee high
In the Queen's Confidence: The Crown I wear
Yet totters on my Head, till Marriage-Rites
Have made her mine. OTHMAN, she must be won.
Plead thou my Cause of Love: Bid her dry up
Her fruitless Tears: Paint forth her long Delays,
Wake all thy Eloquence: Make her but mine,
And such unsought Reward shall crown thy Zeal,
As shall out-soar thy Wishes.

OTHMAN. Mighty King,
Where Duty bids, I go.

BARBAROSSA. Then haste thee, OTHMAN,
Ere yet the Rumor of her Son's Decease
Has reached her Ear; ere yet the mournful Tale
Has whelmed her in a new Abyss of Woe,
And quenched all soft Affection, save for him.
Tell her, I come, borne on the Wings of Love! --
Haste -- fly -- I follow thee.
[Exit OTHMAN. Now ALADIN.
Now Fortune bears us to the wished for Port:
We ride secure, on her most prosperous Billow.
This was the Rock I dreaded. Do not think
The Attempt was greatly daring?

ALADIN. Ay; and necessary.
What booted it, to cut the old Serpent off,
While the young Adder nested in his Place?

BARBAROSSA. True: We have conquered now. ALGIERS is mine,
Without a Rival. Thus great Souls aspire;
And boldly snatch at Crowns, beyond the Reach
Of coward Conscience. -- Yet I wonder much,
OMAR returns not: OMAR, whom I sent
On this high Trust. I fear, it is he has fallen.
Did thou not say, two Slaves encountered SELIM?

ALADIN. Ay, two: it is rumored so.

BARBAROSSA. And that one fell?

ALADIN. Even so: By SELIM's Hand: while his Companion
Planted his happier Steel in SELIM's Heart.

BARBAROSSA. OMAR, I fear, is fallen. From my Right Hand
I gave my Signet to the trusty Slave:
And bade him send it, as the certain Pledge
Of SELIM's Death; if Sickness or Captivity,
Or wayward Fate, should thwart his quick Return.

ALADIN. The Rumor yet is young; perhaps foreruns
The trusty Slave's Approach.

BARBAROSSA. We'll wait the Event.
Meantime give out, that now the widowed Queen
Has dried her Tears, prepared to crown my Love
By Marriage-Rites: Spread wide the flattering Tale:
For if Persuasion win not her Consent,
Power shall compel.

ALADIN. It is indeed a Thought,
Which Prudence whispers.

BARBAROSSA. Thou, brave ALADIN,
Have been the firm Companion of my Deeds:
Soon shall my Friendship's Warmth reward thy Faith. --
This Night my Will devotes to Feast and Joy,
For Conquest over the MOOR. Hence, ALADIN:
And see the Night-Watch close the Palace round.
[Exit ALADIN. Now to the Queen. My Heart expands with Hope.
Let high Ambition flourish: In SELIM's Blood
Its Root is struck: From this, the rising Stem
Proudly shall branch over AFRIC's Continent,
And stretch from Shore to Shore.
Enter IRENE. What, drowned in Tears? still with thy Folly thwart
Each purpose of my Soul? When Pleasures spring
Beneath our Feet, thou spurn'st the proffered Boon,
To dwell with Sorrow. -- Why these sullen Tears?

IRENE. Let not these Tears offend my Father's Eye:
They are the Tears of Pity. From the Queen
I come, thy Suppliant.

BARBAROSSA. On some rude Request.
What would thou urge?

IRENE. Thy dread Return from War,
And proffered Love, have opened every Wound
The soft and lenient Hand of Time had closed.
If ever gentle Pity touched thy Heart,
Now let it melt! Urge not thy harsh Command
To see her! Her distracted Soul is bent
To mourn in Solitude. She asks no more.

BARBAROSSA. She mocks my Love. How many tedious Years
Have I endured her Coyness? Had not War,
And great Ambition, called me from ALGIERS,
Ere this, my Power had reaped what she denies.
But there is a Cause, which touches on my Peace,
And bids me brook no more her false Delays.

IRENE. O frown not thus! Sure, Pity never deserved
A Parent's Frown! Then look more kindly on me.
Let thy consenting Pity mix with mine,
And heal the Woes of weeping Majesty!
Unhappy Queen!

BARBAROSSA. What means that gushing Tear?

IRENE. Oh never shall IRENE taste of Peace,
While poor ZAPHIRA mourns! --

BARBAROSSA. Is this my Child?
Perverse and stubborn! -- As thou love thy Peace,
Dry up thy Tears. What! damp the general Triumph,
That echoes through ALGIERS! which now shall pierce
The vaulted Heaven, as soon as Fame shall spread
Young SELIM's Death, my Empire's bitterest Foe.

IRENE. O generous SELIM!

BARBAROSSA. Ah! There Is more in this!
Tell me, IRENE: On thy Duty, tell me:
As thou do wish, I would not cast thee off,
With an incensed Father's Curses on thee,
Now tell me why, at this detested Name,
Afresh thy Sorrow streams?

IRENE. Yes, I will tell thee.
For he is gone! and dreads thy Hate no more!
My Father knows, that scarce five Moons are past,
Since the MOORS seized, and sold me at ORAN,
A hopeless Captive in a foreign Clime!

BARBAROSSA. Too well I know, and rue the fatal Day.
But what of this?

IRENE. Why should I tell, what Horrors
Did then beset my Soul? -- Often have I told thee,
How 'midst the Throng, a Youth appeared: His Eye
Bright as the Morning Star!

BARBAROSSA. And was it SELIM?
Did he redeem thee?

IRENE. With unsparing Hand
He paid the allotted Ransom: And o'crbade
Avarice and Appetite. At his Feet I wept,
Dissolved in Tears of Gratitude and Joy.
But when I told my Quality and Birth,
He started at the Name of BARBAROSSA;
And thrice turned pale. Yet, with Recovery mild,
Go to ALGIERS, he cried; protect my Mother,
And be to Her, what SELIM is to Thee. --
Even such, my Father, was the generous Youth,
Who, by the Hands of bloody, bloody Men,
Lies numbered with the dead.

BARBAROSSA. Amazement chills me!
Was this thy unknown Friend, concealed from me?
False, faithless Child!

IRENE. Could Gratitude do less!
He said thy Hate pursued him; thence conjured me,
Not to reveal his Name.

BARBAROSSA. Thou treacherous Maid!
To stoop to Freedom from thy Father's Foe!

IRENE. Alas, my Father!
He never was thy Foe.

BARBAROSSA. What! -- plead for SELIM!
Away. He merited the Death he found.
Oh Coward! Traitress to thy Father's Glory!
Thou should have lived a Slave, -- been sold to Shame,
Been banished to the Depth of howling Deserts,
Been aught but what thou art, rather than blot
A Father's Honor, by a Deed so vile: --
Hence, from my Sight. -- Hence, thou unthankful Child!
Beware thee! Shun the Queen: nor taint her Ear
With SELIM's Fate. Yes, she shall crown my Love;
Or by our Prophet, she shall dread my Power.

[Exit BARBAROSSA. IRENE. Unhappy Queen!
To what new Scenes of Horror art thou doomed!
O cruel Father! Hapless Child! whom Pity
Compels to call him cruel! -- Generous SELIM!
Poor injured Queen! who but entreats to die
In her dear Father's Tents! Thither, good Queen,
My Care shall speed thee, while Suspicion sleeps.
What though my frowning Father pour his Rage
On my defenseless Head? Yet Innocence
Shall yield her firm Support; and conscious Virtue
Gild all my Days. Could I but save ZAPHIRA,
Let the Storm beat. I Will weep and pray, till she
And Heaven forget, my Father ever was cruel.

ACT II.
ZAPHIRA and female Slaves discovered. ZAPHIRA. WHEN shall I be at Peace! -- O,
righteous Heaven,
Strengthen my fainting Soul, which fain would rise
To Confidence in thee! -- But Woes on Woes
Overwhelm me! First my Husband! now, my Son!
Both dead! both slaughtered by the bloody Hand
Of BARBAROSSA! Sweet Content, farewell!
Farewell, sweet Hope! Grief is my Portion here!
O dire Ambition! what infernal Power
Unchain'd thee from thy native Depth of Hell,
To stalk the Earth with thy destructive Train,
Murder and Lust! to waste domestic Peace,
And every Heartfelt Joy!
Enter OTHMAN. O faithful OTHMAN!
Our Fears were true! My SELIM is no more!

OTHMAN. Has then the fatal Story reached thine Ear?
Inhuman Tyrant!

ZAPHIRA. Strike him, Heaven with Thunder!
Nor let ZAPHIRA doubt thy Providence.

OTHMAN. 'Twas what we feared. Accuse not Heaven's high Will,
Nor struggle with the ten-fold Chain of Fate,
That links thee to thy Woes! O, rather yield,
And wait the happier Hour, when Innocence
Shall weep no more. Rest in that pleasing Hope,
And yield thyself to Heaven. -- My honored Queen,
The King --

ZAPHIRA. Whom stil'st thou King?

OTHMAN. It Is BARBAROSSA.
He means to see thee --

ZAPHIRA. Curses blast the Tyrant!
Does he assume the Name of King?

OTHMAN. He does.

ZAPHIRA. O Title vilely purchased! by the Blood
Of Innocence! By Treachr'y and Murder!
May Heaven incensed pour down its Vengeance on him;
Blast all his Joys, and turn them into Horror;
Till Phrenzy rise, and bid him curse the Hour
That gave his Crimes their Birth! My faithful OTHMAN,
My sole surviving Prop! Can thou devise
No secret Means, by which I may escape
This hated Palace! with undaunted Step
I Would roam the Waste, to reach my Father's Vales
Of dear MUTIJA! -- Can no means be found,
To fly these black'ning Horrors that surround me?

OTHMAN. That Hope is vain! The Tyrant knows thy Hate.
Hence, Day and Night, his watchful Guards surround thee,
Impenetrable as Walls of Adamant.
Curb then thy mighty Griefs: Justice and Truth
He mocks as Shadows: Rouse not then, his Anger:
Let soft Persuasion and mild Eloquence,
Redeem that Liberty, which stern Rebuke
Would rob thee of for ever.

ZAPHIRA. Cruel Task!
For Royalty to bow, -- an injured Queen
To kneel for Liberty! And, Oh! to whom!
Even to the Murderer of her Lord and Son!
O perish first, ZAPHIRA! Yes, I Will die!
For what is Life to me! My dear, dear Lord!
My hapless Child! Yes, I will follow you.

OTHMAN. Will thou not see him, then?

ZAPHIRA. I will not, OTHMAN.
Or if I do, with bitter Imprecation,
More keen than Poison shot from Serpents Tongues,
I Will pour my Curses on him!

OTHMAN. Will ZAPHIRA
Thus meanly sink in Woman's fruitless Rage,
When she should wake Revenge?

ZAPHIRA. Revenge? -- O tell me --
Tell me but how! what can a helpless Woman!

OTHMAN. Gain but the Tyrant's leave, and reach thy Father:
Pour thy Complaints before him: Let thy Wrongs
Kindle his Indignation, to pursue
This vil e Usurper, till unceasing War
Blast his ill-gotten Power.

ZAPHIRA. [Rising. Ah! -- say thou, OTHMAN?
Thy Words have shot like Lightning through my Frame;
And all my Soul's on Fire! -- Thou faithful Friend!
Yes; with more gentle Speech I Will sooth his Pride;
Regain my Freedom; seek my Father's Tents;
There paint my countless Woes. His kindling Rage
Shall wake the Valleys into honest Vengeance:
The sudden Storm shall pour on BARBAROSSA;
And every glowing Warrior steep his Shaft
In deadlier Poison, to revenge my Wrongs.

OTHMAN. There spoke the Queen. But as thou love thy Freedom,
Touch not on SELIM's Fate. Thy Soul will kindle,
And Passion mount in Flames that will consume thee.

ZAPHIRA. My murdered Son! yes, to revenge thy Death,
I Will speak a Language which my Heart disdains.

OTHMAN. Peace, Peace! The Tyrant comes: Now, injured Queen,
Plead for thy Freedom, hope for just Revenge,
And check each rising Passion!

[Exit OTHMAN. Enter BARBAROSSA. BARBAROSSA. Hail, sovereign Fair! Thrice
honored Queen! in whom
Beauty and Majesty conspire to charm!
Behold the Conqu'ror, whose deciding Voice
Can speak the Fate of Kingdoms, at thy Feet
Lies conquered by thy Power!

ZAPHIRA. O BARBAROSSA!
No more the Pride of Conquest ever can charm
My widowed Heart! With my departed Lord
My Love lies buried! I should meet thy Flame
With sullen Tears, and cold Indifference.
Then turn thee to some happier Fair, whose Heart
May crown thy growing Love, with Love sincere;
For I have none to give!

BARBAROSSA. Love never should die:
It Is the Soul's Cordial: It Is the Fount of Life;
Therefore should spring eternal in the Breast.
One Object lost, another should succeed.
And all our Life be Love.

ZAPHIRA. Urge me no more: -- Thou might with equal Hope
Woo the cold Marble weeping over a Tomb,
To meet thy Wishes! But if generous Love
Dwell in thy Breast, vouchsafe me Proof sincere:
Give me safe Convoy to my native Vales
Of dear MUTIJA, where my Father reigns.

BARBAROSSA. O blind to proffered Bliss! what, fondly quit
This lofty Palace, and the envied Pomp
Of Empire, for an Arab's wandering Tent!
Where the mock Chieftain leads his vagrant Tribes
From Plain to Plain, as Thirst or Famine sways;
Obscurely vain; and faintly shadows out
The Majesty of Kings! -- Far other Joys
Here shall attend thy Call: The winged Bark
For thee shall traverse Seas; and every Clime
Be tributary to ZAPHIRA's Charms.
To Thee, exalted Fair, submissive Realms
Shall bow the Neck; and swarthy Kings and Queens,
From the far-distant NIGER and the NILE,
Drawn captive at my conquering Charriot-Wheels,
Shall kneel before thee.

ZAPHIRA. Pomp and Power are Toys,
Which even the Mind at ease may well disdain.
But, ah! what Mockery is the tinsel Pride
Of Splendour, when by wasting Woes, the Mind
Lies desolate within! -- Such, such, is mine!
Overwhelmed with Ills, and dead to every Joy
Envy me not this last Request, to die
In my dear Father's Tents!

BARBAROSSA. Thy Suit is vain --

ZAPHIRA. Thus kneeling, at thy Feet --!

BARBAROSSA. Thou thankless Fair!
Thus to repay the Labors of my Love!
Had I not siez'd the Throne when SELIM died,
Ere this, thy Foes had laid ALGIERS in Ruin:
I checked the warring Powers, and gave you Peace.

ZAPHIRA. Peace do thou call it! what can worse be feared
From the War's Rage, than Violence and Blood?
Have not unceasing Horrors marked thy Reign?
Through sev'n long Years, thy slaught'ring Sword has reek'd
With guiltless Blood.

BARBAROSSA. With guiltless Blood? -- Take heed --
Rouse not my slumbering Rage: Nor vindicate
Thy Country's Guilt and Treason.

ZAPHIRA. Where Violence reigns, there Innocence is Guilt,
And Virtue, Treason. -- Know, ZAPHIRA scorns
Thy Menace. -- Yes, -- thy slaught'ring Sword has reek'd
With guiltless Blood. Thro'thee, Exile and Death
Have thin'd ALGIERS. Is this thy boasted Peace?
So might the Tiger boast the Peace he brings
When he o'erleaps by Stealth, and wastes the Fold.

BARBAROSSA. Ungrateful Queen! I Will give thee Proof of Love,
Beyond thy Sex's Pride! But make thee mine,
I will descend the Throne, and call thy Son
From Banishment to Empire.

ZAPHIRA. Oh, my Heart!
Can I bear this! --
Inhuman Tyrant! Curses on thy Head!
May dire Remorse and Anguish haunt thy Throne,
And gender in thy Bosom fell Despair!
Despair as deep as mine!

BARBAROSSA. What means ZAPHIRA?
What means this Burst of Grief?

ZAPHIRA. Thou fell Destroyer!
Had not Guilt steeled thy Heart, awak'ning Conscience
Would flash Conviction on thee, and each Look,
Shot from these Eyes, be armed with Serpent-Horrors,
To turn thee into Stone! -- Relentless Man!
Who did the bloody Deed? Oh, tremble Guilt,
Wherever thou art! -- Look on me! -- Tell me, Tyrant, --
Who slew my blameless Son?

BARBAROSSA. What envious Tongue,
My Foe, has dared to taint my Name with Slander?
This is the Rumor of some coz'ning Slave,
Who thwarts my Peace. Believe it not, ZAPHIRA.
Thy SELIM lives: nay more, he soon shall reign,
If thou consent to bless me.

ZAPHIRA. Never! Oh, never -- Sooner would I roam
An unknown Exile through the torrid Climes
Of AFRIC, sooner dwell with Wolves and Tigers,
Than mount with thee my murdered SELIM's Throne!

BARBAROSSA. Rash Queen, forbear! Think on thy Captive-State:
Remember, that within these Palace-Walls,
I am omnipotent: That every Knee
Bends at my dread Approach: That Shame and Honor,
Reward and Punishment, await my Nod,
The Vassals of my Pleasure. -- Yield thee then:
Avert the gathering Horrors that surround thee,
And dread my Power incensed.

ZAPHIRA. Dares thy licentious Tongue pollute mine Ear
With that foul Menace? -- Tyrant! Dread'st thou not
The all seeing Eye of Heaven, its lifted Thunder,
And all the red'ning Vengeance which it stores
For Crimes like thine? -- Yet know, thy Threats are vain.
Though robbed by thee of every dear Support;
No Tyrant's Threat can awe the freeborn Soul,
That greatly dares to Die.

[Exit ZAPHIRA. BARBAROSSA. Where should she learn the Tale of SELIM's Death?
Could OTHMAN dare to tell it? If he did,
My Rage shall sweep him, swifter than the Whirlwind,
To instant Death! -- Curse on her Steadiness!
She lords it over my Heart. There is a Charm
Of Majesty in Virtue, that disarms
Reluctant Power, and bends the struggling Will
From her most firm Resolve.
Enter ALADIN. Oh, ALADIN!
Timely thou come, to ease my laboring Thought,
That swells with Indignation and Despair.
This stubborn Woman --

ALADIN. What, unconquered still?

BARBAROSSA. The News of SELIM's Fate has reached her Ear.
Whence could this come?

ALADIN. I can resolve thy Doubt.
A female Slave, Attendant on ZAPHIRA,
O'erheard the Messenger who brought the Tale,
And gave it to her Ear.

BARBAROSSA. Perdition sieze her!
No Threat can move, nor Promise now allure
Her haughty Soul: Nay, she defies my Power:
And talks of Death, as if her female Form
Inshrin'd some Hero's Spirit.

ALADIN. Let her Rage foam.
I bring thee Tidings that will ease thy Pain.

BARBAROSSA. Say thou? -- Speak on -- O give me quick Relief! --

ALADIN. The gallant Youth is come, who slew her Son.

BARBAROSSA. Who? OMAR!

ALADIN. No: Unhappy OMAR fell
By SELIM's Hand. But ACHMET, whom he joined
His brave Associate, so the Youth bids tell thee,
Revenged his Death by SELIM's.

BARBAROSSA. Gallant Youth!
Bears he the Signet?

ALADIN. Aye.

BARBAROSSA. That speaks him true. -- Conduct him, ALADIN.
[Exit ALADIN. This is beyond my Hope. The secret Pledge
Restored, prevents Suspicion of the Deed,
While it confirms it done.

Enter ACHMET and ALADIN. ACHMET. Hail mighty BARBAROSSA! As the Pledge
[Kneels. Of SELIM's Death, behold thy Ring restored:
That Pledge will speak the rest.

BARBAROSSA. Rise, valiant Youth!
But first, no more a Slave -- I give thee Freedom.
Thou art the Youth whom OMAR (now no more)
Joined his Companion in this brave Attempt?

ACHMET. I am.

BARBAROSSA. Then tell me how you sped. -- Where found ye
That Insolent!

ACHMET. We found him at ORAN,
Plotting deep Mischiefs to thy Throne and People.

BARBAROSSA. Well ye repaid the Traitor. --

ACHMET. As we ought.
While Night drew on, we leapt upon our Prey.
Full at his Heart brave OMAR aimed the Poignard,
Which SELIM shunning, wrench'd it from his Hand,
Then plunged it in his Breast. I hasted on.
Too late to save, yet I revenged my Friend:
My thirsty Dagger, with repeated Blow,
Searched every Artery: They fell together,
Gasping in Folds of mortal Enmity;
And thus in Frowns expired.

BARBAROSSA. Well have thou sped.
Thy Dagger did its Office, faithful ACHMET;
And high Reward shall wait thee. -- One thing more --
Be the Thought fortunate! -- Go, seek the Queen.
For know the Rumor of her SELIM's Death
Has reached her Ear: Hence dark Suspicions rise,
Squinting at me. Go, tell her, that thou saw
Her Son expire; that with his dying Breath,
He did conjure her to receive my Vows,
And give her Country Peace. -- That, sure will lull
Suspicion. ALADIN, that sure will win her.

ALADIN. It Is wisely thought. -- It must.

Enter OTHMAN. BARBAROSSA. Most welcome, OTHMAN.
Behold this gallant Stranger. He has done
The State good Service. Let some high Reward
Await him, such as may o'erpay his Zeal.
Conduct him to the Queen; for he has Tidings
Worthy her Ear, from her departed Son;
Such as may win her Love. -- Come, ALADIN:
The Banquet waits our Presence: Festal Joy
Laughs in the mantling Goblet; and the Night,
Illumined by the Taper's dazzling Beam,
Rivals departed Day.

[Ex. BARB. and ALAD. ACHMET. What anxious Thought
Rowls in thine Eye, and heaves thy laboring Breast?
Why join'st thou not the loud Excess of Joy,
That riots through the Palace?

OTHMAN. Dare thou tell me,
On what dark Errand thou art here?

ACHMET. I dare.
Do thou not see the savage Lines of Blood
Deform my Visage? Read'st not in mine Eye
Remorseless Fury? -- I am SELIM's Murderer.

OTHMAN. His Murderer!

ACHMET. Start not from me.
My Dagger thirsts not but for regal Blood.
Why this Amazement?

OTHMAN. Amazement? -- No -- It Is well: -- it is as it should be --
He was indeed a Foe to BARBAROSSA.

ACHMET. And therefore to ALGIERS: -- Was it not so? --
Why do thou pause? What Passion shakes thy Frame?

OTHMAN. Fate, do thy worst! -- I can no more dissemble! --
Can I unmoved behold the murdering Russian,
Smeared with my Prince's Blood! -- Go, tell the Tyrant,
OTHMAN defies his Power; that tired with Life
He dares his bloody Hand, and pleads to die.

ACHMET. What, did thou love this SELIM?

OTHMAN. All Men loved him.
He was of such unmixed and blameless Quality,
That Envy, at his Praise stood mute, nor dared
To sully his fair Name! Remorseless Tyrant!

ACHMET. I do commend thy Faith. And since thou love him,
I Will whisper to thee, that with honest Guile
I have deceived this Tyrant BARBAROSSA:
SELIM is yet alive.

OTHMAN. Alive!

ACHMET. Nay, more --
SELIM is in ALGIERS.

OTHMAN. Impossible!

ACHMET. Why, if thou doubt'st, I Will bring him hither, straight.

OTHMAN. Not for an Empire!
Thou might as well bring the devoted Lamb
Into the Tyger's Den.

ACHMET. Nay, but I Will bring him
Hid in such deep Disguise, as shall deride
Suspicion, though she wear the Lynx's Eye:
Not even thyself could know him.

OTHMAN. Yes, sure: too sure, to hazard such an awful Trial!

ACHMET. Yet seven revolving Years, worn out
In tedious Exile, may have wrought such Change
Of Voice and Feature, in the State of Youth,
As might elude thine Eye.

OTHMAN. No Time can blot
The Memory of his sweet majestic Mien,
The Luster of his Eye! Nay, more, he wears
A Mark indelible, a beauteous Scar,
Made on his Forehead by a surious Pard,
Which rushing on his Mother, SELIM slew.

ACHMET. A Scar!

OTHMAN. Ay, on his Forehead.

ACHMET. What, like this?
[Lifting his Turban.
OTHMAN. Whom do I see! -- am I awake! -- my Prince!
[Kneels. My honored, honored King!

SELIM. Rise, faithful OTHMAN.
Thus let me thank thy Truth!
[Embraces him.
OTHMAN. Oh, happy Hour!

SELIM. Why do thou tremble thus? Why grasp my Hand?
And why that ardent Gaze? Thou can not doubt me?

OTHMAN. Ah, no! I see thy Sire in every Line. --
How did my Prince escape the Murd'rer's Hand?

SELIM. I wrench'd the Dagger from him; and gave back
That Death he meant to bring. The Russian wore
The Tyrant's Signet: -- Take this Ring, he cried,
The sole Return my dying Hand can make thee
For its accursed Attempt: This Pledge restored,
Will prove thee slain: Safe may thou see ALGIERS,
Unknown to all. -- This said, th'Assassin died.

OTHMAN. But how to gain Admittance, thus unknown?

SELIM. Disguised as SELIM's Murderer I come:
The Accomplice of the Deed: The Ring restored,
Gained Credence to my Words.

OTHMAN. Yet ever thou came, thy Death was rumored here.

SELIM. I spread the flattering Tale, and sent it hither;
That babbling Rumor, like a lying Dream,
Might make Belief more easy. Tell me, OTHMAN, --
And yet I tremble to approach the Theme, --
How fares my Mother? does she still sustain
Her native Greatness?

OTHMAN. Still: In vain the Tyrant
Tempts her to Marriage, though with impious Threats
Of Death or Violation.

SELIM. May kind Heaven
Strengthen her Virtue, and by me reward it!
When shall I see her, OTHMAN?

OTHMAN. Yet, my Prince,
I tremble for thy Presence.

SELIM. Let not Fear
Sully thy Virtue: It Is the Lot of Guilt
To tremble. What has Innocence to do with Fear.

OTHMAN. Yet think -- should BARBAROSSA --

SELIM. Dread him not --
Thou know, by his Command, I see ZAPHIRA.
And wrapped in this Disguise, I walk secure,
As if from Heaven some guardian Power attending,
Threw ten-fold Night around me.

OTHMAN. Still my Heart
Forebodes some dire Event! -- O quit these Walls!

SELIM. Not till a Deed be done, which every Tyrant
Shall tremble when he hears.

OTHMAN. What means my Prince?

SELIM. To take just Vengeance for a Father's Blood,
A Mother's Sufferings, and a People's Groan.

OTHMAN. Alas, my Prince! Thy single Arm is weak
To combat Multitudes

SELIM. Therefore I come,
Clad in this Murd'rer's Guise -- Ere Morning shines,
This, OTHMAN -- this -- shall drink the Tyrant's Blood.
[Shews a Dagger.
OTHMAN. Heaven shield thy precious Life -- Let Caution rule
Thy headlong Zeal!

SELIM. Nay, think not that I come
Blindly impelled by Fury or Despair:
For I have seen our Friends, and parted now
From SADI and ALMANZOR.

OTHMAN. Say -- what Hope?
My Soul is all Attention. --

SELIM. Mark me, then.
A chosen Band of Citizens this Night
Will storm the Palace; while the glutted Troops
Lie drenched in Surfeit; the confed'rate City,
Bold through Despair, have sworn to break their Chain
By one wide Slaughter. I, meantime, have gained
The Palace, and will wait the appointed Hour,
To guard ZAPHIRA from the Tyrant's Rage,
Amid' the deathful Uproar.

OTHMAN. Heaven protect thee --
It Is dreadful -- What Is the Hour!

SELIM. I left our Friends
In secret Council. Ere the dead of Night
Brave SADI will report their last Resolves. --
Now lead me to the Queen. --

OTHMAN. Brave Prince, beware!
Her Joy's or Fear's excess, would sure betray thee.
Thou shall not see her, till the Tyrant perish!

SELIM. I must. -- I feel some secret Impulse urge me.
Who knows that it is not the last parting Interview,
We ever shall obtain?

OTHMAN. Then, on thy Life,
Do not reveal thyself. -- Assume the Name
Of SELIM's Friend; sent to confirm her Virtue,
And warn her that he lives.

SELIM. It shall be so: I yield me to thy Will.

OTHMAN. Thou greatly daring Youth! May Angels watch,
And guard thy upright Purpose! That ALGIERS
May reap the Blessings of thy virtuous Reign,
And all thy Godlike Father shine in thee!

SELIM. Oh, thou have rowz'd a Thought, on which Revenge
Mounts with redoubled Fire! -- Yes, here, even here --
Beneath this very Roof, my honored Father
Shed round his Blessings, till accursed Treach'ry
Stole on his peaceful Hour! O, blessed Shade!
If yet thou hov'rest over thy once lov'd-Clime,
Now aid me to redress thy bleeding Wrongs!
Infuse thy mighty Spirit into my Breast,
Thy firm and dauntless Fortitude, unawed
By Peril, Pain, or Death! that undismayed,
I may pursue the just Intent; and dare
Or bravely to Revenge, or bravely Die.

[Exeunt. ACT III.
Enter IRENE. CAN Air-drawn Visions mock the waking Eye,
Sure 'twas his Image! -- Yet, his Presence here --
After full Rumor had confirmed him dead! --
Beneath this hostile Roof to court Destruction!
It staggers all Belief! Silent he shot
Athwart my View, amid' the glimmering Lamps,
With swift and Ghost-like Step, that seemed to shun
All human Converse. This way, sure he moved.
But Oh, how changed! He wears no gentle Smiles,
But Terror in his Frown. He comes. -- It Is He: --
For OTHMAN points him hither, and departs.
Disguised, he seeks the Queen: Secure, perhaps,
And heedless of the Ruin that surrounds him.
O generous SELIM! can I see thee thus;
And not forewarn such Virtue of its Fate!
Forbid it Gratitude!

Enter SELIM. SELIM. Be still, ye Sighs!
Ye struggling Tears of filial Love, be still.
Down, down fond Heart!

IRENE. Why, Stranger, do thou wander here?

SELIM. Oh, Ruin!
[Shunning her.]
IRENE. Blessed, is IRENE! Blessed if SELIM lives!

SELIM. Am I betrayed!

IRENE. Betrayed! to whom? To Her
Whose grateful Heart would rush on Death to save thee!

SELIM. It was my Hope,
That Time had veiled all Semblance of my Youth,
And thrown the Mask of Manhood over my Visage. --
Am I then known?

IRENE. To none, but Love and Me. --
To me, who late beheld thee at ORAN;
Who saw thee here, beset with unseen Peril,
And flew to save the Guardian of my Honor.

SELIM. Thou Sum of every Worth! Thou Heaven of Sweetness!
How could I pour forth all my Soul before thee,
In Vows of endless Truth! -- It must not be! --
This is my destined Goal! -- The Mansion drear,
Where Grief and Anguish dwell! where bitter Tears,
And Sighs, and Lamentations, choke the Voice,
And quench the Flame of Love!

IRENE. Yet, virtuous Prince,
Though Love be silent, Gratitude may speak.
Hear then her Voice, which warns thee from these Walls.
Mine be the grateful Task, to tell the Queen,
Her SELIM lives. Ruin and Death enclose thee.
O speed thee hence, while yet Destruction sleeps!

SELIM. Too generous Maid! Oh, Heaven! that BARBAROSSA
Should be IRENE's Father.

IRENE. Injured Prince!
Lose not a Thought on me! I know thy Wrongs,
And merit not thy Love. No, learn to hate me.
Or if IRENE ever can hope such Kindness,
First pity, then forget me!

SELIM. When I do,
May Heaven pour down its righteous Vengeance on me!

IRENE. Hence! haste thee, hence!

SELIM. Would it were possible!

IRENE. What can prevent it?

SELIM. Justice! Fate, and Justice!
A murdered Father's Wrongs!

IRENE. Ah, Prince, take heed!
I have a Father too!

SELIM. What did I say? -- my Father? -- not my Father. --
Can I depart till I have seen ZAPHIRA? --

IRENE. Justice, said thou?
That Word has struck me, like a Peal of Thunder!
Thine Eye, which wont to melt with gentle Love,
Now glares with Terror! Thy Approach by Night --
Thy dark Disguise, thy Looks, and fierce Demenor,
Yes, all conspire to tell me, I am lost!
Think, SELIM, what IRENE must endure,
Should she be guilty of a Father's Blood!

SELIM. A Father's Blood!

IRENE. Too sure. In vain thou hid'st
Thy dire Intent! Forbid it, Heaven, IRENE
Should see Destruction hovering over her Father,
And not prevent the Blow!

SELIM. Is this thy Love,
Thy Gratitude to him who saved thy Honor?

IRENE. It Is Gratitude to him who gave me Life:
He who preserved me claims the second Place.

SELIM. Is he not a Tyrant, Murderer?

IRENE. O spare my Shame! I am his Daughter still!

SELIM. Would thou become the Partner of his Crimes?

IRENE. Forbid it Heaven! -- Yet I must save a Father!

SELIM. Come on then. Lead me to him. Glut thine Eye
With SELIM's Blood --

IRENE. Was ever Distress like mine!
O SELIM can I see my Father Perish! --
Would I had never been born!
[Weeps.
SELIM. Thou virtuous Maid!
My Heart bleeds for thee!

IRENE. Quit, O quit these Walls!
Heaven will ordain some gentler, happier Means,
To heal thy Woes! Thy dark Attempt is big
With Horror and Destruction! Generous Prince!
Resign thy dreadful Purpose, and depart!

SELIM. May not I see ZAPHIRA, ere I go?
Thy gentle Pity will not, sure, deny us
The mournful Pleasure of a parting Tear?

IRENE. Go, then, and give her Peace. But fly these Walls,
As soon as Morning shines: -- Else, though Despair
Drive me to Madness; -- yet -- to save a Father! --
O SELIM! spare my Tongue the horrid Sentence! --
Fly! ere Destruction seize thee!

[Exit IRENE. SELIM. Death and Ruin!
Must I then fly? -- what! -- Coward-like betray
My Father, Mother, Friends? -- Vain Terrors, hence!
Danger looks big, to Fear's deluded Eye.
But Courage, on the Heights and Steps of Fate,
Dares snatch her glorious Purpose from the Edge
Of Peril: and while sickening Caution shrinks,
Or self-betray'd, falls headlong down the Steep;
Calm Resolution, unappal'd, can walk
The giddy Brink, secure. -- Now to the Queen. --
How shall I dare to meet her thus unknown!
How stifle the warm Transports of my Heart,
Which pants at her Approach! -- Who waits ZAPHIRA! --

Enter a female SLAVE. SLAVE. Whence this Intrusion, Stranger? at an Hour
Destined to Rest?

SELIM. I come, to seek the Queen,
On matter of such Import, as may claim
Her speedy Audience.

SLAVE. Thy Request is vain.
Even now the Queen has heard the mournful Tale
Of her Son's Death, and drowned in Grief she lies.
Thou can not see her.

SELIM. Tell the Queen, I come
On Message from her dear, departed Son;
And bring his last Request.

SLAVE. I Will haste to tell her.
With all a Mother's tenderest Love she will fly,
To meet that Name.

[Exit SLAVE. SELIM. O ill-dissembling Heart! -- My every Limb
Trembles with grateful Terror! -- Would to Heaven,
I had not come! Some Look, or starting Tear,
Will sure betray me. -- Honest Guile assist
My fault'ring Tongue!

Enter ZAPHIRA. ZAPHIRA. Where is this pious Stranger? --
Say, generous Youth, whose Pity leads thee thus
To seek the weeping Mansions of Distress!
Did thou behold in Death my hapless Son?
Did thou receive my SELIM's parting Breath?
Did he remember me?

SELIM. Most honored Queen!
Thy Son, -- Forgive these gushing Tears, which flow
To see Distress like thine!

ZAPHIRA. I thank thy Pity!
It Is generous thus to feel for others Woe. --
What of my Son? Say, did thou see him die?

SELIM. By BARBAROSSA's dread Command I come,
To tell thee, that these Eyes alone beheld
Thy Son expire.

ZAPHIRA. Oh Heaven! -- my dearest Child!

SELIM. That even in Death, the pious Youth remembered
His royal Mother's Woes.

ZAPHIRA. Where, where was I?
Relentless Fate! -- that I should be denied
The mournful Privilege, to see him die!
To clasp him in the Agony of death,
And catch his parting Soul! O tell me all,
All that he said and looked: Deep in my Heart
That I may treasure every parting Word,
Each dying Whisper of my dear, dear Son?

SELIM. Let not my Words offend. -- What if he said,
Go, tell my hapless Mother, that her Tears
Have streamed too long: Then bid her weep no more:
Bid her forget the Husband and the Son,
In BARBAROSSA's Arms!

ZAPHIRA. O, false as Hell!
Thou art some creeping Slave to BARBAROSSA,
Sent to surprise my unsuspecting Heart!
False Slave, begone! -- My Son betray me thus! --
Could he have ever conceived so base a Purpose,
My Griefs for him should end in great Disdain! --
But he was brave; and scorned a Thought so vile!
Wretched ZAPHIRA! How art thou become
The Sport of Slaves! -- O Griefs incurable!

SELIM. Yet hope for Peace, unhappy Queen! Thy Woes
May yet have end.

ZAPHIRA. Why weep'st thou Crocodile?
Thy treacherous Tears are vain.

SELIM. My Tears are honest.
I am not what thou think.

ZAPHIRA. Who art thou then!

SELIM. Oh, my full Heart! -- I am -- thy Friend, and SELIM's.
I come not to insult but heal thy Woes. --
Now check thy Heart's wild Tumult, while I tell thee --
Perhaps -- thy Son yet lives.

ZAPHIRA. O gracious Heaven!
Do I not dream? say, Stranger, -- did thou tell me,
Perhaps my SELIM lives? -- What do I ask?
Fond, fond, and fruitless Hope! -- What mortal Power
Can ever re-animate his mangled Coarse,
Shoot Life into the cold and silent Tomb,
Or bid the ruthless Grave give up its Dead!

SELIM. O powerful Nature, thou will sure betray me!
[Aside. Thy SELIM lives: For since his rumored Death,
I saw him at ORAN.

ZAPHIRA. Is not then, my SELIM dead?

SELIM. He is not.

ZAPHIRA. Did thou not say, thou saw my son expire?
Did not even now relate his dying Words?

SELIM. It was an honest Falsehood, meant to prove
ZAPHIRA's unstained Virtue.

ZAPHIRA. Why -- but OTHMAN --
OTHMAN affirmed that my poor Son was dead:
And I have heard, the Murderer is come,
In triumph o'cr his dear and innocent Blood.

SELIM. I am that Murderer. -- Beneath this Guise
I spread the abortive Tale of SELIM's Death,
And happily won the Tyrant's Confidence.
Hence gained Access: And from thy SELIM tell thee,
SELIM yet lives; and honors all thy Virtues.

ZAPHIRA. O generous Youth, who art thou? -- From what Clime
Comes such exalted Virtue, as dares give
A Pause to Griefs like mine! -- As dares approach,
And prop the Ruin tottering on its Base,
Which selfish Caution shuns! -- Oh, say -- who art thou?

SELIM. A friendless Youth, self-banish'd with thy Son;
Long his Companion in Distress and Danger:
One who revered thy Worth in prosperous Days:
And more reveres thy Virtue in Distress.

ZAPHIRA. O tell me truly then -- mock not my Woes,
But tell me truly, -- does my SELIM live?

SELIM. He does, by Heaven!

ZAPHIRA. And does he still remember
His Father's Wrongs, and mine!

SELIM. He bade me tell thee,
That in his Heart indelibly are stamped
His Father's Wrongs, and Thine: That he but waits
'Till awful Justice may unsheath her Sword,
And Lust and Murder tremble at her Frown!
'That till the Arrival of that happy Hour,
Deep in his Soul the hidden Fire shall glow,
And his Breast labor with the great Revenge!

ZAPHIRA. Eternal Blessings crown my virtuous Son!
I feel my Heart revive! Here, Peace once more
Begins to dawn.

SELIM. Much honored Queen, farewell.

ZAPHIRA. Not yet, -- not yet; -- indulge a Mother's Love!
In thee, the kind Companion of his Griefs,
Methinks I see my SELIM stand before me.
Depart not yet. A thousand fond Requests
Crowd on my Mind. Wishes, and Prayers and Tears,
Are all I have to give. O bear him these!

SELIM. Take Comfort then; for know thy Son, o'erjoy'd
To rescue thee, would bleed at every Vein! --
Bid her, he said, yet hope we may be blessed!
Bid her remember that the Ways of Heaven,
Though dark, are just: That often some Guardian Power
Attends unseen, to save the innocent!
But if high Heaven decrees our Fall, -- O bid her
Firmly to wait the Stroke; prepared alike
To live or die! and then he wept, as I do.

ZAPHIRA. O righteous Heaven! Thou have at length o'erpay'd
My bitt'rest Pangs; if my dear SELIM lives,
And lives for me! -- hear my departing Prayer!
[Kneels. O spare my Son! -- Protect his tender Years!
Be thou his Guide through Dangers and Distress!
Soften the Rigours of his cruel Exile,
And lead him to his Throne! -- when I am gone,
Bless thou his peaceful Reign! Oh, early bless him
With the sweet Pledges of connubial Love;
That he may win his Virtue's just Reward,
And taste the Raptures which a Parent's Heart
Reaps from a Child like him! Not for myself, --
But my dear Son, -- accept my parting Tears!

[Exit ZAPHIRA. SELIM. Now, swelling Heart,
Indulge the Luxury of Grief! Flow Tears!
And rain down Transport in the Shape of Sorrow!
Yes, I have soothed her Woes; have found her Noble:
And to have given this Respite to her Pangs,
O'erpays all Pain and Peril! -- Powerful Virtue!
How infinite thy Joys, when even thy Griefs
Are pleasing! -- Thou, superior to the Frowns
Of Fate, can pour thy Sunshine over the Soul,
And brighten Woe to Rapture!
Enter OTHMAN and SADI. Honored Friends!
How goes the Night?

SADI. It Is well nigh Midnight.

OTHMAN. What -- in Tears, my Prince?

SELIM. But Tears of Joy: For I have seen ZAPHIRA,
And poured the Balm of Peace into her Breast:
Think not these Tears unnerve me, valiant Friends:
They have but harmoniz'd my Soul; and waked
All that is Man within me, to disdain
Peril, or Death. -- What Tidings from the City?

SADI. All, all is ready. Our confed'rate Friends
Burn with Impatience, till the Hour arrive.

SELIM. What is the Signal of the appointed Hour?

SADI. The Midnight Watch gives Signal of our Meeting:
And when the second Watch of Night is rung,
The work of Death begins.

SELIM. Speed, speed ye Minutes!
Now let the rising Whirlwind shake ALGIERS,
And Justice guide the storm! Scarce two Hours hence. --

SADI. Scarce more than one.

SELIM. But as ye love my Life,
Let your Zeal hasten on the great Event:
The Tyrant's Daughter found, and knew me here;
And half suspects the Cause.

OTHMAN. Too daring Prince,
Retire with us! Her Fears will sure betray thee!

SELIM. What? leave my helpless Mother, here, a Prey
To Cruelty and Lust? -- I Will perish first:
This very Night the Tyrant threatens Violence:
I Will watch his Steps: I Will haunt him through the Palace:
And, should he meditate a Deed so vile,
I Will hover over him like an unseen Pestilence,
And blast him in his Guilt!

SADI. Intrepid Prince!
Worthy of Empire! -- Yet accept my Life,
My worthless Life: Do thou retire with OTHMAN;
I will protect ZAPHIRA.

SELIM. Think thou, SADI,
That when the trying Hour of Peril comes,
SELIM will shrink into a common Man!
Worthless were he to rule, who dares not claim
Pre-eminence in Danger. Urge no more.
Here shall my Station be: And if I fall,
O Friends, let me have Vengeance! -- Tell me now,
Where is the Tyrant?

OTHMAN. Revelling at the Banquet.

SELIM. It Is good. -- Now tell me, how our Powers are destined?

SADI. Near every Port, a secret Band is posted:
By these the watchful Sentinels must perish:
The rest is easy: For the glutted Troops
Lie drowned in Sleep; the Dagger's cheapest Prey.
ALMANZOR, with his Friends, will circle round
The Avenues of the Palace. OTHMAN and I
Will lead our brave Confederates (all sworn
To conquer or to die) and burst the Gates
Of this foul Den. Then tremble BARBAROSSA!

SELIM. Oh, how the near Approach of this great Hour
Fires all my Soul! But, valiant Friends, I charge you,
Reserve the Murderer to my just Revenge;
My Poignard claims his Blood.

OTHMAN. Forgive me, Prince!
Forgive my Doubts! -- Think -- should the fair IRENE --

SELIM. Thy Doubts are vain. I would not spare the Tyrant,
Though the sweet Maid lay weeping at my Feet!
Nay, should he fall by any Hand but mine;
By Heaven, I Would think my honored Father's Blood
Scarce half revenged! My Love indeed is strong!
But Love shall yield to Justice!

SADI. Gallant Prince!
Bravely resolved!

SELIM. But is the City quiet?

SADI. All, all is hushed. Throughout the empty Streets,
Nor Voice, nor Sound. As if the Inhabitants,
Like the presaging Herds that seek the Covert
Ere the loud Thunder rowls, had inly felt
And shunned the impending Uproar.

OTHMAN. There is a solemn Horror in the Night too,
That pleases me: A general Pause through Nature:
The Winds are hushed --

SADI. And as I passed the Beach,
The lazy Billow scarce could lash the Shore:
Nor Star peeps through the Firmament of Heaven --

SELIM. And lo -- where Eastward, over the sullen Wave,
The waining Moon, deprived of half her Orb,
Rises in Blood: Her Beam, well-nigh extinct,
Faintly contents with Darkness --
[Bell tolls. Hark! -- what meant
That tolling Bell?

OTHMAN. It rings the Midnight Watch.

SADI. This was the Signal --
Come, OTHMAN, we are called: The passing Minutes
Chide our Delay: Brave OTHMAN, let us hence.

SELIM. One last Embrace! -- nor doubt, but crowned with Glory,
We soon shall meet again. But oh, remember
Amid' Tumult's Rage, remember Mercy!
Stain not a righteous Cause with guiltless Blood!
Warn our brave Friends, that we unsheath the Sword,
Not to destroy, but save! Nor let blind Zeal,
Or wanton Cruelty, ever turn its Edge
On Age or Innocence! Or bid us stab,
Where the most pitying Angel in the Skies
That now looks on us from his blessed Abode,
Would wish that we should spare.

OTHMAN. So may we prosper,
As Mercy shall direct us!

SELIM. Farewell, Friends!

SADI. Intrepid Prince, Farewell!

[Ex. OATH. and SADI. SELIM. Now Sleep and Silence
Brood over the City. -- The devoted Sentinel
Now takes his lonely stand; and idly dreams,
Of that tomorrow, which shall never come!
In this dread Interval, O busy Thought,
From outward Things descend into thyself!
Search deep my Heart! Bring with thee awful Conscience*
And firm resolve! That in the approaching Hour
Of Blood and Horror, I may stand unmoved,
Nor fear to strike where Justice calls, nor dare
To strike where she forbids! -- Why bear I then
This dark, insidious Dagger? -- It Is the Badge
Of vile Assassins; of the Coward Hand
That dares not meet its Foe! -- Detested Thought!
Yet, -- as foul Lust and Murder, though on Thrones
Triumphant, still retain their hell-born Quality;
So Justice, groaning beneath countless Wrongs,
Quits not her spotless and celestial Nature;
But in the unhallowed Murderer's Disguise,
Can sanctify this Steel!
Then be it so: -- Witness, ye Powers of Heaven,
That not from you, but from the Murd'rer's Eye,
I wrap myself in Night! -- To you I stand
Revealed in Noontide Day! -- Oh, could I arm
My Hand with War! Then like to you, arrayed
In Storm and Fire, my swift-avenging Thunder
Should blast this Tyrant. But since Fate denies
That Privilege, I Will sieze on what it gives:
Like the deep-cavern'd Earthquake, burst beneath him,
And whelm his Throne, his Empire, and himself,
In one prodigious Ruin!

ACT IV.
Enter IRENE and ALADIN. IRENE. BUT did thou tell him, ALADIN, my Fears
Brook no Delay?

ALADIN. I did.

IRENE. Why comes he not!
Oh, what a dreadful Dream! -- 'Twas surely more
Than troubled Fancy: Never was my SouI
Shook with such hideous Phantoms! -- Still he lingers!
Return, return: and tell him that his Daughter
Dies, till she warn him of his threatening Ruin!

ALADIN. Behold, he comes.

[Exit ALADIN. Enter BARBAROSSA. BARBAROSSA. Thou bane of all my Joys!
Some gloomy Planet surely ruled thy Birth!
Even now thy ill-timed Fear suspends the Banquet,
And damps the festal Hour.

IRENE. Forgive my Fear!

BARBAROSSA. What Fear, what Phantom has possessed thy Brain?

IRENE. Oh guard thee from the Terrors of this Night.
For Terror lurks unseen.

BARBAROSSA. What Terror? speak.
Would thou unman me into female Weakness? --
Say, what thou dread'st, and why? I have a Soul
To meet the blackest Dangers undismayed.

IRENE. Let not my Father check with stern Rebuke
The warning Voice of Nature. For even now,
Retired to Rest, soon as I closed mine Eyes,
A horrid Vision rose -- Methought I saw
Young SELIM rising from the silent Tomb:
Mangled and Bloody was his Coarse: his Hair
Clotted with Gore; his glaring Eyes on Fire!
Dreadful he shook a Dagger in his Hand.
By some mysterious Power he rose in Air.
When lo, -- at his Command, this yawning Roof
Was cleft in Twain, and gave the Phantom Entrance!
Swift he descended with terrific Brow,
Rushed on my guardless Father at the Banquet,
And plunged his furious Dagger in thy Breast!

BARBAROSSA. Would thou appal me by a brainsick Vision?
Get thee to Rest. -- Sleep but as sound till Morn,
As SELIM in his Grave shall sleep for ever,
And then no haggard Dreams shall ride thy Fancy!

IRENE. Yet hear me, dearest Father!

BARBAROSSA. To the Couch!
Provoke me not. --

IRENE. What shall I say, to move him!
Merciful Heaven, instruct me what to do!

Enter ALADIN. BARBAROSSA. What mean thy Looks? -- why do thou gaze so wildly?

ALADIN. I hasted to inform thee, that even now,
Rounding the Watch, I met the brave ABDALLA,
Breathless with Tidings of a Rumor dark,
Which runs throughout the City, that young SELIM
Is yet alive --

BARBAROSSA. May Plagues consume the Tongue
That broached the Falsehood! -- It Is not possible --
What did he tell thee further?

ALADIN. More he said not:
Save only, that the spreading Rumor waked
A Spirit of Revolt.

IRENE. O gracious Father! --

BARBAROSSA. The Rumor lies. -- And, yet, your Coward Fears
Infect me! -- What! -- shall I be terrified
By midnight Visions? -- Can the troubled Brain
Of Sleep out-stretch the Reason's waking Eye?
I Will not believe it.

ALADIN. But this gathering Rumor --
Think but on that, my Lord!

BARBAROSSA. Infernal Darkness
Swallow the Slave that raised it! -- Yet, I Will do
What Caution dictates. -- Hark thee. ALADIN --
Slave, hear my Will. -- See that the Watch be doubled --
Seek out this strange Achmet; and forthwith
Let him be brought before me.

IRENE. O my Father!
I do conjure thee, as thou love thy Life,
Retire, and trust thee to thy faithful Guards --
See not this Achmet!

BARBAROSSA. Not see him? -- Death and Torment! --
Think thou, I fear a single Arm that is mortal?
Not see him? -- Forthwith bring the Slave before me. --
If he prove false, -- if hated SELIM live,
I Will heap such Vengeance on him --

IRENE. Mercy! Mercy!

BARBAROSSA. Mercy, -- To whom?

IRENE. To me: -- and to thyself:
To him -- to all -- Thou think I rave; yet true
My Visions are, as ever Prophet uttered,
When Heaven inspires his Tongue!

BARBAROSSA. Never did the Moon-struck Madman rave with Dreams
More wild than thine! -- Get thee to rest; ever yet
Thy Folly wake my Rage. -- Call ACHMET hither.

IRENE. Thus prostrate on my Knees! -- O see him not.
SELIM is dead: -- Indeed the Rumor lies! --
There is no Danger near: -- Or, if there be,
ACHMET is innocent!

BARBAROSSA. Off, frantic Wretch!
This Ideot-Dream has turned her Brain to Madness!
Hence -- to thy Chamber, till returning Reason
Has calmed this Tempest. -- On thy Duty hence!

IRENE. Yet hear the Voice of Caution! -- Cruel Fate!
What have I done! -- Heaven shield my dearest Father!
Heaven shield the innocent! -- Undone IRENE!
Whatever the Event, thy Doom is Misery.

[Exit IRENE. BARBAROSSA. Her Words are wrapped in Darkness. -- ALADIN,
Forthwith send ACHMET hither. -- Mark him well. --
His Countenance and Gesture. -- Then with speed,
Double the Sentinels.
[Exit ALADIN. Infernal Guilt!
How do thou rise in every hideous Shape,
Of Rage and Doubt, Suspicion and Despair,
To rend my Soul! more wretched far than they,
Made wretched by my Crimes! -- Why did I not
Repent, while yet my Crimes were delible!
Ere they had struck their Colors through my Soul,
As black as Night or Hell! -- It Is now too late! --
Hence then, ye vain Repinings! -- Take me all,
Unfeeling Guilt! O banish, if thou can,
This fell Remorse, and every fruitless Fear!
Be this my Glory, -- to be great in Evil!
To combat my own Heart, and, scorning Conscience,
Rise to exalted Crimes!
Enter SELIM. Come hither, Slave: --
Hear me, and tremble: -- Art thou what thou seem?

SELIM. Ha! --

BARBAROSSA. Do thou pause? -- By Hell, the Slave's confounded!

SELIM. That BARBAROSSA should suspect my Truth!

BARBAROSSA. Take heed! For by the hovering Powers of Vengeance,
If I do find thee treacherous, I will doom thee
To Death and Torment, such as human Thought
Never yet conceived! Thou come beneath the Guise
Of SELIM's Murderer. -- Now tell me: -- Is not
That SELIM yet alive?

SELIM. SELIM alive!

BARBAROSSA. Perdition on thee! Do thou echo me!
Answer me quick, or Die!
[Draws his Dagger.
SELIM. Yes, freely strike. --
Already have thou given the fatal Wound,
And pierced my Heart with thy unkind Suspicion!
Oh, could my Dagger find a Tongue, to tell
How deep it drank his Blood! -- But since thy Doubt
Thus wrongs my Zeal, -- Behold my Breast -- strike here --
For bold is Innocence.

BARBAROSSA. I scorn the Task.
[Puts up his Dagger. Time shall decide thy Doom. -- Guards, mark me well.
See that ye watch the Motions of this Slave:
And if he meditates t'escape your Eye,
Let your good Sabres cleave him to the Chine.

SELIM. I yield me to thy Will, and when thou know
That SELIM lives, or see his hated Face,
Then wreak thy Vengeance on me.

BARBAROSSA. Bear him hence. --
Yet, on your Lives, await me within Call. --
I will have deeper Inquisition made:
Happily some Witness may confront the Slave,
And drag to Light his Falsehood.
[Exeunt SELIM and Guards. Call ZAPHIRA.
[Exit a SLAVE. If SELIM lives -- then what is BARBAROSSA?
My Throne's a Bubble, that but floats in Air,
Till Marriage-Rites declare ZAPHIRA mine. --
Fool that I am! To wait the weak Effects
Of slow Persuasion: when unbounded Power
Can give me all I wish! -- Slave, hear my Will, --
Fly, -- bid the Priest prepare the Marriage-Rites.
Let Incense rise to Heaven; and choral Songs
Attend ZAPHIRA to the nuptial Bed.
[Exit SLAVE. I will not brook Delay. -- By Love and Vengeance,
This Hour decides her Fate!
Enter ZAPHIRA. Well, haughty Fair. --
Has Reason yet subdued thee? Will thou hear
The Voice of Love?

ZAPHIRA. Why do thou vainly urge me?
Thou know my fixed Resolve.

BARBAROSSA. Can aught but Phrenzy
Rush on Perdition?

ZAPHIRA. Therefore shall no Power
Ever make me thine.

BARBAROSSA. Nay, sport not with my Rage:
Though yon suspected Slave affirms him dead;
Yet Rumor whispers, that young SELIM lives.

ZAPHIRA. Could I but think him so! my earnest Prayer
Should rise to Heaven, to keep him far from thec!

BARBAROSSA. Therefore, lest Treach'ry undermine my Power,
Know, that thy final Hour of Choice is come!

ZAPHIRA. I have no Choice. -- Think thou I ever will wed
The Murderer of my Lord?

BARBAROSSA. Take heed, rash Queen!
Tell me thy last Resolve.

ZAPHIRA. Then hear me, Heaven!
Hear all ye Powers that watch over Innocence!
Angels of Light! And thou, dear honored Shade
Of my departed Lord! attend, while her^
I ratify with Vows my last Resolve!
If ever I wed this Tyrant Murderer,
If I pollute me with this horrid Union,
Black as Adultery or damned Incest,
May ye, the Ministers of Heaven, depart,
Nor shed your Influence on the guilty Scene! --
May Horror blacken all our Days and Nights!
May Discord light the Nuptial Torch! And rising
From Hell, may swarming Fiends in Triumph howl
Around the accursed Bed!

BARBAROSSA. Begone, Remorse! --
Guards do your Office: Drag her to the Altar.
Heed not her Tears or Cries. -- What? -- dare ye doubt?
Instant obey my Bidding; -- or, by Hell,
Torment and Death shall overtake you all!

[Guards go to seize ZAPHIRA. ZAPHIRA. O spare me! -- Heaven protect me! -- O
my Son,
Were thou but here, to save thy helpless Mother! --
What shall I do! -- Undone, undone ZAPHIRA!

Enter SELIM. SELIM. Who called on ACHMET? -- Did not BARBAROSSA
Require me here?

BARBAROSSA. Officious Slave, retire!
I called thee not.

ZAPHIRA. O kind and generous Stranger, lend thy Aid!
O rescue me from these impending Horrors!
Heaven will reward thy Pity!

BARBAROSSA. Drag her hence!

SELIM. Pity her Woes, O mighty BARBAROSSA!

BARBAROSSA. Rouse not my Vengeance, Slave!

SELIM. Oh, hear me, hear me!

[Kneels. BARBAROSSA. Curse on thy forward Zeal! --

SELIM. Yet, yet have Mercy.

[Lays hold of BARBAROSSA's Garment. BARBAROSSA. Presuming Slave, begone!

[Strikes SELIM. SELIM. Nay, then, -- die Tyrant.

[Rises, and aims to stab BARBAROSSA. BARBAROSSA wrests his Dagger from him.
BARBAROSSA. Ah, Traitor, have I caught thee. -- Hold -- forbear --
[To Guards who offer to kill SELIM. Kill him not yet. -- I will have greater
Vengeance. --
Perfidious Wretch, who art thou? -- Bring the Rack:
Let that extort the Secrets of his Heart.

SELIM. Thy impious Threats are lost! I know that Death
And Torments are my Doom. -- Yet, ere I die,
I Will strike thy Soul with Horror. -- Off, vile Habit! --
Let me emerge from this dark Cloud that hides me,
And make my Setting glorious! -- If thou dare,
Now view me! -- Hear me, Tyrant! -- while with Voice
More dreadful than of Thunder, I proclaim,
That he who aimed the Dagger at thy Heart,
Is SELIM!

ZAPHIRA. O Heaven! my Son! my Son!

[She faints. SELIM. Unhappy Mother!

[Runs to embrace her. BARBAROSSA. Tear them asunder.

[Guards separate them. SELIM. Barbarous, barbarous Ruffians!

BARBAROSSA. Slaves, seize the Traitor.

[They offer to seize him. SELIM. Off, ye vile Slaves! I am your King! --
Retire,
And tremble at my Frowns! That is the Traitor;
That is the Murderer, Tyrant, Ravisher: Seize him,
And do your Country Right!

BARBAROSSA. Ah, Coward Dogs!
Start ye at Words! -- or seize him, or by Hell,
This Dagger ends you all.

[They seize him. SELIM. It Is done! -- Do thou revive, unhappy Queen!
Now arm thy Soul with Patience!

ZAPHIRA. My dear Son! --
Do I then live, once more to see my SELIM! --
But Oh -- to see thee thus! --

[Weeping. SELIM. Can thou behold
Her speechless Agonies, and not relent!

BARBAROSSA. At length Revenge is mine! -- Slaves, force her hence!
This Hour shall crown my Love.

ZAPHIRA. O Mercy, Mercy!

SELIM. Lo! BARBAROSSA! thou at length have conquered!
Behold a hapless Prince, overwhelmed with Woes,
[Kneels. Prostrate before thy Feet! -- Not for myself
I plead! -- Yes, plunge the Dagger in my Breast!
Tear, tear me piecemeal! But, O spare ZAPHIRA! --
Yet, yet relent! force not her Matron Honor!
Reproach not Heaven! --

BARBAROSSA. Have I then bent thy Pride?
Why, this is Conquest even beyond my Hope! --
Lie there, thou Slave! lie, till ZAPHIRA's Cries
Arouze thee from thy Posture!

SELIM. Do thou insult my Griefs? -- unmanly Wretch! --
Curse on the Fear that could betray my Limbs,
[Rising. My Coward Limbs, to this dishonest Posture!
Long have I scorned, I now defy thy Power.

BARBAROSSA. I Will put thy boasted Virtue to the Trial. --
Slaves, bear him to the Rack.

ZAPHIRA. O spare my Son!
Sure filial Virtue never was a Crime!
Save but my Son! -- I yield me to thy Wish! --
What do I say! -- The Marriage Vow -- O Horror!
This Hour shall make me thine! --

SELIM. What! doom thyself
The guilty Partner of a Murderer's Bed,
Whose Hands yet reek with thy dear Husband's Blood! --
To be the Mother of destructive Tyrants,
The Curses of Mankind! -- By Heaven, I swear,
The guilty Hour that gives thee to the Arms
Of that detested Murderer, shall end
This hated Life! --

BARBAROSSA. Or yield thee, or he dies! --

ZAPHIRA. The Conflict's past. -- I will resume my Greatness:
We'll bravely die, as we have lived, with Honor!

[Embracing. SELIM. Now, Tyrant, pour thy fiercest Fury on us: --
Now see, despairing Guilt! that Virtue still
Shall conquer, though in Ruin.

BARBAROSSA. Drag them hence:
Her to the Altar: -- SELIM to his Fate.

ZAPHIRA. O SELIM! O my Son! -- Thy Doom is Death!
Would it were mine!

SELIM. Would I could give it thee!
Is there no Means to save her! Lend, ye Guards,
Ye Ministers of Death, in Pity lend
Your Swords, or some kind Weapon of Destruction! --
Sure the most mournful Boon, that ever Son
Asked for the best of Mothers!

ZAPHIRA. Dearest SELIM!

BARBAROSSA. I Will hear no more. -- Guards, bear them to their Fate.

[Guards seize them. SELIM. One last Embrace!
Farewell! Farewell for ever!

[Guards struggle with them. ZAPHIRA. One Moment yet! -- Pity a Mother's Pangs!
--
O SELIM!

SELIM. O my Mother!

[Exeunt SELIM and ZAPHIRA. BARBAROSSA. My dearest Hopes are blasted! -- What
is Power;
If stubborn Virtue thus out-soar its Flight!
Yet he shall die. -- and she --

Enter ALADIN. ALADIN. Heaven guard my Lord!

BARBAROSSA. What mean thou, ALADIN?

ALADIN. A Slave arrived,
Says that young SELIM lives: Nay, somewhere lurks
Within these Walls.

BARBAROSSA. The lurking Traitor's found,
Convicted, and disarmed. -- Even now he aimed
This Dagger at my Heart.

ALADIN. Audacious Traitor!
The Slave says further, that he brings thee Tidings
Of dark Conspiracy, now hovering over us:
And claims thy private Ear.

BARBAROSSA. Of dark Conspiracy?
Where? -- Among whom?

ALADIN. The secret Friends of SELIM,
Who nightly haunt the City.

BARBAROSSA. Curse the Traitors!
Now speed thee ALADIN. -- Send forth our Spies:
Explore their Haunts. For, by the infernal Powers,
I will let loose my Rage. -- The furious Lion
Now foams indignant, scorning Tears and Cries.
Let SELIM forthwith die. -- Come, mighty Vengeance!
Stir me to Cruelty! The Rack shall groan
With newborn Horrors! -- I will issue forth,
Like Midnight-Pestilence! My Breath shall strew
The Streets with Dead; and Havoc stalk in Gore.
Hence, Pity! -- Feed the milky Thought of Babes:
Mine is of bloodier Hue.

ACT V.
Enter BARBAROSSA and ALADIN. BARBAROSSA. IS the Watch doubled? Are the Gates
secured
Against Surprise?

ALADIN. They are, and mock the Attempt
Of Force or Treachery.

BARBAROSSA. This whispered Rumor
Of dark Conspiracy, on further Inquest,
Seems but a false Alarm. Our Spies, sent out,
And now returned from Search, affirm that Sleep
Has wrapped the City.

ALADIN. But while SELIM lives,
Destruction lurks within the Palace Walls;
Nor Bars, nor Sentinels can give us Safety.

BARBAROSSA. Right, ALADIN. His Hour of Fate approaches. --
How goes the Night?

ALADIN. The second Watch is near.

BARBAROSSA. It Is well: -- Whenever it rings the Traitor dies.
So has my Will ordained. -- I Will seize the Occasion,
While I may fairly plead my Life's Defense.

ALADIN. True: For he aimed his Dagger at thy Heart.

BARBAROSSA. He did. Hence Justice, uncompell'd, shall seem
To lend her Sword, and do Ambition's Work.

ALADIN. His bold Resolves have steeled ZAPHIRA's Breast
Against thy Love: Thence he deserves to die.

BARBAROSSA. And Death's his Doom. -- Yet, first the Rack shall rend
Each Secret from his Heart; unless he give
ZAPHIRA to my Arms, by Marriage-Vows,
With full Consent; ere yet the second Watch
Toll for his Death. -- Curse on this Woman's Weakness!
I yet would win her Love! Haste, seek out OTHMAN:
Go, tell him, that Destruction and the Sword
Hang over young SELIM's Head, if swift Compliance
Plead not his Pardon.
[Exit. ALADIN. Stubborn Fortitude!
Had he not interposed, Success had crowned
My Love, now hopeless. -- Then let Vengeance seize him.

Enter IRENE. IRENE. Now hear me!

IRENE. Might Pity plead!

BARBAROSSA. What! -- plead for Treachery?

IRENE. Yet Pity might bestow a milder Name.
Would thou not love the Child, whose Fortitude
Should hazard Life for thee? -- Oh, think on that: --
The noble Mind hates not a virtuous Foe:
His generous Purpose was to save a Mother!

BARBAROSSA. Damned was his Purpose: And accursed art Thou,
Whose Perfidy would save the dark Assassin,
Who sought thy Father's Life! -- Hence, from my Sight.

IRENE. Oh, never, till thy Mercy spare my SELIM!

BARBAROSSA. Thy SELIM? -- Thine?

IRENE. Thou know -- by Gratitude
He Is mine. -- Had not his generous Hand redeemed me,
What then had been IRENE?

BARBAROSSA. Faithless Wretch!
Unhappy Father! whose perfidious Child
Leagues with his deadliest Foe; and guides the Dagger
Even to his Heart! -- Perdition catch thy Falsehood!
And is it thus, a thankless Child repays me,
For all the Guilt in which I plunged my Soul,
To raise her to a Throne!

IRENE. O spare these Words,
More keen than Daggers to my bleeding Heart!
Let me not live suspected! -- Dearest Father! --
Behold my Breast! write thy Suspicions here:
Write them in Blood; But spare the generous Youth,
Who saved me from Dishonor!

BARBAROSSA. By the Powers
Of great Revenge: thy fond Entreaties seal
His instant Death. -- In him, I Will punish thee. --
Away!

IRENE. Yet hear me! Ere my tortured Soul
Rush on some Deed of Horror!

BARBAROSSA. Seize her, Guards. --
Convey the frantic Idiot from my Presence:
See that she do no Violence on herself.

IRENE. O SELIM! -- generous Youth! -- how have my Fears
Betrayed thee to Destruction! -- Slaves, unhand me! --
Think ye, I Will live to bear these Pangs of Grief,
These Horrors that oppress my tortured Soul? --
Inhuman Father! -- Generous, injured Youth! --
Methinks I see thee stretched upon the Rack,
Hear thy expiring Groans! -- O Horror! Horror!
What shall I do to save him! -- Vain, alas!
Vain are my Tears and Prayers! -- At least, I Will die.
Death shall unite us yet!

[Exit IRENE and Guards. BARBAROSSA. O Torment, Torment!
Even in the midst of Power! -- the vilest Slave
More happy far than I! -- The very Child,
Whom my Love cherished from her infant Years,
Conspires to blast my Peace! -- O false Ambition,
Thou lying Phantom! whither have thou lured me!
Even to this giddy Height; where now I stand,
Forsaken, comfortless! with not a Friend
In whom my Soul can trust!
Enter ALADIN. Have thou seen OTHMAN?
He will not, sure, conspire against my Peace.

ALADIN. He Is fled my Lord. I dread some lurking Ruin.
The Sentinel on Watch says, that he passed
The Gate, since Midnight, with an unknown Friend:
And as they passed, OTHMAN in Whispers said,
"Now farewell, bloody Tyrant."

BARBAROSSA. Slave, thou lie.
He did not dare to say it. Or, if he did,
Pernicious Slave, why do thou wound my Ear
By the foul Repitition? -- Gracious Powers,
Let me be calm! -- O my distracted Soul! --
How am I rent in Pieces! -- OTHMAN fled! --
Why then may all Hell's Curses follow him! --
What Is to be done? Some Mischief lurks unseen.

ALADIN. Prevent it then --

BARBAROSSA. By SELIM's instant Death --

ALADIN* Ay, doubtless.

BARBAROSSA. Is the Rack prepared?

ALADIN. It Is ready.
Along the Ground he lies, overwhelmed with Chains.
The Ministers of Death stand round; and wait
Thy last Command.

BARBAROSSA. Once more I Will try to bend
His stubborn Soul. -- Conduct me forthwith to him:
And if he now disdain my profer'd Kindness,
Destruction swallows him!

[Exeunt. SELIM discovered in Chains, Executioners, Officer, etc. and Rack.
SELIM. I pray you, Friends,
When I am dead, let not Indignity
Insult these poor Remains. See them interred
Close by my Father's Tomb! I ask no more.

OFFICER. They shall.

SELIM. How goes the Night?

OFFICER. Thy Hour of Fate,
The second Watch is near.

SELIM. Let it come on;
I am prepared.

Enter BARBAROSSA. BARBAROSSA. So -- raise him from the Ground. --
[They raise him. Perfidious Boy! Behold the just Rewards
Of Guilt and Treachery! -- Did thou not give
Thy forfeit Life, whenever I should behold
SELIM's detested Face?

SELIM. Then take it, Tyrant.

BARBAROSSA. Did thou not aim thy Dagger at my Heart?

SELIM. I did.

BARBAROSSA. Yet Heaven defeated thy Intent;
And saved me from the Dagger.

SELIM. It Is not ours,
To question Heaven. The Intent and not the Deed
Is in our Power: and therefore who dares greatly,
Does greatly.

BARBAROSSA. Yet bethink thee, stubborn Boy,
What Horrors now surround thee --

SELIM. Think thou, Tyrant,
I came so ill prepared? -- Thy Rage is weak,
Thy Torments pow'rless over the steady Mind:
He who could bravely dare, can bravely suffer.

BARBAROSSA. Yet, lo, I come, by Pity led, to spare thee.
Relent, and save ZAPHIRA! -- For the Bell
Even now expects the Sentinel, to toll
The Signal of thy Death.

SELIM. Let Guilt like thine
Tremble at Death: I scorn his darkest Frown.
Hence, Tyrant, nor profane my dying Hour!

BARBAROSSA. Then take thy Wish.
[Bell tolls. There goes the fatal Knell.
Thy Fate is sealed. -- Not all thy Mother's Tears,
Nor Prayers, nor Eloquence of Grief, shall save thee,
From instant Death. Yet ere the Assassin die,
Let Torment wring each Secret from his Heart.
The Traitor OTHMAN's fled; -- Conspiracy
Lurks in the Womb of Night, and threatens Ruin.
Spare not the Rack, nor cease, till it extort
The lurking Treason; and this Murderer call
On Death, to end his Woes.

[Exit BARBAROSSA. SELIM. Come on then.
[They bind him. Begin the Work of Death. -- what! bound with Cords,
Like a vile Criminal! -- O, valiant Friends,
When will ye give me Vengeance!

Enter IRENE. IRENE. Stop, O stop!
Hold your accursed Hands! -- On me, on me,
Pour all your Torments! -- How shall I approach thee!

SELIM. These are thy Father's Gifts! -- Yet thou art guiltless:
Then let me take thee to my Heart, thou best
Most amiable of Women!

IRENE. Rather curse me,
As the Betrayer of thy Virtue!

SELIM. Ah!

IRENE. 'Twas I -- my Fears, my frantic Fears betrayed thee!
Thus falling at thy Feet! may I but hope
For Pardon ere I die!

SELIM. Hence, to thy Father!

IRENE. Never, O never! -- Crawling in the Dust,
I Will clasp thy Feet, and bathe them with my Tears!
Tread me to Earth! I never will complain;
But my last Breath shall bless thee!

SELIM. Loved IRENE!
What has my Fury done?

IRENE. Indeed, 'twas hard!
But I was born to Sorrow!

SELIM. Melt me not.
I cannot bear thy Tears; -- They quite unman me!
Forgive the Transports of my Rage!

IRENE. Alas!
The Guilt is mine: -- Can thou forgive those Fears
That first awaked Suspicion in my Father!
Those Fears that have undone thee! -- Heaven is witness,
They meant not Ill to thee!

SELIM. None; none, IRENE!
No; 'twas the generous Voice of filial Love:
That, only, prompted thee to save a Father.
Yes; from my inmost Soul I do approve
That Virtue which destroys me.

IRENE. Can thou, then,
Forgive and pity me?

SELIM. I do, -- I do.

IRENE. On my Knees,
Thus let me thank thee, generous, injured Prince! --
Oh Earth and Heaven! That such unequaled Worth
Should meet so hard a Fate! -- That I -- That I --
Whom his Love rescued from the Depth of Woe,
Should be the accursed Destroyer! -- Strike, in Pity;
And end this hated Life!

SELIM. Cease, dear IRENE.
Submit to Heaven's high Will. -- I charge thee live;
And to thy utmost Power, protect from Wrong
My helpless, friendless, Mother!

IRENE. With my Life
I Will shield her from each Wrong. -- That Hope alone
Can tempt me to prolong a Life of Woe!

SELIM. O my ungoverned Rage! -- To frown on Thee!
Thus let me expiate the cruel Wrong,
[Embracing. And mingle Rapture with the Pains of Death!

OFFICER. No more. -- Prepare the Rack.

IRENE. Stand off, ye Fiends!
Here will I cling. No Power on Earth shall part us.
Till I have saved my SELIM!

[A Noise. OFFICER. Hark! what Noise
Strikes on mine Ear?

[A Noise. SELIM. Again!

ALADIN. [Without. Arm, arm! -- Treach'ry and Murder!

[Executioners go to seize SELIM. SELIM. Off Slaves! -- Or I will turn my
Chains to Arms,
And dash you Piecemeal! -- For I have heard a Sound,
Which lifts my towering Soul to ATLAS' Height,
That I could prop the Skies.

ALADIN. Where is the King?
The Foe pours in: The Palace Gates are burst:
The Sentinels are murdered! Save the King!
They seek him through the Palace!

OFFICER. Death and Ruin!
Follow me, Slaves, and save him.

[Ex. OFFICER and EXECUTIONER. SELIM. Now, bloody Tyrant! Now, thy Hour is come!

IRENE. What means yon mad'ning Tumult? -- O my Fears! --

SELIM. Vengeance at length has pierced these guilty Walls,
And walks her deadly Round!

IRENE. Whom do thou mean? my Father?

SELIM. Yes: Thy Father;
Who murdered mine!

IRENE. Is there no room for Mercy?
O SELIM! by our Love! --

SELIM. Thy Tears are vain!
Vain were thy Eloquence, though thou did plead
With an Archangel's Tongue!

IRENE. Spare but his Life!

SELIM. Heaven knows I pity thee. But he must bleed;
Though my own Lifeblood, nay, though thine, more dear,
Should issue at the Wound!

IRENE. Must he then die?
Let me but see my Father, ere he perish!
Let me but pay my parting Duty to him! --
[Clash of Swords. Hark! -- 'twas the Clash of Swords! Heaven save my Father!
O cruel, cruel SELIM!

[Exit IRENE. SELIM. Curse on this servile Chain, that binds me fast,
In pow'rless Ignominy; while my Sword
Should hunt its Prey, and cleave the Tyrant down!

OTHMAN. [Without. Where is the Prince!

SELIM. Here, OTHMAN, bound to Earth! --
Set me but free! -- O cursed, cursed Chain!

Enter OTHMAN and Party, who free SELIM. OTHMAN. O my brave Prince! -- Heaven
favors our Design.
[Embraces him. Take that: -- I need not bid thee use it nobly.

[Giving him a Sword. SELIM. Now, BARBAROSSA, let my Arm meet thine:
It Is all I ask of Heaven!

[Exit SELIM. OTHMAN. Guard ye the Prince --
[Part go out. Pursue his Steps. -- Now this Way let us turn,
And seek the Tyrant.

[Exeunt OTHMAN, etc. SCENE changes to the open Palace. Enter BARBAROSSA.
BARBAROSSA. Empire is lost, and Life: Yet brave Revenge
Shall close my Life in Glory.
Enter OTHMAN. Have I found thee,
Dissembling Traitor? -- Die! --

OTHMAN. Long has my Wish,
Pent in my struggling Breast, been robbed of Utterance.
Now Valor scorns the Mask. -- I dare thee, Tyrant!
And armed with Justice, thus would meet thy Rage,
Though thy red right Hand grasped the pointed Thunder!
Now, Heaven decide between us!

[They fight. BARBAROSSA. Coward!

OTHMAN. Tyrant!

BARBAROSSA. Traitor!

OTHMAN. Infernal Fiend, thy Words are fraught with Falsehood,
To combat Crimes like Thine, by Force or Wiles,
Is equal Glory.

[BARBAROSSA falls. BARBAROSSA. I faint! I die! -- O Horror!

Enter SELIM and SADI. SELIM. The Foe gives Way: Sure this Way went the Storm.
Where is the Tiger fled? -- What do I see?

SADI. ALGIERS is free!

OTHMAN. This Sabre did the Deed!

SELIM. I envy thee the Blow! -- Yet Valor scorns
To wound the fallen. -- But if Life remain,
I will speak Daggers to his guilty Soul! --
Hoa! BARBAROSSA! Tyrant! Murderer!
It Is SELIM, SELIM calls thee!

BARBAROSSA. Off, ye Fiends!
Torment me not! -- O, SELIM, art thou there! --
Swallow me Earth! Bury me deep, ye Mountains!
Accursed be the Day that gave me Birth!
Oh, that I had never wronged thee!

SELIM. Do thou then
Repent thee of thy Crimes! -- He does! He does!
He grasps my Hand! See the repentant Tear
Starts from his Eye! -- Do thou indeed repent? --
Why then I do forgive thee: From my Soul
I freely do forgive thee! -- And if Crimes,
Abhorred as thine, dare plead to Heaven for Mercy, --
May Heaven have Mercy on thee!

BARBAROSSA. Generous SELIM!
Too good, -- I have a Daughter! Oh, protect her! --
Let not my Crimes! --

[Dies. OTHMAN. There fled the guilty Soul!

SELIM. Haste to the City, -- stop the Rage of Slaughter.
Tell my brave People, that ALGIERS is free;
And Tyranny no more.

[Exeunt SLAVES. SADI. And, to confirm
The glorious Tidings, soon as Morning shines,
Be his dead Carcass dragged throughout the City,
A Spectacle of Horror!

SELIM. Curb thy Zeal.
Let us be Brave, not Cruel: Nor disgrace
Valor, by barbarous and inhuman Deeds.
Black was his Guilt: and he has paid his Life,
The Forfeit of his Crimes. Then sheath the Sword:
Let Vengeance die, -- Justice is satisfied!

Enter ZAPHIRA. ZAPHIRA. What mean these Horrors! -- wheresoe'er I turn
My trembling Steps, I find some dying Wretch,
Welt'ring in Gore! -- And do thou live, my SELIM!

SELIM. Lo, there he lies!

ZAPHIRA. The bloody Tyrant slain!
O righteous Heaven!

SELIM. Behold thy valiant Friends,
Whose Faith and Courage have overwhelmed the Power
Of BARBAROSSA. Here, once more, thy Virtues
Shall dignify the Throne and bless thy People.

ZAPHIRA. Just are thy Ways, O Heaven! -- Vain Terrors hence;
Once more ZAPHIRA'S blessed! -- My virtuous Son,
How shall I ever requite thy boundless Love!
Thus let me snatch thee to my longing Arms,
And on thy Bosom weep my Griefs away!

SELIM. O happy Hour! -- happy, beyond the Flight
Even of my ardent Hope! -- Look down, blessed Shade,
From the bright Realms of Bliss! -- Behold thy Queen
Unspotted, unseduc'd, unmoved in Virtue.
Behold the Tyrant prostrate at my Feet!
And to the Memory of thy bleeding Wrongs,
Accept this Sacrifice!

ZAPHIRA. My generous SELIM!

SELIM. Where is IRENE?

SADI. With Looks of Wildness, and distracted Mien,
She sought her Father where the Tumult raged:
She passed me, while the Coward ALADIN
Fled from my Sword: and as I cleft him down,
She fainted at the Sight.

OTHMAN. But straight recovered,
ZAMOR, our trusty Friend, at my Command,
Conveyed the weeping fair one to her Chamber.

SELIM. Thanks to thy generous Care: -- Come, let us seek
The afflicted Maid.

ZAPHIRA. Her Virtues might atone
For her Father's Guilt! -- Thy Throne be hers:
She merits all thy Love.

SELIM. Then haste, and find her. -- over her Father's Crimes
Pity shall draw her Veil; nay, half absolve them,
When she beholds the Virtues of his Child! --
Now let us thank the eternal Power: convinced,
That Heaven but tries our Virtue by Affliction:
That often the Cloud which wraps the present Hour,
Serves but to brighten all our future Days!

FINIS.
