THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH INSECTS.
PLATE CCLIII. PHALAENA PAVONIA, minor. fem. EMPEROR MOTH, female.
The male of this fine species of Phalaena has been given in the first Number
of this Work, with a promise that the female should be added in a future Plate.
The larva and pupa is represented with the male Insect; but we have also
introduced other caterpillars of the same species with the annexed figure, to
show the different stages of their growth. When young they are yellowish: the
tubercles black, with a stripe of the same on the segments of the joints. After
this, the yellow bands become orange, and the transverse black stripes appear
interrupted with longitudinal bands of pale green. Some are entirely green,
except the tubercles, which are yellow, and a small black speck on each joint;
and others are green, chequered with black, and marked on the side with a row
of semilunar spots. In the winged state, we find more permanent and
characteristic distinctions.

Linnaeus, and after him Fabricius, describes three varieties of Phalaena
Pavonia, a minor b med^a and g major. The first is the species found in this
country, and in the north of Europe. The existence of the second was formerly
disputed by some naturalists; and the last is so extremely different, at least
in point of magnitude, that we may almost venture to remove it entirely from
the two preceding.

The difference between the male and female of the common Emperor Moth is
strikingly obvious; the male is smaller than the female, and the colors in
general darker; the posterior wings also are orange in the male, and not so in
the female; and finally, the two sexes may be determined by the structure of
the antennae: those of the male being nearly oval, and very deeply feathered,
or pectinated, and those of the female being also pectinated, but so slightly
as to appear setaceous. As the structure of the antennae is an unerring
criterion by which the sexes are ascertained, the Phalaena Pavonia media is a
phenomenon in Entomology, for both the male and female so perfectly resembles
the female Emperor Moth, P. P. media, which we have figured, that it may be
mistaken for the same species: the female differs in no respect from it; and
the male only in the form of the antennae. We have received this remarkable
species from Italy and Germany. It is figured only by Esper, Phal. 3. tab. 3;
and is thus described by Linnaeus and Fabricius, b media: "singularis ob
soeminam ma^i simillimam." The third, P. Pavonia major, can by no means be
confounded with the preceding: our specimen of it is six inches in breadth, and
is also very bulky: it is found in the Pays de vaud. Roesel has given a figure
of both sexes with the larva and pupa. The winged Insect is of a dingy brown,
the marks somewhat similar to those of the common kind. The larva is large,
with the head small in proportion. The whole is of a citron green, furnished
with elevated tubercles, whose summits diverge into rays like a star, and are
of an azure blue color: it is also beset with a number of long filaments of
threads, each of which terminate in a little capitulum similar to the antennae
of a Butterfly.

FIG. I. I. PAPILIO PANISCUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the ends. Wings in general erect when
at rest. Fly by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire, divaricated; dark brown with
fulvous spots.

P. Paniscus is described by Fabricius as a native of Germany, and has been
lately added to the list of British Papiliones. In this country it seems a very
local species. It is deemed a rare Insect by Entomologists.

FIG. II. PAPILIO SYLVANUS. LEPIDOPTERA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings divaricated, brown, with square spots,
that appear yellow on the upper surface, whitish beneath.

HESPERIA SYLVANUS: alis divaricatis fuscis: maculis quadratis supra flavis
subtis albis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1. 326. 237.
Fabricius has no reference to any author for a figure of this species, nor is
it described by Linnaeus: this is the more remarkable, as the species is found
in great abundance in the months of May and June in this country, and is not
uncommon in Sweden and Germany.


PLATE CCLV.
FIG I. SCARABAEUS NUTANS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae terminate in a kind of club; which is
longitudinally divided into lamina, two, three, or seven in number. Second
joint of the anterior, or foremost legs, armed with spines.

The Water Betony Moth is a very abundant species; the larva feeds on the Moth
Mullien, or Water Betony plant, as its name implies. It is in the larva state
in July, becomes a pupa, and the fly is produced in April.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the ends. Wings erect when at rest. Fly
by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings dentated, chequered with black and
white, in irregular spots and lines. Beneath, one eye-spot on the anterior
wings, and five on the posterior ones.

This Insect is very common in the fly state in the month of June. It frequents
meadows, and is supposed to feed on grass in the larva state. The larva is very
seldom met with. It is thus described by some authors: Larva depressed, or
flattish, of a yellowish color, marked with an obscure line down the back and
sides. The Pupa blue, with a red tail Naturf. 14. tab. 2. fig 1. -- Fab. Ent.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the ends. Wings erect when at rest. Fly
by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings dentated, black with white spots. A red
stripe across the anterior wings, and another along the posterior margin of the
lower wings.

The red admirable Butterfly is certainly a very common species, but as one of
the most beautiful this country can boast of, is entitled to our particular
consideration.

The Caterpillars are of several kinds, according to the different stages of
growth. In the last skin they are green, with a yellow stripe on each side of
the belly, and beset with curiously ramified, or branching spines: sometimes
they are black, with a yellow belly, or black, variegated with red, brown, and
yellow The Chrysalis is of a dark color, ornamented with several spots of
shining gold. The Caterpillars are found on the nettle in June and July: it
remains in Chrysalis twenty-one days, and the Butterfly appears in August.
There are two broods of this species in general every season.


PLATE CCLXI.
FIG. I. I. HIPPOBOSCA EQUINA. HORSE, OR SPIDER FLY. DIPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Rostrum bivalve, cylindrical, obtuse and wavering. Antennae
short, setaceous. Without stemmata. Feet armed with many nails or crotchets.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings obtuse. Thorax variegated. Feet armed
with three crotchets.

Few species of Hippoboscae have hitherto been discovered. Four kinds were
known to Linnaeus, and Fabricius has not increased that number in either of his
Entomological Systems. A fifth species is described by Gmelin in the last
edition of the Systema Naturae, under the name of Uralensis Hippobosca
uralensis: atra hirsuta dorso ordinibus tribus vesicularum albarum nitentium.
Lepechin ^t. 1. t. 19. f. 9. habitat in deserto Uralensi.
. The species in the Entomologia Systematica of Fabricius, are Equina,
Avicularia, Hirundinis, and Lovina. The first is rather larger than the others,
and is well known by the common name of Horse Fly, because it frequently
molests those animals, and attaching itself to their bodies, penetrates the
skin, and sucks their blood. The three other species are also natives of this
country, and like the H. equina, subsists on the blood of certain animals. The
H. avicularia is found chiefly on the bodies of birds, and H. hirudinis more
especially on swallows. These creatures are all of a disgusting form, flat, and
hard: they adhere very tenaciously by means of the nails or crotchets of their
talons, which in this genus are numerous; and are not easily killed by
pressure. The H. equina has three sharp incurvated nails to each foot, the H.
hirundinis is furnished with twice that number on each.

FIG. II. HIPPOBOSCA AVICULARIA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings obtuse. Thorax without spots, and of
one color.

1010. 2. -- Fn. Sv. 1922. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. 4. p. 415. 2.
The figure of Hippobosca avicularia in the works of Sulzer nearly agrees with
our insect, except in color; it is of a dull brown, with less of the green
cast.


PLATE CCLXII.
FIG. I. I. PHALAENA ATRIPLICIS. WILD ARRACH MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base, wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested, anterior wings, brown,
clouded and marked with undulated streaks, and a two-cleft or forked yellow
mark in the middle.

sp. 282. Roes. Ins. 1. phal. 2. tab. 31.
This species is noticed by Harris and Berkenhout, as a native of Great
Britain, under the trivial name of Wild arrach Moth; we have ever considered it
a local species. It is found in Cambridgeshire, the Caterpillar in August, the
Fly in September. The wild orach and common dock are its favorite food.

FIG. II. II. PHALAENA UMBRATICA. SHARK MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, lanceolated,
greyish, striated longitudinally with pale black. A faint reddish dash in the
middle, marked with two black spots.

The larva of Phalaena Umbratica is sometimes of a dirty brown, with spots of
clay color; it feeds on the sow thistle; changes into the Chrysalis state in
May, and the Flies appear in June.


PLATE CCLXIII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA PINETELLA. PEARL VENEER MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae, taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed,
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First wings yellowish brown, with two large
whitish, or pearl-like spots on each.

We met with a specimen of this beautiful little Moth, in June 1798, in
Norwood. It is certainly a rare and interesting British species; though long
since known to collectors of Insects by the trivial English name above adopted.
It may not be improper to add, that this specimen was found in a willow tree,
as those continental Authors who have noticed it, say it inhabits pine trees.

FIG. II. PHALAENA COLONELLA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First wings oblong, greyish, with two black
spots in the center. A faint undulated bar across the interior, and another
near the exterior part of each wing.

FIG I. LUCANUS PARALELEPIPEDUS. SMALL BLACK STAG BEETLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae terminate in a club or knob compressed on one
side, and divided into laminae or teeth. Maxillae or jaws, strong, porrected
before the head, and armed with teeth.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black: body depressed. Maxillae furnished
with a large elevated tooth on the interior side.

Three species of Lucani are found in this country. The largest is Lucanus
Cervus, of which a figure has been given in the early part of this Work. The
present species and L. caraboides complete the list of British Lucani.

The first kind is known to live in the larva state in decayed wood, and it is
supposed the same habits of life belong to others of this tribe. Lucanus
Paralelepipedus ranks amongst the rarest Coleopterous insects of this country;
in Denmark and Germany it is not uncommon.

FIG. II. SCARABAEUS MELOLONTHA. TREE BEETLE, or COCKCHAFER.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae terminate in a kind of club, which is
longitudinally divided into laminae. Second joint of the anterior legs, armed
with spines.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Furnished with scutellum. Brown. Thorax
hairy. Tail bent or inflected, a triangular white spot at each incisure of the
abdomen.

The Cockchafer is found in the greatest abundance throughout Europe, and in
some countries are infinitely more detrimental to agriculture than in England.
In the larva state, it lies buried beneath the surface of the earth, where it
does incredible mischief by devouring the roots of plants. After remaining
three years in the larva state it becomes a winged Insect, and leaving its
subterraneous habitation, is not less detrimental to the corn and other kinds
of grain, and also to trees; particularly the Oak. In some seasons, when they
are numerous, we find the Oak stripped of its leaves, and otherwise much
injured by these voracious animals. About noon the Cockchafers collect in
considerable multitudes among the leaves of the lower boughs of the Oak, when
they may be easily taken, by shaking or beating them into baskets, etc.

Several varieties of this species are mentioned by authors; particularly one
with a red thorax, by Roesel.

FIG. III. SCARABAEUS STERCORARIUS. COMMON DOR, or CLOCK BEETLE.
Both thorax and head without spines.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Furnished with scutellum. Black: clypeus rhombic with a
small elevation or protuberance in the middle. Wing cases furrowed.

Like the preceding species, this Beetle lives in the larva state in the earth.
The Winged Insect is found in the dung of animals, carrion, etc. Few insects
are found more numerous or general throughout Europe than this. The color is
black, with very vivid glosses of shining blue, green, and purple, in different
specimens; and we have a variety of it from the south of Europe that is
entirely of a dull reddish color.


PLATE CCLXV. PHALAENA JOTA. GOLDEN i MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Anterior wings ferruginous
red, variously shaded, and marked in the center with an inverted golden i.

Linnaeus very accurately described this Insect under the specific name Iota in
the early edition of the Systema Naturae. It is given as a native of Germany,
and without a reference to any figure. Fabricius has followed the same
description throughout all his works, without noticing any figure of it also,
until the Entomologia Systematica appeared, when a reference is given to tab.
5. Phal. 3. Vol. I. of Roesel's Insects. This is however erroneous, for
Linnaeus includes that reference among the Synonyms of his Phalaena Gamma, and
Gmelin, his latest editor, continues the same amongst the Synonyms of Gamma
likewise. Klemann, who revised the last edition of Roesel's work, is decidedly
of opinion, that the figure is that of Gamma, and assigns the Linnaean specific
name to it accordingly. Whatever reason influenced the opinion of Fabricius,
that the figure in question was the true Phalaena Iota of Linnaeus, when that
author himself says otherwise, is not mentioned by Fabricius, and is by no
means clear to us; but one circumstance cannot escape observation: Fabricius
has in no instance referred to the figure in Roesel's plate before the
publication of his last work, though all the other Synonyms of Phalaena Gamma
are the same in every edition of the Fabrician systems as in those of his
predecessor, Linnaeus.

This Insect is very beautiful, and much rarer than the following species. It
is found on the common, and white dead nettles, or archangel. The larva has
twelve feet; is without hairs, green; and spotted with white. The Moth appears
in June.

Phalaena Gamma is one of those species which feed indifferently on many kinds
of plant. It is often found amongst nettles and other low herbage, or in
gardens amongst cabbages, etc. It is of a green color, with pale or whitish
longitudinal stripes on the back, and the sides yellow. The Moth is found in
August and September.

Linnaeus and Fabricius describe only the male of this species; the female is
rather larger, the color pale brown, with markings similar to those of the
other sex, but of a reddish color. The characteristic black line, with white
spots on the posterior wing, is the same as in the male Insect.

This Moth derives its specific name, Lemnata, from the food of its
Caterpillar, or larva, which is usually some species of lemna, (duckweed) or
other aquatic plant. In the winged state it is a very common Insect,
particularly in marshy ground, and the sides of ponds and ditches. In general
we find two broods of them in the summer; the first appears in May, the second
in July or August.

FIG. III. PHALAENA DECUSSATA. PRETTY WIDOW MOTH. GEOMETRA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous. Wings cinereous, with four black
streaks: the two middle ones of a serpentine form, and crossing each other.
Several undulated dotted black lines.

PHALAENA DECUSSATA: selicornis, alis cinereis; strigis quatuor, mediis

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae, taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed,
when at rest. Fly by night.

TINEA. SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black, bronzed, or changeable to gold.
A yellow indented band across the anterior wings. Antennae very long.

3. p. 2. p. 341. 40.
The two sexes of this beautiful and extraordinary little Insect has been
described as two distinct species. They differ principally in the form and size
of the antennae; in the female these are entirely setaceous, or like a fine
hair, three times the length of the whole body: the antennae in the male are
shorter, and are thick in the middle, not very unlike those of some kinds of
Sphinges. It is not uncommon in hedges in May and June.

FIG. III. III. PHALAENA PODAELLA. SCARCE JAPANNED MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA. TINEA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae very long. Wings golden black. A
narrow gold or yellow line of equal breadth across the anterior wings.

PHALAENA PODELLA: antennis longissimis, alis nigro-aeneis, anticis fascia
equali angusta aurea. PHALAENA PODELLA: antennis mediocribus alis nigris fascia
albida. Linn. Syst. Not. 896. 428. Alucita Podaella. Fab. Ent. Syst. 3. p. 2.
341. n. 42.
Like the preceding species, the two sexes of PHALAENA Tinea PODAELLA are
distinguished by the different form of the antennae; and Linnaeus has evidently
described only the male, or he would not have defined it -- "Antennis
mediocribus," for the antennae of the female are remarkably long.

The reference made by Fabricius to Geoff. Ins. 2. 194. 32. for this Insect, is
certainly erroneous; for the Insect therein described is stated to have a white
band across the four wings, a white point near the exterior margin of the upper
wings, and a small transverse white mark toward the base. Linnaeus does not
quote Geoffroy for this Insect; and it is evident, Fabricius has confined his
reading to the Latin specific description, which certainly agrees with the
Linnaean description of Podaella in the Syst. Not.

The natural size and magnified appearance is shown at Fig. III. III.

The Sphinges are only, in a few instances, remarkable for that gaiety and
splendor of colors, which render the Butterfly tribe so pleasing and
interesting to general observers. There is, however, a peculiar grace and
elegance of form throughout the Sphinges, which immediately distinguish them
from the Phalaenae, or third tribe of Lepidopterous Insects; and their colors,
though chaste or obscure, are, for the most part, very prettily diversified.
The Sphinges of Great Britain are not numerous; and, in general, the more
beautiful kinds are rare. The Sphinx Ocellata is certainly an exception to such
remark, for we have not a finer or more abundant species of the tribe in this
country. It is also no less common in other parts of Europe; and few authors,
who have treated on the Entomology of any country in Europe, have neglected to
give it a place in their works.

The larva of the Sphinx Ocellata is found on the willow, in May, June, and
July, when it becomes a pupa, and remains in the earth till June following; and
then comes forth in the perfect state.


PLATE CCLXX. GRYLLUS MIGRATORIUS. MIGRATORY LOCUST.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Head inflected, armed with jaws, and furnished with palpi.
Wings wrapped round the sides of the body, and concealed under the elytra. Feet
armed, with two nails. Posterior legs formed for leaping.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax of one segment, and somewhat keeled,
or rising in a longitudinal line, in the middle; mandibules blue.

The Gryllus Migratorius, or Migratory Locust, has always been classed amongst
the Insects of this country on local authority. It certainly visited Great
Britain in the year 1748, and several small flocks of them were seen in the
environs of London, where they caused much consternation, according to the
authors of that time. M. Edwards in particular, gave a figure, and a short
account of it in his History of Birds, [Plate 208] under the name of Great
Brown Locust. It is not certain that they have appeared, at least in
considerable numbers in this country, since that period; and it is probable, if
any specimens of them were then collected, they are now lost; for we have not
hitherto been able to ascertain, precisely, an English specimen of it in any
cabinet, and this consideration alone, has induced us to defer adding this
remarkable creature to our illustration of British Insects.

In the month of September, 1799, LADY AYLESFORD most obligingly communicated a
living specimen of it to us, and we deem ourselves particularly fortunate in
the opportunity it affords us to ascertain the difference, however
inconsiderable, between the variety found in England and those of warmer
countries. It is represented in the annexed plate, both in a resting position
and with the wings expanded. This specimen was found in a barley field near
Packington in Warwickshire. It lived several days after its arrival in London,
and would probably have survived much longer had it not been injured in the
journey, and weakened by long confinement. We remarked, that in feeding, it
cuts the stalk asunder in the middle, or near the root, and tearing off the
leaves, eats only the pith; this may, in some measure, account for the great
mischief and depredation these creatures commit, when they settle in vast
numbers on any tract of cultivated land.

Though we regard the Gryllus Migratorius as an object of curiosity in this
country, in many others they are the terror of the inhabitants. We are not,
perhaps, to admit implicitly the relations of all authors, but in those of
credibility and information, we find abundant reason to hope it may ever
remain, as at present, a rare British species. It is said to be very numerous
in Tartary, from whence at certain periods it migrates westward, and visits the
south of Europe in incredible quantities. Of all the authors who have treated
on the history of this Insect, none are more satisfactory than Roesel; his
observations are given in detail, but they are the result of useful
information, and may be deemed a proper sequel to our concise account of it;
when we consider that his observations relate to the same event and time, the
legions of Locusts that appeared in this country, and throughout Europe in 1748.

Under the section Der Heuscbrecten urd Grillensammlung, etc. etc. Vol. II. p.
103.
"I have already," says Roesel, "given particulars of those dangerous guests in
the beginning of the year 1749, and at the same time added figures of them
Referring to his plate 24, of LOCUSTA GERMANICA and description of the Insects
annexed.
. I shall now only observe, that in the course of the same year, they not only
appeared in Poland, Hungary, Austria, Bohemia, Silesia, Bavaria, but also in
Franconia, and consequently in the environs of our city. Thanks be to God, they
have not been numerous about our city, but from Windsheim we have intelligence
of the third of September, that they had frightened the inhabitants with their
legions, but they departed again on the fourth; since then, a much respected
patron has kindly sent me, the IMPERIAL AND ROYAL HUNGARIAN EDICT of the
present year 1749, together with a printed description of the Insect, and
proper instructions to the imperial subjects, how to extirpate them, and I
thought it necessary, as they contain much good and useful matter, to insert
them." Then he proceeds with Beschreibung Deren Anno 1747, etc. etc. or a
description of the Locust, as given in the Imperial Edict, etc. In the course
of which, and the description in page 145, we are informed, that this Locust
lives three years. The female deposits her eggs in a kind of bag; the eggs are
about a quarter of an inch in length: of a slender oblong form, and placed
within the bag lengthwise, so as to form four or five tiers. It is most advised
to dig for them in this state, and burn them; or if they should alight in the
winged state, as it is known that the noise of bells, etc. will allure them to
any particular spot, it is recommended to form deep ditches, and decoy, drive,
or beat them into the water in multitudes.


PLATE CCLXXI. PAPILIO HYPERANTHUS. RINGLET BUTTERFLY.

The larva of this Butterfly is very rarely met with; it feeds on the roots of
grass; is hairy, of an ash color, with a black line down the side, and the
tail forked. The pupa is gibbous, brown, and spotted with yellow.

Papilio Hyperanthus is found in the winged state in June and July. It
frequents lanes, and hedges on dry and elevated banks, such as are common in
the sandy and chalky soils of Kent.


PLATE CCLXXII. PHALAENA FURCULA. KITTEN MOTH.

Phalaena Furcula is a neat and interesting British Insect. Except in size it
is very similar to Phalaena Vinula; and the Aurelians, from this similarity,
and a fanciful reference to the brindled appearance of the anterior wings, have
whimsically, but not inaptly, given their English trivial names: Phalaena
Vinula, being the largest, is called the Puss Moth; and Phalaena Furcula, the
Kitten. The last is rare: Phalaena Vinula very common.

The larva is found on the willow in July. It remains in the pupa state the
whole winter: the Moth comes forth in May.


PLATE CCLXXIII. CHRYSOMELA NITIDULA.

FIG. I. II. PHALAENA HUMULI. GHOST MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed

The male and female of Phalaena Humuli are very dissimilar, and may easily be
mistaken for distinct species. The male is perfectly white, with a gloss like
satin, the abdomen, antennae, and margin of the wings excepted, for these are
reddish brown. The female is of a fine yellow color, with several fulvous or
orange marks; and is somewhat larger than the other sex.

The larva lives in the earth, at the roots of the Burdock and hop. It is of a
very pale or whitish color, with a brown head, and sixteen feet.

FIG. III. PHALAENA HECTA. GOLDEN SWIFT MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER, AND SYNONYMS. Wings deflexed. Yellow brown. Two oblique,
whitish, or yellow bands, consisting of interrupted and irregular spots, across
the anterior wings.

Ins. 1. tab. 7. fig. 11.
This species is common in the skirts of woods in May and June. The colors in
the male Insect are more vivid than the female, and the spots on the anterior
wings in particular are of such a beautiful yellow, that English collectors
have termed this kind the Golden Swift Moth.

It commences its flight earlier in the evening than any other of the nocturnal
lepidopterous insects. Its manner of flying is very singular, and attracted the
notice of Linnaeus, who aptly compares it to the motion of the pendulum of a
clock.

The larva is unknown: it is supposed to feed on the roots of plants under
ground.


PLATE CCLXXV. PHALAENA ALNIARIA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae feathered. Wings yellow, speckled
with brown, and marked with two transverse streaks. Margins deeply indentated.

Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 136. Sp. 24. Schaeff. Icon. tab. 135. fig. 1, 2.

This Insect is analogous to several other species of British Phalaenae, known
amongst collectors by the indefinite term, Thorn Moths. It is remarkable only
in the larva state, when, from its similarity in form and color to a twig of
the tree on which it feeds, it is supposed to escape the notice of its enemies.
It is a dull creature, and will often remain in an oblique, or erect position,
without motion, or appearance of life, for several hours together.

It is found on fruit trees, in the state of larva, in May: the Moth appears in
August or September.


PLATE CCLXXVI. CHRYSOMELA TENEBRICOSA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae composed of globular articulations, which increase

This Creature is entirely of a black color, glossed, in some specimens, with
shining blue; in others, with purple. Those colors are particularly vivid on
the legs and underside of the Insect. It is very common during most part of the
summer.


PLATE CCLXXVII.
FIG. I. PHRYGANEA VARIA? NEUROPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth furnished with four palpi. Stemmata three. Antennae
longer than the thorax. First wings incumbent. Second wings folded.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings greyish brown, variegated with black, and spotted in
the middle with white.

PHRYGANEA VARIA: alis cinereo, nigroque variis: puncto medio distincto niveo,
antennis nigris. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 2. p. 77, 103.
The Phryganea Varia of Fabricius has not been figured by any author; but is,
we suspect, no other than a small variety of P. Grandis, and which Linnaeus
describes as alis cinereo testaceis, lineolis duabus longitudinalibus nigris,
puncto albo. Fabricius has altered this definition to "alis testaceis cinereo
maculatis," in the Entomologia Systematica, and erroneously attributes the
latter to Linnaeus.

We cannot avoid, in support of our opinion, noticing the striking
dissimilarity between the several figures of Phryganea Grandis, in our copies
of the works quoted by Linnaeus and Fabricius. Roesel has two figures, one of a
bluish gray, the other yellowish brown; both vary in the markings, and are
nearly twice the size of our specimen. In Sulzer, the wings are shorter and
more pointed than in the preceding work; and are rather pellucid and tinged
with yellow: the markings totally different from those in Roesel. Those in
Schaeffer are most like one of our specimens in form and reddish color, but
still with markings as different from it as from either of the preceding
figures. We may hence conclude the marks are inconstant, and the colors
extremely variable; and that in point of size, the present species may be the
Varia of Fabricius, since he notices its affinity to the P. Grandis; and adds,
it is rather smaller. -- "Nimis Affinis P. Grandis at paullo minor." Fab. Ent.

Extremely common in summer. It is a very delicate little creature, greenish,
the wings reticulated, perfectly transparent, with various beautiful, pearly,
reddish, greenish, and yellowish glosses. The eye is large, globular, and has
the appearance of gold, whence its English trivial name. Stink much before a
thunder-storm.

There is a striking similarity in form and color between this species and
Papilio Urticae, already figured in this work. Collectors have hence
denominated the two species the Tortoiseshell Butterflies; they differ,
however, materially in size, as well as manner of life. The smallest kind is
very common, and its larva feeds on the Nettle; the present species is found on
the Elm, frequents woods, and is very scarce.

The larva is found in June; it becomes a pupa in the same month; and after
remaining in that state twenty-one days, the winged Insect is produced.


PLATE CCLXXIX. PAPILIO MEGAERA. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the end. Wings in general deflexed when

The Phalaena Fagana is not one of the rarer British species; it claims
attention for its singular and beautiful appearance only. The larva is found on
the oak in August and September: in the beginning of October, it spins a very
extraordinary kind of covering on a leaf of the oak, and becomes a pupa within.
This covering somewhat resembles a tent, or rather an inverted boat, being
shuttle formed, and having a keel, or longitudinal ridge along the upper part:
its color is yellowish brown; the pupa underneath is purple. The Moth appears
in the winged state in May

The discovery of this minute but rare species of Buprestis in this country, is
due to Alexander M'Leay, Esquire. -- It was found in a puddle, on the road side,
near Coombe Wood, in the month of May last. The specimen is represented in the
annexed plate; the smallest figure denotes the natural size.


PLATE CCLXXXIII. PHALAENA MELLONELLA. HONEY MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper toward the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

TINEA. SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Anterior wings gray: posterior part
purple. Scutellum black, white at the tip.

P. TINEA MELLONELLA: alis canis posticis purpurascentibus: striga alba,
scutello nigro apice candido. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 888. 375. -- Fn. Sv. 1383. --
Fab. Ent. Syst. 3. p. 2. 305. Sp. 79. Reaum. Ins. 3. tab. 19. fig. 79.
The larva of this species is sometimes found in bee-hives; it insinuates
itself amongst the cells of those Insects, and subsists on the honey. It
remains in the pupa state in a long cylindrical channel or passage it forms in
the larva state: the winged Insect comes forth in August.


PLATE CCLXXXIV. SPHINX LIGUSTRI. PRIVET SPHINX, or HAWK MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire. Posterior pair red, with three
black bars across. Abdomen red, with black belts.

SPHINX LIGUSTRI: alis integris posticis rufis; fasciis tribus nigris, abdomine
rubro: cingulis nigris. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 779. 8. Fn. Sv. 1087. Sphinx
Ligustri: Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1. 374. 55. Roes. Ins. 3. tab. 5. Degeer.
Ins. 1. tab. 1. fig. 6. Schaeff. Elen. tab. 116. fig. 2. Albin. Ins. tab. 7.
fig. 10. Esp. Ins. 2. tab. 6. Reaum. Ins. 2. tab. 20, fig. 1 -- 4.
The larva of this beautiful species is found very frequently on the Privet in
the months of July and August. It buries itself in the earth preparatory to its
becoming a pupa, and comes forth in the fly state in June following.


PLATE CCLXXXV. CASSIDA MACULATA. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae nearly filiform, but increasing in bulk toward
the extremity. Margin of the elytra broad. Head concealed under the thorax.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Greenish, variegated with spots of black on
the elytra, particularly along the future of the back.

CASSIDA MACULATA: viridibus elytris rarius, sutura dorsali confertius nigro
maculatis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 575. 6. Fab. Syst. Ent. 88. 2. Cassida viridis
maculis nigris variegata. Geoff. Ins. 1. 314. 5. tab. 5. fig. 6.
Has been supposed only a variety of Cassida viridis, but is evidently a
distinct species, and is very uncommon in England.

Fig. I. The natural size.


PLATE CCLXXXVI.
FIG I. CHRYSOMELA MARSHAMI.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae articulated, larger toward the end. Thorax and
elytra without margin.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Thorax greenish gold. Wing-cases coppery, irregularly
punctated.

CHRYSOMELA MARSHAMI: thorace viridi aeneo, elytris cupreis vage punctatis.
As the British Coleoptera are in few instances remarkable for that splendid
glow and gaiety of colors which distinguish those of warmer climates, we are
more inclined to admire the beauty of this recently discovered species of
Chrysomela. It appears not to have been noticed by any preceding author; and as
it remains with us to designate some specific appellation, we have named it
Marshami, in compliment to that eminent entomologist T. Marsham, Esquire. -- a
name, perhaps, the more appropriate, as it is known among that gentleman's
scientific friends the world will soon be favored with his invaluable papers
on British Coleoptera.

This Insect is nearly allied to C. Fastuosa and C. Hypericum. -- Found in
Norwood last May.

FIG. II. CHRYSOMELA GOETTINGENSIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Oval black, glossed with purple. Legs purple. Tarsi
reddish.

CHRYSOMELA GOETTINGENSIS: ovata atra pedibus violaceis: plantis rufis. Linn.
Syst. Not. 2. 586. 4. -- Fn. Sv. 506. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 1. p. 309. Degeer.
Ins. 5. 298. 8.
A rare species in this country; very common in Germany.


PLATE CCLXXXVII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA PAPILIONARIA. LARGE EMERALD MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae feathered. Wings green: a continued streak of
whitish semicircular marks across the middle of each, and an interrupted or
half streak of the same color below it.

PHALAENA PAPILIONARIA: pectinicornis alis subrepandis viridibus: striga
sesquialtera repanda. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 864. 225. -- Fn. Sv. 1247. Wien.
Verz. 96. 1. Roes. Ins. 4. tab. 18. fig. 3.
A rare and very elegant British species. The larva is green, with about ten
incurvated spines or hooks along the back. It is found in this state on the
Birch and Alder in June, changes to the pupa the latter end of the same month,
and appears on the wing fourteen days after.

The pupa is green variegated with yellow.

FIG. II. PHALAENA PENNARIA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae feathered; Wings indented reddish: two dark
streaks across the anterior pair, and a distinct white spot near the apex.

PHALAENA PENNARIA: pectinicornis alis subdentatis rufescentibus: strigis
duabus fuscis punctoque apicis albo. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 861. 209. -- Fab. Ent.
Syst. 3. p. 2. 132. 14.
The larva smooth reddish brown; found on Fruit Trees.

FIG. III. PHALAENA BILINEATA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous, Wings yellow undulated with brown
streaks, and a broad wave across the anterior pair.

PHALAENA BILINEATA: seticornis alis luteis testaceo undatis: fascia repanda,
margin fusco. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 868. 245. -- Fn. Sv. 1284. Clerk. Icon. tab.
6. fig. 13.
Very abundant in White-thorn hedges during most part of the Summer.


PLATE CCLXXXVIII.
FIG. I. I. CICADA NITIDULA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Rostrum bent inwards. Antennae setaceous. Wings
membranaceous declining along the sides of the body.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Yellow. Wing-cases transparent, whitish, with two dark
transverse bars.

CICADA NITIDULA: flava, elytris hyalino albis, faciis duabus nigris. Fab. Ent.
Syst. 4. p. 46. n. 87.
This minute species is represented in the natural size at Fig. I. The upper
figure exhibits its magnified appearance.

FIG. II. CICADA FLAVOSTRIATA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Black. Head and Thorax transversely streaked with yellow;
streaks on the wing-cases of the same color, disposed longitudinally.

CICADA FLAVOSTRIATA: nigra, capite thoraceque transverse ytrisque
longitudinaliter flavo-striatis.
This Insect has been confounded with the Cicada striata of Linnaeus, Faun.
Suec. 887. and Syst. Not. 709. n. 30. in general; but it is certainly not that
species. Linnaeus refers to Geoff. 1. p. 424. n. 20. for C. striata, wherein it
is thus described; "Head pale green, with two black points in front, and four
near the base; Thorax of the same color, marked with several less distinct
black spots also." We therefore consider our C. flavostriata as a new species.
