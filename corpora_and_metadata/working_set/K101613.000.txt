THE TEARS and TRIUMP^ OF PARNASSUS AN ODE for MUSIC, As it is performed at
the THEATER ROYAL IN DRURY LANE.

LONDON: Printed for P. VAILLANT, in the Strand MD^^^ [Price Sixpence.]

THE TEARS and TRIUMPH, etc.
The Scene discovers APOLLO and the NINE MUS^^ in their proper Habits.

APOLLO. FATE gave the Word; the Deed is done;
AUGUSTUS is no more;
His great Career of Fame is run,
And all the Loss deplore.
The Muses tear off their Laurel^*
CALLIOPE. Well, Sisters of the sacred Spring,
Well may you rend your golden Hair;
Well may you now your Dirges sing,
And pierce with cries the troubled Air.

CHORUS. Fate gave the Word, etc.

CLIO. Founded in Justice was his Sway;
Ambition never marked his Way.

CALLIOPE. Unless the best Ambition that can fire
A Monarch's Breast and all his Soul inspire,
The generous Purpose of the noble Mind,
The best Ambition -- to serve Human Kind.

APOLLO. Yes, Virgins, yes; that Wish sublime
Ranked him with those of earliest Time,
Who for a People's Welfare strove;
Whose Spirits breathe aetherial Air,
And for their Meed of earthly Care,
Drink Nectar with Olympian Jove.

CALLIOPE. Oh! TRUTH! fair Daughter of the Sky,
And MERCY! -- that with asking Eye
Near the OMNIPOTENT do stand;
And, when Mankind provoke his Rage,
Do clasp his Knees, his Wrath assuage,
And win the Thunder from his Hand!

CLIO. Oh! white-rob'd FAITH! caelestial Maid!
Twin-born with JUSTICE! by whose Aid
He lived the Guardian of the Laws;
Dear LIBERTY! round ALBION'S Isle
That bid'st eternal Sunshine smile,
Who now will guard your sacred Cause?

CHORUS. Dear Liberty, etc.

CALLIOPE. Where were ye, Muses, when the fatal Sheers
The FURY raised, to close his reverend Years?
But ah! vain wish! -- you could not stop the Blow;
No Omen warned ye of the impending Woe.

APOLLO. See! where BRITANNIA stands
With close-infolded Hands,
On yonder sea-beat Shore!
Behold her languid Air!
Lo! her dishevelled Hair!
Majesty now no more!
Still on the sullen Wave her Eye is bent,
The TRIDENT of the MAIN thrown idle by;
OLD THAMES, his seagreen Mantle rent,
Inverts his Urn, and heaves a doleful Sigh.
Hark! to the Winds and Waves
Frantic with Grief she raves,
And, Cruel Gods! she cries;
Each chalky Cliff around,
Each Rock returns the Sound,
And, Cruel Gods! replies.

CALLIOPE. See! the Procession sad and slow,
Walks in a solemn Pomp of Woe
Through awful Arches, gloomy Isles,
And Rows of monumental Piles,
Where lie the venerable Just,
Where Heroes moulder into Dust.
Now quietly inurn'd he lies,
Pale! pale! inanimate and cold!
Where round him baleful Vapors rise,
'Midst Bones of Legislators old!

CLIO. Of him who sought the ambitious Gaul
Oe'r thick-embattled Plains,
Who felt, who lived, and reigned for all,
This only now remains.

APOLLO. Bring, in Handfuls, Lillies bring
Bring me all the flowery Spring.
Scatter Roses on his Bier;
Ever honored, ever dear!

CHORUS. Scatter Roses, etc.

MERCURY descends. No more, harmonious Progeny of Jove,
No more let funeral Accents rise;
The great, the good AUGUSTUS reigns above,
Translated to his kindred Skies.

CLIO. No more for my Historic Page --

CALLIOPE. No more for my great Epic Rage --

BOTH.

Will by the Hero now be done --

CHORUS. His great Career of Fame is run,
And all the Loss deplore.
Enter MARS. Lo! Mars, from his beloved Land,
Where Freedom long has fixed her Stand,
Bids ye collect your flowing Hair,
And again the Laurel wear.
For See! BRITANNIA rears her drooping Head;
Again resumes her TRIDENT of the Main;
THAMES takes his Urn, and seeks his watery Bed,
While gay Content sits smiling on the Plain.
Hark! a glad Voice
Proclaims the People's Choice.

CHORUS, within the Scenes. He is our Liege, our rightful Lord!
Of Heart and Tongue with one Accord
We all will sing
Long live the King!
He is our Liege! -- he! -- he alone!
With BRITISH HEART he mounts the Throne;
Around him throngs a loyal Band;
He will protect his NATIVE LAND!
He is our Liege, etc.
The Muses rise and put on their Laurels.
CALLIOPE. The Muses now their Heads shall raise;
The Arts to Life shall spring;
Virgins, we'll trim our withered Bays,
And wake each vocal String;
Now shall the Sculptor's happy Skill
Touch the rude Stone to Life;
The Painter shall his Canvass fill,
Pleas^d with his mimic Strife.

CLIO. Sweet MERCY! FAITH! CAELESTIAL TRUTH!
Now by your Aid the Royal Youth
Shall live the Guardian of the Laws;
Dear LIBERTY! round ALBION'S Isle
That bid'st eternal Sunshine smile,
He now will guard your sacred Cause.

APOLLO. Blessed Prince! whose Subjects in each adverse Hour
For Freedom still have stood!
Blessed Isle! whose Prince but deems the sovereign Pow^^
The Power of doing Good!

MARS. Now open all your Helicon; explore
Of Harmony the loftiest Store;
Let the Drum beat Alarms,
Such as rouse us to Arms;
The Trumpet's shrill Clangor shall pierce through the Sky
Swell the Rapture, swell it high;
And in Notes sublime and clear
Pour the strong Melody, that Heaven may hear.

APOLLO. Nothing mortal will I found;
Lo! the Flame, the Flame divine!
High I mount, I quit the Ground,
Holy Fury! I am thine.
With Rage possessed
Big swells my Breast!
In Visions rapt, before my Sight appears
A brighter Order of increasing Years.

MARS. I see the Rhine devolve his Flood
Deep-crimson'd with the Gallic Blood!
I hear, I hear the distant Roar
Of Ruin on yon hostile Shore!
I see, YOUNG PRINCE, to thee I see
The savage Indian bend the Knee!
Lo! AFRIC from her sable Kings
Her richest Stores in Tribute brings!
And farthest IND, beneath the rising Day
Lays down her Arms, and venerates thy Sway.

CALLIOPE. I see Bellona banished far!
I see him close the Gates of War,
While purple Rage within
With ghastly Ire shall grin,
And rolling his Terrific Eyes,
Where round him Heaps of Arms arise,
Bound with a hundred brazen Chains,
In vain shall foam, and thirst for sanguine Plains.

CLIO. Sweet Peace returns;
Over Albion's Sons
She waves her Dove-like Wing:
On every Plain
The Shepherd Train
Their artless Loves shall sing.
Pale DISCORD shall fly
From the Light of the Sky,
To black Cocytus hurled;
There, there shall feel
Ixion's Wheel,
The Furies with their Serpents curled;
With the unceasing Toil shall groan
Of the unconquerable Stone,
And leave in Harmony the British World.

APOLLO. Proceed great Days; lead on the auspicious Years;
Such Years ( -- for Lo! the Scene of Fate appears!)
Such Years, the DESTINIES have said, shall roll;
Jove nods Consent, and Thunder shakes the Pole.

FINIS.
POSTSCRIPT.
IT occurred to the Author of this little Piece, that, amidst (...) the general
Condolence and Congratulations of the People, (...) Theater should not be
silent. He therefore put together (...) foregoing Lines, and gave them to the
Managers, who ^ave selected as much to be set to Music as the Shortness of
^ime would permit.
