TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS, ON HIS LATE RESIGNATION AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY, THESE
LINES ARE INSCRIBED,

BY HIS OBEDIENT, HUMBLE SERVANT, EDWD JERNINGHAM.

LINES, etc.
YE to whose soul kind nature's hand imparts
The glowing passion for the liberal arts:
Ye great dispenfers of the magic strain,
Whose harmony delights almost to pain:
Ye to whose touch (with DAMER'S skill) is known
To charm to life, and wake the sleeping stone:
Ye rare PROMETHEI, to whose hand is given
To snatch the flame that warms the breast of heaven:
Ye too, ye Bards, illustrious heirs of fame,
Who from the sun your mental lineage claim:
Approach and see a dear and kindred art
Unhallowed maxims to her sons impart;
See her (become wild Faction's ready tool)
Insult the Father of the modern school.
Yet he first entered on the barren land,
And raised on high ARMIDA's powerful wand:
From him the Academics boast a name,
He led the way, he smoothed their path to fame:
From him the instructive lore the pupils claimed,
His doctrine nurtured, and his voice inflamed!
Oh, and is all forgot? -- The sons rebel,
And, REGAN-like, their hallowed sire expel.
Could not his faculties, so meekly borne,
Arrest the hand that fixed the rankling thorn?
Could not the twilight of approaching age,
The silver hairs that crown the indulgent sage,
Domestic virtues, his time-honour'd name,
His radiant works that crowd the dome of fame,
Say could not these suppress the opprobrious scene,
And charm to slumber academic spleen?
Mark, mark the period, when the Children stung
The Parent's feelings with their serpent tongue;
It was while dimness veiled the powers of sight,
The calamity here alluded to came suddenly upon Sir JOSHUA while he was
painting.
And tinged all nature with the gloom of night!
(Not many days removed) the Master came
With wonted zeal to touch the swelling theme!
The pregnant canvass his creation caught,
And drank his rich exuberance of thought:
Decked with the beams of Inspiration's sky,
Glanced over the work his finely-frensy'd eye.
-- Malignant Fate approached -- the scenes decay,
To him the new creation fades away;
Thick night abruptly shades the mimic sky,
And clouds eternal quench the frensy'd eye!
Invention shudder'd -- Taste stood weeping near --
From Fancy's eyelid gushed the glittering tear --
Genius exclaimed, My matchless loss deplore,
The hand of REYNOLDS falls to rise no more!
