TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS The DUKE of CUMBERLAND, etc.
TWelve Times has Sol his annual Race begun,
Since Jove descended from his radiant Throne.
Around the pendent Globe the God pursued
His circling March, and human Actions viewed,
But grieved that Virtue drooped her languid Head,
While Vice from Clime to Clime contagious spread.
Back to his native Seat he sternly flies,
And sends an Edict through the spacious Skies,
To call th'ethereal Powers swift flew his Word,
Th'ethereal Powers as swift attend their Lord.
Upon Olympus' Top the Synod met,
Where high enthroned the thundering Monarch sat,
And with a Nod that shook the Spheres, he swore
The Minor Gods should visit Earth no more.
What must your earthly Sons, Minerva cried,
Explore their doubtful Way without a Guide?
If Pallas must no more to Mortals go,
Let Pallas beg a Substitute below.
Worthy to rule the World, whose noble Mind
May copy out the Gods to human Kind.
She lowly bowed, and Jove consenting smiled,
Go form said he, this new imagined Child.
Collect the best Materials where you will,
And let us see for once Minerva's Skill.
He said, she hastens over the bright Abodes,
Selecting each Perfection of the Gods.
From Mars she warlike Strength and Courage took,
But softened them with Venus' graceful Look.
To these she added Hermes' Eloquence,
And crowned it with her own superior Sense.
Some of Apollo's piercing Rays she stole,
And while the Muses played she formed a Soul.
When thus composed the bright Ingredients lay,
She nobly dressed 'em in ethereal Clay.
Jove touched the Mass with his enlivening Hand,
And vital Warmth inspired a CUMBERLAND.
FINIS.
