THE FARMER.
ACT I.
SCENE I.
A rural Prospect, with a View of a Gentleman's Seat at a Distance.
Enter Fairly in a Passion, and Col. Dormont. Fairly. YOUR Master's a Rascal!
-- unknown to me marrying my Daughter, then leaving her behind him at Canada,
and here stepping into all the Vices of London, a single Gentleman forsooth!
Deny his Marriage! -- but I Will strip him of his new got Wealth.


Col. Dor. Hush! that is likely to happen without your help: You know that old
Humourist his Uncle, Col. Dormont, wishing to avoid the Bustle and Etiquette of
Rank, as a Trick gave my Master here the Enjoyment of his Fortune, of which
hearing he makes so ill a Use, he has absolutely advertised in the News Papers
to find if he has not some other Relation living to transfer it to.


Fair. Then he has another Relation hereabouts too, and to find him is what
brought me now into Kent.


Col. Dor. What Is his name?


Fair. I will not tell.


Col. Dor. Me you may; I Am Captain Valentine's Steward to be sure; but I was
placed here by his Uncle merely as a Guard over him; and harkee, Mr. Fairly,
you know the Colonel from being so much abroad hasn't seen him since the hight
of a Pen Case; I told him though of his deserting your Daughter, all his
profl^gate Exploits! He Is so much incensed that -- here is a Letter in his own
Hand commanding my Master to resign every Shilling's Worth belonging to him,
without beat of Drum this very Evening march out of his House yonder, and for
the first Time appear before him on the Parade, St. James's Park, tomorrow
Morning.


Fair. (with Joy). Then he is ruined! ha! ha! good Captain Valentine! Is Not that
he, (looking out) cajoling some simple Country Girl? And his Wife -- my poor
Child Louisa! Oh! how I should like to break his Bones; but no Sword or Pistol
Work for me; no, I Will find the honest Farmer that is to supersede him; I Will
teach a Captain to wrong a Lawyer; I Will --

Exeunt.
Enter Valentine and Betty Blackberry. AIR. Valentine.
Charming Village Maid,
If thou will be mine,
In Gold and Pearls arrayed,
All my Wealth is thine.
For Gold is Dross to me.
Even Nature's Beauties fade,
If not enjoyed by thee,
My Charming Village Maid!
Had I yon Shepherd's Care,
Your Lambs to feed and fold,
The Dog Star heat I Would bear,
And Winter's piercing cold;
Or such my Lot should be,
At Harrow, Flail or Spade,
Well pleased I Would toil for thee,
My charming Village Maid!
This Morn at Gosly Dawn
I had a Hedge Rose wild,
Its Sweets perfumed the Lawn,
'Twas sportive Nature's Child;
To grace my gay Parterre,
Translated from the Glade,
Sweet Emblem of my Fair,
My charming Village Maid!
Enter Farmer Blackberry (with a Milking Pail.) Farm. Where is this Daughter of
mine? Ah! hey!


Betty. I vow, your Honor, all these fine Things should make me vastly
conceited.


Farm. Ah! ha! he will not have much Trouble to do that.

(Aside.)
Val. My adorable Angel!


Farm. I Have heard say Fairies are good at it, but now I Will see an Angel milk my
Cow.


Betty. La! Father, talk of a Cow to a Gentleman!


Farm. Yes, and I Will keep my Heifer from a Gentleman.

(Aside to Betty. Gives her the Pail, and puts her off)
Val. Stop, Farmer! Yes, I Will propose -- he daren't refuse his Landlord,
(aside). I shall deal with you fair and open: your Daughter Betty pleases me;
name any Settlement, or by Gad I Will sign a Carte Blanch. You know the World,
and I dare say understand me.


Farm. Why, yes, Sir, I think I do understand you.


Val. I Am inclined to be your Friend -- I Have Company waiting at home, so your
Answer will oblige.


Farm. Pray, Sir, did you ever feel the Weight of an English Cudgel?


Val. A what! (Surprised).


Farm. Only a Twig of Oak like this, laid on with an old tough Arm, pretty
strong from Labor, and a Heart stung by an honest Resentment.


Val. Why, Fellow! I fancy you forget who you're talking to.


Farm. Sir, you may be yet a Parent, then you will be capable of a Father's
Feelings, at the cruel Offer to make him a Party in the Prostitution of his
child.


AIR. Farmer.
Ere around the huge Oak that o'ershadows yon Mill
The fond Ivy had dared to entwine.
Ere the Church was a Ruin that nods on that Hill,
Or a Rook built her Nest in that Pine.
Could I trace back the Time, a much earlier Date,
Since my Forefathers toiled in this Field;
And the Farm I now hold on your Honor's Estate,
Is the same that my Grandfather tilled.
He dying bequeathed to his Son a good Name,
Which unsullied descended to me;
For my Child I Have preserved it, unblemished with Shame,
And it still from a Spot shall be free. Exit.
Enter Col. Dormont. Val. Cudgel! A Reptile sting! A Weed dare to raise its
insolent Head, and wag Defiance in my Face.


Col. Dor. My good Sir, hear your poor Steward; Instead of ill will to the
Farmer, as an English Gentleman you should cherish the Farmer's Spirit of an
English Yeoman.


Val. I had not a Thought Clowns had any Feeling.


Col. Dor. Clown! -- he is a Man and a Parent. For the Affront you offered, your
Honor would not at all suffer by making him an Apology.


Val. Apology! Dem'd impertinent this! (Aside.) Total, will you take it?


Col. Dor. That I will, Sir, (quick) and as an Atonement, I suppose present him
from you an Acquittance for his Rent, as this is Quarter's Day.


Val. A pretty Proposal! but, ha! ha! ha! I Will fit my busy Steward, (aside)
Come, I Will write a few Lines of Apology, you draw out a Receipt, I Will enclose
it, and you shall take it to him immediately. -- His Daughter, my bonny Betty.
-- Total, can you blame me?


AIR. Valentine.
No more I Will court the town-bred Fair,
Who shines in artificial Beauty;
Her native Charms, without compare,
Claim all my Love, Respect and Duty.
O my bonny, bonny Bet. sweet Blossom,
Was I a King, so proud to wear thee,
From off the verdant Couch I Would bear thee,
To grace thy Lover's Bosom.
Yet ask me where those Beauties lie,
I cannot say in Smile or Dimple,
In blooming Cheek, or radiant Eye,
It Is happy Nature, wild and simple.
O my bonny, bonny Bet. etc.
Let dainty Beaux for ladies pine,
Ad sigh in Numbers trite and common;
Ye Gods! one darling Wish be mine,
And all I ask is lovely Woman!
O my bonny, bonny Bet. etc.
Come, dearest Girl, the rosy Bowl,
Like thy bright Eye, with pleasure dancing;
My Heaven art thou, so take my Soul,
With Rapture every Sense entrancing.
O my bonny, bonny Bet, etc. Exeuut.
SCENE II.
Farmer Blackberry's House. Enter the Farmer and Betty. Farm. There, stay
within Doors since you cannot walk out without having Gentlemen after you.


Betty. La! Father, the Gentlemen are so tempting, ha! ha! ha!


Farm. Odsbobs! I command you not to let him speak to you.


Betty. If a Gentleman's going, to speak, would not it be very rude in me to
stop his Mouth.


Farm. Then always get out of his Way.


Betty. That I certainly shall, if he is on Horseback.


Farm. Zounds! Hussy! could not you turn and walk from him!


Betty. So I did, and he turned and walked from me; but both walking on all
round the Field, 'till we came to the opposite Side, there we met Face to Face
you know, and then! ha! ha! ha! oh precious!


AIR. Betty.
To hear a sweet Goldfinch's Sonnet,
This Morning I put on my Bonnet,
But scarce in the Meadow, pies on it,
When the Captain appears in my view.
I felt an odd Sort of Sensation.
My Heart beat an odd Palpitation,
I blushed like a Pink or Carnation,
When, says he, "My dear, how do you do?"
The Devil sure, says I, here has pop'd him,
I therefore to stip by but I stopped him,
So my very best Curt'sy I dropped him;
With an Air then he bobs off his Hat,
He seemed with my Person enchanted,
He squeezed my Hand, how my Heart panted,
He asked for a Kiss, and I granted,
And pray new what Harm was in that?
Says I, Sir, for what do you take me?
He said a fine Lady he would make me,
No, them him, he would never forsake me,
And then on his Knee he flap'd down.
His Handkerchief smelt so sweetly,
His white Teeth he showed so completely,
He managed the Matter so neatly,
I never can be kissed by a Clown.
Farm. Ecod, if Neighbor Stubble's Step-son, Jemmy, was come home from London,
he should take you off my Hands this very Evening.


Enter Farmer Stubble, joyful. Farm. Stub. Hey! Betty! your Sweetheart Jemmy's
without.


Farm. B. What, Jemmy Jumps! ecod, now I Am happy.


Betty. Pray has London made him very like a Gentleman?


Farm. Stub. Was'nt it for that, merely to please you, that I sent him there?

Jemmy sings without.
Farm. B. Ecod, here he comes, gay as a Lark, fine as a Butter fly, stout as a
Cock, and merry as a Cricket.


Betty. Ay, here comes the London Beau!


Enter Jemmy, dressed in the Extravagance of Fashion. Jemmy. Gemmen I Am yours!
Mem I Am your most, (struts and flourishes.) Dad, (apart to Stubble) hope you
did not tell you had me 'Prentice to a Stay-maker in London.


Betty. Lud! he looks quite Rakish, (admiring.)


Jemmy. My Dear, I kiss your Hand.


Farm. B. Ecod, if you go no nigher, your Dear must stretch a long Arm.


Betty. Why that was only Compliment, what they say in London.


Farm. B. Oh, then, in London saying and doing are two Things.


Farm. Stub. But, Jemmy, here is Neighbor Blackberry.


Jemmy. Eh! ha!

(looking at Farmer B. through a flat Eye Glass.)
Farm. B. Oh! ho!

(takes out a large Key and looks at Jemmy.)
Betty. Oh, Jemmy, you can tell us all the new Fashions in Town!


Farm. B. Ah, what Price does Corn bring at London Market?


Jemmy. Corn!


Farm. B. Ah, how are Oats?


Jemmy. Ask my Ponies. Oats! think I Am from Bearquay? I Am a Gentleman of -- ha!
ha! ha! -- Canile!


Betty. Indeed, Father, you ask such uncouth Questions. Pray, Jemmy, what makes
you a Gentleman?


Jemmy. My Share in a Pharaoh Bank; my Boots to fling over the Benches in the
Play Houses; a Glass to squint at a Face not six Inches from my own Nose; my
Nag to kick up a Dust in Rotten-row; short Waistcoat, long Breeches, two
Watches, twenty-inch Cane, Umbrella, Hat, Chin, Beau-dash, and Shoe Strings.


All. Ha! ha! ha!


AIR. Jemmy.
Look, dear Ma'am I Am quite the Thing,
Natibus hey, tipity ho,
In my Shoe I wear a String.
Plaidy my Tartan ho;
Cards and Dice I Have monstrous Luck,
Though no Drake yet keep a Duck,
Though not Nimrod yet I Am a Buck,
Lantherum swash kickee.
I Have a Purse well stocked with -- Brass,
Chinckily he, chinckily ho;
I Have good Eyes, yet cock my Glass,
Stare about, squintum ho;
In two Boots I boldly walk,
Pistol, Sword, I never baulk,
Meet my Man and bravely talk,
Peppilus, pop, coupee;
Sometimes I mount a smart Cockade,
Puppydum hey, struttledom ho,
From High Park to the Parade,
Cockmacary kee:
As I pass a Centry Box,
Soldiers rest their bright Firelocks,
Each about his Musket knocks,
Rattledum slap to me.
In the Mall Miss gives her Card,
Cashady me, kissady she,
Set before the Palace Yard,
Leggerum, lounge a row;
Prettiest Things I softly say,
When I Am asked our Chairs to pay,
Yes, says I, and walk away.
Pennybus, Farthing ho.
Bett. Oh, Lord! he is quite rakish!

(enraptured.)
Farm. Stub. Then, Jemmy, I warrant on your going to London you soon got up
Stairs into Gentlemen's Company.


Farm. B. Ay, and I warrant you he soon got down Stairs out of Gentlemen's
Company, ha! ha! ha!


(making a Motion with his Foot.) Jem. Zounds, Sir, I belonged to a Coterin.


Bett. La! what is a Coterin?


Jem. Ma'am, it is a Club, a Thing we established -- fitted up a House in Style
-- select -- to be by ourselves for the Purpose of Play.


Farm. B Oh, then there was a Gang of you?


Jem. Gang! What do ye call --? Party -- Men of Fashion -- deep Play -- Egad
the Rouleaus flew about like Shuttle-cocks.


Bett. And what is a Rouleau?


Jem. A Parcel of -- Shillings -- neatly rolled up like -- a --


Farm. B. Ay, like a Pennyworth of Tobacco, I suppose!


Jem. Tobacco! 'gad, Sir, you suppose the strangest -- what -- eh?


Farm. Stub. And, Jemmy, who was of your --


Jem. Party? I and Sir Bruin Bickery, Marquis Delpini, Colonel Pimlico, and my
Lord Picardy -- hem!

(flourishes.)
All. Ha! ha! ha!


Jem. (Apart to Farm. B.) Must bounce a few, Betty's so upish -- likely
would not have me else.


Farm. B. Right. (to Jem.) Neighbor we'll have Betty and Jemmy married this
very Night -- then she will be out of the Way of this wicked Devil of a Landlord.
(Aside.) (Pipes and Tabors without.) True, we have won our Cricket Match to
Day, the Lads and Lasses are all in such high Glee, so your Wedding shall add
to the Joy of the Day, ha! ha! ha!

Exeunt all but Jemmy, who is detained by Molly Maybush.
Molly. Jemmy, you shall not marry Betty Blackberry, you know before you went up to
London you was Book-sworn to me.


Jem. I went a Clown, and I Am come home a Gemman.


Moll. I Am sure all the Difference I see is, that going you had brown Hair, a
fat Face, and an honest Heart; and you have come home with a white Head, lank
Cheeks, and an ill-natured Soul.


Jem. As to Head and Face -- and Head -- I Am just the -- the Tippy; and as to
Soul that is with us, Gents. like our Honor, a Thing we know nothing about only
to swear by; as "'pon my Soul, Sir," -- "'pon my Honor, Mem," -- just as your
Country Folks "Odsbodikins" "Gadzookens," and "by the living Jingo."


Moll. For sartain my Father cannot leave me quite so well as Betty, we have not so
much Corn in our Granary, but I Have ten times as much Love in my Heart, Jemmy.


AIR. Molly.
My Daddy, O, was very good,
To make me fine he spared no Pelf,
And scrape up money all he could,
He Would give it to my bonny Self.
My handsome Cap from Dover came,
Some thought from France, so gay to see,
Though sighed for by each Maid and Dame;
'Twas not my Cap was dear to me.
Blythe Johnny, O, upon his Mare,
Adown the Dell his Horn ran sweet,
To me presented Puss, the Hare,
That over the wild Thyme ran so fleet.
Then Ned a Nosegay for my Breast,
He brought no Flower more sweet than he;
And warbling Will a Linnet's Nest,
No Flowers or Birds were dear to me.
So softly. O, to yonder Grove,
The Moon so kind the while did blink,
I stole to meet my own true Love,
Yet on false Love I fell to chink.
The rustling Leaves increase my fears,
A Footstep falls who cannot be;
Oh joy, my Jemmy now appears,
And he alone was dear to me.
Jem. Piping for me, Molly, is -- I Am not come-atable

(Swaggers.)
Moll. But your Promise --


Jem Keep a Promise! What do you take me for?


Moll. Did I think you ever could forget the Day you left our Village? Don't
you remember as you were stepping on the Coach Roof, as I stood crying, you
with one Foot on the little Wheel, and the other just on the Boot; your right
Hand you stretched to the Coachman, and your left as I held it mine, washing it
with my Tears, the Postman at that Moment sounding his Horn; Gee! up! says the
Coachman, and I soon lost Sight of my Jemmy.


Jem. I protest I Have such an Absence -- that --


Moll. You must remember your Promise to marry me -- you cannot forget the Horn.


Jem. Horn! -- A damned odd Marriage Memorandum you have hit upon, Molly.

Exeunt.
SCENE III.
A Green before Farmer Blackberry's House, Music, with a Noise of Dancing.
Enter Farmer Blackberry and Jemmy. Farm B. Ah? ha! featly done! Jemmy, why
don't you take a Dance?


Jem. Me sport a Toe among such Clodhoppers! Ah! ha! dance away my Vestris and
Vetchelli's!


Farm. B. Well, my Boy, you shall have Betty then; no fear of our Squire --
Hey! what can his Steward want!

(Looking out.)
Enter Col. Dormant. Col. Dor. My Master is now sorry, Farmer, for the Affront
he offered you, and requests you will accept here enclosed a Receipt and full
Acquittance for your Quarter's Rent.


Jem. Something toward Betty's Portion,

(aside.)
Enter Rundy. Run. Why, Lord, Farmer, the Squire's Men are got driving your
Cattle, and they say it is for your Rent.


Col. Dor. What!


Farm. B. On Quarter-day -- this is his Receipt!


Col. Dor. Oh! some Mistake of that scoundrel the Bailiff!

Enter the Bailiff. Harding, what do you mean by this Outrage!


Bail. To Obey Master's Orders.


Col. Dor. Orders! Farmer, open that -- or here, you young Fellow (to Jemmy)
read aloud the Paper you will find there, if your Scholarship reaches so far.

(Gives Letter exultingly.)
Jem. Scholarship!

(Conceitedly. Opens and reads.) " For golden Grain I bring you Chaff,
"So Neighbors at the Bearer laugh!"
Ha! ha! ha!

(looking at Col. Dormant) how do you like my Scholarship?

(Reads.) "If this for Quarter's Rent will not pass,
"Why then the Reader is --

Run (Who had been looking over him, reads) An Ass -- ha! ha! ha!

(looking at Jemmy.)
Farm B. Does he make a Jest of his Cruelty?


Col. Dor. And me the Fool -- be assured, Farmer, his Uncle will do you
Justice; the Captain will not be long a Landlord.

(Walks up enraged)
Enter Betty. Bett. Oh, Father!


Farm. B. Jemmy, I must borrow this Rent from the Portion I thought to pay down
with Betty.


Jem. Borrow! eh! od! -- it happens so unlucky, but I now remember I promised
Molly Maybush, and Dinner's ready -- tol, lol, deral.

Exit.singing.
Bett. There now, if Jemmy han't gone from me!


Farm. B. And a good riddance of such a sordid ^^scal; but there is your London
Gentleman.


Enter Fairly. Fair. Ay, this should be the House, and you the Master; let us
see my Instructions, (peruses a Paper) Blackberry -- Mother's name -- yes -- I
hope here my Search is at an End, your Name is Blackberry, your Mother Niece to
Edward Timbertop, Esquire.


Bett. Yes, Sir, we have had 'Squires in our Family.

(Curtsies.)
Farm. B. Ay, but I never knew any good on it, but to make you conceited.


Fair. I have Authority to inform you that by this Descent you're likely soon
to be Master of those very Lands from whence your Cattle were drove by your
worthless Landlord.


Col. Dor. Eh, what, Mr. Fairly, is this, though -- (quick and joyful) are you
really related to Colonel Dormont?


Farm. B. Why I did hear of some Relation made a huge Fortune in America by
Army Contracts, or -- but I know naught about'n.


Fair. To prove your Affinity to the Colonel, and hear what he intends, you
must go to London.


Bett. To London!

(great.)
Fair. Ay, and appear in Splendor as his adopted Heir; I Will have such a
triumphant Revenge on that Puppy your Master for his Usage to my poor Louisa.

(To Col. Dorm.)
Col. Dor. But, best first let the Colonel --


Fair. What do you talk, he is a Person of Property, and and if he disapproves of
what I Have done, let my Pocket answer.

(Resolutely.)
Col. D. Well, since you're resolved, I Will instantly deliver to my Master the
Colonel's Letter of Dismission -- take Charge of every Thing yonder, and if
you will undertake to get the Farmer and Family to Town, I transfer my Duty, and
shall be there in Time to have Lodgings prepared for their Reception.


Fair. Good Fellow.


Farm. B. I live in Town, amongst Smoke, Noise and Back-bitings; no, no, no.


Fair. Eh! ay, and instead of Blackberry you must take the Name of Timbertop.


Col. D. But why didn't you acquaint the Colonel with your Distress?


Farm. B. Distress I never knew before to Day; so by Jingo I never thought of
brushing up a grand Relationship for sake of a Dinner or so, while here I could
enjoy my homely Meal with the sweet Sauce of Independance; but come in and take
a Bit of Mutton over a Glass of my home-brew'd -- we'll hear this Story, and
before I turn a Gentleman, you shall see what a jolly Fellow is an English
Farmer.

Exeunt Farmer and Betty. [Betty, during the above Scene, alternately listens
with Joy and Surprise -- she remains]
Bett. To London -- yes -- instead of Betty Blackberry, I shall be Miss Eliza
Timbertop!


Enter Jemmy Jumps. Jem. (aside) Old Blackberry fallen into this House -- great
Fortin! Oh, I must tack about.

Bett. Prescious! I shall be so tasty this Summer; round my Neck a charming
thick Barcelona Handkerchief, with a beautiful double Gauze one over it, a
Marseilla quilted Petticoat stout and white as a Counterpane; over that a rich
Paduasoy Gown that shall stand an end; and over that again my choice long
Satin Cardinal furred with Ca^'s Skin.


Jem. (Aside.) A cool Summer's Dress! poh!

Jemmy fans himself with his Hat.
Bett. In my Kalimanco Shoes, I Will have such a thumping Pair of Silver Buckles,
and in my Pink Hat a Bunch of Cherry color'd Ribbon!


Jem. Ha! (advancing) my Betty.


Bett. (Looking round affectedly.)
Jem. I Am come to with you Joy!


Bett. Wish Joy! oh! oh! the Bellman!


Jem. Bellman! my Dear your own Jemmy Jumps.


Bett. Jumps! now what is this Person talking about?


Jem. Hem! Mem! may I presume to beg --


Bett. Beg! I havn'^ got no small Change.

Exit Betty, very stately and affected.
Jem. (After a Pause, whistles.) Beg -- small! Change! -- Me for a Beggarman!
Yes, I must ha -- Molly Maybush -- she is a hundred Pound -- that, and a little
Credit at Manchester -- open a smart Shop -- Yes, get to town, and buckle to
Business -- Eh, here is Molly, how rejoiced she will be at my coming back to her.
-- Tol, lol, lol!

Sings.
Enter Molly Maybush and Rundy. Run. And, Molly, ben't you ashamed to leave
such a true loving Boy as I be?


Moll. Yes, I now see Jemmy courted me all along only for the Lucre of Gain:
Yonder he is, let us laugh at him -- I Will pretend not to see him.


AIR. Molly.
Send him to me,
Let him woo me,
Softly breathe each tender Vow:
Why forsake me,
Come and take me,
Take me in the Humor now.
In my Cheeks full Roses blowing,
Wishes twinkle in my Eyes;
Oh, what Joy when Joy bestowing,
Yet my careless Lover flies.
Girls don't hear him,
Mock him, jeer him;
He Will deceive you,
Kiss and leave you.
Jem. Your most -- lovely Molly (bows) Rundy what brings you here?

(fiercely.)
Run. To see a little Fun, Sir.


Jem. Fun.


Moll. Ha! ha! ha!


Run. Ha! ha! ha!

they get each Side of him.
Jem. Molly, I left you crying. Methinks I find you wondrous frisky.


Moll. Yes, Sir.

(Curtsies with an arch mock complaisance.)
Run. Yes, Sir.

(Bows in like manner.)
Jem. Amazing civil!

(Looking on each side of him.)
Moll. Rundy, sure this is a Gentleman!


Run. Is It, indeed!

(Affects to look at Jemmy with Amazement.)
Moll. Oh, yes, for his Soul is only a Thing to swear by, as "'Pen my Soul,
Sir! 'Pon my Honor, Mem!" just as us Country Folks might say "Odsbodikins!"
"Odzookerikins! and by the living Jingo!" (Mimicking.) Ha! ha! ha!


Run. Ha! ha! ha!


Jem. (First looking at them very gravely, then laughing.) Ha! ha! ha! again,
if that what you're both for; ha! ha! ha! -- Indeed! Molly, as second Thought's
best, I Will return to my first Design and have you.


Moll. No, Sir; sure you would not be so good!

(Arch and Ironical.)
Jem. Think I Would break my Engagement! Molly, I claim, your Promise.


Moll. I keep a Promise! what do you take me for?

(Mimicking.)
Run. What do you take us for?

(Mimicking.)
Moll. Jemmy, my Father has engaged me to Rundy here, so "I am not comeatable."
(Mimicking) There -- (gives Rundy her Hand) and thus let every Girl serve the
fortune-hunting Chap that courts the Heart, while his Eye is on her Pocket


Jem. Have I figured in London for this? The Tulip of Kensington Gardens to be
ousted by a Cabbage Stalk! Oh, ye God's and Goddesses, Tags, Laces, Whalebone,
Busks and Bodices.

ACT II.
SCENE I.
Louisa's Lodgings in London.
Enter Colonel Dormant and Landlady. Col. Dormant. THE Apartments, Ma'am, are
for a Family from the Country.


Land. Well, Sir, the Lady here moves today to her own House in Kent; this is
she, Sir. (Looking out.) Please to see the other Rooms. Sir.

Exit.
Col. Dor. Ma'am.

Exit, following Landlady.
Enter Louisa. AIR.
Winds, softly tell my Love
You have brought home his Dove,
Say poor Louisa flies to her Mate;
Smooth was the Ocean,
And swift was our Motion,
He was my Haven, and Absence my Fate.
Yet the Lambs straying,
Through the Meads playing,
Cropping wild Flowers on the Precipice Brink;
Joys surrounding,
Sporting, bounding,
Nor on fond Phillis the Wanton will think.
Col.Dor. (Without.) They Will do exceeding well, Ma'am; but (enters) I must
apologize to this Lady for my Intrusion before she had given up her Apartments.

(Bows.)
Louisa. Sir.

(Curtsies.) A loud Knocking.
Col. Dor. Hey! they are here! 'Squire Timbertop and his whole Family!


Fair. (Without.) Ha! Mr. Total's here!


Louisa Heavens! my Father!


Col. Dor. What! Mr. Fairly!


Louisa. Oh! Sir! shut the Door! I Am lost if he sees me.


Col. Dor. Then, Madam, I presume you are Mrs. Valentine?


Louisa Sir, since you know -- Dear, Sir, don't I -- ^ d^r^'nt see my Father
'till acknowledged by my Husband, who has --


Col. Dor. You're just from Canada, Ma'am! And this the amiable Woman he has
deserted! Don't be alarmed, Ma'am, at my discovering, I Am your Steward, Ma'am.


Louisa. Perhaps my Husband's, Sir! Oh! bring me to him!


Col. Dor. Ma'am, he is now in Disgrace with his Uncle; turned out, Ma'am; his
Uncle, the Colonel, is one of your very odd Sort of Persons; means well, but
always doing something that nobody else would think of; and I Am convinced he
would not have you see your Husband before he tries the Success of a Scheme he
has planned for his Reformation.


Enter Landlady. Land. Lud, Sir, here is your Country Family come; Ma'am, will not
you make use of my Parlour 'till your Chaise comes -- Jenny!

Calls, and Exit.
Col. Dor. Near the Time I appointed my Gentleman in the Park, so must now
leave the Blackberry's to Fairly (aside.) Ma'am, best remain here, if you can
keep out of your Father's Sight; in the Evening I Will give you convincing
Reasons for postponing your Journey to Kent; the Colonel, Ma'am, has heard of
your Wrongs, and is determined to punish his Nephew; he will teach him in the
School of Poverty the Use of Riches, Ma'am.

Bows, and Exit.
Louisa Ah! my Valentine, to forsake, to deny me. I Will not increase the
Colonel's Displeasure by seeing him; and yet --


Enter Landlady. Land. Where Is that old Gentleman? Here Is an Officer below saw
him through the Window, and desires he would follow him into the Park.

Exit.
Louisa. An Officer! If it should be (goes to the Window) it is my Valentine!
Discarded by his Uncle -- perhaps distressed -- Yes, the Steward said his Uncle
was determined he should learn in the School of Poverty: No, to, my Valentine,
I cannot see it (Rings.) Enter a Servant. Richard! that Gentleman -- the
Officer -- follow, watch where he goes, and instantly bring me Word -- Quick!
(Exit Servant.) Cruel Uncle! to abandon him; and this unfeeling Steward --
advise me not to see him -- in Want! -- Heavens! -- the Thought! -- Ah!
Valentine though unkind yon have been, you are still my Husband.

Exit.
SCENE II.
St. James's Park.
Enter Colonel Dormant. Col. Dor. Follow you to the Park! but where. (Looking
round.) Eh! is not this the young Fellow that read the curious Receipt for me?


Enter Jemmy Jumps, with a Parcel, Jem. Toll lol! lol! eh! it is -- Master
Steward who thought to have met you in London! ha! ha! ha! Well, how have you
left Ploughman Blackberry and his clumsy Family?


Col. Dor. True, I thought you was to have had his Daughter and her clumsy
Fortune!


Jem. Have me! he! he! he! certainly they were all upon the Scramble for me, as
if I was a tit Bit for a City Feast, I was such a neat, tol, lol! hey! -- Betty
dressed at me -- Jenny skimm'd the Cream -- Molly robbed the Hen-Roost, and
Susan baked the round little hot Loaves for my Breakfast -- Becky sung at me;
Sal hopp'd and Pol bob'd at me; but, poor Things, it was'nt on the Cards --
could not be --

AIR. Jemmy.
Gad a mercy, Devil's in me,
All the Damsels wish to win me;
Like a Maypole round me cluster,
Hanging Garlands fus and fluster.
Jilting, capering, grinning, smirken,
Pouting, bobbing, winking, jerking,
Cocking Bills up, Chins up, perking.
Kates and Betties,
Polls and Letties.
All were doting gentle Creatures,
On their Features;
To their Aprons all will not pin me,
Gad a mercy, etc. etc.
Old one, in the Country I was a Gentleman -- in Town I Am a Staymaker.


(Points to his Parcel.) Col. Dor. A Staymaker?


Jem. Perhaps you could recommend one -- but right -- ha! ha! ha! your Master
ran away from you -- got into Place yet!


Col. Dor. Pert Puppy!

(Aside.)
Jem. Never saw 'Squire Valentine -- but hear he was a fine flashy Fellow! one
of us! ha! ha! (capers and sings.) I Am about setting up in Business -- want
only a Partner with a little ready -- Molly's Penny would have now been apropos
-- raising Capital is -- I Am going now after a Person advances Money -- but, my
old Steward, you're among the monied Men, you could put a Body in the way of
raising a little Cash -- I can give undeniable Security.


Col. Dor. I Will try it -- yonder he comes -- it may bring him into an
embarrassing Distress; and if any Thing can reclaim him the very Scheme of
Necessity must be the Means. (Aside.) Why I -- I do know a Gentleman that does
these Things.


Jem. (With Joy.) Where does he live?


Col. Dor. This happens lucky enough -- see that Gentleman coming strait from
Story's Gate.


Jem. What! he in the brown Coat?


Col. Dor. No.


Jem. Oh! in the smart little buckled Wig.


Col. Dor. Psha! what think ye of that red Coat!


Jem. That Officer! ha! ha! ha! a Captain lend Money! a good Joke!


Col. Dor. He Is Agent to fifteen Regiments.


Jem. Zounds! then he can lend me the King's Money.


Col. Dor. There -- you see with what Authoriry he les against the Treasury
Wall.


Jem. Like a prop to the Treasury; a rich Fellow, I warrant: If you know him,
my dear Boy, will you propose it?


Col. Dor. Well, I Will speak to him.


Jem. Much obliged -- here he is!


Col. Dor. Be you in the Way.


Jem. Only drop this in Fludyer-Street -- two hundred will just do me -- I Will
do the handsome Thing -- Housekeeper's Security -- Premium to you, and the
neatest Pair of Dimity Jumps for your Girl -- mum, now -- ha!

Exit grinning.
Enter Valentine, out of Temper. Val. When did you get to Town? Whose House is
that I saw you gossipping in?


Col. Dor. Then he hasn't seen his wife.

(Aside.)
Val. Well, here have I been parading this Half-hour, and no Uncle, as his
Letter appointed.


Col. Dor. You don't know his Person; perhaps he has been parading too, and
surveying you.


Val. I Will wait no longer -- I discard him -- talk of me! he is made up of
Caprice and Uncertainty.


Col. Dor. Why, faith he is a little queerish in his -- but no Caprice -- no,
no -- cursed inflexible in what he thinks right -- aye, he will certainly settle
his Fortune on this newfound Relation -- your Conduct to your Wife -- Affair of
Blackberry -- and --


Val. Give me a Taste of Life, and now turn me adrift, only for a few
fashionable Gallantries! I got them to pass Dice too, before I left home --
haven't one Guinea in my Pocket -- if I could but raise a little Money just for
an outset.


Col. Dor. Could Not some be raised on your Commission?


Val. Eh -- but I don't know any of those Money Brokers.


Enter Jemmy, smiles at Col. Dormant, then walks up. Col. Dor. Sir, do you see
that Gentleman?


Val. That Fellow that nodded to you?


Col. Dor. Fellow! You Have seen an Advertisement of a Person that has twenty
thousand lying at his Banker's! that is he! X. Y. the most liberal Money lender
in Town.


Val. Why, he gave you a very familiar Nod, Total; see if he will advance the
Cash to me.


Col. Dor. I Will try -- about two hundred will do?


Val. Capital!


Col. Dor. Sir, (calling Jemmy, then goes over, and speaks apart to him) He Will
do it.


Jem. My dear Friend! does he know the Sum I want -- Security I can give, and
--


Col. Dor. All: Step to any Tavern hard-by, and I Will bring him to you.


Jem. Eh -- the Rummer -- the Landlady a Customer of mine -- think he will have
the Money about him!

(joyful.)
Col. Dor. Is Not Drummond's over the Way? Have you a Purse or good strong
Pocket for the Cash -- when you get it?

(half aside.)
Jem. A good Pocket, but no Purse.


Col. Dor. Take my Glove -- it is stout Ramskin -- the Guineas will lie there
so snug in the Fingers.


Jem. And the half Guineas drop so pat in the little one.


Col. Dor. You Will have your cash between finger and thumb.


Jem. Snug as a Pinch o'Snuff.


Col. Dor. (Aloud to Valentine) Sir, the Gentleman will see you at the Rummer.


Val. (Bowing to Jemmy) Sir, I shall attend you.


Jem. Sir -- Oh Sir. -- (Apart to Col.) A Country Family just come to Town,
over in Suffolk-street, must step just and take Measure of a young Lady.


[Exit bowing to Valentine, and smiling to Col.] Col. Dor. Oh, yes, he will.


Val. You're a devilish good Fellow, Total!


Col. Dor. But then he is so cursed fond of good Eating and Drinking: nothing to
be done with him without giving him a Dinner, and drinks Burgundy, I assure you.


Val. Zounds! I Will give him a Bottle and a Bird with all my Soul! Yonder Is
Supple and Captain Palaver! heard of my Misfortune, for they seem to avoid me.
-- My Friends!


Col. Dor. Ah! my good Sir, even the civility of the World hangs on the Success
of the Moment; and let your empty Pocket now convince you that Distress is the
Touchstone of Friendship. Suppose to cut a Flash, I ask 'em to the Dinner
you will be obliged to give this Gentleman, and; ha! ha! Sir, to carry it on I Will
desire Mr. X. Y. before them, to seem as if you was the Lender.


Val. Ha! ha! ha! well done Total! ha! ha! ha! Hey, Counselor Flummery, too!
(looking out) True: I owe him twenty Guineas.


Col. Dor. Well, Sir, you will be now able to pay him: 'Gad, Sir, he can draw up
the necessary Writings between you and the Gentleman. I Will ask him.


Val. Run -- bespeak a good Room, and order Dinner for six. (Pushes Col. Dar.
off.) This Supply will set me going -- I Will let Uncle see I can shine without
his dirty Acres, but -- without House, cheerful Home, Ability to entertain and
enjoy the social Hour.


AIR. Valentine.
How bright are the Joys of the Table,
I mean when the Cloth is removed;
Our Hearts are fast held ly a Cable,
While round the Decanter is should;
The Ladies all rise to retire,
We stand up, and look very grave,
A Bumper, then draw round the Fire,
Determined like Souls to behave.
My Servant, he knows I Am a Toper,
Clean Glasses of Wine a Recruit,
He brings in a six Bottle Co^per,
And places it close at my Foot;
I gingerly take up a Bottle,
The Saw-dust I puff from his Coat,
The Cork out he sings in the Throttle,
But sweeter than Mara his Note.
What Gentlemen Coffee now chooses,
The Compliment come from the Fair;
No Gentlemen Coffee refuses,
But not a Man stirs from his Chair;
Though Frenchm^n may do so I bar it,
With British Politeness I think,
While Monsieur we thank for his Claret,
He never shall teach us to drink.
Gay Hebe now shows in Apolio,
A Strugg^^ 'tw^^t Claret and Wit,
For Bacchus nsists he shall swallow
Six Bumpers before he may sit;
Ye Fair, why so ill should we treat you,
Go part ere the Bottle is won!
At Supper Apollo shall meet you,
And show you what Bacchus has done. Exit.
SCENE III.
Apartments in which Louisa had been seen.
Enter Fairly. Fair. What Accommodations has old Total got for the Farmer and
his Family here? Enter Rundy, in a Livery. So Rundy, you have got from the Plough
to the Coach!


Run. Ay, Sir, Miss Bett would make Master and she go all round the Town in
Chairs. I walked before, he! he! he! Master's so grand, and Miss Betty's quite
my Lady; my Molly is own Maid, and I am my own Gentleman.


Fair. Tell your Master I am here.


Run. Tell! why Mun in London one can call a Body from the Top of the House to
the Bottom, and from Bottom to Top, without opening ones Mouth, (Goes to side
and rings.) that does it.


Fair. Ha! ha! ha! why sure you don't ring for your Master?


Run. Why, Sir, he rings for me, and one good Turn deserves another: Lord you
cannot think what a Beau I intend to be here in London -- Oh --


AIR. Rundy.
A Flaxen-headed Cow boy, as simple as may be,
And next a merry Plough-boy, I whistled over the Lea,
But now a saucy Footman, I strut in worsted Lace,
And soon I Will be a Butler, and wag my jolly Face;
When Steward I Am promoted, I Will snip a Tradesman's Bill,
My Master's Coffers empty, my Pockets for to fill;
When lolling in my Chariot, so great a Man I Will be,
You Will forget the little Plough-boy that whistled over the Lea.
I Will buy Votes at Elections, but when I Have made the Pelf,
I Will stand Poll for the Parliament, and then vote in myself;
Whatever's good for me, Sir, I never will oppose,
When all my Ayes are sold off, why then I Will sell my Noes;
I Will bawl, harangue and paragraph, with speeches charm the Ear,
And when I Am tired on my Legs, then I Will sit down a Peer.
In Court or City honor, so great a Man I Will be,
You Will forget the little Plough-boy that whistled over the Lea. Exit,
Enter Farmer Blackberry, and Betty, dressed. Fair. Ah! ha! Zounds who comes
here?

Bett. Fuddled! Oh, it is Fashion; ay, Sir, and Mrs. Fal-lal, the Milliner, says
I shall soon set the Fashions, she will be asked for the Eliza Cap, the Timbertop
Bonnet, la! we improve so! Sir, mustn't I learn to Dance! (dances) and play
Music on the Harp? that great Long-man in the Hay-Market is to send me all the
new Songs, and the last Opera in Score.


Farm. B. Score! No, Zounds! you shall not run in Debt, Daughter! there is
Fashion!


Bett. He! he! he! Oh, Mr. Fairly, do you hear? -- we have been shopping! bought
such Beauties!


Farm. B. By Gad but I believe I Have forgot all your Trinkums in the Chair that
brought me home -- you Rundy! Enter Rundy. Ods bobs! Rundy, where is the Chair?
(Rundy reaches a Chair, places it behind Farmer Blackberry, then bows.) Poo!

Run. Oh, Lord, Sir; the Irishmen run away with that.


Bett. How provoking!


Fair. You know, Rundy, I desired you, whenever you took a Chair or Coach, to
take the Number. --


Run. Oh, I did; here it is your Honor, and in nice Brass; I cut it off when
they went into the Alehouse --

(shows a Chair Number.)
Bett. Oh dear!


Enter Landlady. Land. One from Tavistock-street, Miss.

new Stays; I Will sit your Ladyship with a Waist neat as a topsy turvy Sugar Loaf.


Bett. Turn me topsy turvy! la! is that the Fashion.


Jemmy. (preparing his Measure) Now, Ma'am!

(looks and is surpised.)
Bett. (staring) Jemmy Jumps! What, our London Gentleman only a Stay-maker!


Jemmy. I protest this is the oddest! I came to one Miss Timbertop

(she pats his Forehead)
Farm B. A Stay-maker! oh, you make no Stay here.


Jemmy. Then I Will go -- hey! me -- Mr. Jump's Carriage. -- lal, lal, lal! --

(Exit singing.)
Bett. La! what an impudent Fellow!


Farm. B. Ay, Girl, beware of the Fops, though while you have Youth be merry; --


AIR. Farm. Blackberry.
Lovely Ladies, Sprigs of Fashion,
Smile the youthful Hour away;
Welcome now the tender Passion,
In my Sunshine I made Hay.
Musty Age forbids soft Wooing,
What themselves are past the doing,
But sage Reason, to each Season,
Pleasures suiting, Age recruiting,
By full Glasses, though Life passes,
Wine restores the Lamp of Day. --
The Sun's Love Potion.
Hits my Notion
To set in Ocean, next Morning rise
Showing a broad Face,
Glowing in Youth
My girl, in Age a glorious Flask,
So live so die is all I ask. Lovely Ladies, etc. etc.
Enter Colonel Dormant. Col. D. Farmer, the Colonel desires me to conduct you
to him. He has sent his Coach.

Farm. B. Ay, Gadzooks! where is the Squire!


Col. D. Now at the Rummer Tavern, and soon in the Hands of the Bailiffs --


Fair. Now, Farmer you and I Will have a complete Revenge.


Farm. B. Well, you shall see my Revenge, I Am somewhat the humor of my
Countrymen toward the French, ready to shake Hands, but as ready for a Blow if
they intend one. --


AIR. Farmer Blackberry.
Old England's a Lion, stretched out at his Ease,
A Sailor his Keeper, his Couch the green Seas;
Should a Monkey dare to chatter
Or a Tiger Claw
They tumble at his roar,
They tremble at his roar
As he lifts his Paw.
I love a Neigbour's Friendship, but he turned Foe,
Prepare to receive him with Blow for Blow.
Exeunt. SCENE IV.

Mistress sends me up her Stays, I Will take 'em home with me now, and alter them
to her liking. (Exit 1st Waiter) That will show this Gentleman I Am a Man of
Business, then he will not be afraid to lend the Cash about him, though I should
like he would send me over to Drummond's, it is so pretty to see those Bankers
Clerks shovel up the Gold! with a back Paw slide a handful of Guineas along the
Counter, then tip, tip, tip! reckon so nimble -- (mimicks) With this Money such
a smart Shop as I shall open.

Falgate. --


Val. Norton Falgate! Really, Sir, I don't know any body in that Quarter of the
Town. --


Jemmy. Lord, Sir; it is one of the most substantialist and most opulentist
Place. --


Val. I hav'n't a doubt, Sir -- but had hopes of giving you up a Lieutenant's
Commission. --


Jemmy. Give me a Commission -- eh -- he, he, he.


Val. Oh, well, Sir; since that is not -- if Mr. Total joins in a Bond. --


Jemmy. Sir, I Have no objection to a Bond if you think that sufficient; but
asking Mr. Total to join is a Liberty that -- almost a Stranger to me -- though
he has so kindly brought about this Business, I could not expect him to join --
Oh, no!


Val. My dear Sir, if he dare refuse I Would break his Back.


Jemmy. Back! his Back! Oh, Lord! what! force him to join? Oh, Sir, by no
means. He Is almost a Stranger to me.
