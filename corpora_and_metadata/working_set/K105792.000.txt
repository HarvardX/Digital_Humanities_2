PREFACE.
THE Comedy of Le Glorieux, by M. Nericault Destouches, is the basis on which
The School for Arrogance has been formed. From that I have taken the plan,
several of the characters, and some of the scenes. Difference of arrangement,
additional incidents, and what I deem to be essential changes of character,
have all been introduced. The Count has but little resemblance to the original:
Lucy and Mac Dermot none. Lady Peckham is a new character, and was first
suggested by a friend; who, conceiving highly of the contrast which exists in
life, between the pride of rank and the pride of riches, industriously sought
to stimulate and rouse my imagination.

The subject of the piece is greatly interesting to morals, and highly worthy
of the Theater. Conscious of the great effects a perfect Comedy might have
produced, I regret the imperfections of the present. Some good it will do: I
regret that it cannot do more. Persuaded as I am of the moral dignity of the
stage, I cherish an enthusiastic wish to see the dramatic art surpass even all
its former sublime efforts. Among the pleasures of the imagination, how
frequently has its place been the first! Happy indeed should I be, could my
success add the smallest impulse to the exertions of Genius: ineffably happy,
would but this noble art once more boldly assert its rank; and render itself,
not only the general love and delight of mankind, but the veneration of the
wise.

It is with peculiar pleasure that I here acknowledge how much I am indebted to
the conduct of Mr. Marshal; who, in consequence of the prejudices which it was
imagined Mr. Harris labored under, respecting me, acted, for a time, in my
behalf, as the author of the piece. Though anxiously zealous for its success,
he still continued impartially attentive to the interests of all parties; and
sacrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good.

The tribute of justice is also due to Mr. Harris. This tribute I am happy to
have an opportunity to pay. And, that I may now be consistent, as I always have
been, in my private and public language to Mr. Harris, I will here insert a
copy of a letter which I wrote to him, when the comedy had been twice performed.

SIR,
I HAVE patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you. That
moment I hope is now come. I should be guilty of injustice, were I any longer
to delay expressing my sense of the propriety with which you have acted,
relatively to The School for Arrogance, after you had every reason to suppose
it mine. Such conduct, Sir, is highly honorable; and is not only productive of
the best effects, but must secure the best and most permanent applause. That
you had conceived disadvantageous ideas of me I knew; though I have no doubt
but I shall ultimately convince you that, even supposing me to be mistaken, my
motives have been laudable ***** A single phrase, which relates entirely to
myself, is here omitted.
. With me you were irritated; but you had the justice to forget the man, and
promote the interests of the piece. This I hold it my duty to say to the world
at large.

I am, Sir, Your obliged humble servant, T. HOLCROFT.
Newman Street, Feb. 7, 1791.

To THOMAS HARRIS, Esquire.
Mr. Harris kindly expressed the satisfaction which his own private feelings
received, from this letter; nor can there be a doubt but that the propriety of
his conduct, under such circumstances, will be as agreeable to himself, and as
pleasing to the public, as it has been to me.

Newman Street, Feb. 17, 1791.

PROLOGUE.
Spoken by Mr. BERNARD, in the character of a News-hawker.
After sounding and calling "Great news!" without, enter with a postman's horn,
newspapers, cap, and livery. GREAT news! Great news! Extraordinary news!
Who Will buy, or give three halfpence to peruse?
(Sounds) Great news! -- Pray did you call, Sirs? Here am I!
Of wants and wanted I Have a large supply!
Of fire and murder, marriage, birth and death,
Here Is more than I can utter in a breath!
Rapes, riots, hurricanes, routs, rogues, and faro!
Famine and flames in Turkey, and the plague at Cairo!
Here Is tincture for the gums, which dentists make;
Whose teeth eat most when other people's ache.
Here are rich soups, hams, tongues, oils, sauce, sour krout:
And here is the grand specific for the gout!
Here Is turtle newly landed; lamb house-fed:
And here a wife and five small children wanting bread.
Wholesale and retail British spirits here:
And here is the dying speech of poor small-beer!
Here are tall men, short women, and fat oxen:
And here are Sunday schools, and schools for boxing;
Here ruined rakes for helpmates advertise;
And only want 'em handsome, rich, and wise.
Great news! Here Is money lent on bond, rare news!
By honest, tenderhearted, christian Jews!
Here are promotions, dividends, rewards;
A list of bankrupts, and of new-made lords.
Here the debates at length are, for the week:
And here the deaf and dumb are taught to speak.
Here Hazard, Goodluck, Shergold, and a band
Of generous gentlemen, whose hearts expand
With honor, rectitude, and public spirit,
Equal in high desert, with equal merit,
Divide their tickets into shares, and quarters:
And here is a servant-maid found hanging in her garters!
Here! Here Is the fifty thousand, sold at every shop!
And here is the Newgate calendar -- and drop.
Rare news! Strange news! Extraordinary news!
Who would not give three-halfpence to peruse?
(Going, returns) 'Sblues! I forgot -- Great news, again, I say!
Tonight, at Covent Garden, a new play!
(In raptures) Oh! I Will be there! With Jack, our printer's devil!
We Are judges, we! Know when to clap, or cavil!
We Have heard our pressmen talk of, of -- of Rome and Greece!
And have read Harry-Harry-Harry Stotle's master piece!
When we have paid our shilling, we are the town!
As wisely can find fault as those who pay their crown!
Nay we, like them, if it be bad or good,
Can talk, as fast as, as -- as if we understood!
Oh! I Will be there; get the first row; and, with my staff,
I Will act the trunk-maker, thump, roar, encore, and laugh!
The prompter's boy has called our Jack aside;
And says the Play's to cure the world of pride!
That rich folks will no longer think they are born
To crush the weak, and laugh the poor to scorn!
The great 'twill teach that virtue, wit, and merit,
They may perchance possess, but cannot inherit!
That learning, wisdom, genius, truth, and worth,
Are far more rich and rare than ribbands, rank, and birth!
Lord! Lord! Whoever heard of such a scheme?
Teach sense to wealth and pride! Your poets always dream!
Could he do this, there is no one will deny
That News! Strange news! would be the general cry.

THE SCHOOL FOR ARROGANCE: A COMEDY.
ACT I.
SCENE I. [The House of Sir PAUL PECKHAM.] Enter LYDIA followed by MAC DERMOT.
LYDIA. ONCE again, Mr. Mac Dermot, have done with this nonsense.


Mac D. Arrah, and why so scoffish? Sure now a little bit of making love --


Lydia. Pshaw! Do me the favor to answer my questions. The Count, your master,
is in love with Miss Lucy Peckham?


Mac D. Faith, and you may say that.


Lydia. Is he really well born?


Mac D. Oh! As for that, honey, let him alone. The noblest blood of France,
aye, and what is better, of Ireland too, trickles to his finger's ends. The
Villars and the O'Connollies.


Lydia. And he wishes to marry into the family of the Peckhams?


Mac D. The divle a bit, my dear.


Lydia. How?


Mac D. He is viry willing to marry the young Lady, but not her family. His
pride and his passion have had many a tough battle about that, do you see. Only
think! A direct descindant of the former kings of Ireland, and collateral
cousin to a prisent peer of France, to besmear and besmoulder his dignity by
rubbing it against porter butts, vinegar casks, and beer barrels.


Lydia. Miss Lucy is indeed a lovely girl, animated to excess, and sometimes
apparently giddy and flighty: but she has an excellent understanding, and a
noble heart; and these are superior to birth, which is indeed a thing of mere
accident.


Mac D. Faith, and that it is -- I, a simple Irishman, as I am -- why now, I
would have been born a duke, had they been civil enough to have asked my
consint.


Lydia. The Count fell in love with her at the convent, to which she was sent
to improve her French.


Mac D. And where I think you first met with her?


Lydia. Yes -- she saw me friendless, and conceived a generous and
disinterested affection for me. -- He has followed her to England; has taken
apartments in our neighborhood, and lives in splendor -- yet is not rich.


Mac D. Um, um. -- No -- But then he is a Colonel in the Irish brigade; and,
beside his pay, has sacrit supplies.


Lydia. From whom?


Mac D. Faith, and I don't believe he knows that himself.


Lydia. That Is strange! -- His pride is excessive.


Mac D. To spoke the truth, that now is his failing. -- An if it was not for
that, oh! he would be the jewel of a master! -- He trates his infariors with
contimpt, keeps his distance with his aquals, and values the rubbishing dust of
his great grandfathers above diamonds!


Lydia. His character is in perfect contrast to that of his humble rival, Sir
Samuel Sheepy; who, even when he addresses a footman, is all bows and
affability; whose chief discourse is, Yes, if you please, and, No, thank you;
and who, in the company of his mistress, stammers, blunders, and blushes, like
a great boy.


Mac D. What is it you till me? He the rival of the Count my master! That old
--


Lydia. A bachelor, and only fifty; rich, of a good family, and a great
favorite with Lady Peckham, by never having the courage to contradict her.


Mac D. Why, there now! You talk of the Count's pride! Here is this city lady
as proud as ten counts! Her own coach horses, ready harnessed, don't carry
their heads higher! And then she is as insolent, and as vulgar, and -- Hem!


Enter Lady PECKHAM and Sir SAMUEL SHEEPY, followed by two Footmen, in very
smart morning jackets. Lady P. Here, fellers -- go with these here cards
[Footmen receive each a parcel of large cards, and are going] Oh! Tell that
there butler to come to me -- instantly. -- And -- Do you hear? -- Vhen you
comes back, get those dismal heads of yourn better powdered; put on your no
liveries, and make yourselves a little like christians. -- These creeters are
no better nur brootes, Sir Samooel! They are all so monstrous low, and wulgar!
-- I have a party tonight; I hopes you vill make von?


Sir Sam. Certainly, my Lady.


Lady P. Vhy, vhere is this butler?


Enter BUTLER. Butler. I am here, my Lady!


Lady P. Is all the furniter rubbed?


Butler. All, my Lady!


Lady P. The m'ogany bright?


Butler. As beeswax can make it, my Lady!


Lady P. Bow pots in the china jars?


Butler. Yes, my Lady!


Lady P. The picters on the hall staircase scoured?


Butler. Clean, my Lady! -- But, I -- (hesitating)


Lady P. You! You vhat?


Butler. I am afraid their eyes and noses will soon disappear.


Lady P. Psha! -- Feller! -- Are the no prints come home?


Butler. Yes, my Lady!


Lady P. And the karakatoors hung up in the drawing room?


Butler. All, my Lady!


Lady P. You shall come and see 'em, Sir Samooel!


Sir Sam. Your Ladyship has exquisite taste.


Lady P. Oh! Sir Samooel! -- Vell, feller?


"Butler. My Lady!


Lady P. Vhat do you stand gaping at?


"Butler. My Lady!


Lady P. Vill you begone, feller?


Butler. Oh! -- Yes, my Lady; (Aside) and thank you too! [Exit.


Lady P. So, Miss! is Sir Paul come to town?


Lydia. I have not seen him, Madam.


Lady P. Sir Paul generally sleeps at our country seat, at Hackney.


Sir Sam. A pleasant retreat, my Lady!


Lady P. Wastly! A weary paradise! -- Vhere is my daughter, Miss?


Lydia. I don't know, Madam.


Lady P. And vhy don't you know? Please to go and tell her Sir Samooel is here.
[Exit Lydia.] -- A young purson that my daughter has taken under her purtection.


Sir Sam. Seems mild and modest, my Lady.


Lady P. Not too much of that, Sir Samooel. -- Who (Surveying Mac Dermot) --
pray, who are you, young man?


Mac D. I! -- Faith, my Lady, I -- I am -- mysilf: Mac Dermot.


Lady P. Who?


Mac D. The Count's gintleman.


Lady P. Gentleman! -- Gentleman, indeed! -- Count's gentleman! -- Ha! -- A
kind of mungrel Count, Sir Samooel; half French, half Irish! As good a
gentleman, I suppose, as his footman here! I believes you have seen him though?


Sir Sam. I think I once had the honor to meet him here, my Lady.


Lady P. An honor, Sir Samooel, not of my seeking, I assure you! Aspires to the
hand of Miss Loocy Peckham! -- He! -- An outlandish French foriner! -- I hates
'em all! I looks upon none on 'em as no better nur savages! Vhat do they vant
vith us? Vhy our money, to be sure! A parcel of beggars! -- I vishes I vus
Queen of England for von day only! I vould usher my orders to take and conquer
'em all, and transport 'em to the plantations, instead of negurs.


Sir Sam. I have heard, my Lady, that the Count was my rival.


Lady P. He your rival, Sir Samooel! He! A half bred, higglety-pigglety, Irish,
French fortin hunter rival you indeed! -- [Enter Lydia.] -- Vell, Miss! Vhere
is my daughter?


Lydia. In her own apartment, Madam, dressing.


Lady P. She Will be down presently, Sir Samooel -- Gentleman indeed! The Count's
Gentleman! Ha! Pride and Poverty!


[Exeunt Lady Peckham and Sir Samuel Sheepy. Mac D. (Highly affronted) Pride!
-- By the holy footstool, but your Ladyship and Lucifer are a pair!


(Knocking.) Lydia. Here comes Sir Paul.


Mac D. Then I will be after going.


Lydia. No, no; stay where you are.


Enter Sir PAUL PECKHAM. Sir Paul. Ah! My sweet dear Liddy! You are the angel I
wished first to meet! Come to my -- (Running up to her.) -- Why how now,
hussy? Why so shy?


Lydia. Reserve your transports, Sir, for Lady Peckham.


Sir Paul. Lady! -- But who have we here?


Lydia. Mr. Mac Dermot, Sir.


Sir Paul. Oh! I remember -- servant to the Count, my intended son-in-law.


Mac D. The viry same, Sir. [Bows.]


Sir Paul. I hear an excellent character of your master. They tell me he is a
fine, hearty, dauntless, swaggering fellow! If so, he is a man of family, and
the very husband for my Lucy.


Mac D. Faith, thin, and he is all that!


Sir Paul. As for this Sir Samuel Sheepy, he shall decamp -- A water drinker! A
bowing, scraping, simpering, ceremonious Sir! Never contradicts any body! --
Dammee! An old bachelor! And he! He have the impudence to make love to my fine,
young, spirited wench! -- But he is my Lady's choice! -- Is she within?


Lydia. Yes, Sir.


Sir Paul. I suppose we shall have a fine breeze on this subject! But, what! Am
I not the monarch, the Grand Seignior of this house? Am I not absolute? Shall I
not dispose of my daughter as I please? Do you hear, young man? Go, present my
compliments to the Count, and tell him I mean to give him a call this morning.


[Lydia makes signs to Mac Dermot to stay.] Mac D. I am waiting for him here,
Sir.


Sir Paul. Waiting for him here, Sir! No, Sir! You cannot wait for him here,
Sir!


Mac D. But, Sir --


Sir Paul. And, Sir! Why don't you go?


Mac D. The Count bid me, Sir --


Sir Paul. And I bid you, Sir -- Pack! Begone! [Exit Mac Dermot.] -- Now we are
alone, my dear Lydia -- Why, where are you going, hussy?


Lydia. Didn't you hear my Lady call?


Sir Paul. Call? No. -- And if she did, let her call.


Lydia. Surely, Sir, you would not have me offend her?


Sir Paul. Offend! Let me see who dare be offended with you in this house! It
is my will that you should be the Sultana!


Lydia. Me, Sir!


Sir Paul. You, my Queen of Hearts! You! My house, my wealth, my servants,
myself, all are yours!


Lydia. You talk unintelligibly, Sir.


Sir Paul. Do I? Why then I Will speak plainer. -- I am in love with you! You are
a delicious creature, and I am determined to make your fortune! -- I Will take
you a house up in Mary-lebone; a neat snug box; hire you servants, keep you a
carriage, buy you rings, clothes, and jewels, and come and sup with you every
evening! -- Do you understand me now?


Lydia. Perfectly, Sir!


Sir Paul. Well, and -- hay! -- Does not the plan tickle your fancy? Do not
your veins tingle, your heart beat, your -- hay? What say you?


Lydia. I really, Sir, don't know what to say -- except that I cannot comply,
unless a Lady, whom I think it my duty to consult, should give her consent.


Sir Paul. What Lady? Who?


Lydia. Lady Peckham, Sir.


Sir Paul. My wife! -- Zounds! Are you mad? Tell my wife?


Lydia. I shall further ask the advice of your son and daughter, who will
wonder at your charity, in taking a poor orphan like me under your protection;
will be happy to see themselves ruined for my sake, and will profit by the
example of so venerable a father.


Sir Paul. Poh! Nonsense!


Lydia. A little farther off, if you please, Sir.


Sir Paul. Nearer! Angel! Nearer!


Lydia. I Will raise the house, Sir!


Sir Paul. Pshaw!


Lydia. Help!


Sir Paul. My handkerchief! You sweet --


Enter EDMUND. Edm. Lydia! Sir!


Sir Paul. How now, Sir! -- [Aside to Lydia.] Hem! -- Say it was a mouse --


Edm. What is the matter, Sir?


Sir Paul. What Is that to you, Sir? -- What do you want, Sir? Who sent for you,
Sir?


Edm. I perceive you are not well, Sir!


Sir Paul. Sir!


Edm. How were you taken?


Sir Paul. Taken! -- [Aside] Young scoundrel! -- Take yourself away, Sir!


Edm. Impossible, Sir! You tremble! Your looks are disordered! Your eyes wild!


Sir Paul. [Aside] Here Is a dog!


Edm. Be so obliging, Miss Lydia, as to run and inform Lady Peckham how ill my
father is!


Sir Paul. Why, you imp! [Stopping Lydia] Lydia! Stay where you are -- You
audacious! -- Will you begone?


Edm. That I certainly will not, Sir, while I see you in such a way!


Sir Paul. Way, Sir! -- Very well, Sir! -- Very well!


Edm. I Will reach you a chair, Sir -- Pray sit down -- Pray cool yourself.


Sir Paul. Oh, that I were cooling you in a horsepond!


Edm. You are growing old, Sir.


Sir Paul. You lie, Sir!


Edm. You should be more careful of yourself -- Shall I send for a physician?


Sir Paul. [Aside] Dammee, but I Will physic you! I Will --


Enter a MAN-COOK. Cook. Your soup is ready, Sir.


Sir Paul. Sir!


Cook. Knew your worship's hour -- Never made better in my life -- Rich and
high! Just to your worship's palate.


Sir Paul. Why, fellow, don't you see I Am very ill?


Cook. Ill, Sir Paul!


Sir Paul. That my eyes are wild, that I tremble, am old, and want a physician?


Cook. Lord! Sir Paul! I have been your physician for these fifteen years!


Sir Paul. I tell you, I Am ill; and want cooling! Ask that scoundrel else --
I Am dying! So serve up your dose --


Cook. Ha, ha, ha! Yes, your worship. [Exit.


Sir Paul. [Muttering as he goes off] A sly, invidious -- The demure dog has a
mind to her himself -- Yes, yes! -- Oh! Dammee, pitiful Peter, but I Will fit
you! [Exit.


Lydia. You see, Sir!


Edm. [Shrugging] I do.


Lydia. I must leave this family.


Edm. Leave! Why, charming Lydia, will you afflict me thus? Have I not declared
my purpose?


Lydia. Which cannot be accomplished. You promise marriage, but your father
will never consent.


Edm. Then we will marry without his consent.


Lydia. Oh, no! Do not hope it! When I marry, it shall be to render both my
husband and myself respectable, and happy: not to embitter, not to dishonor
both.


Enter a FOOTMAN. Foot. A person, who calls himself Mr. Dorimont, enquires for
you, Madam.


Lydia. Heavens! Can it be? Show him up instantly. [Exit Footman.


Edm. You seem alarmed!


Lydia. No, no! Overjoyed!


Edm. Who is it?


Lydia. I scarcely can tell you. A gentleman who used to visit me in the
convent.


Edm. Have you been long acquainted?


Lydia. Little more than two years; during which he was my monitor, consoler,
and guide


Edm. [Seeing him before he enters] His appearance --


Lydia. Is poor; but his heart is rich in benevolence. Pray leave us. [Exit
Edmund.


Enter Mr. DORIMONT. Lydia. [Running to meet him] Ah! Sir --


Mr. Dor. I am happy to have found you once again.


Lydia. What, Sir, has brought you to England?


Mr. Dor. Business; part of which was to see you.


Lydia. You have been always generous and kind -- Yet I am sorry you should see
me thus.


Mr. Dor. Why? [Eagerly] What are you?


Lydia. An humble dependant -- A lady's companion.


Mr. Dor. Alas! Why did you leave the convent without informing me?


Lydia. 'Twas unexpected. -- You had forborne your visits; and I feared death,
or some misfortune. At my mother's decease, the young lady with whom I live
having an affection for me, and seeing me deserted, offered to take me with her
to England, promising I should rather be her friend than her companion.


Mr. Dor. And has she kept her word?


Lydia. On her part faithfully, tenderly!


Mr. Dor. That is some consolation!


Lydia. But --


Mr. Dor. What?


Lydia. She has a mother, who does not fail to make inseriority feelingly
understand itself.


Mr. Dor. [With some emotion] Indeed! -- [Collecting himself] But with whom
were you in such earnest conversation when I entered?


Lydia. The brother of my young lady: a gentleman worthy your esteem.


Mr. Dor. And worthy yours? -- You blush!


Lydia. Do you blame me for being just?


Mr. Dor. No -- He is rich, young, and handsome. -- Do you often meet?


Lydia. We do.


Mr. Dor. You are lovely, inexperienced, and unprotected!


Lydia. Fear nothing -- I shall not easily forget myself.


Mr. Dor. [Earnestly] I hope not. -- But what does he say?


Lydia. That he loves me.


Mr. Dor. Is that all?


Lydia. No -- He offers me secret marriage.


Mr. Dor. Secret marriage!


Lydia. I see the danger, and wish to shun it. -- You may find me some place of
refuge in France.


Mr. Dor. Can you so easily renounce all the flattering prospects love has
raised?


Lydia. Yes; and not only them, but love itself, when it is my duty.


Mr. Dor. Noble-minded girl! -- Remain where you are -- Nay, indulge your
hopes; for know, your lover will be honored by your hand.


Lydia. Sir! -- Honored.


Mr. Dor. Honored! -- By birth you are greatly his superior.


Lydia. Can you be serious? -- Oh, trifle not with a too trembling heart! --
Why did my mother conceal this secret from me? -- Or, if true, why die and
leave it unrevealed?


Mr. Dor. There were reasons -- She was not your mother.


Lydia. Not! -- Oh, sir! You have conjured up ten thousand busy thoughts! -- Is
my mother living?


Mr. Dor. No.


Lydia. My father?


Mr. Dor. He is.


Lydia. Why has he so long forsaken me?


Mr. Dor. That must be told hereafter. Be patient -- wait the event. -- You are
acquainted, I think, with Count Conolly Villars?


Lydia. He visits here.


Mr. Dor. I have business with him.


Lydia. Ah, Sir! I fear you will meet a cool reception! Your humble appearance
and his pride will but ill agree.


Mr. Dor. Fear not -- My business is to lower his pride.


Lydia. Sir! He may insult you.


Mr. Dor. Humble though I myself am, I hope to teach him humility. To visit
you, and to accomplish this, was the purport of my journey. -- Adieu for the
present -- Think on what I have said; and, though by birth you are noble,
remember, virtue alone is true nobility.


[Lydia rings. Exit Mr. Dorimont, and enter Lucy: her dress more characteristic
of the girl than of the woman; and her manner full of life, but tempered by the
most delicate sensibility.] Lucy. Well, Lydia! Any news for me?


Lydia. Mr. Mac Dermot has been here, with the Count's compliments; but in
reality to see if Lady Peckham were at home. You know how much he wishes to
avoid her.


Lucy. Yes; and I don't wonder at it. -- She has just been with me, ushering
her orders, as she calls it. -- "I desires, Miss, you vill receive Sir Samooel
Sheepy as your intended spouse." -- And so she has sent me here to be courted;
and the inamorato is coming, as soon as he can take breath and courage!


Lydia. But why, my dear, do you indulge yourself in mocking your mamma?


Lucy. Lydia, I must either laugh or cry; and, though I laugh, I assure you it
is often with an aching heart.


Lydia. My dear girl!


Lucy. I hope, however, you will own there is no great harm in laughing a
little at this charming Adonis, this whimsical lover of mine!


Lydia. Perhaps not.


Lucy. What can his reason be for making love to me?


Lydia. There Is a question! Pray, my dear, do you never look in your glass?


Lucy. Um -- yes -- But does he never look in his glass too?


Lydia. Perhaps his sight begins to decay. -- But are not you alarmed?


Lucy. No.


Lydia. Do not you love the Count?


Lucy. Um -- Yes.


Lydia. Well! And you know how violent and prejudiced Lady Peckham is!


Lucy. Perfectly! But I have Sir Paul on my side; and, as for Sir Samuel, he
was dandled so long in the nursery, and is still so much of the awkward,
bashful boy, that he will never dare to put the question directly to me; and I
am determined never to understand him till he does.


Lydia. Here he comes.


Lucy. Don't leave me.


Enter SIR SAMUEL SHEEPY. Sir Sam. [Bowing with trepidation] Madam -- Hem! --
Madam --


Lucy. [Curtsying and mimicking] Sir -- Hem! Sir -- [Aside to Lydia] Count his
bows!


Sir Sam. Madam, I -- Hem! -- I am afraid -- I am troublesome.


Lucy. Sir -- Hem! -- A gentleman of your merit -- Hem! --


Sir Sam. [Continues bowing through most of the scene] Oh, Madam! -- I am
afraid -- Hem! -- You are busy.


Lucy. [Curtsying to all his bows] Sir -- Hem! --


Sir Sam. Do me the honor to bid me begone.


Lucy. Surely, Sir, you would not have me guilty of rudeness?


Sir Sam. [Aside] What a blunder! -- Madam -- Hem! -- I ask ten thousand
pardons!


Lucy. Good manners require -- Hem!


Sir Sam. That I should begone without bidding. [Going]


Lucy. Sir!


Sir Sam. [Aside] I suppose I Am wrong again*


Lucy. I didn't say so, Sir!


Sir Sam. [Turning quick] Didn't you, Madam?


Lucy. A person of your politeness, breeding, and accomplishments -- Hem! --


Sir Sam. [Aside] She Is laughing at me.


Lucy. Ought to be treated with all reverence. [Curtsying with ironic gravity.]


Sir Sam. [Aside] Yes! She Is making a fool of me!


Lucy. Sir! -- Were you pleased to speak, Sir? -- Hem! --


Sir Sam. Hem! -- Not a word, Madam!


Lydia. This will be a witty conversation.


Lucy. I presume, Sir -- Hem! -- You have something to communicate. --


Sir Sam. Madam! -- Hem! -- Yes, Madam, I mean no, Madam -- No -- Nothing --
Hem! --


Lydia. Nothing, Sir Samuel!


Sir Sam. Hem! -- Nothing -- Nothing.


Lucy. Then may I take the liberty, Sir, to enquire -- Hem! -- What the purport
of your visit is? -- Hem! --


Sir Sam. The -- the -- the -- Hem! -- The -- purport is -- Hem! -- I -- I have
really forgotten!


Lucy. Oh, pray, Sir, take time to recollect yourself -- Hem! -- I am sure, Sir
Samuel -- Hem! -- You have something to say to me -- Hem!


Sir Sam. Yes -- No -- no -- nothing.


Lydia. Fie! Sir Samuel! Nothing to say to a lady!


Sir Sam. No! -- Hem! -- I never had any thing to say to ladies in my life!
That is -- Yes -- Yes -- I own -- I have something of the -- the utmost -- Hem!


Lucy. Indeed!


Sir Sam. A thing which -- lies at my heart! -- Hem!


Lucy. Mercy! -- Sir Samuel! -- Hem! --


Sir Sam. Which I -- Hem! -- Have long -- But I will take some other
opportunity. [Offering to go.]


Lucy. By no means, Sir Samuel! You have quite alarmed me! I am impatient to
hear! I am afraid you are troubled in mind -- Hem!


Sir Sam. Why -- Hem! -- Yes, Madam -- Rather -- Hem!


Lucy. I declare, I thought so! I am very sorry! Perhaps you are afraid of
death?


Sir Sam. Madam!


Lucy. Yet you are not so very old!


Sir Sam. Madam!


Lucy. But I would not have you terrify yourself too much -- Hem!


Sir Sam. Madam!


Lucy. I perceive I have guessed it.


Sir Sam. Madam! Hem! No, Madam.


Lucy. No! -- What then is this important secret? -- Nay, pray tell me -- Hem!


Sir Sam. Hem! N -- n -- n -- n not at present, Madam.


Lydia. Nay, Sir Samuel!


Sir Sam. Some other time, Madam -- Hem!


Lucy. And can you be so cruel to me? Can you? I declare, I shall dream about
you! Shall think I see you in your winding sheet! Or some such frightful
figure! And shall wake all in a tremble -- Hem!


Sir Sam. A tremble indeed, Madam!


Lucy. And will not you tell me, Sir Samuel? Will Not you?


Sir Sam. N -- n -- n -- n not at present, Madam -- Hem!


Lucy. Well, if you will not, Sir Samuel, I must leave you; for what you have said
has absolutely given me the vapors! -- Hem!


Sir Sam. I, Madam! -- Have I given you the vapors?


Lucy. Yes, you have, Sir Samuel; and shockingly too! You have put such gloomy
ideas into my mind!


Sir Sam. Bless me, Madam -- Hem!


Lucy. Your salts, Lydia! -- Hem!


Sir Sam. I hope, Madam, you -- you are not very ill!


Lucy. Oh, I shall be better in another room -- Hem!


Sir Sam. [Aside] Yes, yes; it is my company that has given her the vapors.
[Aloud] Shall I -- [Confusedly offering his arm.]


Lucy. No, no -- Stay where you are, Sir Samuel.


Sir Sam. [Aside] She wants to be rid of me! -- Hem!


Lucy. Only, remember, you are under a promise to tell me your secret -- Hem!
-- If you don't, I shall certainly see your ghost! Remember -- Hem! [Exit.


Sir Sam. Madam -- I -- [Not knowing whether to go or stay] -- [To Lydia] Miss
Lydia -- Hem!


Lydia. Sir!


Sir Sam. If you would -- hem! be so civil, I --


Lydia. Oh, Sir! I have the vapors as bad as Miss Lucy! [Exit.


Sir Sam. Have you? -- Hem! Bless me! Death! Winding-sheets! Ghosts! -- Gloomy
ideas indeed -- Hem! -- She was laughing at me! I am sure she was! Hem! All my
life long have I been laughed at by young coquettish girls! Yet I cannot forsake
'em! Then the vapors! My old trick! I always give young ladies the vapors! I
make 'em ill! They are always sick of me! Hem! -- It Is very strange that I
cannot learn to talk without having a word to say! A thing so common too! Why
cannot I give myself monkey airs, skip here and there, be self-sufficient,
impertinent, and behave like a puppy, purposely to please the ladies? What! Is
there no such thing to be found as a woman who can love a man for his modesty?
This foreign count, now, my rival, is quite a different thing! He [Mimicking]
-- He walks with a straight back, and a cocked-up chin, and a strut, and a
stride, and stares, and takes snuff, and --! Yes, yes! He Is the man for the
ladies! [Exit.


END OF THE FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE, an Apartment in the House of Sir PAUL PECKHAM. LYDIA. I CANNOT forget
it -- My father alive! And I of noble descent! -- It Is very strange! -- Hope,
doubt, and apprehension are all in arms! Imagination hurries me beyond all
limits of probability!


Enter EDMUND. Edm. Why do you thus seek solitude?


Lydia. To indulge thought.


Edm. Has your friend brought you bad news?


Lydia. No.


Edm. What has he said?


Lydia. Strange things!


Edm. Heavens! -- What?


Lydia. You would think me a lunatic, were I to repeat them.


Edm. Lydia! I conjure you not to keep me on the rack!


Lydia. I was enjoined silence, but I feel my heart has no secrets for you --
Yet, you will laugh.


Edm. Ungenerous Lydia!


Lydia. Yes; you will think me mad.


Edm. Lydia, you are unjust.


Lydia. Am I? -- Well then, I am told -- Would you believe it? -- I am told
that my family is illustrious!


Edm. Good heavens! -- It Is true! I feel it is true! Charming Lydia, [Kneeling]
thus let love pay you that homage which the world, blind and malignant, denies.


Lydia. Rise, Edmund. Birth can at best but confer imaginary dignity; there is
no true grandeur but of mind.


Edm. Some one is coming!


Lydia. Aye, aye! Get you gone.


Edm. I am all transport!


Lydia. Hush! Away!


Edm. My angel! [Kisses her hand.]

[Exit hastily.
Enter FOOTMAN, introducing Mr. DORIMONT. Foot. A gentleman to you, Madam.


Lydia. This sudden return, Sir, is kind.


Mr. Dor. I have bethought me. The moment is critical, and what I have to
communicate of importance. Are we secure?


Lydia. We are. This is my apartment. [Lydia goes and bolts the door.] Have you
seen the Count, Sir?


Mr. Dor. No. But I have written to him anonymously.


Lydia. And why anonymously?


Mr. Dor. To rouse his feelings, wound his vanity, and excite his anger. His
slumbering faculties must be awakened. -- Is he kind to you?


Lydia. No. Yet I believe him to be generous, benevolent, and noble of heart;
though his habitual haughtiness gives him the appearance of qualities the very
reverse.


Mr. Dor. Worthy, kind girl! -- You were born for the consolation of a too
unfortunate father!


Lydia. Again you remind me that I have a father. Why am I not allowed to see
him? Why am I not suffered to fly into his arms?


Mr. Dor. He dreads lest his wretched and pitiable condition should make you
meet him with coldness.


Lydia. Oh! How little does he know my heart! Yet speak; tell me, what monster
was the cause of his misery?


Mr. Dor. The monster Pride.


Lydia. Pride!


Mr. Dor. Your mother's pride, which first squandered his wealth, and next
endangered his life.


Lydia. How you alarm me!


Mr. Dor. A despicable dispute for precedence was the occasion of a duel, in
which your father killed his antagonist, whose enraged family, by suborning
witnesses, caused him to be convicted of murder, obliged him to fly the
kingdom, and with your mother wander under a borrowed name, a fugitive in
distant countries.


Lydia. Heavens! -- But why leave me ignorant of my birth?


Mr. Dor. That, being unfortunate, you might be humble: that you might not
grieve after happiness which you seemed destined not to enjoy. 'Twas the
precaution of a fond father, desirous to alleviate, if not succor your
distress.


Lydia. Oh! How I burn to see him! -- Is he not in danger? Is his life secure?


Mr. Dor. He himself can scarcely say. His enemies have discovered him, are hot
in pursuit, and fertile in stratagems and snares. They know that justice is now
busied in his behalf; but justice is slow, and revenge is restless. -- Their
activity, I hear, is redoubled.


Lydia. Guard, I conjure you, guard my father's safety! Let me fly to seek him!
Conduct me to his feet!


Mr. Dor. He wished you first to be informed of his true situation; lest,
knowing him to be noble, you should expect to see him in all the pomp of
affluence, instead of meeting a poor, dejected, forlorn old man.


Lydia. His fears are unjust; injurious to every feeling of filial affection
and duty! The little I have I will freely partake with him. My clothes, the
diamond which my supposed mother left me, whatever I possess shall instantly be
sold for his relief: my life shall be devoted to soften his sorrows. Oh that I
could prove myself worthy to be his daughter! Oh that I could pour out my soul
to secure his felicity!


Mr. Dor. Forbear! -- Let me breathe! -- Affection cannot find utterance! --
Oh! this melting heart! -- My child!


Lydia. Sir!


Mr. Dor. My Lydia!


Lydia. Heavens!


Mr. Dor. My child! -- My daughter!


Lydia. [Falling at his feet] Can it be? -- My father! -- Oh ecstasy!


Mr. Dor. Rise, my child! -- Suffer me to appease my melting heart! -- Oh,
delight of my eyes! -- Why is not your brother like you?


Lydia. My brother! Who? Have I a brother?


Mr. Dor. The Count is your brother.


Lydia. It Is too much!


Mr. Dor. He is not worthy such a sister.


Lydia. The sister of the Count! I! -- Ah! Nature, thy instincts are fabulous:
for, were they not, his heart would have beaten as warmly toward me, as mine
has done for him!


Mr. Dor. I will make him blush at his arrogance. You shall witness his
confusion; which shall be public, that it may be effectual.


Lydia. Would you have me avoid explanation with him?


Mr. Dor. Yes, for the present. -- I mean to see him. Our meeting will be warm;
but he shall feel the authority of a father.


Lydia. If you are a stranger to him, I fear lest --


Mr. Dor. No, no. He knows me, but knows not all his obligations to me. -- I
have secretly supplied him with money, and gained him promotion; which he has
vainly attributed to his personal merits. But I must be gone. My burdened
heart is eased! Once more, dear child of my affections, be prudent. I have much
to apprehend; but, should the present moment prove benign, my future days will
all be peace!


[Knocking heard at the chamber door.] Lydia. [Alarmed] Who Is there?


Sir Paul. [Without] It Is I! -- Open the door!


Lydia. I am busy, Sir.


Sir Paul. Pshaw! Open the door, Itell you!


Mr. Dor. Who is it?


Lydia. Sir Paul.


Mr. Dor. And does he take the liberty to come into your apartment?


Lydia. Oh, Sir, he will take any liberty he can.


Sir Paul. Why don't you open the door?


Mr. Dor. You are surrounded by danger and temptation!


Lydia. Have no fears for me, Sir.


Sir Paul. Will you open the door, I say?


Mr. Dor. Let him come in. [Lydia unbolts the door.]


Enter SIR PAUL. Sir Paul. What is the reason, you dear little baggage, that
you always shut yourself up so carefully?


Lydia. You are one of the reasons, Sir.


Sir Paul. Pshaw! You need not be afraid of me!


Lydia. I Am not afraid of you, Sir.


Sir Paul. Why that is right. I Am come to talk matters over with you. My Lady's
out -- a wisiting. [Mimicking] -- The coast is clear. I have secured my
graceless dog of a son -- I suspect --!


Lydia. What, Sir?


Sir Paul. But it will not do! Mind! Take the hint! -- I Have heard of an excellent
house!


Lydia. You are running on as usual, Sir.


Sir Paul. With a convenient back door! -- I Will bespeak you a carriage! Choose
your own liveries! Keep as many footmen as you please! Indulge in every thing
your heart can wish! Operas, balls, routs, masquerades! Rotten Row of a Sunday!
Town house and country house! Bath, Bristol, or Buxton! Hot wells, or cold
wells! Only -- Hem! -- Hay?


Lydia. Sir, I must not hear such ribaldry.


Sir Paul. Indeed but you must, my dear -- How will you help it? You cannot
escape me now! I have you fast! No scapegrace scoundrel of a --! [Mr. Dorimont
comes forward] And so --


Mr. Dor. [Sternly] And so, Sir!


Sir Paul. Zounds! [Pause] And so! [Looking round] Locked up together! You were
busy!


Mr. Dor. Well, Sir?


Sir Paul. Oh, very, Sir! Perhaps you have a house yourself, Sir?


Mr. Dor. Sir?


Sir Paul. With a convenient back door?


Mr. Dor. So far from offering the lady such an insult, Sir, I am almost
tempted to chastise that impotent effrontery which has been so daring.


Sir Paul. Hem! -- You are very civil, Sir! And, as a return for your
compliment, I am ready to do myself the pleasure, Sir, to wait on you down
stairs.


Lydia. I Will spare you the trouble, Sir.


Mr. Dor. Though this Lady's residence here will be but short, I would have you
beware, Sir, how you shock her ears again, with a proposal so vile!


Sir Paul. Your caution is kind, Sir!


Mr. Dor. I am sorry it is necessary, Sir! What! The head of a house! The
father of a family! Oh! Shame! He who, tottering on the brink of the grave,
would gratify appetites which he no longer knows, by reducing the happy to
misery and the innocent to guilt, deserves to sink into that contempt and
infamy into which he would plunge unwary simplicity.

[Exeunt.
SCENE, the apartment of the Count, an elegant room, with chairs, sopha,
glasses, pictures, etc. MAC DERMOT and PICARD, with a letter in his hand,

Mac D. Here comes the Count! Stand back, man, and hold your tongue!


[Enter the Count, followed by two Footmen, in handsome liveries. Footmen place
themselves in the back ground. Mac Dermot comes a little forward.] Count. The
more I reflect on my own infatuation, the more I am astonished!


Mac D. My Lord --


Count. [Traversing the stage] A man of my birth! My rank! So to forget
himself! -- Still she is an angel! -- But the family of a cit! -- A brewer's
daughter!


Mac D. My Lord --


Count. [Gives him a forbidding look] The world contains not a woman so lovely!
-- Yet the vulgar, haughty, disgusting airs of the mother! The insulting
familiarity of the father! And the free, unceremonious tone of the whole
family! -- I am fascinated!" -- Neither do they condescend to court my
alliance! I must be the humble suitor: I must entreat, must supplicate
permission to degrade my noble ancestors, who will abjure me, blushing through
their winding sheets! -- I must petition, and fawn, and acknowledge the high
honor done* -- No! If I do! -- Yet it is false! I shall! I feel I shall be thus
abject.


Mac D. If -- I might be so bold --


Count. Well, Sir --


Mac D. A letter for your Lordship.


Count. Oh! -- What from the ambassador?


Mac D. No faith, my Lord.


Count. Ha! The Duchess*


Mac D. No, my Lord, nor the Duchess, neither.


Count. [Taking it] Who then, Sir?


Mac D. Faith, my Lord, that is more than I can say -- But perhaps the letter
itsilf can tell you.


Count. Sir! -- Who brought it?


Pic. Un pauvre valet footaman, me Lor -- His shoe, his stocking, his habit,
his chapeau, vas all patch an piece. And he vas --


Mac D. [Aside, interrupting him] Bo!

his white handkerchief] Foh! -- Open it, and inform me of the contents.


Mac D. Yes, my Lord.


Pic. His visage, me Lor --


Count. How now!


Pic. [In a pitiful tone] Me Lor --


Mac D. 'Sblood, man --! [Stopping his mouth, and pushing him back.]

submissively retire] She is ever uppermost! I cannot banish her my thoughts! Do
you hear? -- Dismiss those -- [Waving his hand.]


Mac D. Yes, my Lord. -- Hark you, spalpeens! [Waving his hand with the same
air as the Count.] [Exeunt footmen.

him off, and then returns to examining the letter.]


Count. Insolent menial! -- Well, Sir? The contents?


Mac D. Faith, my Lord, I am afraid the contints will not plase you!


Count. How so, Sir?


Mac D. Why, as for the how so, my Lord, if your Lordship will but be plased to
rade --


Count. Didn't I order you to read?


Mac D. To be sure you did, my Lord; but I should take it as a viry particular
grate favor, if that your Lordship would but be plased to rade for yoursilf.


Count. Why, Sir?


Mac D. Your Lordship's timper is a little warm; and --


Count. Read!


Mac D. Well -- If I must I must! -- The person who thinks proper, at present,
to address you --


Count. [Interrupting] Sir!


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. Be pleased to begin the letter, Sir!


Mac D. Begin? Sarra the word of beginning is here -- before or after --


Count. `The person'?


Mac D. Yes, my Lord.


Count. Mighty odd! [Throws himself in the arm-chair] Proceed, Sir.


Mac D. The person who thinks proper, at present, to address you, takes the
liberty to inform you that your haughtiness, instead of being dignified, is
ridiculous.


Count. [Starting up] Sir!


Mac D. Why now, I told your Lordship!


Count. [Traversing the stage.] Go on!


Mac D. [With hesitating fear.] The little -- merit -- you have --


Count. [With a look.] The little merit I have? The little? -- The little? --
[Mac Dermot holds up the letter.] -- Go on!


Mac D. The little merit you have -- cannot convince the world that your pride
-- is not -- is not -- is not --


Count. Is not what? [Sternly.]


Mac D. [Fearful] `Impertinent.'


Count. [Striking Mac Dermot.] Rascal!


Mac D. Viry well, my Lord! -- [Throwing down the letter] I humbly thank your
Lordship! -- By Jasus! But I Will remimber the favor --


Count. [More coolly] Read, Sir.


Mac D. To the divle I pitch me if I do!


Count. [Conscious of having done wrong] Read, Mac Dermot.


Mac D. No, my Lord! -- Mac Dermot is a man! -- An Englishman! -- Or an
Irishman, by Jasus, which is better still! And by the holy poker, if but that
your Lordship was not a Lord now! -- [Pulling down his sleeves, and clenching
his fist with great agony.]


Count. [Carelessly letting his purse fall] Pick up that purse, Mac Dermot.


Mac D. It Is viry well! -- Oh! -- Well! -- Well! -- Well! [Lays the purse on
the table.]


Count. You may keep it -- Mac Dermot.


Mac D. What! -- I touch it! -- No, my Lord! -- Don't you think it! -- I
despise your guineas! -- An Irishman is not to be paid for a blow!


Count. [With increasing consciousness of error, and struggling with his
feelings] -- I -- I have been hasty --


Mac D. Well, well! -- It Is viry well!


Count. I am -- I -- I am sorry, Mac Dermot.


Mac D. [Softened] My Lord!


Count. [Emphatically] Very sorry --


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. Pray forget it! [Taking him by the hand] I cannot forgive myself.


Mac D. By the blessed Mary, then, but I can. -- Your Lordship is a noble
gentleman! -- There is many an upstart Lord has the courage to strike, whin
they know their poor starving depindants hands are chained to their sides, by
writchedness and oppression: but few indeed have the courage to own the injury!


Count. I will remember, Mac Dermot, that I am in your debt.


Mac D. Faith, and if you do, my Lord, your mimory will be better than mine! --
I have lived with your Lordship some years; and, though not always a kind, you
have always been a ginerous master. To be sure, I niver before had the honor
of a blow from your Lordship; but then I niver before had the satisfaction to
be quite sure that, while you remimbered yoursilf to be a Lord, you had not
forgotten poor Mac Dermot was a man.


Count. Well, well! [Aside, and his pride returning] He thinks he has a license
now to prate. -- There is no teaching servants; nay indeed there is no teaching
any body a sense of propriety!


Mac D. Did your Lordship spoke? [Bowing kindly.]


Count. Give me that letter. And -- take the money -- It is yours.


Mac D. Your Lordship will be plased for to pardon me there. -- If you think
proper, you may give me twice as much tomorrow. -- But the divle a doit I Will
touch for today!


Count. Wait within call.


Mac D. [Going] I niver before knew he was all togedther such a jewel of a
master! [Exit.


Count. It Is this infernal letter that caused me to betray myself thus to my
servant! -- And who is this insolent, this rash adviser? May I perish if I do
not punish the affront! -- Here is no name! -- A strange hand too! -- [Reads]
The friend who gives you this useful lesson has disguised his hand, and
concealed his name -- Anonymous coward! -- His present intention being to
awaken reflection, and make you blush at your own bloated vanity' --
Intolerable! Or, if not, to prepare you for a visit from one who thinks it his
duty to lower your arrogance; and who will undertake the disagreeable task this
very day. -- Will he? Will he? -- Mac Dermot!


Mac D. [Entering] My Lord!


Count. If any stranger enquire for me, inform me instantly.


Mac D. Yes, my Lord.


Enter EDMUND. Edm. Good Morrow, Count.


Count. [Slightly bowing, and with vexation to Mac Dermot] Why, where are my
fellows? No body to show the gentleman up?


Edm. Oh! You are too ceremonious by half, Count!


Count. [With quickness] A little ceremony, Sir, is the essence of good
breeding.


Edm. Psha!


Count. Psha, Sir!


Edm. Ceremony, like fringe hiding a beautiful face, makes you suspect grace
itself of deformity.


Count. Do you hear, Mac Dermot?


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. See that those rascals are more attentive!


Edm. Why, what is the matter with you, Count?


Count. [Muttering and traversing] Count! Count!


Edm. You seem out of temper!


Count. [Strongly feeling his own impropriety] Oh dear! No -- No -- Upon my
honor, no! -- You totally mistake -- I assure you, you mistake. I Am very glad
to see you! I am indeed! [Taking him eagerly by the hand.]


Edm. I Am very glad you are. Though you have an odd mode of expressing your
joy! But you are one of the unaccountables! Cast off this formality --


Count. [Aside] Very fine! [Biting his fingers] Formality, Sir!


Edm. Give the heart its genuine flow! -- Throw away constraint, and don't
appear as if you were always on the tenter-hooks of imaginary insult!


Count. I! [Aside] This is damned impertinent! [Struggling to be over-familiar]
You entirely misconceive me! My character is frank and open! No man has less
constraint! I even study to be, as it were, spontaneous!


Edm. Ha, ha, ha! I perceive you do!


Count. Really, Sir! -- [Aside] Does he mean to insult me?


Edm. I thought to have put you in a good humor.


Count. I am in a good humor, Sir! I never was in a better humor, Sir! Never,
Sir! 'Sdeath! A good humor, indeed! -- Some little regard to propriety, and
such manners as good breeding prescribes to gentlemen --


Edm Ha, ha, ha! Well, well, Count, endeavor to forget the gentleman, and --


Count. Sir! No, Sir: however you may think proper to act, that is a character
I shall never forget.


Edm. Never, except at such moments as these, I grant, Count.


Count By --!


Edm. Well gulped! -- I had a sort of a message; but I find I must take some
other opportunity, when you are not quite in so good a humor. [Going] I Will
tell my sister what --


Count. Sir! -- Your sister! -- My divine Lucy! -- A message!


Edm. So! The magic chord is touched!


Count. Dear Sir, I -- I, I, I, -- I am afraid I am warm. -- Your sister you
said! -- I doubt I -- that is --


Edm. Well, well, make no apologies.


Count. Apologies! No, Sir! -- I did not mean -- That is -- Yes -- I -- My Lucy!
My Lucy! What message?


Edm. Nay, I cannot well say myself. You know the madcap. -- She bade me tell
you, if I happened [Significantly] to see you, that she wanted to give you a
lecture.


Count. Indeed! [Aside] I Am lectured by the whole family. [Aloud] On what
subject?


Edm. Perhaps you will take pet again!


Count. I, Sir! -- Take pet! -- My sense of propriety, Sir -- [Biting his lips.]


Edm. Why, ay? Your sense of propriety, which, by the bye, my slippant sister
calls your pride, [Count in great agitation] is always on the watch, to catch
the moment when it becomes you to take offense.


Count. You -- You are determined I shall not want opportunities!


Edm. You mistake, Count -- I have a friendship for you. -- Why, what a
forbidding stare is that now! Ay! A friendship for you.


Count. Sir -- I -- I am not insensible of the -- honor --


Edm. Yes, you are.


Count. [With over-acted condescension] Sir, you are exceedingly mistaken! Very
exceedingly! Indeed you are! As I am a man of honor, there is no gentleman
whom I should think it a higher -- that is -- Upon my soul --!


Sir PAUL on the Stairs. Sir Paul. Is the Count at home, young man?


Footman. [Without] Yes, Sir.


Edm. I hear my father! We have had a fracas; I must escape! If you will come
and listen to my sister's lecture, so -- Good Morrow! [Exit.


Count. It Is insufferable! Never sure did man of my rank run the gauntlet thus!
No respect! No distinction of persons! But with people of this class it is ever
so -- Hail fellow well met!


Enter SIR PAUL. Sir Paul. Ay! Hail fellow well met! Hay! You jolly dog!
[Shaking him heartily by the hand.]


Count. Hem! Good -- Good Morrow, Sir! [Aside] Here is another family lecturer!


Sir Paul. Was not that young Mock-modesty that brushed by me on the stairs?


Count. It was your son, Sir.


Sir Paul. Good morning, Sir! [Mimicking] said the scoundrel, when he was out
of my reach. -- Dammee! [With a kick] I would have shown him the shortest way
to the bottom! -- Well -- Hay! You have elegant apartments here!


Count. [With contempt] Very indifferent, Sir!


Sir Paul. I shall remain in town for a fortnight, and am glad you live so near
-- We'll storm the wine-cellar! -- I hear you are no flincher! -- Hay! When
shall we have a set-to! Hay! When shall we have a rory tory? A catch, and a
toast, and a gallon a man! -- But -- Hay! -- What Is the matter? -- An't you
well?


Count. [With sudden excess of affability] Oh, yes, Sir Paul! Exceedingly well,
Sir Paul! Never better, Sir Paul!


Sir Paul. Why, that is right -- I thought you had been struck dumb.


Count. Oh! By no means, Sir Paul! I am very happy to see you! Extremely happy!
Inexpressibly --


Sir Paul. I knew you would -- What say you to my Lucy? Hay!


Count. Say! That she -- She is a phoenix! [In raptures.]


Sir Paul. Dammee, so she is! What is a phoenix?


Count. I adore her!


Sir Paul. That Is right!


Count. The day that makes her mine, will be the happiest of my life!


Sir Paul. So it will -- For I Will make youas drunk as an emperor! Hollo, there!
-- Get your master's hat -- Come, come; you shall dine with me. [Locking him by
the arm.]


Count. Sir!


Sir Paul. Dammee, I Will make you drunk today!


Count. Did you speak to me, Sir?


Sir Paul. To you? Why, what the devil! Do you think I spoke to your footman?
[Quitting his arm.]


Count. [Again endeavoring to be affable] Oh, no, Sir Paul! No! I -- Pardon me
-- I -- I was absent.


Sir Paul. Absent! -- I smell a rat -- Your dignity took miff!


Count. No, Sir Paul; by no means -- No -- I -- That is -- I will acknowledge,
I am not very much accustomed to such familiarities.


Sir Paul. Are you not? Then you soon must be.


Count. Sir!


Sir Paul. Ay, Sir! A few lessons from me will cure you.


Count. Sir -- I --


Sir Paul. I am the man to make you throw off! I Will teach you to kick your
stateliness down stairs, and toss your pride, as I do my wig, behind the fire.


Count. Good breeding, Sir --


Sir Paul. Good breeding, Sir, is a blockhead, Sir! None of your sormal Don
Glums! None of your grand pas for me! A friend, good fellowship, and the other
bottle! That Is my motto!


Count. People of my rank distinguish --


Sir Paul. Damn distinctions!


Count. They make it a condition, Sir --


Sir Paul. Indeed! -- Look you, my dear Count, either unbridle, or you and I
are two. You tell me you love my daughter -- She is the finest girl in England;
and I believe the slut has taken a fancy to you. The match pleases me, because
it displeases my wife -- And, except when you are riding your high horse, I
like you, Count. -- Dismount, and it is a match. -- If not, turn the peg, and
prance! I Am your humble!


Count. [Aside] I Will not endure it! Racks shall not make me bend to this!


Sir Paul. Lucy is a wench after my own heart! -- No piping, no pining, no
sobbing for her! I have a fine fellow in my eye --


Count. Sir! [Alarmed]


Sir Paul. None of your Sir Ramrod Grumble-gizzards!


Count. By Heavens! I would cut the villain's throat who should dare impede my
happiness!


Sir Paul. Why ay! Dammee, now you talk!


Count. The loss of my Lucy would render me the most wretched of beings!


Enter MAC DERMOT with the hat. Sir Paul. To be sure -- [Taking him again by
the arm] Come, come! [Claps the Count's hat on his head] Dinner is waiting! I
smell the haunch! It perfumes the whole street! Come along! I hate the shackles
of ceremony! A smoking table, and a replenished sideboard, soon put all men on
a level! Your hungry and thirsty souls for me! He that enters my house, always
deposits his grandeur, if he has any, at the door! [Sings]

"This brown jug, my dear Tom, which now foams with mild ale."


Mac D. Well said, old Toby! Oh! [Rubbing his hands.]


[Exeunt. The Count making disconcerted attempts to preserve his stateliness,
wishing to be familiar, scarcely knowing how to behave, and Mac Dermot enjoying
his embarrassment. END OF THE SECOND ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE I. The drawing room of Sir Paul Peckham elegantly furnished, but hung
all round with prints, chiefly caricatures. EDMUND and LYDIA. Edm. I SHALL
never recover from my surprise!


Lydia. Hush!


Edm. The Count your brother? -- My sister, my family, must be informed.


Lydia. Not on your life, Edmund. So implacable are his enemies, that my father
informs me an Exempt, bribed by them, has followed him to England.


Edm. Impotent malice! The laws will here protect him.


Lydia. Oh! Who can say? The wicked cunning of such life-hunters is dreadful!
-- I insist therefore upon your promise.


Edm. My Angel! Fear nothing! [Kissing her hand.]


Enter LUCY unperceived. Lucy. [Placing herself beside Edmund] Turn about! --
Now me. [Holding out her hand]


Edm. Oh sister! I am the happiest of men!


Lucy. And you appear to be very busy too, with your happiness.


Edm. Did you but know! --


Lucy. Oh! I know a great deal more than you suspect -- Not but you seem to be
taking measures to inform the whole house.


Edm. Of what?


Lucy. [Placing herself between them] That you two are never easy apart.


Edm. Sister -- I -- I must insist that you speak of this Lady with -- with
every respect!


Lucy. Brother!


Lydia. Edmund!


Lucy. [Looking first at one and then at the other] Strange enough this!


Edm. Were I to tell you --


Lydia. [Aside, and making signs] Very well!


Lucy. Tell me what? -- Why don't you tell me?


Edm. Pshaw! No no -- Nothing -- I -- I don't know what I am saying.


Lucy. Why surely you don't imagine your fondness for each other is any secret?


Edm. Sister! I don't understand -- Are you narrow-minded enough to suppose
this young lady unworthy the hand of --


Lucy. Of my brother? -- No -- To call my Lydia Sister [Taking her hand] is one
of the things on earth I most fervently wish.


Lydia. My generous friend!


Edm. My charming girl!


Lucy. But -- then --


Edm. There are now no buts! It will be an honor -- I say, sister, you -- you
don't know -- In short I must very earnestly solicit you to treat Miss Lydia
with all possible delicacy -- I -- I -- I cannot tell you more at present --
But I once again request, I conjure, nay I --


Lydia. Hem!


Lucy. Hem! -- Humph!


Edm. You -- You understand me, sister. [Exit.


Lucy. Indeed I don't! -- There now goes one of your Lord and Masters! Take
care of him! He Will make an excellent grand Turk -- [Humorously burlesquing]
Treat Miss Lydia, I say, with all possible delicacy -- And have I, Lydia, have
I shown a want of delicacy to my friend?


Lydia. Oh, no! My heart throbs with an oppressive sense of your generous, your
affectionate attention to me.


Lucy. Oppressive? -- Well! This is the proudest world!


Lydia. Nay, I didn't mean --


Lucy. Oh! No matter!


Lydia. Have you had any conversation with the Count?


Lucy. No -- There has been no opportunity yet today -- I am really afraid his
pride is quite as absurd as that of my good Mamma!


Lydia. And your affection begins to cool.


Lucy. Um -- I -- I cannot say that -- Heigho! -- He has his faults.


Lydia. [Ardently] I hope he has his virtues too!


Lucy. So do I -- But how to cure those faults?


Lydia. If incurable, 'twould break my heart!


Lucy. Your ardor surprises me! -- But, hush!


Enter COUNT. Count. [Bowing] I was afraid, Madam, love would not have found so
much as a moment to speak its anxieties -- Nay even now -- [Looking haughtily
toward Lydia.]


Lydia. [Pointedly, and almost in tears] Sir, I -- I am sensible of my own
unworthiness. [Exit.


Lucy. That lady, Sir, is my friend.


Count. Madam!


Lucy. Why are you surprised?


Count. Madam! -- No -- no, not surprised -- There is a maxim, indeed, which
says -- Friendship can only subsist between equals.


Lucy. But where is the inferiority?


Count. Madam!


Lucy. You are above the poor, the pitiful idea, that wealth confers any claims?


Count. Perhaps it does not, Madam. But beauty, understanding, wit, in short,
mind, confers ten thousand! And in these I never beheld your peer!


Lucy. Very prettily spoken, indeed! And I am almost persuaded that you love me
very dearly.


Count. Madam, I adore you!


Lucy. Yes, you are continually thinking of my good qualities.


Count. Eternally, Madam! I think of nothing else!


Lucy. True -- You never remember your own!


Count. Were I totally insensible of my own, Madam, I should be unworthy of you.


Lucy. You admire me even in my representatives, my relations and friends!
Affable to all, good-humoured to all, attentive to all, your politeness, ease,
and urbanity extend to every person for whom you think my heart is any way
interested! Your passions are all subservient to love!


Count. Yes, Madam; subservient is the very word! They are all subservient to
love!


Lucy. You never recollect the dignity of your descent, nor accuse mine of
meanness! You have too much understanding to plume your thoughts with turgid
arrogance; or to presume on the imaginary merit of an accident, which none but
ignorance, prejudice, and folly, are so besotted as to attribute to themselves!


Count. Mankind have agreed, Madam, to honor the descendants of the wise and
the brave.


Lucy. They have so -- But you have too much native merit to arrogate to
yourself the worth of others! You are no jay, decked in the peacock's feathers!
You are not idiot enough to imagine that a skin of parchment, on which is
emblazoned the arms and acts of one wise man, with a long list of succeeding
fools, is any honor to you! Responsible to mankind for the use or the abuse of
such talents as you feel yourself endowed with, you think only of how you may
deserve greatly; and disdain to be that secondary thing, that insignificant
cipher, which is worthless except from situation!


Count. The feelings of injured honor, Madam, perhaps may be too irritable.
They shrink from insult, and spurn at contamination! Yet honor is the source
of a thousand virtues! The parent of ten thousand glorious deeds! Honor is
generous, sincere, and magnanimous! The protector of innocence, the assertor of
right, the avenger of wrong! Yes! Honor is the patron of arts, the promoter of
science, the bulwark of government, the defender of kings, and the savior of
nations! -- Indulge me then in cherishing a sentiment so noble!


Lucy. Indulge? -- Applaud, you mean! Honor with you never degenerates into
ostentation! Is never presumptuous! Is no boaster! Is eager to earn, but scorns
to extort pre-eminence! Your honor is not that abject inflated phantom which
usurps contested claims, exacts submission which it does not merit, offends,
irritates, and incites disgust, nay tarnishes even virtue itself! You do not,
under the word Honor, seek a miserable cobweb covering for exorbitant pride!


Count. Madam, accusation so pointed, so --


Lucy. Nay, now! Have not I been reading your panegyric?


Enter a FOOTMAN. Foot. My lady desires you will come to her immediately, Madam.


Lucy. Very well [Exit Footman]. -- I am a thoughtless, slighty girl! What I
say can have but little meaning -- Else, indeed, I would have ventured to have
given you a word of advice -- But -- It Is no matter.


Count. Madam, you have stung me to the soul! If I am indeed what you describe,
'twere time I should reform.


Lucy. I must be gone. -- I have, I own, been wildly picturing something to
myself, which I greatly fear I could not love! [Exit.


Count. And is it my likeness? -- Surely it cannot be! -- Could not love? --
Excruciating thought! [Exit after Lucy.


Enter EDMUND, in haste, and LYDIA from an inner chamber, meeting. Edm. Where
is the Count?


Lydia. This moment gone --


Edm. [Eagerly] Which way?


Lydia. Through that door.


Edm. [Running, stops at the door] Ah! It Is too late! The footman is telling
him.


Lydia. Why are you so much alarmed?


Edm. The clouds are collected, and the storm is coming!


Lydia. What do you mean?


Edm. Lady Peckham has watched her opportunity: Sir Paul has dropped asleep in
his armchair; she has ordered your sister to her apartment, and has sent to the
Count to come and speak with her; that is, to come and be insulted, here in the
drawing room.


Lydia. What can be done?


Edm. I know not -- I dread her intolerable tongue.


Lydia. Perhaps were you to retire, and, when they grow warm* to interrupt them
at the proper moment, the presence of a third person might be some restraint on
the workings of pride; of the violent ebullitions of which I am in great
apprehension.


Edm. Had I but met the Count before he had received the message! --


Lydia. Here comes Lady Peckham. Begone!

[Exit Edmund.
Enter Lady PECKHAM, followed by a Footman* Foot. I have delivered your
ladyship's message, and the Count is coming.


Lady P. [Swelling] Weary vell! -- Go you about your business, feller -- [Exit
Footman.] Your company is not vanted, miss.

[Exit Lydia after Edmund.
Enter COUNT, bowing. Lady P. So, Sir! They tells me, Sir, that you and my
foolish husband are colloguing together, for to marry my daughter! Is this
troo, Sir?


Count. [With his usual polite haughtiness] If it were, Madam?


Lady P. Do you know who Miss Loocy Peckham is, Sir?


Count. Not very well, Madam.


Lady P. Sir!


Count. Except that she is -- your daughter.


Lady P. And do you know who I am, Sir?


Count. I have been told, Madam --


Lady P. Told, Sir! Told! Vhat have you been told? Vhat have you been told, Sir?


Count. That your ladyship was an honest wax-chandler's daughter.


Lady P. Yes, Sir! The debbidy of his vard, Sir! A common councilman, and city
swordbearer! Had an aldermand's gownd von year, vus chosen sheriff the next,
and died a lord mayor elect!


Count. With all his honors blooming on his brow.


Lady P. And do you know, Sir, that I designs Sir Samooel Sheepy, Sir, an
English knight and barrowknight, for the spouse of my daughter? A gentleman
that is a gentleman! A purson of honor and purtensions, and not a papish
Jesubite!


Count. Of his honors and pretensions I am yet to be informed, Madam.


Lady P. Vhat, Sir! Do you mean for to say, Sir, or to insinivate, Sir, that
Sir Samooel Sheepy is not your betters?


Count. If Sir Samuel himself, Madam, had put such a question to me, I would
have replied with my sword; or, more properly, with my cane.


Lady P. Cane! Weary vell, Sir! I Will let Sir Samooel know that you threatens to
cane him! I Will take care to report you! Cane quotha! He shall talk to you!


Count. Let him, Madam!


Lady P. Madam! Madam! At every vord -- Pray, Sir, do you know that Sir Paul
Peckham has had the honor to be knighted by the King's own hand?


Count. I have heard as much, Madam.


Lady P. Madam, indeed! -- And for you for to think for to look up to my
daughter!


Count. Up, Madam!


Lady P. Yes, Sir -- Up, Sir! -- Pray, Sir, vhat are your purtensions?


Count. [With great agitation] Madam!


Lady P. Who are you, Sir? Vhere do you come from? Who knows you? Vhat parish
do you belong to?


Count. Madam, I am of a family known to history, known to Europe, known to the
whole universe!


Lady P. Ah! I believes you are better known nur trusted!


Count. The names of Connolly and Villars, Madam, never before were so degraded
as they have been in my person.


Lady P. Oh! I makes no doubt but you are a purson that vould degurade any name!


Count. Insult like what I have received from you, Madam, no man that breathes
should utter, and escape death -- But you are --


Lady P. Vhat, Sir? Vhat am I, Sir? Vhat am I, Sir?


Count. A woman.


Lady P. A voman, indeed! Sir, I vould have you to know, Sir, as how I am a
lady! A lady, Sir, of his Majesty's own making! And moreover, Sir, don't you go
for to flatter yourself that I shall bestow the hand and fortin of Miss Loocy
Peckham upon any needy outlandish Count Somebody-nobody! My daughter, Sir, is
for your betters!


Count. Madam, though scurril -- [Recollecting himself] I say, Madam, though
such vul -- such accusations are beneath all answer, yet I must tell you that,
by marrying your daughter, if after this I should sink myself so low -- I say
by marrying your daughter, Madam, I should confer an honor on your family, as
much superior to its expectations, as the splendor of the glorious sun is to
the twinkling of the worthless glowworm.


Lady P. Vhat! -- Vhat! -- [Enter EDMUND] Marry come up! An Irish French
foriner! Not so good as von of our parish porpers! And you! You purtend to
compare yourself to the united houses of the Peckhams and the Pringles! Your
family indeed! Yourn! Vhere's your settlement? Yourn! Vusn't my great uncle,
Mr. Peter Pringle, the cheesemonger of Cateatonstreet, a major in the
Train-Bands before you vus born, or thought of?


Edm. [Aside] So, so! I Am too late! [Aloud] Let me entreat your Ladyship --


Lady P. Vhat! Hasn't I an ownd sister at this day married to Mr. Poladore
Spragges, the tip-toppest hot-presser in all Crutched Friars! Is Not my maiden
aunt, Miss Angelica Pringle, vorth thirty thousand pounds, in the South Sea
funds, every day she rises! And does not I myself go to bed, and get up, the
greatest lady in this here city? And for to purtend for to talk to me of his
family! Hisn!


Edm. [Very warmly] I must tell you, my Lady, you strangely forget yourself,
and expose your family to ridicule.


Lady P. You must tell me, Sir! Vhy, Sir, how dare you have the temeracity for
to come for to go for to dare for to tell me! Here Is fine doings! Henpecked by
my own chicken!


Edm. The Count, Madam, is a man of the first distinction, in his native
country!


Lady P. Vhat country is that, Sir? Who ever heard of any country but England?
A Count among beggars! How much is his Countship vorth?


Count. I had determined to be silent, Madam, but I find it is impossible!
[With vehement volubility] And, I must inform you, my family is as ancient, as
exalted, and as renowned, as you have proved yours to be -- what I shall not
repeat! That I am the heir to more rich acres than I believe your Ladyship ever
rode over! That my father's vassals are more numerous than your Ladyship's
vaunted guineas! That the magnificence in which he has lived looked with
contempt on the petty paltry strainings of a trader's pride! -- And that in his
hall are daily fed -- [Stops short, and betrays a consciousness of inadvertent
falsehood, but suddenly continues with increasing vehemence] Yes, Madam, are
daily fed, now, at this moment, Madam, more faithful adherents, with their
menials and followers, than all your boasted wealth could for a single year
supply!


Edm. Are? At this moment, say you, Count?


Count. Sir -- I -- I have said.


Edm. I know you to be a man of honor, and that you cannot say what is not.


Count. I -- I -- I have said, Sir. [Walking with great perturbation.]


Lady P. You have said more in a minute nur you can prove in a year!


Edm. [Warmly] Madam, I will pledge my life for the Count's veracity.


Lady P. You pledge! Vhat do you know about the matter? I Will pledge that he has
been telling a pack of the most monstrous --


Edm. Forbear, Madam! Such insult is too gross to be endured, almost, from an
angry woman! Dear Count --


Lady P. Voman again! Weary fine! Weary pretty! Voman quotha! To be called a
voman by my own witals!


Count. [Aside] What have I done! -- [With agony] A lie!


Lady P. As for you, Sir, I does not believe von vord you say! I knows the
tricks of such sham shevaleers as you too vell!


Count. [Walking away from her] Torture!


Lady P. But I Will take care to have you prognosticated.


Count. [Aside] Damnation!


Lady P. I Will have you karakatoored in your troo colors! I Will have you painted
in your father's hall; you and your vooden shoe shrug and snuffle scare-crows;
your half dozen lank and lean shotten herring shadows; vith the light shining
through 'em, like parchment at a vorkshop vinder; grinning hunger over a dish
of soup-meegur, vith a second course of frogs; and a plate of hedge-berries and
crab apples for the dessert! I Will depicter you! I Will not forget your wassals!


Count. [Aside] I can support it no longer. [Going.]


Edm. [Catches him by the hand] My dear Count --


Count. Sir! -- I am a dishonored villain!

[Exit.
Lady P. There! There! He tells you himself he is a willin! His conscience
flies in his face, and he owns it!


Edm. [With great ardour and feeling] Madam! He is a noble-hearted gentleman!
His agonizing mind deems it villainy to suffer insult so gross. -- Sorry am I,
Madam, to be obliged to tell you that, humble though your family is, the
disgrace with which you have loaded it is indelible! With anguish of heart you
force me to repeat, I blush while I listen to you! [Exit.


Lady P. Vhy who ever heard the like of this here now? Here Is a prodigal son!
Here Is a regenerate reprobate! Here Is a graceless Gogmagog! To purtend as how
he is ashamed of me! Me! A purson of my carriage, connections, and breeding! I!
Whose weary entrance, of a ball night, puts Haberdasher's-hall all in a
combustion!


Re-enter the COUNT, deep in thought, and much agitated. Lady P. [Seeing him]
Marry my daughter, indeed! -- Faugh! [Exit Lady Peckham.


Count. Into what has my impetuous anger hurried me? -- Guilty of falsehood! --
I? -- To recede is impossible! -- What! Stand detected before this city madam!
Whose tongue, itching with the very scrophula of pride, would iterate liar in
my ear! No! Falsehood itself is not so foul! -- Mac Dermot!


Enter MAC DERMOT. Mac D. My Lord!


Count. Mac Dermot -- I -- You -- You have heard of the state which formerly my
father held; of his household grandeur, of the hinds and servants whom he daily
fed, and the train by which he was attended!


Mac D. To be sure I have, my Lord. -- Here, your dukes and your peers know
nothing at all of style! Abroad, some hundreds starve, that one may ate! But,
in England, they have learned the trick of aich man ating for himsilf!


Count. Psha! Listen -- The -- The misfortunes that since have befallen us are
little known in this country.


Mac D. To be sure they are not, my Lord.


Count. Nor -- N -- Hem! -- Nor would I have them -- D -- D -- D -- a -- Hem!
-- Do you understand me, Mac Dermot?


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. I -- I -- I would not be exposed to the insolent taunts of upstart
wealth.


Mac D. Faith then, my Lord, you must not live in this city.


Count. Nay, but -- attend to me -- I -- I would -- I would have them think --


Mac D. [After waiting] What, my Lord?


Count. [Traversing the stage, striking his forehead, and then returning] Mac
Dermot -- there are situations -- I say, it may sometimes be wise, at least
prudent -- and -- and -- excusable -- Have not you remarked, Mac Dermot, that
Lydia -- [Short pause.]


Mac D. Oh! To be sure I have remarked, my Lord, that she is a sweet crater;
that Miss Liddy!


Count. Nay, but -- Her influence in the family --


Mac D. Oh yes, my Lord.


Count. Now -- if -- if -- Suppose you were -- to take -- an opportunity -- Is
she proud?


Mac D. Mild as mother's milk, my Lord!


Count. If she were persuaded -- I say -- Our family misfortunes -- That is --
No -- No -- The family magnificence -- Do you comprehend me?


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. Psha! -- Damnation! [Exit.


Mac D. [Stands some time amazed] Why, now, am I Mac Dermot, or am I not? --
The Divle! -- He would have me take an opportunity with Miss Liddy! -- Faith
and I would very willingly do that -- And persuade her -- Oh! Honey, but she is
not so asy to be persuaded! [Pauses] To be sure he must mane something! [Pauses
again] Oh! Hona mon dioul! But I have it! -- Ahoo! What a thickscull have I
been, all this while! -- He is a little bit ashamed to be thought poor, among
this tribe of Balifarnians, who have nothing but their dirty guineas to boast
of -- And so he would have me persuade -- Oh ho! -- Let me alone. There she
goes! I will be after -- Bo! Flustration! There is that Mr. Edmund, now, close
at her heels! -- The young royster is always getting the sweet crater up in a
corner! -- Take an opportunity? Sarra the opportunity there is for me to take!

[Exit.
END OF THE THIRD ACT.
ACT IV.
SCENE, The COUNT's Apartment. MR. DORIMONT and MAC DERMOT. MR. DORIMONT. PRAY,
Sir, is the Count within?


Mac D. The Count, Sir! And pray why may you ask?


Mr. Dor. I want to speak with him, Sir.


Mac D. Spoke! Oh! The Count is not so asy to be spoken with. Plase to deliver
your message to me.


Mr. Dor. Inform him I am come for an answer to my letter.


Mac D. [Alarmed] Letter, Sir! -- What! The letter brought by a shabby footman?


Mr. Dor. Ay, ay -- Has he read it?


Mac D. Read it! Faith, and it has been very well read! But pray, Sir, now, are
you the writer?


Mr. Dor. I am.


Mac D. [With dread] Then take my advice! Make your escape! -- It Is very well
for you my master is not at home!


Mr. Dor. [Smiling] Why so?


Mac D. Why so? Man alive! Have you a mind to be murdered?


Mr. Dor. Fear nothing. [Knocking heard.


Mac D. [With increasing terror] By the holy phial but there he is! -- Why,
will you begone now?


Mr. Dor. No -- I will not.


Mac D. Marcy upon my soul! -- For the Lord's sake, Sir! -- Why, Sir, I tell
you he will have your blood! And will not you begone now?


Mr. Dor. No, Sir.


Mac D. Lord Jasus! What will I do? If he comes into this room, here will be
murder!


Mr. Dor. Go -- Tell him I am waiting for him.


Mac D. Me tell him! -- I warn you to begone! Remimber, I wash my hands of your
blood. -- Make off! -- Make off, I tell you, while I go and keep him to his own
apartment! [Exit.


Mr. Dor. [To a footman crossing] Hark you, young man! Tell the Count, your
master, that the stranger, who wrote the anonymous letter to him, is here,
waiting for an answer.


Foot. Yes, Sir. [Exit.


Mr. Dor. The sears of the servant strongly speak the anger of the master. --
But that was what I partly feared, and partly wished.


Count. [Enraged without.] Where is the rash, the audacious, [Enter COUNT] the
insolent wretch, who -- [Aside] My father!


Mr. Dor. I scarcely could have expected so kind a welcome, Sir! It Is exemplary!


Count. Passion, Sir, is sometimes guilty of improprieties -- Pray pardon me!


[Enter MAC DERMOT, behind, in trepidation.] Count. I imagined -- [Seeing Mac
Dermot] How now, Sir! Begone!


Mr. Dor. Why so? Let him stay!


Count. Begone, or! --


Mr. Dor. Stay, I say!


Count. And do you hear -- I am not at home.


Mac D. [Aside, and going] Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Here will be murder! [Exit.


Mr. Dor. What should that mean, Sir?


Count. Sir! -- There are reasons -- I ought not to expose my father's safety.


Mr. Dor. Rather own, you ought not to blush at your father's poverty! Is this
my reception? This the warm welcome of a duteous son?


Count. It Is so sudden -- Yet my heart feels an affection --


Mr. Dor. Which is stifled by your vanity! Your father is contemned, because he
is unfortunate!


Count. No, Sir. I do not merit a reproach so cruel. Contemn my father! You
know me not. -- Tell me, which way can I prove my respect and love?


Mr. Dor. By openly acknowledging me: not by concealment; not by disavowing me
in the day of my distress!


Count. Think, Sir, of your own safety!


Mr. Dor. What danger is there with people of honor? Present me to the family
of Sir Paul.


Count. Impossible, Sir!


Mr. Dor. [Sternly] Impossible!


Count. Let me conjure you not to be too precipitate. You know not the vulgar
pomp of new-made gentry; whose suffocating pride treats indigent merit, nay,
birth itself, with the most imperious disdain!


Mr. Dor. Talk not of their pride, but of your own! You complain of others
haughtiness? You! In whom the vice is so intolerable, that you willingly would
disown your father!


Count. Sir, you wrong me.


Mr. Dor. But, determined to be known for what I am, since you refuse, I Will
introduce myself.


Count. For heaven's sake, Sir! I entreat! I supplicate! On my knees, I conjure
you to forbear!


Mr. Dor. Yes; pride, kneeling, conjures a father in poverty to suffer himself
to be disclaimed! Your mother's pride was my house's downfall: this she has
bequeathed to you!


Count. Sir -- [Starts up at hearing]


Sir Paul. [Without] I tell you, I know he is at home!


Mac D. [Without] Upon my soul, Sir Paul --


Sir Paul. Zounds! Why I saw him from my own window!


Count. [Alarmed] Here is Sir Paul! You know not, Sir, how much is at stake! I
have not time to tell you now; but let my entreaties --!


Mr. Dor. Oh! How humble are the proud! But remember, I consent only on
condition that you restrain your arrogance. If, while I am present, any symptom
-- [Retiring back.]


Enter SIR PAUL. Sir Paul. 'Sblood! I knew you were at home! But to instruct
servants how to lie, with the most cool, composed, and barefaced impudence, is
one branch of modern education.


Count. I am sorry, Sir Paul.


Sir Paul. Pshaw! Damn apologies. I have good news for you.


Count. Sir!


Sir Paul. I do believe, (God forgive me!) that my wife is growing reasonable!


Count. Does she consent?


Sir Paul. Yes -- To permit you to ask her pardon.


Count. Sir! Ask pardon?


Mr. Dor. [Advancing] Yes, Sir; ask pardon.


Sir Paul. Hem! -- [Aside] Zounds! Again! -- Why, what the plague can he do
here?


Mr. Dor. Your servant, Sir.


Sir Paul. Sir, your very humble.


Count. [Aside, and alarmed] What can this mean?


Mr. Dor. You seem surprised, Sir.


Sir Paul. Yes! You have a trick of taking people by surprise.


Count. [Aside] Does he know him?


Sir Paul. [Aside, and then to the Count] Odd enough! -- Who is this queer old
fellow?


Count. [Aside] All is safe! -- [Aloud] Sir, the -- the -- gentleman [Aside]
What shall I say? [To Sir Paul] A gentleman, Sir, who --


Sir Paul. A gentleman!


Count. Yes -- That is --


Sir Paul. What, some poor relation, I suppose?


Count. Yes, Sir -- A relation -- The -- the family estates have been under his
management.


Sir Paul. Oh! Your steward?


Count. No -- Not absolutely my -- my steward --


Sir Paul. What, your land-bailiff, then?


Count. No, Sir -- No -- That is --


Sir Paul. Does not seem to have made his fortune by his office! A little
weather-beaten.


Count. He is a man of the strictest probity, Sir.


Sir Paul. Nay, his appearance is the pledge of his honesty!


Mr. Dor. [Aside] I can perceive he is practicing deceit! Oh vanity! But I will
restrain my anger. The moment of open punishment is not yet come.


Count. [Crossing to his father] Let me request you, Sir, not to reveal
yourself.


Mr. Dor. [Drily] Well, Sir.


Count. [Returning to Sir Paul] His economy and good management are equal to
his fidelity.


Sir Paul. [Aside] Confounded odd all this, though! [Aloud] Well, Count, I have
exerted my whole authority with Lady Peckham; and her son Edmund, who has more
influence over her than any body else, is your friend. So be wary, do your
duty, and the day is your own.


Count. My duty, Sir!


Mr. Dor. Yes, Sir. Your duty, Sir.


Sir Paul. [Aside] A damned strange fellow! [Aloud] Is it not your duty, Count,
to serve yourself?


Mr. Dor. And would you contend about a word?


Sir Paul. Very true, Sir! -- You seem a -- a plain spoken -- a -- Hem!


Mr. Dor. [Significantly] Yes! I think it my duty to tell vice, and folly, the
truth.


Sir Paul. Hem! -- You hear, Count?


Mr. Dor. His punctilious pride is contemptible!


Count. [Half forgetting himself] Sir!


Mr. Dor. And Sir! -- I repeat: do your duty, Sir.


Sir Paul. [Aside] The most unaccountable! Hem! --


Count. [Aside] I am on the rack! He will betray himself.


Sir Paul. [To the Count] The old gentleman does not mince matters!


Count. [Aside to his Father] You will ruin me.


Mr. Dor. Do as he requires, or I will feign no longer.


Sir Paul. Lady Peckham is expecting you. Come, come; try whether you cannot
put on a winning submissive air.


Count. [Aside] I shall burst!


Mr. Dor. Submissive, Sir! -- Remember!


Count. I shall not forget, Sir!


Sir Paul. You approve my advice, don't you, Sir?


Mr. Dor. Entirely. The lesson you give him, Sir, is a useful and a necessary
one. I know him!


Count. [Aside] Fiends!


Sir Paul. What, Sir -- You -- have lived long in the family?


Mr. Dor. Sir!


Sir Paul. Nay, don't be affronted!


Count. [To Sir Paul] Let us begone, Sir! I am ready to attend you.


Sir Paul. [Aside] The bluntest, drollest --!


Count. We are losing time, Sir.


Sir Paul. Well, well; in a moment. [To Mr. Dorimont] Pray, under favor, what
may be the amount of the Count's rent roll?


Mr. Dor. Sir! His rent roll, Sir?


Sir Paul. Ay, his rent roll -- The nett produce of his estates?


Mr. Dor. Why that question to me, Sir?


Count. [Coming between them] For heaven's sake, Sir Paul, let us go.


Sir Paul. 'Sblood! What a violent hurry you're in all of a sudden!


Count. [Endeavouring to force him away] Lady Peckham is waiting, Sir. I beg, I
entreat --


Sir Paul. [Aside] The mystery thickens!


Mr. Dor. Pray, Sir, has the Count --


Count. [Interrupting] For the love of mercy, Sir, answer no questions; hear
none, ask none! I am frantic!


Mr. Dor. [To the Count] Silence, Sir! [To Sir Paul] Has the Count ever talked
of his estates?


Sir Paul. Oh yes.


Count. [Aside] Damnation!


Mr. Dor. And told you the amount?


Sir Paul. No -- no -- But, as you --


Count. I must insist, Sir, on going. [To Sir Paul.]


Mr. Dor. I Am not prepared, Sir, just now to answer your question, of the rent
roll. I have business, and must leave you; but I will shortly give you the
information you require. In the mean time, young gentleman, think on what has
passed! Observe Sir Paul's advice, and act as becomes you. Put off your vanity
-- Be humble, and know yourself. [Exit.


Count. [Aside fervently] Thank heaven he is gone!


Sir Paul. Your steward is an odd one!


Count. Sir -- I -- I tell you he is not my steward.


Sir Paul. No!


Count. No, Sir.


Sir Paul. What is he then?


Count. Sir -- I --


Sir Paul. I thought you taught every body to keep their distance; but he
treats you with as little ceremony as -- [Aside] as he did me.


Count. Yes, Sir; people do take very unaccountable liberties.


Sir Paul. But what brought him here?


Count. Sir -- He -- Business, Sir.


Sir Paul. Oh, the family estates.


Count. And pray, Sir, what do you know of him?


Sir Paul. I -- Nothing.


Count. You appear to be acquainted.


Sir Paul. Um -- No, no.


Count. You had seen him before.


Sir Paul. Hem! Yes, I had seen him. Come, let us be going.


Count. But permit me to ask.


"Sir Paul. Pshaw!" Come, come -- Lady Peckham is waiting.


Count. I must own, Sir Paul, I meet with many mortifications. Your daughter is
an angel. But there are certain things to which a man of my rank must not,
cannot stoop. Do you, Sir Paul, come to an agreement with your lady, and I am
ready. -- [Calls] Mac Dermot! -- I Will return in a moment. [Retires.]


Sir Paul. Now, if the demon of ambition did not possess me, I should never
truckle to the self-sufficient airs of this man of rank! He has put a spell
upon me! -- I Will break with him this moment -- Yet, if I do that, all is over.
My authority is gone! Madam will be triumphant; and then farewell to submission!
-- Beside, the honor of the alliance! Nobility! Precedence! A family so
famous! 'Sblood! Who knows but my grandson may be a Marshal of France? [To the
Count, who returns] Come, come, Count; let us begone. You must make your peace
with my Madam.


Count. Solicitation, Sir Paul, does not become me; it is a thing I have not
been accustomed to. Do you speak for me. Say all, say every thing you please.
Your mediation will, I presume, be sufficient.


Sir Paul. [Quite angry] Damn me if this is not beyond all human patience!
After all I have done in your behalf! What! Would you have me and my whole
family approach your footstool, there present my daughter, and kneeling beg
your highness to accept her? No, my haughty Count! Either my daughter is worth
asking for, or not worth having. Carry your pomp to a better market; I Will stoop
to it no longer. Your servant, Sir! [Exit.


Count. [Following] Nay, Sir Paul -- Must I endure this? Must I? -- I! The
descendant of an ancient race! The rightful lord of athousand vassals! Ought I
to cringe in supplicatory baseness, use servile dishonorable adulation, bend
to sufflated wealth, act the parasite to new-fledged pride, and petition where
I should command? No! Earth should hide me rather! But that love, imperious
love hurries me forward, with impulse irresistible! What! Wait, and fawn on
Madam, and mince, and simper, and act the skipjack, and chatter to her parrot,
and be of her opinion, and fetch and carry, and praise her taste, and join her
scandal, and laugh when she laughs, and kiss her monkey! -- And to whom? -- Oh!
[Exit.


SCENE changes to the House of SIR PAUL PECKHAM. MAC DERMOT, and LYDIA. Mac D.
Oh, yes! Stabling for a hundred horses! Open house all the year about! Sarvants
five and twinty to the score; all making work for one another!


Lydia. Then the Count, your master, should be immensely rich.


Mac D. Should be? To be sure he is. Don't I tell you --


Lydia. Yes; you tell me one thing at night, and another in the morning -- You
had forgotten the Colonel's pay! -- And the secret supplies!


Mac D. [Aside] Faith, and so I had!


Lydia. And pray was this all your own invention?


Mac D. Why, as to that -- And is it me, now, that you would have to betray my
master?


Lydia. What, then, he bid you spread this report?


Mac D. Arrah now, did I say that? -- Did I say that? -- I tell you he bid me
no such thing! -- What, and did you think, now, you could get that out of me?
By St. Patrick, but I would bite off my tongue, if it should dare to blunder
out one word against so good a master! --


Lydia. [Aside] Honest, affectionate fellow!


Mac D. [Aside] Oh! Blarney! -- She wants to be too cunning for me, the sweet
crater! And so, for fear of -- Miss Liddy, your servant.

[Exit.
Lydia. I almost love him myself, for his love to his master.


Enter SIR PAUL, followed by EDMUND. Sir Paul. I tell you, I have done with
him. He is a pompous, insolent coxcomb! The Great Mogul himself is a fool to
him!


Edm. All men have their foibles, Sir.


Sir Paul. Damn his foibles. I have enough to do with my own! And, do you hear,
Sir? [Significantly] Don't let me be troubled with any of your foibles either!
You understand me. [Looking at both] I Will not be trifled with. [Exit.


Lydia. What has put him into so ill a humor?


Edm. The cursed supercilious haughtiness of the Count. He has insulted Sir
Samuel Sheepy, too!


"Lydia. I am sorry for it; but that is a trifle.


Edm. You are mistaken. Sir Samuel's resentment is very high; and,
notwithstanding the servility of his manner, is more to be apprehended than you
imagine.


Lydia. Surely you do not expect a challenge?


Edm. Nay, my love, I would not wish to terrify you.


Lydia. But you have terrified me!


Enter LUCY. Lucy. Well, brother, have you succeeded with my mamma?


Edm. I believe so -- I cannot tell -- Where is the Count?


Lucy. I hear him on the stairs.


Edm. Well, warn him to be careful.

[Exit with chagrin.
Lucy. What Is the matter?


Lydia. The old story! The Count's pride. If he should quarrel again with Lady
Peckham, all will then be over!


Lucy You have put me quite in a tremor!


Enter the COUNT. Bows. Lucy. [Going] I will inform my mamma, Sir, that you are
here; and she will be with you immediately.


Count. May I not, Madam, be indulged with one previous word?


Lucy. Yes, Sir; one, and but one. Instead of conciliating, I find your manners
offend and disgust every one. Either cast away your hauteur, regain the
affections and consent of my friends, and above all make your peace with Lady
Peckham, or this shall be the last meeting of our lives! [Exit.


Lydia. Are you aware, Sir, of your danger? Sir Samuel, Sir Paul, Lady Peckham,
all affronted! Nay your best friend, Edmund, has this moment left the room to
avoid you! Oh! Think on that lovely lady! And if you have any affection for
her, for yourself, or for your father -- recall your reason, discard your
folly, and act with a little common sense! [Exit.


Count. This is strange! -- My father? -- She know my father? -- And why am I
schooled and tutored thus? What have I done? What is it they expect from me? --
Do I indeed offend and disgust? -- Which way? Has not love induced me to
overlook all the high distinctions which honor holds sacred? Nay, am I not now
come on the most abject of errands? -- Yet, to lose her --! The last meeting of
our lives! -- They will absolutely drive me mad among 'em!


Enter LADY PECKHAM. Count. Madam [Bowing] -- When I last had the honor -- of
a -- an interview with your ladyship, I -- I am afraid -- I might possibly be
inadvertently betrayed into -- some warmth.


Lady P. Vhy, Sir, seeing as how my son tells me you are a real nobleman, and
not von of the rifraff fortin hunting fellers, if so be as you thinks fit to
make proper pologies, vhy, Sir, I -- I --


Count. To a lady, Madam, every apology may be made. Any concessions therefore
--


Lady P. Oh, Sir, as for that there, I vants nothing but vhat is right and
downright. And I supposes, Sir, you are weary villin to own that an outlandish
foriner must think himself highly honored, by a connection with an English
family of distinction. Because that I am sure you cannot deny. And that it vus
a most perumptery purceedin in you, being as you are but a Frenchman, or of an
Irish generation at best, to purtend to the hand and fortin of Miss Loocy
Peckham, vithout my connivance.


Count. Madam!


Lady P. As I tells you, Sir, I am upright and downright. So do you, or do you
not?


Count. Madam --! I am ready to acknowledge that the charms of your daughter's
mind, and person, are equal to any rank!


Lady P. Her mind and purson, indeed! No, Sir! Her family and fortin! -- And I
believes, Sir, now you are come to your proper senses, you vill own too that no
outlandish lord, vhatever, can uphold any comparagement vith the Peckham family
and connexions!


Count. [With great warmth and rapidity] Madam, though I am ready to offer
every excuse which can reasonably be required, for any former inadvertency;
yet, Madam, no consideration whatever shall lead me -- I say, Madam, my own
honor, a sense of what is due to my ancestors, myself, and to truth -- that
is, Madam -- No! The world, racks, shall not force me to rank my family with
yours.


Lady P. Vhy, Sir! Vhat is it that you are talking of? Rank my family vith
yourn, indeed! Marry come up! No, to be sure! I say rank! I knows weary vell
vhat is my do: and that there, Sir, is the thing that I vould have you for to
know! And I insist upon it, Sir, that you shall know it; and shall own that you
knows it; or, Sir, I rewoke every thing I have condescended to specify vith my
son! So do you, Sir, or do you not?


Count. Madam -- What, Madam?


Lady P. Do you depose, that outlandish foriners are all beggars, and slaves;
and that von Englishman is vorth a hundred Frenchmen?


Count. Madam -- Whatever you please. [Bows.]


Lady P. Oh! Weary vell! -- And do you purdict that this here city is the first
city in the whole vorld?


Count. I -- I believe it is, Madam.


Lady P. Oh! Weary vell! -- And that the Moniment, and the Tower, and
Lununbridge, are most magnanimous and superfluous buildings?


Count. Madam --


Lady P. I Will have no circumbendibus! Are they, or are they not?


Count. Your ladyship is pleased to say so. [Bows.]


Lady P. To be sure I does! Because I knows it to be troo! And that the
wretches in forin parts are all fed upon bran; seeing as how there is no corn?


Count. As your ladyship thinks! [Bows.]


Lady P. And that the whole country could not purwide von lord mayor's feast?


Count. I -- Certainly not, Madam: they have few turtle and no aldermen.


Lady P. Ah! A pretty country, indeed! No aldermen! And that it vould be the
hite of pursumption, in you, for to go for to set yourself up as my equal? Do
you own that?


Count. [Passionately] No, Madam!


Lady P. Sir!


Count. No force, no temptation shall induce me so to dishonor my great
progenitors!


Lady P. Vhy, Sir!


Count. My swelling heart can hold no longer! Honor revolts at such baseness!
Patience itself cannot brook a fallacy so glaring! No! Though destruction were
to swallow me, I would assert my house's rights, and its superior claims!


Lady P. Weary vell, Sir! Wastly vell, Sir! And I vould have you for to know,
Sir, vhile my name is my Lady Peckham, I will dissert my houses rights, and
claims! That I despises all --! Ha, ha! -- Ha! Weary fine, indeed! Am I to be
sent here to be hectored, and huffed, and bluffed, and bullied, and bounced,
and blustered, and brow-beat, and scoffed, and scouted, and --! Ha!


Count. [Recovering his temper and interceding] Madam --


Lady P. I a brought my hogs to a fine market! But I Will let 'em know who is at
home!


Count. My warmth, Madam --


Lady P. Your honor and glory, indeed! And for to purtend for to send for me
here, to palaver me over as I supposed --


Count. I am ready to own, Madam --


Lady P. But I Will rid the house of you! I Will take good care you shall have no
daughter of mine! You may post off to your father's hall, and there starve in
state. Varm it with a blaze of dried leaves, and stop up the gaps in the
shattered vinders, and old groaning doors, vith clay; then send your shivering
wassals, that stand jabbering behind your von armed vooden chair, to skin the
sheep that died of hunger and the rot, to make you a varm vinter surtout!


Count. [Still interceding] Madam --


Lady P. My daughter, indeed! I Will karakatoor you! [Exit.


Count. Flames and fury! [Following, is met by Sir Samuel Sheepy, who shuts the
door after him, and will not suffer the Count to pass.] How now, Sir!


Sir Sam. [Bowing] Sir, your humble servant.


Count. What does this mean, Sir? Let me pass!


Sir Sam. A word or two first, if you please, Sir.


Count. Let me pass! [Putting his hand to his sword.]


Sir Sam. [Bowing, but resolutely guarding the door] Sir I must humbly entreat
--


Count. Damnation! -- What is it you want with me, Sir? Who are you, Sir?


Sir Sam. My name is Sheepy, Sir. [Bowing.]


Count. Sheepy? [Aside] So, so, so! Hell and the devil! At such a moment as
this!


Sir Sam. I am told, Sir, I have some obligations to you, which it becomes me
to discharge.


Count. Well, Sir.


Sir Sam. Not quite so well, Sir, as I could wish. [Bowing.]


Count. [Aside] Was ever man so tormented?


Sir Sam. I am informed, Sir, that you have condescended to mention me, in my
absence.


Count. And so, Sir?


Sir Sam. You did me an honor, Sir. [Bowing.]


Count. Either speak your business, and suffer me to pass, or I will nail you
to the door!


Sir Sam. Dear Sir, you are so warm! [Bowing] -- I have been told you were so
good as to threaten to cane me.


Count. Ay, Sir? By whom!


Sir Sam. By Lady Peckham, Sir.


Count. Indeed! -- Well; suppose it.


Sir Sam. 'Twas kind of you! -- Unluckily, I have not been much used to
threatening messages, and am really afraid I shall not be very prompt at
submission.


Count. Oh, do not doubt yourself, Sir.


Sir Sam. Humble though I am, I do not find that a swaggering look -- [Bowing.]


Count. Sir! [With his hand to his sword.]


Sir Sam. Moderate your anger, kind Sir -- I have a petition to you. [Putting
on his white gloves.]


Count. Damn your sneer, Sir! Speak!


Sir Sam. Bless me, Sir! You are so warm! It is only that you would kindly do
me the favor either to cut my throat, or suffer me to cut yours. [Draws and
flourishes.]


Count. [With his hand to his sword] Are you mad, Sir? Do you recollect where
you are? In whose house?


Sir Sam. Gadso! True, Sir! I should be sorry to be interrupted -- Luckily, my
carriage is at the door; and I know a snug room in a neighboring tavern, where
this business may be effectually settled, as quietly, as coolly, and as
privately as possible.


Count. 'Twere well for you, Sir, had you chosen another opportunity -- But
come!


Sir Sam. Oh! Sir! I know my place -- After you! [Bows.]


Count. Away, Sir! [Exeunt.


SCENE changes to the COUNT's Apartment. A considerable noise of hasty
footsteps without, and voices at some distance calling -- "Here! Here! -- This
way! -- Up, up! -- Follow!" Enter Mr. DORIMONT, abruptly. Mr. Dor. I am
pursued, beset, and cannot escape!


Enter MAC DERMOT. Mac D. Blood and thunder! Why what is all this? Oh! And is it
you, Sir?


Mr. Dor. Where is the Count?


Mac D. Faith and that is more than I can tell. [Noise approaching -- Here,
here, I tell you! This room!] Why what the divle --!


Mr. Dor. I am hunted! My liberty, perhaps my life, is in danger!


Mac D. Why sure the Count would not --


Mr. Dor. Here! Take, hide this packet from the eyes of my pursuers! Don't lose
it; but, if you have any sense of worth and honesty, deliver it safe into the
hands of Sir Paul Peckham!


Mac D. Niver fear me, honey.


Enter an EXEMPT, and two BAILIFFS. Exempt. That Is the man. Seize him!


First Bail. Sir, you are our prisoner.


Mr. Dor. On what authority, Sir?


First Bail. Authority, Sir? The authority of law, Sir.


Mr. Dor. For what crime?


First Bail. As to crime, Sir, I cannot tell; but for a trifling debt, of fifty
thousand pounds.


Mr. Dor. At whose suit?


Exempt. At mine, Sir.


Mr. Dor. Yours? Vile wretch! Gentlemen* he is a spy: the creature of a foreign
Court! I never had dealings with him in my life!


First Bail. We know nothing of that, Sir. He has sworn to the debt.


Exempt. No parleying; take him away.


First Bail. Ay, ay. Come, Sir. [They all three forcibly drag him out.]


Mr. Dor. [Going and without] Help! Rescue! False Imprisonment!


Mac D. Why what is all this now? -- Poor old gintleman!


[Noise without at a distance -- "Rescue! Rescue! Help!"] Mac D. Where is my
shillalee? -- Oh, by St. Peter and his crook, but I will be one among you,
scoundrels! [Exit running.


END OF THE FOURTH ACT.
ACT V.
SCENE, The House of SIR PAUL PECKHAM. Enter LYDIA agitated, EDMUND following.
EDMUND. BE pacified: you are too much alarmed.


Lydia. If Sir Paul should have let them pass, what dreadful consequences may
have followed! Where can he be?


Edm. He is here!


Enter SIR PAUL. Lydia. Oh, Sir! -- Where are they? -- Has any thing happened?


Sir Paul. Happened! -- Dammee! I could not believe my own ears! -- A silky
Simon! -- The Count was in a right humor -- 'Sblood! I had a great mind to
have let him kill the old fool.


Lydia. Then they have not fought! Are they safe, Sir?


Sir Paul. Yes, yes; they are safe enough -- But do you know the amorous swain,
his blood being heated, could only be pacified on condition that he might have
another interview with Lucy! -- I Am glad on it! -- I Will go and give her her
lesson.


Edm. Oh, Sir, leave him to my sister, she needs no instructions.


Sir Paul. No? -- Gad, I believe not! She Is my own girl! But clear the coast;
he is coming!


Edm. I will go to Lady Peckham; and do you, Lydia, watch for the Count.


Sir Paul. Ay, ay. He is suddenly grown humble; apologized to me, and promised
to come and plead with my lady. But away.

[Exeunt Edmund and Lydia, and
Enter SIR SAMUEL SHEEPY. Well, Sir Samuel, you are here!

Sir Sam. Yes, Sir. [Aside] And I half wish I was any where else, already.


Sir Paul. And so you absolutely have the courage to attack my Lucy? Ha, ha,
ha! Why you are quite a hero! You fear neither man nor woman!


Sir Sam. [Aside] I wish I didn't --


Sir Paul. Nay, but don't begin to look so pitiful! She Will be here in a minute.
Don't flinch! Stand to your guns! She Will not easily strike! Ha, ha, ha! Die
hard, my old boy!

[Exit.
Sir Sam. What is the matter with me? I declare he has talked me into a
tremble! Why should I be so terrified at a harmless woman? I cannot help it! A
pair of beautiful eyes are flaming swords, which no armor can resist!


Enter LUCY, cheerfully. Lucy. So, Sir Samuel!


Sir Sam. Bless me! -- My heart is in my mouth!


Lucy. You seem taken by surprise.


Sir Sam. Madam -- Hem! -- No, Madam -- Yes, Madam. [With his usual bows.]


Lucy. My Papa informed me you were waiting, purposely to disclose this
important secret.


Sir Sam. Madam -- Hem! -- Yes, Madam --


Lucy. Do you know that I have had you in my mind I don't know how often, since
I saw you?


Sir Sam. Hem! -- Have you, Madam?


Lucy. Yes, I have -- It Is a pity, nay indeed a shame, that so famous an
English family as that of the Sheepy's should become extinct.


Sir Sam. Hem! -- There is no danger of that, Madam.


Lucy. No! -- Why it is too late in life for you to marry, Sir Samuel --


Sir Sam. Hem! -- Yes, Madam. No, Madam.


Lucy. Indeed! So you --! Well! I should like to know your choice -- Some staid
body, I imagine.


Sir Sam. Madam -- Hem! --


Lucy. But I would not have her too old, and disagreeable.


Sir Sam. Hem! I can assure you, Madam -- She -- Hem! -- She is a very
beautiful young lady.


Lucy. You surprise me! -- Oh! Then perhaps she is some low-born girl, who has
more pride than understanding, and is willing to sacrifice her youth, and
beauty, to the silly vanity of riding in a coach?


Sir Sam. Quite -- Hem! -- Quite the contrary, Madam.


Lucy. Then she must be poor, and must think of marrying you for the sake of
your riches, hoping you will die soon.


Sir Sam. Madam -- Hem! She is very rich.


Lucy. Is it possible!


Sir Sam. And I should flatter myself would not expect me to die too soon.


Lucy. Oh! But she will! Young women never marry old men, but with a wish to
dance over their graves.


Sir Sam. Hem!


Lucy. Perhaps the poor girl may -- may have made a faux pas.


Sir Sam. Hem! Her virtue is unspotted, Madam.


Lucy. You amaze me! Young, rich, beautiful, and virtuous! What can her reason
be for making choice of you? Why does not she rather marry some youth, whose
rare qualities resemble her own? -- Oh! I Have found the secret at last! She Is an
idiot.


Sir Sam. Hem! No, Madam -- No -- Hem! -- I am afraid she has too much wit!


Lucy. Nay then, Sir Samuel, you are the most fortunate gentleman I ever heard
or read of! -- But are you sure she is in love with you?


Sir Sam. Hem! N -- Not very, Madam.


Lucy. No! -- Oh ho! I have unriddled it at last! You have been bargaining for
her with her father, or her mother, or -- Ay, ay! The poor young lady's consent
has never been asked! -- And would you be so selfish as to seek your own single
gratification, and be contented to see her condemned to misery, pining to death
for the youth she loves, and justly detesting the sight of you, as the wicked
unfeeling author of her wretchedness?


Sir Sam. Hem! [Looking toward the door] Madam I -- Hem! -- I wish you a good
evening.


Lucy. [Preventing his going] Another word, Sir Samuel. Have you ever talked to
the young lady on the subject?


Sir Sam. Hem! I -- Hem! -- I have and -- Hem! I have not.


Lucy. You never made a direct proposal?


Sir Sam. Hem! No, Madam.


Lucy. But why?


Sir Sam. I, I -- Hem! -- I cannot very well tell.


Lucy. But I can. -- With much folly and depravity, there is still some virtue
in you.


Sir Sam. Madam! [Looking how to escape.]


Lucy. Though you could form so unjust a project, you never had the courage to
insult the lady by an avowal of your guilt.


Sir Sam. Hem! Guilt, Madam!


Lucy. Yes, Sir, guilt -- However, Sir, she has perfectly understood your
insinuations.


Sir Sam. Madam!


Lucy. She has infinite respect for filial duties. But, though she would beware
of offending her parents, I know her to be equally determined never to entail
misery on herself; nor to accept a husband whom she could neither esteem,
admire, nor love!


Sir Sam. Madam -- I -- Hem! -- Your servant, Madam.


Lucy. [Between him and the door] Not till you first promise --


Sir Sam. [Forgetting his fear] I Will promise any thing, Madam.


Lucy. That you will not render yourself more ridiculous, by persevering in so
absurd, so unjust a pursuit.


Sir Sam. No, Madam! I Am quite ridiculous enough already!


Lucy. Nay, more, that you will not seek some less friended, more enslaved, or
more timid young creature, whom your misapplied wealth might command.


Sir Sam. Whatever you please, Madam!


Lucy. But that you will rather apply your superfluous hoards to the protection
of youthful innocence.


Sir Sam. Suffer me but to depart, Madam, and I will bequeath my estates in
perpetuity as you shall direct; I Will entail them on the Magdalen; or I Will
advertise for marriageable men and maids, and you shall portion out my money
among them! I Will -- I Will do any thing, except marry, or go a courting!


Lucy. Why then, Sir Samuel -- [Kissing his hand] There -- That be your reward.


Sir Sam. Madam -- Your humble servant.

[Exit abruptly.
Lucy. Ha, ha, ha! Poor Sir Samuel! This is the first time he ever forgot his
bow. [Enter the COUNT.] Well, Sir! have you effectually made your peace with my
mamma?


Count. I have done my endeavor, Madam -- Would I were at peace with myself!


Lucy. And are you still, Sir, under the dominion of prejudice so weak? Do you
still repent of what you so long have deemed your condescension?


Count. Far otherwise, Madam. There are beings so peculiarly favored of
heaven, and endowed with such high perfections, both of body and of mind, that
they are superior to all the distinctions of men, among whom they walk angels
upon earth! You are one of these! And my misery is, I never can deserve you!


Lucy. You may have stumbled, but this selfcondemnation shows it was but to
rise with tenfold strength. Persevere, and we will be severed only by death.


Enter EDMUND. Edm. At length, my dear Count, Lady Peckham is pacified. To
stoop to her ill-placed pride, to overlook her prejudice, and to petition as
you did, was noble in you. I have seconded your efforts, have pledged myself
for your honor, and guaranteed your veracity.


Count. Then, Sir, you have struck a dagger to my heart! I have been guilty of
falsehood! That very pride, and that exalted, or I fear extravagant, sense of
honor, which should have preserved me from a stain so hateful, have dashed me
down the precipice!


Edm. You amaze me!


Count. It Is true, 'twas inadvertent; but rankling vanity, strengthened by a
purer motive, the trembling alarms of love, induced me to persist; nay, a
second time to aid deception.


Lucy. You did wrong -- But which of us can say they never erred?


Edm. Ay! Who will stand forth and affirm, that, amid the rude whirl, the
confused doubts, or the terrors of passion, they never once have been betrayed
into your crime? For a crime I own it is; and with consequences so wide, so
pernicious, and so fatal, that, when it shall be extirpated from the earth,
that moment man will be perfect! But, in this poor world's present state, it is
so far venial, that (painful, humiliating thought!) no -- the noblest, the
purest of us all, cannot strike his heart, and say -- I never was a liar!


Lucy. Frail as we are, and hourly as the arts of falsehood are practiced upon
us, to our detriment, and often to our ruin, those only are most free from
guilt, who shake contagion soonest from them; and, by the next sublime effort
of truth, scorning to shrink from shame, which is their due, in some sort turn
the vice itself to virtue.


Edm. But what have you said that --


Enter SIR PAUL. Sir Paul. Come, come! We must strike while the iron is hot! We
must take my Lady while she is in the humor, since she must necessarily be a
party in our deeds. And first I have agreed, as you know, Count, that my
daughter's portion shall be 80,000l. The remainder will chiefly rest with you.
What settlement do you intend to make? And on what estates?


Count. None, Sir.


Sir Paul. None!


Count. I have no estates.


Sir Paul. Sir! -- Why, what! -- Zounds! -- After the enquiries I made, I
cannot be so deceived! Are not you Count Connolly Villars?


Count. I am, Sir.


Sir Paul. A colonel in the armies of the Most Christian King?


Count. I am, Sir.


Sir Paul. Recommended to me by Messieurs Devigny, the great merchants at
Marseilles?


Count. The same, Sir.


Sir Paul. Why, then, what do you mean?


Count. When I first paid my addresses to this lady, I imagined my rank and
family were a sufficient counterpoise to wealth.


Sir Paul. Ha! Gold in one scale, honor in the other? -- Flimsy ware! -- No, no
-- Kick the beam --


Count. But, ardent, violent, and eternal, as my love for your angelic daughter
is, and must be, even the loss of her shall not tempt me, any longer, to
practice the least imposition.


Sir Paul. Well, but, 's blood! The steward! The family estates!


Count. I have told you the truth, Sir.


Enter LYDIA. Lucy. What Is the matter, Lydia?


Lydia. Poor Mr. Mac Dermot --!


Count. What of him? -- Any harm?


Lydia. He has been in some fray, and is so bruised!


Count. Bruised! Where is he?


Lydia. Below, with a packet, which he wants to deliver to Sir Paul.


Sir Paul. To me?


Lydia. Yes, Sir. Pray go to him.


Sir Paul. A packet for me! [Going] I shall never hear the last of this from my
Lady!

[Exit Sir Paul.
Lucy. Brother, go to my mamma, and endeavor to keep her in temper. [To the
Count] Be not dejected! I know my father's affection for me, and do not yet
despair. [Exit after Sir Paul.


Count. Charming, generous girl! -- This poor Mac Dermot!


Lydia. He is afraid of seeing you. He says you will never pardon him, for
having taken the part of some man, whom you threatened to murder!


Count. I? I threatened to murder no man! -- Will you, Madam, be so kind as to
tell him I am here; and that I insist on seeing him?


Lydia. With pleasure. [Exit.


Count. Kingdoms should not tempt me to pass another day like this!


Enter MAC DERMOT, with his left Arm in a Sling. Count. How now, Mac Dermot!
Where have you been? What Is the matter with you?


Mac D. No great matter, my Lord -- Only a little bit of a joint here.
[Pointing to his arm.]


Count. [Alarmed] Broken?


Mac D. A double tooth or two -- Not much, my Lord.


Count. Much! -- How? -- What have you been doing?


Mac D. [Pitifully] I hope your Lordship will not be angry! [Enraged] But the
rascals sazed him neck and heels!


Count. Seized who?


Mac D. [Passionately] He was as innocent as the babe unborn, my Lord, and he
told 'em so: [Rage] the dirty rapscallions!


Count. Who are you talking of?


Mac D. [Pitifully] To be sure, he -- he sent your Lordship a -- a viry
impartinent letter.


Count. How? [The Count's perplexities and passions are here effectually
roused, and increase through the scene.]


Mac D. There were three of them. Niver did your Lordship set your two
good-looking eyes on such a pair of thieves!


Count. For heaven's sake, tell your story straight forward! What letter do you
mean? Who?


Mac D. [With great emotion] I hope your Lordship will forget and forgive! It
would have moved the bowels of your compassion, to have seen the old gintleman!


Count. Is it possible? What can he mean? What old gentleman?


Mac D. [Enraged] The dirty shaberoons took him by the throat -- My viry blood
boiled! -- Upon my soul, my Lord, I could not bear it! I hope you will forgive
me! By the merciful father, I could not bear it!


Count. Tell me, this moment, who you mean!


Mac D. He came running back, out of breath, and asked for your Lordship. And
so, my Lord, [Pleading] being a fillow-crater in distriss --


Count. Came where?


Mac D. A couple of as ill-looking Tyburnturnpike bum-bailiffs as your Lordship
could wish! With a cowardly complotter at their back! It was he that came
behind me with his shillalee, while I was hard at work with them both But the
brave old gentleman stepped in; and, by the Virgin's nightcap, but he gave
him his dose!


Count. Once more, tell me instantly, what old gentleman?


Mac D. Considering his age, he is as active, and as brave a fillow, as ever
handled a fist.


Count. [Aside] He cannot surely mean my father! Mac Dermot, I entreat, I
command you to tell me of whom you are talking.


Mac. D. If your Lordship had but seen the noble old soul, I Am sure you would
have forgiven me.


Count. But what letter --?


Mac D. Oh! The divle burn the letter! Now, my Lord, don't mention it! Pray
don't remimber it, your Lordship! Pray don't! By my soul, now, my Lord, he is a
fine old fillow! Oh! How he laid about him!


Count. Was it the person who came this afternoon?


Mac D. My Lord --


Count. Fear nothing! Speak.


Mac D. Why, then, my Lord -- To be sure -- it was he himsilf.


Count. And is he safe? Did you free him from them?


Mac D. Why, my Lord, I could not hilp it! [Emphatically] I could not hilp it!
By the holy footstool, but I couldn't!


Count. Mac Dermot! [Taking him by the hand.]


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. Well, well! A time will come --


Mac D. My Lord!


Count. Are you much hurt, Mac Dermot? -- Here! -- Hollo! -- [Enter a Footman]
Call a chair! Run for a surgeon and a physician! The best that can be procured.


Mac D. For me, my Lord?


Count For you, my noble fellow!


Mac D. Spare yourself the labor, young man.


Count. Go! Do as I order you; instantly. [Exit Footman.] Mac Dermot, you must
be put to bed!


Mac D. To bed, my Lord!


Count. And lose some blood!


Mac D. Faith, my Lord, that will be a little too much! I Have lost quite blood
enough already.


Count. Pray! I request! I must have you do as I desire! I would not have any
ill happen to you, for the world!


Mac D. Oh! And the divle of ill or harm can happen to Mac Dermot, the while he
has such an a ginerous prince royal of a master! Though I believe, the best
thing that could happen to me just now, would be a good supper, and a hearty
tiff of whisky punch.


Count. Not for the Indies!


Mac D. Faith, my Lord, it was hard work; and has given me a very craving kind
of a call.


[Re-enter Footman.] Foot. The chair is waiting, Sir.


Count. Go, my good fellow! Obey me but this once, and I Will never act the
master to you more.


Mac D. Well, well, my Lord. But I hope your Lordship will not quite kill me with
kindness. [Exit.


Enter SIR PAUL and LUCY. Sir Paul. [With the packet opened] So, Count, I find,
after all your pretended raptures, you never wished to marry my daughter!


Count. Sir!


Sir Paul. Why did not you retract like a man; and not make a paltry, false
excuse of poverty?


Count. Sir, I made no false excuse!


Sir Paul. How, Sir! Shall I not believe my eyes? Have I not bills here in my
hand, drawn in your favor, for five hundred thousand crowns?


Count. In mine!


Sir Paul. In yours! Given me this moment by your own servant.


Count. Impossible, Sir!


Sir Paul. Impossible, is it? Why, look you, here are the bills: and, hollo!
[Enter Footman] Go you, Sir, and desire Mr. Mac Dermot to come back.


Count. Stir not for your life, on such an errand! He must not, shall not be
disturbed.


Sir Paul. Nay, my word, it seems, is not to be believed; nor perhaps the bills
themselves! But, Sir, though you vaunt so highly of being a man of honor, the
trick was beneath a man of honesty.


Enter LADY PECKHAM and EDMUND. Lady P. Here Is a komakul kind of an
obstroperous person, that says he must speak to the Count -- You may come in,
Mister.


Enter Mr. DORIMONT and LYDIA. Sir Paul. Ah! What, my friend the steward! I am
glad you are come! Never was so amazed in my life! Your master, here, has been
telling me he has no estates!


Lady P. How!


Mr. Dor. My master, Sir!


Count. The feelings of man cannot support this open shame! [Crossing to go.]


Mr. Dor. Whither now, Sir?


Sir Paul. Ay! Talk to him! I Am in a mist!


Count. Suffer me to pass, Sir. [Crosses to the door] Speak the truth -- Render
me contemptible! Abhorrent! But make me not a witness of my own disgrace!


Mr. Dor. Stay, Sir!


Count. I cannot.


Mr. Dor. Stay! Or dread a father's malediction!


Sir Paul. His Father! The plague! Hem! -- Lydia!


Lydia. Hush!


Lady P. Father, indeed! Vhat he! So, so! Here Is a wirago! Here Is a chouse!


Sir Paul. My Lady --


Lady P. I thought vhat vould be the upshot on it!


Edm. Madam. [Takes her aside for a moment in dumb show.]


Mr. Dor. Spurred on by suppositions and conceits the most absurd, wholly
intent upon yourself, contemning others, exacting respect you did not merit,
refusing ceremony where 'twas due, protuberant with pride, yet poorly ^arping
at and holding idiot warfare with the pride of others, forgetful of the dignity
of reason, but with tenacious grasp clinging to the ludicrous dignity of birth,
the heir indeed and first born of Folly, ignorance itself has mocked and
taunted at you!


Lady P. Weary troo! Give him his own!


Sir Paul. Zounds! My Lady! -- I wish he would give you your own a little! Not
but it is right enough!


Lady P. To be sure! I knows weary vell I am right


Mr. Dor. Your father too has been avoided, nay disowned! Your father! Who for
years has lived in indigence, that he might secretly supply your wants, support
you in splendor, and preserve you from all the misery of which he made himself
the willing victim!


Count. Sir! You! Was it you? Oh! Ingratitude!


Mr. Dor. Your father was offensive to your sight! And what was it you
despised? Why this poor garb! You wished no kindred with virtuous poverty! Had
I appeared in all my former state, though knave or fool had been blazoned on my
brow, yet, decked in the trappings of magnificence, I had received an open
welcome. But, blessed be my penury! Since it has been your punishment.


Count. Sir, wrung as my heart is by remorse, and guilty as I know myself, for
I have still increase of guilt, no words can mitigate my crimes. Yet, though I
have erred, I feel I have something in me capable of good; and strong
propensities to all the tender ties, the filial duties, and the severer virtues
which I have seemed to want; a mind which, once convinced, has strength to shun
and to subdue its master passion, renounce its folly, and abhor its turpitude.
Deep is my offense against you and nature! But let nature plead in my behalf.
Here at your feet, repentant for my faults, I claim that pity which a father so
good, and so affectionate, will not sure refuse.


Mr. Dor. Oh! No -- For now you speak like the son of my heart, the image of my
brightest hopes! You have stood the fiery trial, and are pure!


Lady P. Vhy but hark you me, Mister -- Vhy vhat! You are not a Count too, to
be sure!


Mr. Dor. No, Madam.


Lady P. Vhy then --


Mr. Dor. If a title can flatter your Ladyship, mine is something higher.


Lady P. How!


Mr. Dor. I am a Marquis.


Lady P. A Marquis! You! Vell! [Aside] For an outlandish Marquis!


Edm. My Lady --!


Sir Paul. Well but the bills? [Holding them out in his hand.]


Mr. Dor. They are mine.


Count. Yours, Sir!


Mr. Dor. Remittances for some recovered arrears. -- But where is my brave
protector? My hero!


Count. Safe, Sir! Every care is taken of the generous fellow. -- Is the
physician come?


Sir Paul. Yes, yes. I have taken care of that. I have sent him my own
physician. Hem! -- [Aside] My cook!


Count. You know not half his worth!


Mr. Dor. Which shall not go unrewarded.


Count. No, by heaven!


Mr. Dor. We have now the means; we no longer are oppressed and poor.


Count. Yet are you not in present danger?


Mr. Dor. No. Malice has spent its last effort. Our ambassador has just sent me
the final decision of the judges: my sentence is reversed, my whole estates are
restored, and the power of my persecutors is at an end.


Count. Oh! Fortune! Oh! My Father! -- And may I hope it? -- My Lucy! May I --?


Lucy. Yes! Hope every thing!


Count. Mine!


Lucy. Yours! Heart and soul!


Sir Paul. She is a brave wench!


Lady P. Hold a blow, if you please! Vhat! Am I nobody?


Count. Madam, to you a thousand excuses are due.


Lady P. To be sure they are!


Count. I am conscious of my past ridicule, and will no more contend with your
ladyship, for prejudices so false and weak.


Lady P. I knoo I vus right! I knoo you made yourself ridicolous! I told you so
often enough!


Sir Paul. Well said, my Lady! -- But hark you, Miss Lydia -- [Significantly]
And, Sir.


Mr. Dor. A moment's patience, Sir. -- Count! How shall I tell him? -- My son!
Look at this charming, this virtuous young lady.


Sir Paul. [Aside] Zounds! What now?


Count. I am conscious of having treated her with proud unkindness, at the very
moment too, when I perceived she was sincerely my friend.


Mr. Dor. Your friend! -- Look at her! Does not your heart throb? Feel you not
sensations more tender? -- Are you not all doubt, allhope, all fear, all
perturbation?


Count. Sir! -- What! -- Who?


Mr. Dor. Can you not imagine? -- Look at her, I say! -- Behold her agitation!


Count. Mercy!


Mr. Dor. Open your arms, your heart, to receive her --


Count. Sir! Madam! Who?


Mr. Dor. Your sister!


Count. My sister!


Lydia. My dearest, best of brothers! [Runing into his arms.]


Lucy. My friend! My Lydia!


Count. Oh! How culpable have I been!


Sir Paul. [Aside] 'Sblood! Here Is a pretty piece of business!


Lady P. Vhat's that you say, Sir? Miss Liddy the Count's sister!


Edm. It Is very true, Madam.


Lady P. Troo! Vell, I purtest I Am quite in a quandary!


Mr. Dor. [To Sir Paul.] And now, Sir --


Sir Paul. [Aside] Yes, it is my turn now! -- Yes, Sir!


Mr. Dor. While laboring to reclaim the follies of youth --


Sir Paul. Yes, Sir!


Mr. Dor. We ought not to forget the vices of age.


Sir Paul. Hem! We'll talk of them after supper, Sir. [Looking round at Lady
Peckham and the company.]


Mr. Dor. Well, Sir, on condition --


Sir Paul. Oh! Any condition you please, Sir!


Edm. [Leading Lydia.] My dear Father! --


Sir Paul. My kind son! [Aside] Sly rascal!


Lydia. [To Sir Paul.] We shall want a house, Sir.


Sir Paul. Hem! Ay, ay!


Lydia. Somewhere in Mary-le-bone.


Sir Paul. Very well!


Lydia. With a --


Sir Paul. Zounds! [Aside to Lydia] Hush! Don't mention the back door!


Lydia. Then we are all friends?


Sir Paul. To be sure -- But, you may as well not tell Scapegrace!


Lydia. Never fear.


Sir Paul. Not a word of the new liveries!


Lydia. Depend upon my honor.


Count. My sister and my friend! Can it be?


Edm. Would you not wish it thus?


Count. Oh! Most ardently!


Mr. Dor. Chequered are the scenes of life. Pleasure and pain, joy and grief,
austerity and laughter, intermingling, weave a motley web. Our prejudices are
our punishments: they cling about us, warp our actions, distort our manners,
render us the food of satire, the mockery of fools, and torture us, as wailing
urchins are tormented to make sport for boys. Error and folly impede the
progress of perfection. Truth alone can make men wise and happy. Myself the
sacrifice of falsehood and mistake, feebly have I striven to stem the torrent*
and here my task, and here I hope my troubles end.

EPILOGUE.
Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.
THE curtain dropped, of course the author sends
Me to salute our generous noble friends!
To me you listen, he politely says,
Whenever I prattle, with a wish to praise.
For kindness so unceasing may you be
As happy, every soul, as your applause makes me!
But to my text -- The theme tonight is Pride:
Much have we said -- and much more have implied.
Our boldest strokes are feeble, nor can show
The child of Pride with half his genuine glow;
Of Pride, which can such various forms assume;
Now rise an emperor, now sink a groom.
Mounted aloft, the wonder of his age,
With hackney coachmen furious war to wage;
Six swandown waistcoats swathe him into shape;
His legs all buckskin, and his coat all cape;
With manners, looks, and language such you would swear
His tutor had been Piccadilly's Bear;
When most contemptible most hoping praise,
And only envious of the groom he pays;
Four dappled greys in front, behind three men;
Down Pall Mall dashing, to da^ up again;
Then only in his height and pomp of pride,
When Girl or Gambler's seated by his side;
Driving by day, dicing by night, his passion;
Such is the modern man of high-flown fashion!
Such are the scions sprung from Runny-Mead!
The richest soil, that bears the rankest weed!
Potatoe like, the sprouts are worthless found;
And all that is good of them is under ground.
Of Pride one single sketch in crayons more.
Behold her torch! Hark! Thunder shakes the door!
The carriage stops; the footmen make a lane;
The feathers stoop, and enter Lady Jane:
Perfect in how do you do, drop, bob, and bow.
(Curtseys, my friends, are out of fashion now) -- [To the Galleries]
First to his Grace; next to the next of birth:
She none forgets -- save genius, wit, and worth;
Whom if she mark, it is with a modish stare,
To ask who knows them? or, How came they there?
Now at the bank, in antichamber kept,
Where Pharaoh's host twelve tedious hours had slept,
She seats herself, like palpitating lover,
Eager the last night's losses to recover.
No sense of virtue, dignity, or shame:
Her greatest pride her knowledge of the game.
That pride most piqued, most mortified, to see
A Nabob's wife stake larger sums than she!
And now three anxious hours have slipped away:
Three hundreds have been lost, in piddling play.
No luck for her! Aloud fresh cards she calls:
Her passions rising as her pocket falls.
She punts: again she loses; and again!
Oaths quiver on her lip! She names the ten.
Stung to the soul, a desperate set she makes;
Till even the winning banker deals and quakes.
Ghastly she pants, with horror in her eye,
To be the first the fatal card to spy.
The fatal card is turned, and ends the reign
Of Fashion, Folly, Pride, and Lady Jane!
Here too we end; obliged ourselves to own
Our pride is great -- when we can please the town.
