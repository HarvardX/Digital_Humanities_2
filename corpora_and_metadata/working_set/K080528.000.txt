SCENE, The Volscian Camp. PROLOGUE
Spoken by Mr. QUIN. I Come not here your Candor to implore
For Scenes, whose Author is, alas! no more;
He wants no Advocate his Cause to plead;
You will yourselves be Patrons of the Dead.
No Party his Benevolence confined
No Sect -- alike it flowed to all Mankind.
He loved his Friends (forgive this gushing Tear:
Alas! I feel I am no Actor here)
He loved his Friends with such a Warmth of Heart,
So clear of Interest, so devoid of Art,
Such generous Freedom, such unshaken Zeal,
No Words can speak it, but our Tears may tell. --
O candid Truth, O Faith without a Stain,
O Manners gently firm, and nobly plain,
O sympathizing Love of others Bliss,
Where will you find another Breast like His? --
Such was the Man -- the Poet well you know:
Often has he touched your Hearts with tender Woe:
Often in this crowded House with just Applause
You heard him teach fair Virtue's purest Laws;
For his chaste Muse employed her Heav'n-taught Lyre
None but the noblest Passions to inspire,
Not one immoral, one corrupted Thought,
One Line, which dying he could wish to blot.
Oh may Tonight your favorable Doom
Another Laurel add to grace his Tomb:
Whilst he, superior now to Praise or Blame,
Hears net the feeble Voice of Human Fame.
Yet if to those whom most on Earth he loved,
From whom his pious Care is now removed,
With whom his liberal Hand, and bounteous Heart
Shared all his little Fortune could impart,
If to those Friends your kind Regard shall give
What they no longer can from His receive,
That, that, even now, above yon starry Pole,
May touch with Pleasure his immortal Soul.
CORIOLANUS. A TRAGEDY.
ACT I. SCENE I.
The Volscian Camp. ATTIUS TULLUS, VOLUSIUS. VOLUSIUS. WHENCE is it, TULLUS,
that our Arms are stopped
Here on the Borders of the Roman State?
Why sleeps that Spirit, whose Heroic Ardour
Urg'dy ou to break the Truce, and poured our Host,
From all the united Cantons of the Volsci,
On their unguarded Frontier? Such Designs
Brook rot an Hour's Delay; their whole Success
Depends on instant vigorous Execution.

TULLUS. VOLUSIUS, I approve thy brave Impatience;
And will to thee, in Confidence of Friendship,
Disclose my secret Soul. Thou know GALESUS,
Whose Freedom CAIUS MARCIUS, once his Guest,
Of all the Spoil of sacked Corioli,
Alone demanded; and who thence to Rome,
From Gratitude and Friendship, followed MARCIUS;
Whence lately to our Antium he returned,
With Overtures of Peace proposed by Rome.

VOLUSIUS. I know him well; an antiquated Sage
Of that romantic School, Pythagoras
Established here on our Hesperian Shore;
Whose gentle Dictates only serve to tame
Enfeebled Mortals into Slaves.

TULLUS. GALESUS,
Doubtless, possesses many civil Virtues;
Is gentle, good; for Rectitude of Heart
And Innocence of Life by all revered.

VOLUSIUS. Pardon me, TULLUS, if my faithful Bluntness
Deems you too liberal in his Praise. In Peace,
Such may perhaps do well, when Prating rules
An idle World; but in tempestuous Times
They are stark naught, these visionary Statesmen,
Fit Rulers only for their golden Age.
The rugged Genius of rapacious Rome
For other Men, and other Counsels, calls.

TULLUS. Your Thoughts are mine -- I only meant to tell thee
The Part he bears in this ill-timed Delay.
Soon as our gathered Army marched from Antium,
The Roman Senate, whose attentive Caution
Watched all our Motions, took at once the Alarm
And sent a Herald, ere we past their Borders,
With formal Ceremony, to demand
The Cause of our Approach. -- Had I been Master,
I would have answered at the Gates of Rome.
But this GALESUS, who attends our Camp
Among the Volscian Deputies, so pleaded
The Laws of Nations, made such loud Complaints
Against the Infraction of the Public Faith,
So teased us with the Pedantry of States,
That I was forced, unwilling, to permit
His Freedman, TITUS, to be sent to Rome
With our Demands. If these the Senate grants,
We then are in the Toils of Peace entangled,
In spite of all my Efforts to avoid them.

VOLUSIUS. O it is a wild Chimera! Peace with Rome!
Dream not of that, unless die Volscian Courage
Be quite subdued, and only seeks to gild
A vile Submission with that specious Name.
Learn Wisdom from your Neighbors. Peace with Rome
Has quelled the Latins, tamed their freeborn Spirit,
And by her Friendship honored them with Chains.

TULLUS. She never will grant it on the just Conditions
I now have brought the Volsci to demand:
The Restitution of our conquered Cities,
And fair Alliance upon equal Terms.
I know the Roman Insolence will scorn
To yield to this: and TITUS must return
Within three Days, the longest Term allowed him;
Of which the Third is near elapsed already.
Then even GALESUS will not dare to stop us,
With superstitious Forms, and solemn Trisles,
From letting loose th'unbridled Rage of War
Against those hated Tyrants of Hesperia.

VOLUSIUS. Thanks to the Gods! my Sword will then be free.
Then, poor Corioli! thy bleeding Wounds,
Thy Treasures sacked, thy captivated Matrons,
Shall amply be revenged by thy VOLUSIUS:
Then, TULLUS, from the losty Brows of MARCIUS
Thou may regain the wreaths his conquering hand,
By partial Fortune aided, tore from thine.

TULLUS. O my VOLUSIUS! thou, who art a Soldier,
A tried and brave one too, say, in thy Heart
Do thou not scorn me? thou, who saw me bend
Beneath the half-spent Thunder of a Foe,
Warm from the Conquest of Corioli,
Which, rushing furious in with those, whose Sally
He had repelled, he feiz'd almost alone;
And gave to Fire and Sword. Yet thence he flew,
Scorning the Plunder of our richest City,
His Wounds undrest, without a Moment's Respite,
To where our Armies on the fearful Edge
Of Battle stflood; and, asking of the Consul
To be opposed to me, with mighty Rage,
Resistless, bore us down.

VOLUSIUS. True Valor, TULLUS,
Lies in the Mind, the never-yielding Purpose,
Nor owns the blind Award of giddy Fortune.

TULLUS. My Soul, my Friend, my Soul is all on Fire!
Thirst of Revenge consumes me! the Revenge
Of generous Emulation, not of Hatred.
This happy Roman, this proud MARCIUS haunts me.
Each troubled Night when Slaves and Captives sleep,
Forgetful of their Chains, I, in my Dreams,
Anew am vanquished; and, beneath his Sword
With Horror sinking, feel a tenfold Death,
The Death of Honor. But I will redeem --
Yes, MARCIUS, I will yet redeem my Fame.
To face thee once again is the great Purpose
For which alone I live. -- Till then how slow,
How tedious lags the Time! while Shame corrodes me,
With many a bitter Thought; and injured Honor
Sick, and desponding, preys upon itself.

VOLUSIUS. It fast approaches now, the Hour of Vengeance,
To this famed Land, to ancient Latium due.
Unballanc'd Rome, at Variance with herself,
To Order lost, in deep and hot Commotion,
Stands on the dangerous Point of civil War;
Her haughty Nobles and seditious Commons
Reviling, fearing, hating one another:
While, on our part, all wears a prosperous Face:
Our Troops united, numerous, high in Spirit,
As if their Gen'ral's Soul informed them all.
O long-expected Day!

TULLUS. Go, brave VOLUSIUS,
Go breathe thy Ardour into every Breast,
That when the Volscian Envoy shall return,
Whom ere the Close of Evening I expect,
One Spirit may unite us in the Cause
Of generous Freedom, and our native Rights,
So long oppressed by Rome's encroaching Power,

SCENE II.
TULLUS alone. GALESUS said that MARCIUS stands for Consul.
O favor thou his suit, propitious Jove!
That I may brave him at his Army's Head,
In all the Majesty of sovereign Power!
That the whole Conduct of the War may rest
Oh us alone, and prove by its Decision,
Which of the two is worthiest to command --
SCENE III.
TULLUS, OFFICER. TULLUS. Ha! why this Haste? you look alarmed.

OFFICER. My Lord,
One of exalted Port, his Visage hid,
Has placed himself upon your sacred Hearth,
Beneath the dread Protection of your Lares;
And sits majestic there in solemn Silence.

TULLUS. Did you not ask him who, and what he was?

OFFICER. My Lord, I could not speak; I felt appalled,
As if the Presence of some God had struck me.

TULLUS. Come, Dastard! let me find this Man of Terrors.

SCENE IV.
The back Scene opens, and discovers CORIOLANUS as described above. CORIOLANUS,
TULLUS. TULLUS, after some Silence. Illustrious Stranger -- for thy high
Demeanor
Bespeaks thee such -- who art thou?

CORIOLANUS. [Rising and unmuffling his Face. View me, TULLUS --
[After some pause. Do thou not know me?

TULLUS. No. That noble Front
I never saw before. What is thy Name?

CORIOLANUS. Does not the secret Voice of hostile Instinct,
Does not thy swelling Heart declare me to thee?

TULLUS. Gods! can it be? --

CORIOLANUS Yes. I am CAIUS MARCIUS;
Known to thy smarting Country by the Name
Of CORIOLANUS. That alone is left me,
That empty Name, for all my Toils, my Service,
The Blood which I have shed for thankless Rome.
Behold me banished thence, a Victim yielded
By her weak Nobles to the maddening Rabble.
I seek Revenge. Thou may employ my Sword,
With keener Edge, with heavier Force against her,
Than ever it fell upon the Volscian Nation.
But if thou, TULLUS, do refuse me this,
The only Wish of my collected Heart,
Where every Passion in one burning Point
Concenters, give me Death: Death from thy Hand
I sure have well deserved -- Nor shall I blush
To take or Life or Death from ATTIUS TULLUS.

TULLUS. O CAIUS MARCIUS! in this one short Moment,
That we have friendly talked, my ravished Heart
Has undergone a great, a wondrous Change.
I ever held thee in my best Esteem;
But this Heroic Confidence has won me,
Stamped me at once thy Friend. I were indeed
A Wretch as mean as this thy Trust is noble,
Could I refuse thee thy Demand -- Yes, MARCIUS!
Thou have thy Wish! take half of my Command:
If that be not enough, then take the whole.
We have, my Friend, a gallant Force on Foot,
An Army, MARCIUS, fit to follow thee.
Go, lead them on, and take thy full Revenge.
All should unite to punish the Ungrateful.
Ingratitude is Treason to Mankind.

CORIOLANUS, embracing him. Thus, generous TULLUS, take a Soldier's Thanks,
Who is not practiced in the Gloss of Words --
Thou Friend indeed! Friend to my Cause, my Quarrel!
Friend to the darling Passion of my Soul!
All else I set at naught! -- Immortal Gods!
I am new-made, and wonder at myself!
A little while ago, and I was nothing;
A powerless Reptile, crawling on the Earth,
Cursed with a Soul that restless wished to wield
The Bolts of Jove! I dwelt in Erebus,
I wandered through the hopeless Glooms of Hell,
Stung with Revenge, tormented by the Furies!
Now, TULLUS, like a God, you draw me thence,
Throne me amidst the Skies, with Tempest charged,
And put the ready Thunder in my Hand!

TULLUS. What I have promised, MARCIUS, I will do.
Within an Hour at farthest we expect
The Freedman of GALESUS back from Rome,
Who carried to the Senate our Demands.
Their Answer will, I doubt not, end the Truce,
And instant draw our angry Swords against them.
Till then retire within my inmost Tent,
Unknown to all but me, that when our Chiefs
Meet in full Council to declare for War,
I may produce thee to their wondering Eyes,
As if descended from avenging Heaven
To humble lofty Rome, and teach her Justice.

CORIOLANUS. To thy Direction, TULLUS, I resign
My future Life: my Fate is in thy Hands;
And, if I judge aright, the Fate of Rome.

The End of the First ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE I.
GALESUS, TITUS. GALESUS. INDEED! my TITUS, I had Hopes that Rome,
Vexed as she is with her domestic Broils,
Her Frontier weak, her Armies unprepared,
Might have complied with our Demands, and given us
The same Alliance granted to the Latins.

TITUS. The Senate scarce would hear the Terms I offered;
But ordered me to bear this Answer back:
"If first the Volsci take up Arms, the Romans
"Will be the last to lay them down."

GALESUS. Alas!
This Answer seals the Doom of many a Wretch.
Unchain'd Bellona from her Temple rushes,
With all the Crimes and Vices in her Train.
Earth fades at her Approach. To rural Peace,
Fair Plenty, and the social Joy of Cities,
Soon will succeed Rage, Rapine, Devastation,
Each cruel Horror sanctified by Names.
O Mortals! Mortals! when will you, content
With Nature's Bounty, that in fuller Flow,
Still as your Labors open more its Sources,
Abundant gushes over the happy World;
When will you banish Violence, and Outrage,
To dwell with Beasts of Prey in Woods and Deserts?

TITUS. Never till Rome shall change her conquering Maxims.

GALESUS. Her haughty Spirit now will soar beyond
Its usual Pitch, upborne by CAIUS MARCIUS.
Stands he not for the Consulate?

TITUS. He did.
But is no more a Citizen of Rome.

GALESUS. What mean thou, TITUS?

TITUS. MARCIUS is from Rome
Banished for ever.

GALESUS. O immortal Powers!
On what Pretense could they to Exile doom
Their wisest Captain, and their bravest Soldier?
Nor less renowned for Piety, for Justice,
An uncorrupted Heart, and purest Manners.

TITUS. The Charge against him was entirely groundless,
What not his Enemies themselves believed,
Affecting of tyrannic Power in Rome.
His real Crime was only some hot Words,
Struck from his fiery Temper, in the Senate,
Against those factious Ministers of Discord,
The Tribunes of the People. They to Rage,
And frantic Fury, roused the mad Plebeians;
By whom supported in their bold Attempt,
They durst presume to summon to the Bar
Of an enraged and partial Populace,
The most illustrious Senator of Rome.
To this the Nobles yielded -- and, with his,
Gave up their own and Childrens Rights for ever.

GALESUS. O shameful Weakness in a Roman Senate,
So much renowned for Firmness! Yet, my TITUS,
Spite of my Love to MARCIUS, I must own it,
The vigorous Soil whence his Heroic Virtues
Luxuriant rise, if not with careful Hand
Severely weeded, teems with Imperfections.
His lofty Spirit brooks no Opposition.
His Rage, if once offended, knows no Bounds.
He deems Plebeians, with Patrician Blood
Compared, the Creatures of a lower Species,
Mere menial Hands by Nature meant to serve him.

TITUS. It was this high Patrician Pride undid him.
The furious People triumphed in his Ruin
As if they had expelled another Tarquin:
While, like a captive Train, the vanquished Nobles
Hung their dejected Heads in silent Shame.
MARCIUS alone seemed unconcerned; though deep
The latent Tempest boiled within his Breast,
Choked up and smothered with excessive Rage.

GALESUS. You were his Guest at Rome, and therefore, TITUS,
Might on this sad Occasion be permitted
To join your Tears with his domestic Friends.
Saw you that moving Scene?

TITUS. I did, GALESUS.
I followed MARCIUS home -- His Mother, there,
VETURIA, the most venerable Matron
These Eyes have ever beheld, and soft VOLUMNIA,
His lovely, virtuous Wife, amidst his Children,
Spread on the Ground, lay lost in dumb Despair.
He swelling stood a while, and could not speak,
Th'affronted Hero struggling with the Man;
Then thus at last he broke the gloomy Silence:
"'It Is done. The guilty Sentence is pronounced.
"Ungrateful Rome has cast me from her Bosom.
"Support this Blow with Fortitude and Courage,
"As it becomes two generous Roman Matrons.
"I recommend my Children to your Care.
"Farewell. I go, I quit, without Regret,
"A City grown an Enemy to Virtue."

GALESUS. Oh godlike MARCIUS! oh unconquered Strength
And Dignity of Mind! How much superior
Is such a Soul to all the Power of Fortune!

TITUS. This said, he sternly tried to break away:
When, holding in her Hand his eldest Son,
VETURIA followed; while the poor VOLUMNIA,
All drowned in Tears, and bearing in one Arm
Their youngest, yet an Infant, with the other
Hung clinging at his Knees -- he, turning to them,
Half softened, half severe, breathed from his Soul
These broken Accents -- "Cease your vain Complaints.
"Mother, you have no more a Son; and thou,
"Thou best of Women! thou, my dear VOLUMNIA!
"No more a Husband" -- Pierced with these dire Words,
VOLUMNIA lifeless sunk: and off he flung,
With wild Precipitation.

GALESUS. Thy sad Tale
Blinds my old Eyes with Tears -- But whither, tell me,
O whither, TITUS, bent he then his Course?

TITUS. Where the blind Genius of regardless Rage
And Desperation led. On to the Gate,
Capena called, attended by the Nobles,
He stalked in sullen Majesty along;
Nor deigned a Word. A godlike virtuous Anger
Beamed through his Features, and sublimed his Air.
With downcast Eyes he walked; or if aside
He chanced to look, each Look was great Reproach.
Thus in emphatic Silence, that made Words
Void and insipid all, he parted from them,
The Day preceding my Return from Rome;
Nor has been heard of since, lost in th'Abyss
Of his own Woes.

GALESUS. O MARCIUS, noble MARCIUS!
How shall my Friendship succor thy Distress?
Where shall I find thee, to partake thy Sorrows,
And make myself Companion of thy Exile?
But, TITUS, we indulge Discourse too long --
Go, and assemble thou the Volscian Chiefs,
Whilst I repair to TULLUS, to inform,
And bring him to the Council, there to hear
The fatal Answer thou have brought from Rome.

SCENE II.
Changes to TULLUS'S Tent. CORIOLANUS, TULLUS. CORIOLANUS. Forgive me, TULLUS,
if I count the Moments
That stop the Purpose of thy noble Kindness,
And keep me here confined in tame Inaction.
Why lingers TITUS?

TULLUS. Calm thy restless Heart,
Brave MARCIUS; every Minute I expect him.
Soon from the Cloud that hides thee, shall thou break
With double Brightness; soon thy firey Rage
Shall wither all the Strength and Pride of Rome.

CORIOLANUS. O righteous Jove, Protector of the Injured!
If from my earliest Youth, with pious Awe,
I still have reverenced thy all-powerful Justice,
Still by her sacred Dictates ruled my Actions,
O let that Justice now support my Cause,
And arm my strong Right Hand with all her Terrors!.
When that is done, be Life or Death my Lot,
As thy almighty Pleasure shall determine.
[Enter an Officer to TULLUS.
OFFICER. My Lord, GALESUS asks Admittance to you.

TULLUS. MARCIUS, retire an Instant, till I hear
The Business brings him hither -- Bid him enter.
[Exit Officer and CORIOLANUS. Enter GALESUS.
SCENE III.
TULLUS, GALESUS. GALESUS. TULLUS, the Roman Senate has returned
No other Answer, to our late Demands,
But absolute Denial and Defiance.

TULLUS. It is what I expected -- We shall teach them
An humbler Language soon -- Have thou assembled,
As I desired, the Volscian Chiefs in Council?

GALESUS. TITUS is gone to summon their Attendance.

TULLUS. It is enough -- Come forth, my noble Guest!
And show GALESUS how the Gods assist us.

SCENE IV.
CORIOLANUS, TULLUS, GALESUS. GALESUS. O My astonished Soul! what do I see?
What! CAIUS MARCIUS! CAIUS MARCIUS here,
Beneath one Tent with TULLUS?

TULLUS. Ay, and more,
With TULLUS, now his Friend and fellow Soldier.
Yes, thou shall see him thundering at the Head
Of Volscian Armies; he, who often has carried
Destruction through their Ranks -- Your Leave a Moment,
While to our Chiefs, and Fathers, I announce
Their unexpected Guest.

SCENE V.
CORIOLANUS, GALESUS. CORIOLANUS. Thou good old Man!
Close let me strain thee to my faithful Heart,
Which now is doubly thine, united more
By the Protection which thy Country gives me,
Than by our former Friendship.

GALESUS. Strange Event!
This is thy Work, almighty Providence!
Whose Power, beyond the Stretch of human Thought,
Revolves the Orbs of Empire; bids them sink
Deep in the deadning Night of thy Displeasure,
Or rise majestic over a wondering World.
The Gods by thee -- I see it, CORIOLANUS, --
Mean to exalt us, and depress the Romans.

CORIOLANUS. GALESUS, yes, the Gods have sent me hither;
Those righteous Gods; who; when vindictive Justice
Excites them to destroy a worthless People,
Make their own Crimes and Follies strike the Blow.

GALESUS. Cherish these Thoughts; that teach us what we are,
And tame the Pride of Man. There is a Power,
Unseen that rules th'illimitable World;
That guides its Motions, from the brightest Star,
To the least Dust of this sin-tainted Mold;
While Man, who madly deems himself the Lord
Of all, is naught but Weakness and Dependence.
This sacred Truths, by sure Experience taught,
Thou must have learnt, when, wandering all alone,
Each Bird, each Insect, flitting through the Sky,
Was more sufficient for itself, than thou --
Ah the full Image of thy Woes dissolves me!
The Pangs that must have torn, at parting from thee,
Thy Mother and thy Wife. I cannot think
Of that sad Scene without some Drops of Pity!

CORIOLANUS. Who was it forced me to that bitter Parting?
Who, in one cruel hasty Moment, chased me
From Wife, from Children, Friends; and Household Gods,
Me! who so often had protected theirs?
Who, from the sacred City of my Fathers
Drove me with Nature's Commoners to dwell,
To lodge beneath their wide unshelter'd Roof,
And at their Table feed? O blast me, Gods!
With every Woe! Debility of Mind,
Dishonor, just Contempt, and palsy'd Weakness,
If I forgive the Villains! yes GALESUS,
Yes, I will offer to the Powers of Vengeance
A great, a glorious Victim -- a whole City! --
Why, TULLUS, this Delay?

GALESUS. May CORIOLANUS
Be to the Volscian Nation, and himself;
The dread, the godlike Instrument of Justice!
But let not Rage and Vengeance mix their Rancour;
Let them not trouble with their fretful Storm,
Their angry Gleams, that Azure, where enthroned
The calm Divinity of Justice sits
And pities, while she punishes, Mankind.

CORIOLANUS. What said thou? What, against the Powers of Vengeance?
The Gods gave honest Anger, just Revenge,
To be the awful Guardians of the Rights
And native Dignity of Human kind.
O were it not for them, the saucy World
Would grow a noisome Nest of little Tyrants!
Each Carrion Crow, on Eagle Merit perched,
Would peck his Eyes out, and the mungril Cur
At pleasure bait the Lion -- No, GALESUS,
I would not rashly, nor on light Occasion,
Receive the deep Impression in my Breast;
But when the Base, the Brutal and Unjust,
Or worse than all, the Ungrateful, stamp it there,
O I will then with Luxury supreme,
Enjoy the Pleasure of offended Gods,
A righteous, just Revenge! -- Behold my Soul.
[Enter an Officer.
OFFICER. My Lords, th'assembled Chiefs desire your Presence.

GALESUS. Come, noble MARCIUS; let My joyful Hand
Conduct thee thither -- Doubt not thy Reception
Will be proportioned to thy Fame and Merit.

SCENE VI.
The back Scene opens, and discovers the Deputies of the Volscian States,
assembled in Council. They rise and salute CORIOLANUS; then resume their
Places. GALESUS, TULLUS, CORIOLANUS, SENATORS. GALESUS. Assembled States, and
Captains of the Volsci,
Behold the Chief so much renowned in War;
Our once so formidable Foe; but now
Our proffered Friend and Soldier -- CAIUS MARCIUS.

1st SENATOR. We give him hearty Welcome, from our Souls!

CORIOLANUS. Most noble Chiefs, and Fathers of the Volsci,
I need not say, how by the People's Rage;
And the poor Weakness of the timid Nobles,
I am expelled from Rome. Had I confined
My Wishes merely to a safe Retreat,
Some Latin City might have given me that;
Or any nameless Corner. What imports it,
Where a tame patient Exile rots in Silence?
But, Volscian Lords, permit me to declare,
I would at once cut short my useless Days,
Rather than be that despicable Wretch,
Who neither can take Vengeance on his Foes,
Nor serve his Friends. That is my Temper, Chiefs.
I shall be glad to merit, by my Sword,
Th'Asylum which I seek among the Volsci.
Rome is our common Foe: Then let us join
Our common Suffering, Passions, and Resentments.
Yes, though but one, I bring so many Wrongs,
So large a Share of powerful Enmity,
Into the War, as gives me the Presumption,
To offer to the Volscian States th'Alliance
Even of my single Arm. --

TULLUS. That single Arm
Is in itself a numerous Army, MARCIUS;
The Volscians so esteem it -- But proceed.

CORIOLANUS. I will not mention, Volscian Chiefs, what Talent
The World allows me to possess in War:
But be it what it will, you may employ it.
Soldier, or Captain, in whatever Station
You place me, I will lose each Drop of Blood,
Or with this Hand I Will fix the Volscian Standard
On the proud Towers of Capitolian Jove.

TULLUS. Chiefs of the Volscian League, I give you Joy
Of our new Citizen, the noble MARCIUS.
The Genius of the Volscian State has sent him,
Whetted by Wrongs into a keener Hatred
Than that we bear to Rome. It were contemning,
With impious self-sufficient Arrogance,
This Bounty of the Gods, not to accept,
With every Mark of Honor, of his Service.
I, Volscians, I, even ATTIUS TULLUS, give,
First of you all, my Voice, that CAIUS MARCIUS
Be now received to high Command among us;
That instantly we do appoint him General
Of half our Troops, which here, with your Consent,
I to him yield. -- Speak, Chiefs, is this your Pleasure?

1st SENATOR. It is, -- We give unanimous Consent.

TULLUS, embracing him. MARCIUS, I joy to call thee my Companion,
And Colleague in this War.

CORIOLANUS. By all the Gods!
Thou art the generous Victor of my Soul!
Yes, TULLUS, I am conquered by thy Virtue.

GALESUS. Though I have often, on great Occasions? TULLUS,
Beheld thee in the Senate, and the Field,
Covered with Glory; yet, I must avow,
I never saw thee show such genuine Greatness,
Such true Sublimity of Soul, as now.
To scorn the all-powerful Charm of selfish Passions,
Chiefly the dazzling Pride of Emulation,
That noble Weakness of Heroic Minds,
To sink thyself that thou may raise thy Country;
To put the Sword into thy Rival's Hand,
And twine thy promised Laurels round his Brow --
O it is a Flight beyond the highest Point
Of Martial Glory! and what few can reach.
Go forth, the chosen Ministers of Justice;
And may that awful Power, whose secret Hand
Sways all our Passions, turns our partial Views
All to its own dread Purposes, attend you!

CORIOLANUS. I burn to enter on the glorious Task
You now have marked me out. How slow the Time
To the warm Soul, that in the very Instant
It forms, would, execute, a great Design.
It Is my Advice we march direct to Rome;
We cannot be too quick. Let the first Dawn
See us in bright Array before her Walls.
Perhaps when they behold their Exile there,
Backed by your Force, some conscious Hearts among them
May feel the Alarm of Guilt.

TULLUS. I much approve
Of this Advice. It Is what I thought before,
Ere strengthened, MARCIUS, by thy mighty Arm:
But now it is doubly right. Here, Volscian Chiefs,
Here let our Council terminate -- The Troops
Have had Repose sufficient. Strait to Rome,
Come, let us urge our March -- As yet the Stars
Ride in their middle Watch: we shall with Ease,
Reach it by Dawn. --

CORIOLANUS. Yes, we have time -- too much!
Six tedious Hours till Morn -- But hence! away!
My Soul on Fire anticipates the Dawn.

End of the Second ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE I.
CORIOLANUS, TULLUS, VOLUSIUS, TITUS, with a Crowd of Volscian Officers.
Acclamations behind the Scenes. CORIOLANUS. NO more -- I merit not this lavish
Praise.
True, we have driven the Roman Legions back,
Defeated, and disgraced -- But what is this?
Nothing, ye Volsci, nothing yet is done.
We but begin the wondrous Leaf of Story,
That marks the Roman Doom. At length it dawns,
The destined Hour, that eases of their Fears
The Nations round, and sets Hesperia free.
Come on, my brave Companions of the War!
Come, let us finish at one mighty Stroke?
This Toil of laboring Fate -- We will, or perish!
While, noble TULLUS, you protect the Camp,
I, with my Troops, all Men of chosen Valor,
And well-approv'd today, will storm the City.

TITUS. Beneath thy animating Conduct, MARCIUS,
What can the Volscian Valor not perform.
Thy very Sight and Voice subdues the Romans.
When, lifting up your Helm, you showed your Face,
That like a Comet glar'd Destruction on them,
I saw their bravest Veterans fly before thee.
Their ancient Spirit has with thee forsook them,
And Ruin hangs over yon devoted Walls.
[Enter an Officer; who addresses himself to Coriolanus.
OFFICER. My Lord, a Herald is arrived from Rome,
To say, a Deputation from the Senate,
Attended by the Ministers of Heaven,
A venerable Train of Priests and Flamens,
Is on the Way, addressed to you.

CORIOLANUS. To me!
What can this Message mean! -- Stand to your Arms,
Ye Volscian Troops; and let these Romans pass
Betwixt the lowering Frown of double Files.
What! do they think me such a milky Boy,
To pay my Vengeance with a few soft Words.
Come, fellow Soldiers, TULLUS, come, and see.
If I betray the Honors you have done me.
[Goes out with a Train of Volscian Officers.
SCENE II.
TULLUS, VOLUSIUS, who remain. VOLUSIUS, after some Silence, Are we not,
TULLUS, failing in our Duty
Not to attend our General?

TULLUS. How! What said thou?

VOLUSIUS. Methought, my Lord, his parting Orders were,
We should attend the Triumph now preparing
Over all his Foes at once -- Romans and Volsci!
Come, we shall give Offense.

TULLUS. Of this no more.
I pray thee spare thy bitter Irony.

VOLUSIUS. Shall I then speak without Disguise?

TULLUS. Speak out:
With all the honest Bluntness of a Friend.
Think thou I fear the Truth?

VOLUSIUS. Then, TULLUS, know,
Thou art no more the General of the Volsci.
Thou have, by this thy generous Weakness, sunk
Thyself into a private Man of Antium.
Yes, thou have taken from thy laureled Brow
The well-earn'd Trophies of thy Toils and Perils,
Thy springing Hopes, the fairest ever budded,
And heaped them on a Man too proud before.

TULLUS. He bears it high.

VOLUSIUS. Death, and Perdition! high!
With uncontrolled Command! -- You see, already,
He will not be encumbered with the Fetters
Of our Advice. He speaks his Sovereign Will;
On every Hand he issues out his Orders,
As to his natural Slaves. -- For you, my Lord,
He has, I think, confined you to your Camp,
There in inglorious Indolence to languish;
While he, beneath your blasted Eye, shall reap
The Harvest of your Honor.

TULLUS. No, VOLUSIUS,
Whatever Honor shall by him be gained
Reverts to me, from whole superior Bounty
He drew the Means of all his glorious Deeds.
This mighty Chief, this Conqueror of Rome
Is but my Creature. --

VOLUSIUS. Wretched Self-Delusion;
He and the Volscians know he is thy Master.
He acts as such in all Things -- Now by Mars,
Could my abhorrent Soul endure the Thought
Of stooping to a Roman Chief, I here
Would leave thee in thy solitary Camp,
And go where Glory calls.

TULLUS. Indeed, VOLUSIUS,
I did expect more equal Treatment from him.
But what of that? -- The generous Pride of Virtue
Disdains to weigh too nicely, the Returns
Her Bounty meets with -- Like the liberal Gods,
From her own gracious Nature she bestows,
Nor stoops to ask Reward -- Yet must I own,
I thought he would not have so soon forgot
What he so lately was, and what I am.

VOLUSIUS. Gods! knew ye not his Character before?
Did you not know his Genius was to yours
Averse, as are Antipathies in Nature?
High, overweening, tyranously Proud,
And only fit to hold Command over Slaves?
Hence, as repugnant to that equal Life,
Which is the quickening Soul of all Republics,
The Roman People cast him forth; and we,
Shall we receive the Bane of their Repose,
Into our Breast? Are we less free than they?
Or shall we be more patient of a Tyrant?

TULLUS. All this I knew. But while his Imperfections
Are thy glad Theme, thou have forgot his Virtues.

VOLUSIUS. I leave that Subject to the smooth GALESUS,
And these his Volscian Flatterers -- His Virtues!
Trust me there is no Insolence that treads
So high as that which rears itself on Virtue.

TULLUS. Well, be it so -- I meant, that even his Vices
Should, on this great Occasion, serve the Volsci.

VOLUSIUS. Confusion! there it is! there lurks the Sting
Of our Dishonor! while this MARCIUS leads
The Roman Armies, ours are driven before him.
Behold, he changes Sides; when with him changes
The Fortune of the War. Strait they grow Volsci
And we victorious Romans -- Such, no doubt,
Such is his secret Boast -- Ay, this vile Brand,
Success itself will fix for ever on us;
And, TULLUS, thou, it is thou must answer for it.

TULLUS, aside. His Words are Daggers to my Heart; I feel
Their Truth, but am ashamed to own my Folly.

VOLUSIUS. O Shame! O Infamy! the Thought consumes me,
It scalds my Eyes with Tears, to see a Roman
Borne on our Shoulders to immortal Fame:
Just in the happy Moment that decided
The long Dispute of Ages, that for which
Our generous Ancestors had toiled and bled,
To see him then step in and steal our Glory!
O that we first had perished all! A People,
Who cannot find in their own proper Force
Their own Protection, are not worth the saving!

TULLUS It must have Way! I will no more suppress it --
Know, then, my rough old Friend, no less than thee
His Conduct hurts me, and upbraids my Folly.
I wake as from a Dream. What Demon moved me?
What doting Generosity? his Woes,
Was it his Woes! to see the brave reduced
To trust his mortal Foe? perhaps, a little
That worked within my Bosom -- But, VOLUSIUS,
That was not all -- I will to thee confess
The Weakness of my Heart -- Yes, it was Pride,
The dazzling Pride to see my Rival-Warriour
The great CORIOLANUS, bend his Soul,
His haughty Soul, to sue for my Protection.
Protection said I? were it that alone,
I had been base to have refused him that,
To have refused him aught a gallant Foe
Owes to a gallant Foe. -- But to exalt him
To the same Level, nay above myself;
To yield him the Command of half my Troops,
The choicest acting Half -- That, that was Madness!
Was weak, was mean, unworthy of a Man! --

VOLUSIUS. I scorn to flatter thee -- It was indeed.

TULLUS. Curse on the Slave, GALESUS! soothing, he
Seized the fond Moment of Infatuation,
And clinch'd the Chains my generous Folly forged,
How shall I from this Labyrinth escape?
Must it then be! what cruel Genius dooms me,
In War or Peace to creep beneath his Fortune?

VOLUSIUS. That Genius is thyself. If thou can bear
The very Thought of stooping to this Roman,
Thou from that Moment art his Vassal, TULLUS;
By that thou do acknowledge, Parent Nature
Has formed him thy Superior. But if fixed
Upon the Base of manly Resolution,
Thou say -- I will be free! I will command!
I and my Country! then -- O never doubt it --
We shall find Means to crush this vain Intruder;
Even I myself -- this Hand --
Nay, hear me, TULLUS,
It Is not yet come to that, that last Resource.
I do not say we should employ the Dagger,
While other, better Means are in our Power.

TULLUS. No, my VOLUSIUS, Fortune will not drive us,
Or I am much deceived, to that Extreme:
We shall not want the strongest fairest Plea,
To give a solemn Sanction to his Fate.
He will betray himself. Whatever his Rage
Of Passion talks, a Weakness for his Country
Sticks in his Soul, and he is still a Roman.
Soon shall we see him tempted to the Brink
Of this sure Precipice -- Then down, at once,
Without Remorse, we hurl him to Perdition! --
But hark! the Trumpet calls us to a Scene
I should detest, if not from Hope we thence
May gather Matter to mature our Purpose.

SCENE III.
The back Scene opens, and discovers CORIOLANUS sitting on his Tribunal,
attended by his Lictors, and a Crowd of Volscian Officers. Files of Troops
drawn up on either Hand. In the Depth of the Scene appear the Deputies from the
Roman Senate, M. MINUCIUS, POSTHUMUS COMINIUS, SP. LARTIUS, P. PINNARIUS, and
Q. SULPITIUS, all Consular Senators, who had been his most zealous Friends. And
behind them march the Priests, the Sacrificers, the Augurs, and the Guardians
of the sacred Things, dressed in their Ceremonial Habits. These advance slowly,
betwixt the Files of Soldiers, under Arms. As TULLUS enters, CORIOLANUS rising
salutes him. CORIOLANUS. Here, noble TULLUS, sit, and judge my Conduct;
Nor spare to check me if I act amiss.

TULLUS. MARCIUS, the Volscian Fate is in thy Hands.
[CORIOLANUS is seated again, and TULLUS places himself upon a Tribunal on his
Left Hand. Mean time the Roman Deputies advance up to CORIOLANUS and salute
him, which he returns.
CORIOLANUS. What, Romans, from the Generals of the Volsci
Is your Demand?

MINUCIUS. O CORIOLANUS, Rome,
Nurse of thy tender Years, thy Parent-City,
Her Senators, her People, Priests, and Augurs,
Her every Order and Degree, by us,
Thy ever-zealous, still-unshaken Friends,
Sue in the most pathetic Terms for Peace.
And if in This; constrained, We from our Maxim,
Never to ask but give it, must depart;
It is some Consolation, in the State
To which thou have by thy superior Valor
Reduced us, that we ask it from a Roman.

CORIOLANUS. I was a Roman once, and thought the Name
Was hot dishonored by me; but it pleased
Your Lords, the Mob of Rome, to take it from me;
Nor will I now receive it back again.

MILUCIUS. The Name thou may reject, but can not throw
The Duties from thee which that Name imports;
Indissoluble Duties, bound upon thee
By the strong Hand of Nature, and confirmed
By the dread Sanction of all-ruling Jove.
Then hear thy Country's supplicating Voice;
By all those Duties I conjure thee hear us.

CORIOLANUS. Well -- I will hear thee; speak, declare thy Message.

MILUCIUS. Give Peace, give healing Peace, to two brave Nations,
Fatigued with War, arid sick of cruel Deeds!
To carry on Destruction's easy Trade,
Afflict Mankind, and scourge the World with War,
Is what each wicked, each ambitious Man,
Who lets his furious Passions loose, may do:
But in the flattering Torrent of Success,
To check his Rage, and drop the avenging Sword,
When a repenting People ask it of him,
That is the genuine Bounty of a God.
Then urge no further this your just Resentment;
Which, injured as you are, you needs must feel,
But never ought to carry into Action,
Against your sacred Country; whence you drew
Your Life, your Virtues, every mortal Good,
That very Valor you employ against her.
Stop, CORIOLALUS, ere, beyond Retreat,
You plunge yourself in Crimes. To the fierce Joy
Of Vengeance pushed to barbarous Excess,
Repentance will succeed, and sickning Horror.
Consider too the slippery State of Fortune.
The Gods take Pleasure often, when haughty Mortals
On their own Pride erect a mighty Fabric,
By slightest means, to lay their towering Schemes
Low in the Dust, and teach them they are nothing.
Return, thou virtuous Roman! to the Bosom
Of thy imploring Country. Lo! her Arms,
She fondly spreads to take thee back again,
And by redoubled Love efface her Harshness.
Return, and crown thee with the noblest Wreathe,
Which Glory can bestow -- the Palm of Mercy!

CORIOLANUS. MARCUS MINUCIUS, and ye other Romans,
Respected Senators, and holy Flamens,
Attend, and take to your Demand this Answer:
Why court you me, the Servant of the Volsci?
It is to them that you must bend for Peace,
Which on these only Terms they will accord you.
"Restore the conquered Lands, your former Wars
"Have ravished from them: from their Towns an Cities,
"Won by your Arms, withdraw your Colonies;
"And to the full Immunities of Rome
"Frankly admit them, as you have the Latins."
Then, Romans, you have Peace, and not till then!
If these are Terms which suit not your Ambition,
They suit the State to which the Volscian Arms
Have now reduced you -- We have learned from Rome
To use our Fortune, and command the Vanquished.

TULLUS, (aside.) Death to my Hopes! I Am now his Slave for ever.
CORIOLANUS, addressing himself to the Volsci
This, my illustrious Patrons and Protectors,
Volsci, to you I owed. Permit me now
To do myself and injured Honor Justice.
[Turning again to the Romans. As to the Liberty you idly vaunt
To give me of returning to your City,
It Is what I hold unworthy of Acceptance.
Can I return into the ungrateful Bosom
Of a distracted State, where, to the Rage
Of a vile senseless Populace, the Laws
Are by your shameful Weakness given a Prey?
Who are the Men that hold the Sway among you?
And whom have you expelled, as even unworthy
To live within the Cincture of your Walls! --
O the wild Thought breaks in and troubles Reason! --
With what, ye Romans, can the sowerest Censor,
The most envenomed Malice, justly charge me?
Did I ever break your Laws? Nay, did I ever
Do aught that could disturb the sacred Order,
The Peace and social Harmony of Life;
Or taint your ancient Sanctity of Manners?
What was my Crime? I could not bear to see
Your Dignity debased: to see the Rabble,
Tread on the reverend gray Authority
Of Senatorial Wisdom: Yes, for you,
In your Defense I did enrage this Monster;
And yet you basely left me to its Fury.
Then talk no more of Services and Friendship:
A Friend, who can, and does not shield, betrays me.
Or if the Power was wanting, then your Senate
Is sunk into Servility, and Bondage,
Nor should a Freeman deign to sit among you.

MINUCIUS. The Wisest are sometimes compelled to yield
To popular Storms: Yet I defend not, MARCIUS,
Our timid Conduct; we have felt our Error,
And now invite thee back to aid the Senate,
With thy heroic Spirit to restrain
The giddy Rage of Faction, and to hold
The Reins of Government more firm hereafter.
As to the Appeal which thou have nobly made
In Vindication of thy spotless Fame,
With Pleasure we confirm it, and bear Witness
To all thy public and thy private Virtues:
But let us also beg thee not to stain
The Brightness of that Glory by a Crime,
Which, unrepented, would disgrace them all,
A dire rebellious War against thy Country.

CORIOLANUS. Absurd! What can you mean? To call a People,
Who with the last Indignity have used me,
To call my Foes my Country! No, MINUCIUS,
It is the generous Nation of the Volsci,
These brave, these virtuous Men, you see around me,
Who, when I wandered a poor helpless Exile,
Took Pity of my Injuries and Woes;
Forgot the former Mischiefs of my Sword;
Heaped on me Kindness, Honors, Dignities;
Feared not to trust me with this high Command,
And placed me here the Guardian of their Cause: --
Be Witness, Jove! -- It is alone their Nation
I henceforth will acknowledge for my Country!
Let this suffice -- You have my Answer, ROMANS.

COMINIUS. This Answer, CORIOLANUS, is the Dictate
More of thy Pride than Magnanimity:
It Is thy Revenge that gives it, not thy Virtue.
Art thou above the Gods? who joy to shower
Their doubled Goodness on repenting Mortals?
But think not I intend, by This, to urge
Our proffered Peace, so harshly treated, further.
That were a Weakness ill becoming Romans.
Yet I must tell thee, it would better fuit
A fierce despotic Chief of barbarous Slaves,
Than the calm Dignity of one who sits
In the grave Senate of a free Republic,
To talk so high, and as it were to thrust
Plebeians from the native Rights of Man. --

CORIOLANUS. Ha! do thou come the People's Advocate
To Me, COMINIUS! Come thou to insult me?

COMINIUS. Nay, hear me, MARCIUS: -- These gray Hairs empower me
To set thee right before this great Assembly:
And there was once a Time, thou would have heard
Thy General with more Deference and Patience. --
I tell thee then, whoever amidst the Sons
Of Reason, Valor, Liberty, and Virtue,
Displays distinguished Merit, is a Noble
Of Nature's own creating. Such have risen
Sprung from the Dust, or where had been our Honors?
And such in radiant Bands will rise again,
In yon immortal City, that, when most
Deprest by Fate, and near apparent Ruin,
Returns, as with an Energy divine,
On her astonished Foes, and shakes them from her --
Your Pardon, VOLSCI -- But This, CORIOLANUS,
Is what I had to say.

CORIOLANUS. And I have heard it --
[Rising from his Tribunal; and the Priests advancing to address him, he
prevents them. For you, ye awful Ministers of Heaven,
Let me not hear your holy Lips profaned
By urging what my Duty must refuse.
I bow in Adoration to the Gods;
I venerate their Servants. But there is,
There is a Power, their chief, their darling Care,
The Guardian of Mankind, which to betray
Were violating all -- And that is JUSTICE.
So far my public Character demands;
So far my Honor. -- Now, what should forbid
The Man, and Friend, to be indulged a little?
Permit me to embrace thee, good MINUCIUS;
Thee, LARTIUS; you, PINNARIUS and SULPICIUS:
But chiefly thee, COMINIUS, who first raised me
To Deeds of Arms; who from thy Consolar Brow
Took thy own Crown, and with it circled mine.
Tho naught can shake my Purpose, yet I wish
That Rome had sent me others on this Errand.
I thank you for your Friendship. The Protection,
Which you have given to those, whom once I called
By tender Names, I would not now remember.
How shall I -- say -- return your generous Goodness?
O there is nothing you, as Friends, can ask,
My grateful Heart will not with Pleasure grant you.

COMINIUS. We thank thee, CORIOLANUS -- But a Roman
Disdains that Favor you refuse his Country.

CORIOLANUS. To the Volscian Officers.
See that they be, with due Regard and Safety,
Conducted back.
[To the Roman Senators. I will suspend the Assault,
Till to these Terms, of which we will not bate
The smallest Part, your Senate may have Time
To send their latest Answer. Then we cut
All further Treaty off. Romans, farewell.

The End of the Third ACT.
ACT IV.
SCENE I.
TULUS alone. WHAT is the Mind of Man? A restless Scene
Of Vanity and Weakness; shifting still,
As shift the Lights of our uncertain Knowledge;
Or as the various Gale of Passion breathes.
None ever thought himself more deeply founded
On what is right, nor felt a nobler Ardor,
Than I, when I invested CAIUS MARCIUS
With this ill-judg'd Command. Now it appears
Distraction, Folly, monstrous Folly! Meanness!
And down I plunge, betrayed even by my Virtue,
From Gulf to Gulf, from Shame to deeper Shame.
SCENE II.
TULLUS. GALESUS. GALESUS. I listened, TULLUS, to the important Scene
That lately passed before us, with most strict
Unprejudiced Attention; and have since
Revolved it in my Mind, both as a Man,
Ally,d to all Mankind, and as a Volscian.
Indeed our Terms are high, and by the Manner
In which they were prescribed by CORIOLANUS,
Are what we cannot hope will ever be granted.
They should be softened. Let us yield a little,
Conscious ourselves to a great Nation's Pride,
The Pride of human Nature. Could the Romans
Stoop to such Peace, commanded by the Sword,
They then were Slaves, unworthy our Alliance.

TULLUS. Gods! do I hear in thee, one of the Chiefs
Entrusted with the Honor of the Volsci,
An Advocate for Rome?

GALESUS. I glory, TULLUS,
To own myself an Advocate for Peace.
Peace is the happy natural State of Man;
War his Corruption, his Disgrace --

TULLUS. His Safeguard!
His Pride! his Glory! -- What but War, just War,
Gave Greece her Heroes? Those who drew the Sword
(As we do now) against the Sons of Rapine;
To quell proud Tyrants, and to free Mankind.

GALESUS. Yes, TULLUS, when to just Defense the Warrior
Confines his Force, he is a worshipped Name,
Dear to Mankind, the First and Best of Mortals!
Yet still, if this can by soft Means be done,
And fair Accommodation, that is better.
Why should we purchase with the Blood of Thousands,
What may be gained by mutual just Concession?
Why give up Peace, the best of human Blessings,
For the vain cruel Pride of useless Conquest?

TULLUS. These soothing Dreams of philosophic Quiet
Are only fit for unfrequented Shades.
The Sage should quit the busy bustling World
Ill suited to his gentle Meditations,
And in some Desert find that Peace he loves.

GALESUS. Mistaken Man! Philosophy consists not
In airy Schemes, or idle Speculations:
The Rule and Conduct of all social Life
Is her great Province. Not in lonely Cells
Obscure she lurks, but holds her heavenly Light
To Senates and to Kings, to guide their Councils,
And teach them to reform and bless Mankind.
All Policy but here is is false, and rotten;
All Valor not conducted by her Precepts
Is a destroying Fury sent from Hell
To plague unhappy Man, and ruin Nations.

TULLUS. To stop the Waste of that destroying Fury,
Is the great Cause and Purpose of this War.
Art thou a Friend to Peace? -- subdue the Romans.
Who, who, but they, have turned this ancient Land,
Where, from Saturnian Times, harmonious Concord
Still loved to dwell, into a Scene of Blood,
Of endless Discord, and perpetual Rapine?
The Sword, the vengeful Sword, must drain away
This boiling Blood, that thus disturbs the Nations!
Talk not of Terms. It is a vain Attempt
To bind the Ambitious and Unjust by Treaties:
These they elude a thousand specious Ways;
Or if they cannot find a fair Pretext,
They blush not in the Face of Heaven to break them.

GALESUS. Why then affronted Heaven will combat for us.
Set Justice on our Side, and then my Voice
Shall be as loud for War as thine; my Sword
Shall strike as deep; at least my Blood shall flow
As freely, TULLUS, in my Country's Cause.
But as I then would die to serve the Volscians,
So now I dare to serve them by opposing,
Even with my single Voice, the impetuous Torrent
That hurries us away beyond the Bounds
Of temperate Wisdom; and presume to tell thee,
It is thy Passion, not thy Prudence dictates
This haughty Language.

TULLUS. Yes, it is my Passion,
A Passion for the Glory of my Country,
That scorns your narrow Views of timid Prudence.
Our injured Honor drew our Swords, and never
Shall they be sheathed while I command the Volscians,
Till Rome submits to Antium. --

GALESUS. Rome will perish
Ere she submit; and she has still her Walls,
The Strength of her Allies, her native Valor,
Which often has saved her in the worst Extremes,
And, stronger yet than all, Despair, to aid her.

TULLUS. All these will naught avail her, if our Fears
Come not to her Assistance -- But, GALESUS,
Why urge you this to me? Go, talk to MARCIUS.
The War has given him all his Pride could hope for,
To see Rome's Senate humbled at his Feet:
He now may wish to reign in Peace at Antium,
And thou, perhaps, art come an Envoy from him,
To learn if I shall prove a quiet Subject.

GALESUS. Through this unguarded Opening of thy Soul,
I see what stings thee -- Ah! beware of Envy!
If that pale Fury seize thee, thou art lost!
TULLUS, it is easier far, from the clear Breast,
To keep out treacherous Vice, than to expel it.
Farewell. Remember I have done my Duty.
[Goes out.
TULLUS, alone. This Man discerns my Heart -- Well: What of that?
Am I afraid its Movement should be seen?
I, whose clear Thoughts have never shunned the Light,
Must I now seek to hide them? O Misfortune!
To have reduced myself to such a State,
So much beneath the Greatness of my Soul,
That, like a Coward, I must learn to practice
The wretched Arts of vile Dissimulation!
By Heaven I will not do it -- I will not stoop
To veil my Discontent a Moment longer.
But see! my Rival comes, the happy MARCIUS.
His haughty Mien, his very Looks, affront me.

SCENE III.
CORIOLANUS, TULLUS. CORIOLANUS. TULLUS, I have received Intelligence,
That a strong Body of the Latin Troops
Is in full March to raise the Siege of Rome.
Another Day will bring them to its Aid.
But go thou forth, and lead the valiant Bands,
By thee commanded, to repel these Succors.
Go, and cut off from Rome its last Resource.

TULLUS. I lead my Troops, from the great Scene of Action,
From falling Rome, which, ere Tomorrow's Sun
Shall set, may be our Prey! Sure you forget
My Rank and Station -- I disdain the Service:
Give it to some you may command. For me,
I own no Master but the Volscian States.
Rome is my Object. I from Antium brought
The noblest Army ever shook her Walls.
And shall I now, on that decisive Day,
Doomed by the Gods to lay her Pride in Ashes,
Shall I be absent from the glorious Work?
It is the highest Outrage even to think it. --
Just Gods! Do thou presume to give thy Orders
To me? to me! thy Equal in Command?
Nay, thy Superior? Was it not my Hand,
My lavish Hand, bestowed thy Power upon thee?
And know, proud Roman, that the Man who gave it,
Can at his Will resume it.

CORIOLANUS. I proposed
This Expedition to thee as thy Friend,
Not as thy General, TULLUS. We are both
Commanders here; and for my Share of Power,
Whenever the Council of the Volscian States,
Who clothed me with it, shall again demand it,
I at their Feet will lay it down, persuaded,
The cankered Tongue of Envy's Self must own,
That by my Service I have well deserved it.

TULLUS Was it to Them, or Me, you hither came
To crave Protection? Was not then your Fortune,
Your Liberty, your Life, at my Disposal?
I raised you from the Dust, a wretched Exile,
An Outcast, helpless, friendless, driven to beg
The lowest Refuge which Despair can seek,
Shelter amidst thy Foes. My pitying Goodness
Protected, trusted, and believed you grateful.
O ill-plac'd Confidence! What for all this
Is thy Return? Pride; Self-sufficiency,
Councils apart from mine; despotic Orders;
The Glory of the War all pilfer'd from me:
And, to complete the Whole, a Latin Army
Now conjured up to draw me from the Siege;
Till by cajoling our tame Chiefs, and dazzling
The senseless Eyes of the low Mob of Soldiers,
Thou shall be solely seated in the Power
Which, thank my Folly! now is shared betwixt us.

CORIOLANUS. Immortal Gods! Hear I these Words from TULLUS!
I will be calm -- I will. -- Thou do accuse me
Of the worst Vice that can debase Mankind,
Of black Ingratitude. On what Foundations?
What have I done to merit such a Charge?
Is it my Fault, if in the Volscian Army
My Name is as revered and great as thine?
Can I forbid Authority, and Fame,
To follow Merit and Success? -- You knew
The Man whom you employed, and should have known,
He would not be a Cipher in Employment.

TULLUS. Think thou my Heart can better brook than thine
To be that Cipher! that dishonored Tool!
Subservient to the Ambition of another?
Gods! I had rather live a drudging Peasant,
Unknown to Glory, in some Alpine Village;
Than, at the Head of these victorious Legions,
Bear the high Name of Chief, without the Power.
No, MARCIUS, no. I will command indeed:
And thou shall learn, with all the Volscian Army,
To treat their General with Respect.

CORIOLANUS. Respect!
O TULLUS! TULLUS! by the Powers divine!
I bore thee once Respect, as high as Man
Can show to Man. From thee, my Foe, my Rival,
I nor disdained nor feared to ask Protection.
You gave me all I asked, you gave me more,
With noble Warmth of Heart! which, to Esteem,
Added the Ties to Gratitude, and Friendship.
Whatever since, in Council, or in Arms,
Has been by me achieved, was done for thee.
My Glory all was thine. The Plams I gained
Only composed a Garland for his Brow,
Who raised this banished Man to tread on Rome.

TULLUS. To tread on him who raised him -- That, I know,
Is thy ambitious Purpose; but be certain,
However Rome may bend beneath thy Fortune,
Thou shall not find an easy Conquest here.

CORIOLANUS. May Jove with Lightning strike me to the Center!
If from the Day I saw thy Face at Antium,
My Heart has ever formed one secret Thought
To hurt thy Honor, or depress thy Greatness:
I was thy Friend, thy Soldier, and thy Servant.
But now I will as openly avow,
Thy Jealousy has, with envenomed Breath,
Made such a sudden Ravage in our Friendship,
I know not what to think. --

TULLUS. Think me thy Foe.
There is no lasting Friendship with the Proud.

CORIOLANUS. Nor with the Jealous -- But of this enough.
Come, let us turn our Fire a nobler Way:
We have a worthier Quarrel to pursue. --
It were unjust, dishonorable, base,
Our Pride should hurt the Volscian Cause.

TULLUS. No, MARCIUS.
I mean to guard it better for the future:
The Volscian Cause is safest with a Volscian.
I therefore claim, insist upon my Right;
That you shall yield me my Command in Turn.
The first Attack was yours: It Is scanty Justice,
The second should be mine.

CORIOLANUS. TULLUS, it is yours.
O it imports not which of us command!
Give me the lowest Rank among your Troops:
All Italy will know, the Voice of Fame
Will tell all future Times, that I was present;
That CORIOLANUS in the Volscian Army
Assisted, when Imperial Rome was sacked;
That City which, while he maintained her Cause,
Invincible herself, made Antium tremble.

TULLUS. What arrogant Presumption!

SCENE. IV.
To them VOLUSIUS, entering hastily. TULLUS. Ha! VOLUSIUS,
Thy Looks declare some Message of Importance.

VOLUSIUS. TULLUS, they do -- I was to find thee, MARCIUS.
To thee a second Deputation comes,
Thy Mother, and thy Wife, with a long Train
Of all the noblest Ladies Rome can boast,
In mourning Habits clad, approach our Camp,
Preceded by a Herald, to demand
Another Audience of Thee.

CORIOLANUS. How, VOLUSIUS!
Said you, the Roman Ladies! Low, indeed,
Must be the State of Rome, when thus her Matrons
She sends amidst the Tumults of a Camp,
To beg Protection for the Men, who lie
Trembling behind their Ramparts -- Come! once more!
And see me put an End to Prayers and Treaty!

SCENE V.
TULLUS. VOLUSIUS. VOLUSIUS. TULLUS, it is well. This answers to my Wishes.

TULLUS. How? What is well? That humbled Rome once more
Shall deck him with the Trophies of our Arms?

VOLUSIUS. And hop'st thou nothing from this blessed Event?
They who have often blasted mighty Heroes,
Who often have stolen into the firmest Hearts,
And melted them to Folly; They, my Friend,
Will do what Wisdom never could effect.

TULLUS. Think thou the Prayers and Tears of wailing Women
Can shake the Man, who with such cold Disdain
Stood firm against those venerable Consuls,
And spurned the Genius of his kneeling Country?

VOLUSIUS. It was his Pride alone that made him ours.
That Passion kept him firm; the flattering Charm
Of humbling those, who in their Persons bore
The whole collected Majesty of Rome.
These Women are no proper Objects for it:
He cannot triumph over his Wife and Mother.
On this my Hopes are founded, that these Women
May by their gentler Influence subdue him.

TULLUS. Whatever the Event, he shall no longer here,
As wave his Passions, dictate Peace, or War.
Whether his stubborn Soul maintains its Firmness,
Or yields to Female Prayers, the Volscian Honor
Will be alike betrayed. If Rome prevails,
He stops our conquering Arms from her Destruction;
If he rejects her Suit, he reigns our Tyrant.
But, by the Immortal Gods! his short-lived Empire
Shall never see you radiant Sun descend.

VOLUSIUS. Blessed be those Gods that have at last inspired thee
With Resolution equal to thy Cause,
The Cause of Liberty! --

TULLUS. Be sure, VOLUSIUS,
If that should happen which thy Hopes portend;
Should he, by Nature tamed, disarmed by Love,
Respite the Roman Doom -- He seals his own:
By Heaven! he dies.

VOLUSIUS. Let me embrace thee, TULLUS!
Now breaking from the Cloud, which, like the Sun,
Thy own too bounteous Beams had drawn around thee.

TULLUS. You was deceived, my Friend. When I with Tameness,
With Tameness which astonished thy brave Spirit,
Seemed to submit to that unequal Sway
He arrogated over me; know, my Heart
Never swelled so high as in that cruel Moment.
My Indignation, like the imprisoned Fire
Pent in the troubled Breast of glowing Aetna,
Burnt deep and silent: But, collected now,
It shall beneath its Fury bury MARCIUS!
It Is fixed. Our Tyrant dies.

VOLUSIUS. TULLUS, my Sword
Here claims to be employed. -- Nor mine alone --
There are some worthy Volsci still remaining,
Who think with us, and pine beneath the Laurels
A Roman Chief bestows.

TULLUS. Go, find them strait,
And bring them to the Space before his Tent;
It Is there he will receive this Deputation.
Then if he sinks beneath these Women's Prayers --
Or if he does not -- But, VOLUSIUS, wait,
I give thee strictest Charge to wait my Signal.
Perhaps I may find Means to free the Volsci
Without his Blood. If not -- We will be free.

The End of the Fourth ACT.
ACT. V.
SCENE I.
Trumpets sounding. The Scene discovers the Camp, a Crowd of Volscian Officers
with Files of Soldiers, drawn up as before. Enter CORIOLANUS, TULLUS, GALESUS,
VOLUSIUS. The Roman Ladies advance slowly from the Depth of the Stage, with
VETURIA the Mother of CORIOLANUS, and VOLUMNIA his Wife, at their Head, all
clad in Habits of Mourning. CORIOLANUS stands at the Head of the Volsci,
surrounded by his Lictors; but, when he perceives his Mother and Wife, after
some Struggle, he advances, and goes hastily to embrace them. CORIOLANUS
advancing. LOWER your Fasces, Lictors --
Oh VETURIA!
Thou best of Parents!

VETURIA. CORIOLANUS, stop.
Whom am I to embrace? A Son, or Foe?
Say, in what Light am I regarded here?
Thy Mother, or thy Captive?

CORIOLANUS. Justly, Madam,
You check my Fondness, that, by Nature hurried,
Forgot I was the General of the Volsci,
And you a Deputy from hostile Rome.

He goes back to his former Station. I hear you with Respect. Speak your
Commission.
VETURIA. Think not I come a Deputy from Rome.
Rome, once rejected, scorns a Second Suit.
You have already heard whatever the Tongue
Of Eloquence can plead, whatever the Wisdom
Of sacred Age, the Dignity of Senates,
And Virtue, can enforce. Behold me here,
Sent by the Shades of your immortal Fathers,
Sent by the Genius of the Marcian Line,
Commissioned by my own maternal Heart,
To try the soft, yet stronger Powers of Nature.
Thus authorized, I ask, nay, claim a Peace,
On equal, fair, and honorable Terms,
To Thee, to Rome, and to the Volscian People.
Grant it, my Son! Thy Mother begs it of thee,
Thy Wife, the best, the kindest of her Sex,
And these illustrious Matrons, who have soothed
The gloomy Hours thou have been absent from us.
We, by whatever is great and good in Nature,
By every Duty, by the Gods, conjure Thee!
To grant us Peace, and turn on other Foes
Thy Arms, where thou may purchase virtuous Glory.

COIRIOLANUS. I should, VETURIA, break those holy Bonds
That hold the wide Republic of Mankind,
Society, together; I should grow
A Wretch, unworthy to be called thy Son;
I should, with my VOLUMNIA's fair Esteem,
Forfeit her Love; these Matrons would despise me --
Could I betray the Volscian Cause, thus trusted,
Thus recommended to me -- No, my Mother,
You cannot sure, you cannot ask it of me!

VETURIA. And does my Son so little know me? me!
Who took such Care to form his tender Years,
Left to my Conduct by his dying Father?
Have I so ill deserved that Trust? Alas!
Am I so low in thy Esteem, that thou
Should ever imagine I could urge a Part
Which in the least might stain the Marcian Honor?
No, let me perish rather! perish All!
Life has no Charms compared to spotless Glory!
I only ask, thou would forbid thy Troops
To waste our Lands, and to assault yon City,
Till Time be given for mild and righteous Measures.
Grant us but One Year's Truce: Mean while thou may,
With Honor and Advantage to both Nations,
Betwixt us mediate a perpetual Peace.

CORIOLANUS. Alas! my Mother! That were granting all.

VETURIA. Can thou refuse me such a just Petition,
The First Request thy Mother ever made Thee?
Can thou to her Entreaties, Prayers, and Tears,
Prefer a savage obstinate Revenge?
Have Love and Nature lost all Power within thee?

CORIOLANUS. No, -- in my Heart they reign as strong as ever.
Come, I conjure you, quit ungrateful Rome,
Come, and complete my Happiness at Antium,
You, and my dear VOLUMNIA -- There, VETURIA,
There shall you see with what Respect the Volsci
Will treat the Wife and Mother of their General.

VETURIA. Treat me thyself with more Respect, my Son;
Nor dare to shock my Ears with such Proposals.
Shall I desert my Country, I who come
To plead her Cause? Ah no! -- A Grave in Rome
Would better please me, than a Throne at Antium.
How have thou thus forsaken all my Precepts?
How have thou thus forgot thy Love to Rome?
O CORIOLANUS, when with hostile Arms,
With Fire and Sword, you entered on our Borders,
Did not the fostering Air, that breathes around us,
Allay thy guilty Fury, and instill
A certain native Sweetness through thy Soul?
Did not your Heart thus murmur to itself?
"These Walls contain whatever can command
"Respect from Virtue, or is dear to Nature,
"The Monuments of Piety and Valor,
"The sculptured Forms, the Trophies of my Fathers,
"My household Gods, my Mother, Wife and Children!"

CORIOLANUS. Ah! you seduce me with too tender Views! --
These Walls contain the most corrupt of Men,
A base seditious Herd; who trample Order,
Distinction, Justice, Laws, beneath their Feet,
Insolent Foes to Worth, the Foes of Virtue!

VETURIA. Thou have not thence a Right to lift thy Hand
Against the whole Community, which forms
Thy ever-sacred Country -- That consists
Not of coeval Citizens alone:
It knows no Bounds; it has a Retrospect
To Ages past; it looks on those to come;
And grasps of all the general Worth and Virtue.
Suppose, my Son, that I to thee had been
A harsh obdurate Parent, even unjust:
How would the monstrous Thought with Horror strike thee,
Of plunging, from Revenge, thy raging Steel
Into her Breast, who nursed thy infant Years! --

CORIOLANUS. Rome is no more! that Rome which nursed my Youth;
That Rome, conducted by Patrician Virtue,
She is no more! My Sword shall now chastise
These Sons of Pride and Dirt! Her upstart Tyrants!
Who have debased the noblest State on Earth
Into a sordid Democratic Faction.
Why will my Mother join her Cause to theirs?

VETURIA. Forbid it, Jove! that I should ever distinguish
My Interest from the general Cause of Rome;
Or live to see a foreign hostile Arm
Reform th'Abuses of our Land of Freedom. Pausing.
But it is in vain, I find, to reason more.
Is there no way to reach thy filial Heart,
Once famed as much for Piety as Courage?
Often have thou justly triumphed, CORIOLANUS;
Now yield one Triumph to thy widowed Mother;
And send me back amidst the loud Acclaims,
The grateful Transports of delivered Rome,
The happiest far, the most renowned of Women!

CORIOLANUS. Why, why, VETURIA, will thou plead in vain?
TULLUS. Aside to VOLUSIUS. See, see, VOLUSIUS, how the strong Emotions
Of powerful Nature shake his inmost Soul!
See how they tear him. -- If he long resists them,
He is a God, or something worse than Man.

VETURIA. O MARCIUS, MARCIUS! can thou treat me thus?
Can thou complain of Rome's Ingratitude,
Yet be to me so cruelly ungrateful?
To me! who anxious reared thy Youth to Glory?
Whose only Joy, these many Years, has been,
To boast that CORIOLANUS was my Son?
And do thou then renounce me for thy Mother?
Spurn me before these Chiefs, before those Soldiers,
That weep thy stubborn Cruelty? Art thou
The hardest Man to me in this Assembly?
Look at me! Speak!
[Pausing, during which he appears in great Agitation. Still do thou turn
away?
Inexorable? Silent? -- Then, behold me,
Behold thy Mother, at whose Feet thou often
Have kneeled with Fondness, kneeling now at thine,
Wetting thy stern Tribunal with her Tears.

CORIOLANUS. [Raises her. VETURIA, rise. I cannot see Thee thus.
It is a Sight uncomely, to behold
My Mother at my Feet, and that to urge
A Suit, relentless Honor must refuse.

VOLUMNIA. [Advancing. Since CORIOLANUS, thou do still retain,
In spite of all thy Mother now has pleaded,
Thy dreadful Purpose, Ah! how much in vain
Were it for me to join my Supplications!
The Voice of thy VOLUMNIA, once so pleasing
How shall it hope to touch the Husband's Heart,
When proof against the Tears of such a Parent?
I dare not urge what to thy Mother thou
So firmly have denied -- But I must weep --
Must weep, if not thy harsh Severity,
At least thy Situation. O permit me,
[Taking his Hand. To shed my gushing Tears upon thy Hand!
To press it with the cordial Lips of Love!
And take my last Farewell!

CORIOLANUS. Yet, yet, my Soul,
Be firm, and persevere --

VOLUMNIA. Ah CORIOLANUS!
Is then this Hand* this Hand to me devoted,
The Pledge of Nuptial Love, that has so long
Protected, blessed, and sheltered us with Kindness,
Now lifted up against us? Yet I love it,
And, with submissive Veneration, bow
Beneath the Affliction which it heaps upon us.
But O! what nobler Transports would it give thee!
What Joy beyond Expression! could thou once
Surmount the furious Storm of fierce Revenge,
And yield thee to the Charms of Love and Mercy.
Oh make the glorious Trial!

CORIOLANUS. Mother! Wife!
Are all the Powers of Nature leagued against me?
I cannot! -- will not! -- Leave me, my VOLUMNIA!

VOLUMNIA. Well, I obey -- How bitter thus to part!
Upon such Terms to part! perhaps for ever! --
But tell me, ere I hence unroot my Feet,
When to my lonely Home I shall return,
What from their Father, to our little Slaves,
Unconscious of the Shame to which you doom them,
What shall I say?
[Pausing; He highly agitated. Nay -- tell me, CORIOLANUS!

CORIOLANUS. Tell thee! What shall I tell thee? See these Tears!
These Tears will tell thee what exceeds the Power
Of Words to speak, whatever the Son, the Husband,
And Father, in one complicated Pang,
Can feel -- But leave me; -- even in Pity leave me!
Cease, cease, to torture me, my dear VOLUMNIA!
You only tear my Heart; but cannot shake it:
For by the immortal Gods, the dread Avengers
Of broken Faith! --

VOLUMNIA. [Kneeling. Oh swear not, CORIOLANUS!
Oh vow not our Destruction!

VETURIA. Daughter, rise.
Let us no more before the Volsian People
Expose ourselves a Spectacle of Shame.
It is in vain we try to melt a Breast,
That, to the best Affections Nature gives us,
Prefers the worst -- Hear me, proud Man! I have
A Heart as stout as thine. I came not hither,
To be sent back rejected, baffled, shamed,
Hateful to Rome, because I am Thy Mother:
A Roman Matron knows, in such Extremes,
What Part to take -- And thus I came provided.
[Drawing from under her Robe a Dagger. Go! barbarous Son! go! double Parricide!
Rush over my Corse to thy beloved Revenge!
Tread on the bleeding Breast of her, to whom
Thou ow'st thy Life! -- Lo, thy first Victim!

CORIOLANUS. Seizing her Hand.
Ha!
What do thou mean?

VETURIA. To die, while Rome is free,
To seize the Moment ere thou art her Tyrant.

CORIOLANUS. O use thy Power more justly! Set not thus
My treacherous Heart in Arms against my Reason.
Here! here! thy Dagger will be well employed;
Strike here! and reconcile my fighting Duties.

VETURIA. Off! -- Set me free! -- Think thou that Grasp, which binds
My feeble Hand, can fetter too my Will?
No, my proud Son! Thou can not make me live,
If Rome must fall! -- No Power on Earth can do it!

CORIOLANUS. Pity me, generous VOLSCI! -- You are Men --
Must it then be? -- Confusion! -- Do I yield?
What is it? Is it Weakness? Is it Virtue? --
Well! --

VETURIA. What? Speak!

CORIOLANUS. O, no! -- my stifled Words refuse
A Passage to the Throes that wring my Heart.

VETURIA. Nay, if thou yieldest, yield like CORIOLANUS;
And what thou do, do nobly!

CORIOLANUS. [Quitting her Hand. There! -- It Is done! --
Thine is the Triumph, Nature!
[To VETURIA in a low Tone of Voice.
Ah VETURIA! Rome by thy Aid is saved -- but thy Son lost.

VETURIA. He never can be lost, who saves his Country.

CORIOLANUS. [Turning to the Roman Ladies. Ye Matrons, Guardians of the Roman
Safety,
You to the Senate may report this Answer.
We grant the Truce you ask. But on these Terms:
That Rome, mean-time, shall to a Peace agree,
Fair, equal, just, and such as may secure
The Safety, Rights, and Honor of the VOLSCI.
[To the Troops. VOLSCI, We raise the Siege. Go, and prepare,
By the first Dawn, for your Return to Antium.
[As the Troops retire, and CORIOLANUS turns to the Roman Ladies;
TULLUS. To VOLUSIUS aside. It Is as we wished, VOLUSIUS -- To your Station.
But mark me well -- Till thou shall hear my Call,
I charge thee not to stir. One Offer more
My Honor bids me make to this proud Man,
Before we strike the Blow -- If he rejects it,
His Blood be on his Head.

VOLUSIUS. Well! I obey you.
[He goes out.
CORIOLANUS. Be it thy Care, Galesus, that a Safeguard
Attend these noble Matrons back to Rome.

SCENE II.
CORIOLANUS. TULLUS. CORIOLANUS. I plainly, TULLUS, by your Looks discern
You disapprove my Conduct.

TULLUS. CAIUS MARCIUS,
I mean not to assail thee with the Clamor
Of loud Reproaches, and the War of Words;
But, Pride apart, and all that can pervert
The Light of steady Reason, here to make
A candid fair Proposal

CORIOLANUS. Speak. I hear thee.

TULLUS. I heed not tell thee, that I have performed
My utmost Promise. Thou have been protected;
Have had thy amplest, most ambitious Wish:
Thy wounded Pride is healed, thy dear Revenge
Completely sated; and, to crown thy Fortune,
At the same time, thy Peace with Rome restored.
Thou art no more a Volscian, but a Roman.
Return, return; thy Duty calls upon thee,
Still to protect the City thou have saved:
It still may be in Danger from our Arms.

CORIOLANUS. Insolent Man! Is this thy fair Proposal?

TULLUS. Be patient -- Hear! By hospitable Jove!
I mean thee well -- Yes, one last Bounty more
I frankly will bestow. I have already
From Rome protected thee; now from the Volsci,
From their just Vengeance, I will still protect Thee.
Retire. I will take care thou may with Safety.

CORIOLANUS. With Safety! -- Heavens! -- And think thou

CORIOLANUS Will stoop to thee for Safety? No! my Safeguard
Is in myself, a Bosom void of Blame,
And the Great Gods, Protectors of the Just. --
O it is an Act of Cowardice and Baseness,
To seize the very Time my Hands are fettered,
By the strong Chain of former Obligations,
The safe sure Moment to insult me. -- Gods!
Were I now free, as on that Day I was,
When at Corioli I tamed thy Pride,
This had not been.

TULLUS. Thou speak the Truth: It had not.
O for that Time again! Propitious Gods,
If you will bless me, grant it! -- Know, for That,
For that dear Purpose, I have now proposed
Thou should return. I pray thee, Marcius, do it!
And we shall meet again on nobler Terms.

CORIOLANUS. When to the Volsci I have cleared my Faith,
Doubt not I shall find Means to meet thee nobly.
We then our generous Quarrel may decide
In the bright Front of some embattel'd Field,
And not in private Brawls, like fierce Barbarians.

TULLUS. Thou can not hope Acquittal from the Volsci. --

CORIOLANUS. I do: -- Nay more, expect their Approbation,
Their Thanks! I will obtain them such a Peace
As thou durst never ask; a perfect Union
Of their whole Nation with imperial Rome
In all her Privileges, all her Rights.
By the just Gods, I will! What would thou more?

TULLUS. What would I more! Proud Roman; This I would;
Fire the cursed Forest where these Roman Wolves
Haunt and infest their nobler Neighbors round them;
Extirpate from the Bosom of this Land,
A false perfidious People, who, beneath
The Mask of Freedom, are a Combination
Against the Liberty of Human-kind,
The genuine Seed of Outlaws and of Robbers.

CORIOLANUS. The Seed of Gods! -- It Is not for thee, vain Boaster!
It Is not for such as Thou, so often spared
By her victorious Sword, to talk of Rome,
But with Respect and awful Veneration.
Whatever her Blots, whatever her giddy Factions,
There is more Virtue in one single Year
Of Roman Story, than your Volscian Annals
Can boast through all your creeping dark Duration!

TULLUS. I thank thy Rage. This full displays the Traitor.

CORIOLANUS. Ha! Traitor!

TULLUS. First, to thy own Country, Traitor!
And Traitor, now, to mine!

CORIOLANUS. Ye heavenly Powers!
I shall break loose -- My Rage -- But let us part --
Lest my rash Hand should do a hasty Deed
My cooler Thought forbids.

TULLUS. For the last] time,
Hear me, and mark my Words; the sober Dictates
Of well-weigh'd Resolution. Thou and I
Are in that State for which resistless Nature
Has formed us, Foes again -- Begone -- Return --
To head the Roman Troops. I grant thee Quittance
Full and complete of all those Obligations
Thou have so often insultingly complained
Fettered thy Hands. They now are free. I court
The worst thy Sword can do; whilst thou from me
Have nothing to expect, but sore Destruction.
Quit then this hostile Camp. Once more I tell thee,
Thou art not here one single Hour in Safety.

CORIOLANUS. Think thou to fright me hence?

TULLUS. Thou will not then?
Thou will not take the Safety which I offer?

CORIOLANUS. Till I have cleared my Honor in your Council,
And proved before them all, to thy Confusion,
The Falsehood of thy Charge; as soon in Battle
I would before thee fly, and howl for Mercy,
As quit the Station they have here assigned me.

TULLUS. Volusius! Hoa!

SCENE III.
To them Volusius, and Conspirators, with their Swords drawn. TULLUS. Seize,
and secure the Traitor!

CORIOLANUS. [Laying his Hand upon his Sword. Who dares approach me, dies!

VOLUSIUS. Die thou!
[As Coriolanus draws his Sword, Volusius and the Conspirators rush upon and
stab him. Tullus standing by without having drawn his Sword.
CORIOLANUS. [Endeavouring to free himself. Off! -- Villains!
[Falling. Oh murdering Slaves! Assassinating Cowards!
[Dies.
SCENE IV.
[Upon the Noise of the Tumult, enter hastily to them Galesus, the other
Deputies of the Volscian States, Officers Friends of Coriolanus, and Titus with
a large Band of Soldiers. GALESUS. [As he enters. Are we a Nation ruled by
Laws, or Fury?
How! Whence this Tumult? --
[Pausing. Gods! what do I see?
The noble MARCIUS slain!

TULLUS. You see a Traitor
Punished as he deserved, the Roman Yoke
That thrall'd us broken, and the Volsci free!

GALESUS. Hear me, great Jove! Hear, all you injured Powers
Of Friendship, Hospitality, and Faith!
By that heroic Blood, which from the Ground
Reeking to you for Vengeance cries, I swear!
This impious Breach of your eternal Laws,
This daring Outrage on the Volscian Honor,
Shall find in me a rigorous Avenger!
On the same Earth, polluted by their Crime,
I will not live with these unpunished Ruffians!

TULLUS. This Deed is mine: I claim it all! -- These Men,
These valiant Men, were but my Instruments,
To punish him who to our Face betrayed us.
We shall not fear to answer to the Volsci,
In a full Council of their States at Antium,
The glorious Charge of having stabbed their Tyrant!

GALESUS. TITUS, till then secure them.
[ Tullus and Conspirators are led off. [Galesus, standing over the Body of
Coriolanus, after a short Pause, proceeds. Volscian Fathers,
And ye, brave Soldiers, see an awful Scene,
Demanding serious solemn Meditation.
This Man was once the Glory of his Age,
Disinterested, just, with every Virtue
Of civil Life adorned, in Arms unequalled.
His only Blot was this; That, much provoked,
He raised his vengeful Arm against his Country.
And, lo! the righteous Gods have now chastis'd him,
Even by the Hands of those for whom he fought.
Whatever private Views and Passions plead,
No Cause can justify so black a Deed:
These, when the angry Tempest clouds the Soul,
May darken Reason, and her Course control;
But when the Prospect clears, her startled Eye
Must from the treacherous Gulf with Horror fly,
On whose wild Wave, by stormy Passions tossed,
So many hapless Wretches have been lost.
Then be this Truth the Star by which we steer;
Above Ourselves our COUNTRY should be dear.

The END.
EPILOGUE.
SPOKEN BY Mrs. WOFFINGTON. WELL! Gentlemen! and are you still so vain
To treat our Sex with arrogant Disdain,
And think, to you alone by partial Heaven
Superior Sense and sovereign Power are given.
When in the Story told Tonight, you find,
With what a boundless Sway we rule the Mind,
And, by a few soft Words of ours, with Ease,
Can turn the proudest Hearts just where we please?
If an old Mother had such powerful Charms, --
To stop a stubborn Roman's conquering Arms, --
Soldiers and Statesmen of these Days, with you
What think you would a fair young Mistress do?
If with my grave Discourse, and wrinkled Face,
I thus could bring a Hero to Disgrace,
How absolutely may I hope to reign
Now I am turned to my own Shape again!
However, I will use my Empire well;
And, if I have a certain magic Spell
Or in my Tongue, or Wit, or Shape, or Eyes,
Which can subdue the Strong, and fool the Wise,
Be not alarmed: I will not interfere
In State Affairs, nor undertake to steer,
The Helm of Government, -- as we are told
Those Female Politicians did of old:
Such dangerous Heights I never wished to climb --
Thank Heaven! I better can employ my Time --
Ask you to what my Power I shall apply?
To make my Subjects blessed, is my Reply.
My Purposes are gracious all, and kind,
Some may be told -- and some may be divined:
One, which at present I have most at Heart,
To you without Reserve I will impart:
It is my Sovereign Will, -- Hear, and obey, --
That you with Candor treat this Orphan Play.
