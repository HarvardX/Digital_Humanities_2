THE MALE-COQUETTE: OR, Seventeen Hundred Fifty-Seven.

In TWO ACTS.

As it is Performed at the THEATER ROYAL In DRURY LANE.

-- Jacentem lenis in Hostem. VIRG. LONDON: Printed for P. VAILLANT, facing
Southampton-Street, in the Strand. MDCCLVII.

THE following Scenes were written with no other View than to serve Mr.
Woodward last Year at his Benefit; and to expose a Set of People, (the
Daffodils) whom the Author thinks more prejudicial to the Community, than the
various Characters of Bucks, Bloods, Flashes and Fribbles, which have by Turns
infested the Town, and been justly ridiculed upon the Stage. He expects no
Mercy from the Critics: But the more indulgent Public, perhaps, will excuse his
Endeavors to please them, when they shall know, that the Performance was
plan'd, written, and acted in less than a Month.

PROLOGUE.
WRITTEN AND SPOKEN By Mr. GARRICK.
WHY to this Farce this Title given,
Of Seventeen Hundred Fifty Seven?
Is it a Register of Fashions,
Of Follies, Frailties, favorite Passions?
Or is it designed to make appear,
How happy, good, and wise you were,
In this same memorable Year?
Sure with our Author Wit was scarce,
To crowd so many Virtues in a Farce.
Perhaps it is meant to make you stare,
Like Cloths hung out at Country Fair;
On which strange Monsters glare and grin,
To draw the gaping Bumpkins in. --
Though it is the Genius of the Age,
To catch the Eye with Title Page;
Yet here we dare not so abuse ye --
We have some Monsters to amuse ye.
Ye Slaves to Fashion, Dupes of Chance;
Whom Fortune leads her fickle Dance:
Who, as the Dice shall smile or frown,
Are rich and poor, and up and down;
Whose Minds eternal Vigils keep;
Who -- like Macbeth, have murdered Sleep! --
Each modish Vice this Night shall rise,
Like Banquo's Ghost, before your Eyes;
While, conscious you, shall start and roar --
Hence, horrid Farce! -- we'll see no more! --
-- Ye Ladies, too -- Maids, Widows, Wives --
Now tremble for your naughty Lives!
How will your Hearts go pit-a-pat? --
Bless me! -- Lord! -- what is the Fellow at? --
Was Poet ever so rude before?
Why sure the Brute will say no more --
Again! -- O Gad! -- I cannot bear --
Here -- you Boxkeeper, -- call my Chair:
Peace, Ladies -- it is a false Alarm --
To YOU our Author means no Harm.
His Female Failings all are Fictions:
To which your Lives are Contradictions.
The unnatural Fool has drawn a Plan,
Where Women like a worthless Man,
A Fault never heard of since the World began.
This Year he lets you steal away --
But if the next you trip or stray;
His Muse, he vows, on you shall wait,
In Seventeen Hundred Fifty-eight.

THE MALE-COQUETTE.
ACT I.
Enter ARABELLA, and SOPHIA in Men's Clothes. ARABELLA. INDEED, my Dear, you will
repent this Frolic.


SOPHIA. Indeed, my Dear, then it will be the first Frolic I ever repented in
all my Life. Lookee, Bell, it is in vain to oppose me, for I am resolved -- the
only Way to find out his Character, is to see him thus, and converse freely
with him. If he is the Wretch he is reported to be, I shall away with him at
once; and if he is not, he will thank me for the Trial, and our Union will be
the stronger.


ARABELLA. I never knew a Woman yet, who had Prudence enough to turn off a
pretty Fellow, because he had a little more Wickedness than the rest of his
Neighbors.


SOPHIA. Then I will be the first to set a better Example. -- If I did not
think a Man's Character was of some Consequence, I should not now run such
Risques, and encounter such Difficulties, to be better acquainted with it.


ARABELLA. Ha, Sophy! if you have Love enough to be jealous, and Jealousy
enough to try these Experiments -- don't imagine, though you should make terrible
Discoveries, that you can immediately quit your Inclinations, with your
Breeches; and return so very philosophically to your Petticoats again, ha, ha!
--


SOPHIA. You may be as merry with my Weaknesses, as you please, Madam; but I
know my own Heart, and can rely upon it.


ARABELLA. We are great Bullies by Nature; but Courage and Swaggering, are two
Things, Cousin.


SOPHIA. Since you are as little to be convinced, as I am to be persuaded --
your Servant --

[Going.
ARABELLA. Nay, Sophy -- This is unfriendly -- if you are resolved upon your
Scheme, open to me without Reserve, and I Will assist you.


SOPHIA. Imprimis, then; I confess to you, that I have a kind of whimsical
Attachment to Daffodil; not but I can see his Vanities, and laugh at 'em.


ARABELLA. And like him the better for 'em --


SOPHIA. Pshaw! don't plague me, Bell -- my other Lover, the jealous Mr. Tukely
--


ARABELLA. Who loves you too well to be successful --


SOPHIA. And whom I really esteem --


ARABELLA. As a good Sort of Man, ha, ha, ha.


SOPHIA. Nay, should have loved him --


ARABELLA. Had not a prettier Fellow stepped in between, who perhaps does not
care a Farthing for you --


SOPHIA. That Is the Question, my Dear -- Tukely, I say, either stung by
Jealousy, or unwilling to lose me, without a Struggle, has entreated me to know
more of his Rival, before I engage too far with him -- Many strange Things he
has told me, which have piqu'd me I must confess, and I am now prepared for the
Proof.


ARABELLA. You Will certainly be discovered, and put to Shame.


SOPHIA. I have secured my Success already.


ARABELLA. What do you mean?


SOPHIA. I have seen him, conversed with him, and am to meet him again today,
by his own Appointment.


ARABELLA. Madness! -- it cannot be.


SOPHIA. But it has been, I tell you --


ARABELLA. How? how? -- Quickly, quickly, dear Sophy?


SOPHIA. When you went to Lady Fanny's last Night, and left me, as you thought,
little disposed for a Frolic, I dressed me as you see, called a Chair, and went
to the King's-Arms -- asked for my Gentleman, and was shown into a Room -- he
immediately left his Company, and came to me.


ARABELLA. I tremble for you.


SOPHIA. I introduced myself as an Italian Nobleman, just arrived: Il Marchese
di Macaroni --


ARABELLA. Ridiculous! -- ha, ha.


SOPHIA. An Intimate of Sir Charles Vainlove's, who is now at Rome -- I told
him my Letters were with my Baggage, at the Custom-house -- He received me with
all the Openness imaginable, and would have introduced me to his Friends; I
begged to be excused, but promised to attend him today, and am now ready, as
you see, to keep my Word.


ARABELLA. Astonishing! -- and what did you talk about?


SOPHIA. Of various Things -- Women among the rest; and though I have not
absolutely any open Acts of Rebellion against him, yet, I fear he is a Traitor
at Heart -- and then such Vanity! -- but I had not Time to make great
Discoveries -- It was merely the Prologue -- The Play is to come.


ARABELLA. Act your Part well, or we shall hiss you --


SOPHIA. Never fear me; you don't know what a mad, raking, wild young Devil I
can be, if I set my Mind to it, Bell.

[Laying hold of her.
ARABELLA. You fright me! -- you shall positively be no Bedfellow of mine any
longer.


SOPHIA. I am resolved to ruin my Woman, and kill my Man, before I get into
Petticoats again.


ARABELLA. Take Care of a Quarrel though -- a Rival may be too rough with you.


SOPHIA. No, no, Fighting is not the Vice of these Times; and as for a little
Swaggering -- damn it, I can do it as well as the best of 'em.


ARABELLA. Hush, hush! Mr. Tukely is here --


SOPHIA. Now for a Trial of Skill; if I deceive him, you will allow that half my
Business is done.

[She walks aside, takes out a Glass, and looks at the Pictures.
Enter TUKELY. TUKELY. Your Servant Miss Bell -- I need not ask if Miss Sophy
be at home, for I believe I have seen her since you did.


ARABELLA. Have you, Sir? You seem disconcerted, Mr. Tukely: Has any Thing
happened?


TUKELY. A Trifle, Madam -- but I was born to be trifled with, and to be made
uneasy at Trifles.


ARABELLA. Pray, what trifling Affair has disturbed you thus?


SOPHIA. What Is the Matter now?

[Aside.
TUKLY. I met Miss Sophy this Moment in a Hackney Chair, at the End of the
Street: I knew her by the Pink Negligee; but upon my crossing the Way to speak
to her, she turned her Head away, laughed violently, and drew the Curtain in my
Face.


SOPHIA. So, so; well said, Jealousy.

[Aside.
ARABELLA. She was in Haste, I suppose, to get to her Engagement.


TUKELY. Yes, yes, Madam; I imagine she had some Engagement upon her Hands --
But sure, Madam, her great Desire to see her more agreeable Friends, need not
be attended with Contempt and Disregard to the rest of her Acquaintance.


ARABELLA. Indeed, Mr. Tukely, I have so many Caprices, and Follies of my own,
that I cannot possibly answer for my Cousin's too.


SOPHIA. Well said, Bell.

[Aside.
TUKELY. Answer, Miss! -- No, Heaven forbid you should -- for my Part, I have
given up all my Hopes as a Lover, and only, now, feel for her as a Friend --
and indeed as a Friend, a sincere Friend -- I cannot but say, that going out in
a Hackney Chair, without a Servant, and endeavoring to conceal herself, is
somewhat incompatible with Miss Sophy's Rank and Reputation -- This I speak as
a Friend -- not as a Lover, Miss Bell -- pray mind that.


ARABELLA. I see it very plainly, Mr. Tukely -- and it gives me great Pleasure,
that you can be so indifferent in your Love, and yet so jealous in your
Friendship.


TUKELY. You do me Honor, Miss, by your good Opinion.

[Walks about, and sees Sophy. Who Is that, pray?


ARABELLA. A Gentleman who is waiting for Sophy.


TUKELY. I think she has Gentlemen waiting for her every where.


SOPHIA. I am afraid, Sir, [coming up to him with her Glass] you will excuse me,
that notwithstanding your Declaration, and this Lady's Compliments, there is a
little of the Devil, called Jealousy, at the Bottom of all this Uneasiness.


TUKELY. Sir! --


SOPHIA. I say, Sir, wear your Cloak as long as you please, the Hoof will peep
out, take my Word for it.


TUKELY. Upon my Word, Sir, you are pleased to honor me with a Familiarity
which I neither expected, or indeed desired, upon so slight an Acquaintance.


SOPHIA. I dare swear you did not.

[Turns off, and hums a Tune.
TUKELY. I don't understand this!


ARABELLA: This is beyond Expectation --

[Aside.
SOPHIA. I presume, Sir, you never was out of England --

[Picking her Teeth.
TUKELY. I presume, Sir, that you are mistaken -- I never was so foolishly fond
of my own Country, to think that nothing good was to be had out of it; nor so
shamefully ungrateful to it, to prefer the Vices and Fopperies of every other
Nation, to the peculiar Advantages of my own.


SOPHIA. Ha, ha; well said, old England, in faith -- Now, Madam, if this
Gentleman would put this Speech into a Farce, and properly lard it with Roast
Beef, and Liberty, I would engage the Galleries would roar and halloo at it for
half an Hour together -- Ha, ha, ha.


ARABELLA. Now the Storm's coming.

[Aside.
TUKELY. If you are not engaged, Sir, we'll adjourn to the next Tavern, and
write this Farce between us.


SOPHIA. I fancy, Sir, by the Information of your Face, that you are more
inclined to Tragedy, than Comedy --


TUKELY. I shall be inclined to treat you very ill, if you don't walk out with
me.


SOPHIA. I have been treated so very ill already, in the little Conversation I
have had with you, that you must excuse my walking out for more of it; but if
you will persuade the Lady to leave the Room, I Will put you to Death -- Damme --

[Going up to him.
ARABELLA. For Heaven's sake! what is the Matter, Gentlemen?


TUKELY. What can I do with this Fellow?


SOPHIA. Madam, don't be alarmed -- this Affair will be very short -- I am
always expeditious; and will cut his Throat, without shocking you in the least:
-- Come, Sir, [draws] if you will not defend yourself, I must kick you about the
Room.

[Advancing.
TUKELY. Respect for this Lady, and this House, has curbed my Resentment
hitherto: But as your Insolence would take Advantage of my Forbearance, I must
correct it at all Events --

[Draws.
SOPHIA and ARABELLA. Ha, ha, ha!


TUKELY. What is all this?


SOPHIA. What, would you set your Courage to a poor, weak Woman? You are a bold
Briton, indeed! -- Ha, ha, ha.


TUKELY. What, Sophia? --


ARABELLA. Sophia! No, no; she is in a Hackney-Chair, you know, without a
Servant, in her Pink Negligee -- Ha, ha, ha. --


TUKELY. I am astonished! and can scarce believe my own Eyes -- What means this
Metamorphosis?


SOPHIA. It Is in Obedience to your Commands -- Thus equipped, I have got Access
to Daffodil, and shall know whether your Picture of him is drawn by your Regard
for me, or Resentment to him -- I will sound him, from his lowest Note to the
Top of his Compass.


TUKELY. Your Spirit transports me -- This will be a busy, and, I hope, a happy
Day for me. I have appointed no less than five Ladies to meet me at the Widow
Damply's; to each of whom, as well as yourself, the accomplished Mr. Daffodil
has presented his Heart; the Value of which I am resolved to convince 'em of
this Night, for the sake of the whole Sex.


SOPHIA. Pooh, pooh! that is the old Story -- You are so prejudiced. --


TUKELY. I am afraid it is you who are prejudiced, Madam; for if you will
believe your own Eyes and Ears --


SOPHIA. That I will, I assure you -- I shall visit him immediately -- He
thinks me in the Country, and to confirm it, I Will write to him as from thence
-- But ask me no more Questions about what I have done, and what is to be done;
for I have not a Moment to lose; and so, my good Friend Tukely, yours -- My
dear Bell, I kiss your Hand -- [kisses her Hand] You are a fine Woman, by
Heavens! Here, Joseppi, Brunello, Francesi, -- where are my Fellows there? Call
me a Chair -- Viva l'Amor, and Liberta --

[Exit singing.
ARABELLA. Ha, ha; there is a Spirit for you! -- Well now, what do you stare at?
-- You could not well desire more -- O, fie, fie, -- don't sigh, and bite your
Fingers; rouse yourself, Man; set all your Wits to work; bring this faithless
Corydon to Shame, and I Will be hanged if the Prize is not yours -- If she
returns in Time, I Will bring her to the Widow Damply's --


TUKELY. Dear Miss Arabella --


ARABELLA. Well, well; make me a fine Speech another Time. About your Business
now --


TUKELY. I fly --

[Exit TUKELY.
ARABELLA. What a Couple of blind Fools has Love made of this poor Fellow, and
my dear Cousin Sophy? Little do they imagine, with all their wise Discoveries,
that Daffodil is as faithful a Lover, as he is an accomplished Gentleman -- I
pity these poor deceived Women, with all my Heart -- But how will they stare,
when they find that he has artfully pretended a Regard for them, the better to
conceal his real Passion for me -- They will certainly tear my Eyes out; and
what will Cousin Sophy say to me, when we are obliged to declare our Passion?
No Matter what -- It Is the Fortune of War -- And I shall only serve her, as she
and every other Friend would serve me in the same Situation --

A little cheating never is a Sin,
At Love or Cards -- provided that you win.
[Exit ARAB.
Daffodil's Lodgings. Enter DAFFODIL and RUFFLE. DAFFODIL. But are you sure,
Ruffle, that you delivered the Letter last Night, in the Manner I ordered you?


RUFFLE. Exactly, Sir.


DAFFODIL. And you are sure that Mr. Dotterel saw you slip the Note into his
Wife's Hand?


RUFFLE. I have alarmed him, and you may be assured, that he is as uneasy as
you would wish to have him -- But I should be glad, with your Honor's Leave,
to have a little serious Conversation with you; for my Mind forebodes much
Peril to the Bones of your humble Servant, and very little Satisfaction to your
Honor.


DAFFODIL. Thou art a most incomprehensible Blockhead --


RUFFLE. No great Scholar, or Wit, indeed -- but I can feel an Oak Sappling, as
well as another -- Ay, and I should have felt one last Night, if I had not had
the Heels of all Mr. Dotterel's Family -- I had the whole Pack after me --


DAFFODIL. And did not they catch you?


RUFFLE. No, thank Heaven --


DAFFODIL. You was not kicked then?


RUFFLE. No, Sir.


DAFFODIL. Nor can'd?


RUFLLE. No, Sir.


DAFFODIL. Nor dragged through a Horse-pond?


RUFFLE. O, Lord! No, Sir.


DAFFODIL. That Is unlucky --


RUFFLE. Sir!


DAFFODIL. You must go again, Ruffle, to Night, perhaps you may be in better
Luck.


RUFFLE. If I go again, Sir, may I be can'd, kicked, and Horse-ponded for my
Pains -- I believe I have been ^ucky enough to bring an old House over your
Head.


DAFFODIL. What do you mean?


RUFFLE. Mr. Dotterel only hobbled after me, to pay me (...) the Postage of
your Letter; but being a little out (...) Wind, he soon stopped, to curse and
swear at me -- I could hear him mutter something of Scoundrel, and Pimp, and my
Master, and Villain -- and Blunderbuss, and Saw-pit; and then he shook his
Stick, and looked like the Devil!


DAFFODIL. Blunderbuss, and Saw-pit! This Business grows a little serious, and
so we will drop it -- The Husband is so old and peevish, and she so young and
pressing, that I Will give it up, Ruffle -- The Town talks of us, and I am
satisfied.


RUFFLE. Pray Sir, with Submission, for what End do you write to so many
Ladies, and make such a Rout about 'em; there are now upon the List half a
Dozen Maids, a Leash of Wives, and the Widow Damply. I know your Honor don't
intend Mischief; but what Pleasure can you have in deceiving them, and the
World? for you are thought a terrible young Gentleman.


DAFFODIL. Why that Pleasure, Booby.


RUFFLE. I don't understand it -- What do you intend to do with 'em all? Ruin
'em?


DAFFODIL. Not I, faith.


RUFFLE. But you will ruin their Reputations.


DAFFODIL. That Is their Business -- Not mine.


RUFFLE. Will you marry any one of 'em?


DAFFODIL. O, no; that would be finishing the Game at once -- If I preferred
one, the Rest would take it ill; so because I will not be particular, I give 'em
all Hopes, without going a Step further.


RUFFLE. Widows cannot live upon such slender Diet.


DAFFODIL. A true Sportsman has no Pleasure but in the Chase; the Game is
always given to those who have less Taste, and better Stomachs.


RUFFLE. I love to pick a Bit, I must confess -- Really, Sir, I should not care
what became of half the Women you are pleased to be merry with -- But Miss
Sophy, sure, is a heavenly Creature, and deserves better Treatment; and to make
Love to her Cousin too, in the same House -- that is very cruel.


DAFFODIL. But it amuses one -- besides they are both fine Creatures. And how
do I know, if I loved only one, but the other might poison herself?


RUFFLE. And when they know that you have loved 'em both, they may poison one
another -- This Affair will make a great Noise.


DAFFODIL. Or I have taken a great Deal of Pains for nothing; but no more
prating, Sirrah; while I read my Letters, go and ask Harry what Cards and
Messages he has taken in this Morning.


RUFFLE. There is no mending him.

[Exit RUFFLE.
DAFFODIL. [Opens Letters] This is from the Widow Damply -- I know her Scrawl
at a Mile's Distance -- she pretends that the Fright of her Husband's Death
hurt her Nerves so, that her Hand has shook ever since -- ha, ha, ha -- It has
hurt her Spelling too, for here is Joy with a G; ha! ha! poor Creature. [Reads]
Hum -- hum -- hum -- Well said, Widow; she speaks plain, faith, and grows
urgent -- I must get quit of her -- she desires a tete a tete; which, with
Widows who have suffered much for the Loss of their Husbands, is, as Capt.
Bobadil says, a Service of Danger. So, I am off -- [Opens another] What the
Devil have we here? A Bill in Chancery: Oh, no! my Taylor's Bill -- Sum Total
374 l. 11 s. 5 d. -- Indeed, Monsieur Chicaneau, this is a damned Bill, and you
will be damned for making it -- therefore, for the Good of your Soul, Mons.
Chicaneau, you must make another. [tears it] The French know their Consequence,
and use us accordingly. [Opens another.] This is from Newmarket. -- [Reads] --

May it please your Honor,
I Would not have you think of matching Cherry-Derry with Gingerbread; he is a
terrible Horse, and very covetous of his Ground -- I have chopped Hurlothrumbo
for the Roan Mare, and fifty Pounds. Sir Roger has taken the Match off your
Hands, which is a good Thing; for the Mare has the Distemper, and must have
forfeited -- I flung his Honor's Groom, though he was above an Hour in the
Stable. The Nutmeg Gray, Custard, is matched with Alderman. Alderman has a good
Wind, and will be too hard for Custard. --

I am, your Honor's Most obedient Servant, ROGER WHIP.


-- Whip's a Genius, and a good Servant. I have not as yet lost above a
Thousand Pounds by my Horses -- But such Luck cannot always last.


Enter RUFFLE with Cards. RUFFLE. There Is the Morning's Cargo, Sir.

[Throws 'em down upon the Table.
DAFFODIL. Heigh Day! I cannot read 'em in a Month; prithee, Ruffle, set down my
Invitations from the Cards, according to their Date, and let me see 'em
Tomorrow Morning -- So much Reading would distract me.


RUFFLE. And yet these are the only Books that Gentlemen read Nowadays.

[Aside.
Enter a SERVANT. SERVANT. And please your Honor, I forgot to tell you that
there was a Gentleman here last Night -- I Have forgot his Name.


RUFFLE. Old Mr. Dotterel, perhaps.


SERVANT. Old; no, no, he looks younger than his Honor -- I believe he is mad,
he cannot stand still a Moment; he first caper'd out of the Chair, and when I
told him your Honor was not at Home, he caper'd into it again -- said he would
call again, jabber'd something, and away he went singing.


DAFFODIL. It Is the Marquis of Macaroni, I saw him at the King's Arms
Yesterday: Admit him when he comes, Harry.


SERVANT. I shall, your Honor -- I can neither write or remember these
outlandish Names.

[Exit Servant.
DAFFODIL. Where is my List of Women, Ruffle, and the Places of their Abode,
that we may strike off some, and add the new Acquisitions?


RUFFLE. What, alter again! I wrote it out fair but this Morning -- There are
quicker Successions in your Honor's List, than the Court-Calendar.


DAFFODIL. Strike off Mrs. Dotterel, and the Widow Damply.


RUFFLE. They are undone.

[Strikes 'em out.
Enter SERVANT. SERVANT. A Lady, Mr. Ruffle, in a Chair, must speak with you.


DAFFODIL. Did she ask for me? -- See Ruffle, who it is.

[Exit RUFFLE.
SERVANT. No, your Honor; but she looked quite flustrated.


DAFFODIL. Well, go below, and be careful not to let any old Gentleman in this
Morning -- and do you hear, if any of the Neighbors should inquire who the Lady
is, you may say it is a Relation; and be sure smile, do you hear? when you tell
'em so.


SERVANT. I shall, your Honor -- He, he, he, I am never melancholy.

[Exit Servant.
DAFFODIL. That Fellow's a Character.


Enter RUFFLE. RUFFLE. Sir, it is Mrs. Dotterel; she has had a terrible Quarrel
with her Husband about your Letter, and has something to say of Consequence to
you both -- she must see you, she says.


DAFFODIL. I will not see her -- Why would you say that I was at Home -- You know
I hate to be alone with 'em, and she is so violent too -- Well, well, show her
up -- This is so unlucky --


RUFFLE. He hates to see Duns he never intends to pay.

[Exit. RUFF.
DAFFODIL. What shall I do with her? This is worse than meeting her Husband
with a Blunderbuss in a Saw-pit.


Enter Mrs. DOTTEREL, and RUFFLE. DAFFODIL. Dear Mrs. Dotterel, this is so
obliging -- Ruffle, don't let a Soul come near me. [Aloud] -- And harkee, don't
leave us long together, and let every Body up that comes.

[Aside.
RUFFLE. What a Deal of Trouble here is about nothing.

[Exit RUFF.
Mrs. DOTTEREL. In the Name of Virtue, Mr. Daffodil, I hope you have not given
any private Orders, that may in the least derogate from that absolute
Confidence which I place in your Honor.


DAFFODIL. You may be perfectly easy under this Roof, Madam. I hope, I am
polite enough not to let my Passions, of any Kind, run too great Lengths in my
own House.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Nothing but absolute Necessity could have made me take this
imprudent Step -- I am ready to faint with my Apprehensions -- Heigh ho! --


DAFFODIL. Heaven forbid! -- I Will call for some Assistance.

[Going to ring.
Mrs. DOTTEREL. Let your Bell alone [Stopping him] You Are always calling for
Assisistance, I think -- you never give one Time to come to ones self -- Mr.
Dotterel has seen your Letter, and vows Vengeance and Destruction -- Why would
you be so violent and imprudent?


DAFFODIL. The Devil was in me, Madam; but I repent it from my Soul; it has
cured me of being violent.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Come, come, don't take it too deeply neither; I thought it
proper, at all Hazards, to let you know what had happened, and to entreat you,
by that Affection you have sworn to me, to be careful of my Reputation.


DAFFODIL. That I will indeed, Madam; we cannot be too careful.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Well, Mr. Daffodil, I am an unhappy Woman -- married to one I
cannot love; and loving one I ought to shun -- It is a terrible Situation, Mr.
Daffodil --


DAFFODIL. It is indeed, Madam, -- I am in a terrible one too -- Would I was
well out of it.

[Aside.
Mrs. DOTTEREL. Do you know, Mr. Daffodil, that if I had not been very
religious, my Passions would have undone me -- But you must give me Time, for
nothing but that, and keeping the best Company, will ever conquer my Prejudices
--


DAFFODIL. I should be very ungenerous not to allow you Time, Madam -- three
Weeks or a Month, I hope, will do the Business -- Though, by my Honor, I got the
better of Mine in half the Time -- What is Ruffle doing?

[Aside.
Mrs. DOTTEREL. He Is very cold, methinks; but I Will try him further -- Lookee,
Mr. Daffodil, you must curb your Passions, and keep your Distance -- Fire is
catching, and one does not know the Consequences when once it begins to spread.


DAFFODIL. As you say, Madam, Fire is a catching; it is dangerous to play with
it; and as I am of the Tinder-Kind, -- as one may say, -- we had better, -- as
you say -- Madam, -- change the Subject -- Pray did you ever hear of the
Pug-dog that you advertised? It was a very pretty Creature -- what was his
Name, Madam?


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Daffodil, Sir!

[Stifling her Passion.
DAFFODIL. Madam!


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Could I love and esteem any Thing, and not call it Daffodil? --
What a Wretch!

[Aside.
DAFFODIL. You do me Honor, Madam -- I don't like her Looks, I must change the
Discourse [Aside.] Upon my Soul, Mrs. Dotterel, this Struggle is too much for
Man: My Passions are now tearing me to Pieces, and if you will stay, by Heaven
I will not answer for the Consequences.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Consequences! What Consequences! Thou wretched, base, false,
worthless Animal!


DAFFODIL. You do me Honor.

[Bowing.
Mrs. DOTTEREL. Can thou think that I am so blinded by my Passion, not to see
thy treacherous, mean, unmanly Evasions? -- I have long suspected your Infamy,
and having this Proof of it, I could stab your treacherous Heart, and my own
weak one -- Don't offer to stir, or ring your Bell, for, by Heavens, I Will --

[Catches hold of him.
DAFFODIL. I stir! I am never so happy, as when I am in your Company.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Thou lie: Thou art never so happy as when thou art deceiving,
and betraying our foolish Sex -- and all for what? Why, for the poor Reputation
of having that, which thou have neither Power nor Spirit to enjoy.


DAFFODIL. Ha! I hear Somebody coming -- Now for a Rapure [Aside.] Talk not of
Power or Spirit -- Heaven, that has made you fair, has made me strong -- O!
forgive the Madness which your Beauty has occasioned.

[Throws himself upon his Knees.
Enter SERVANT. SERVANT. The Marquis of Macaroons --

[Exit Serve.
Enter SOPHIA. Mrs. DOTTEREL. Ha! [Screams.] I am betrayed! --

[They all stare, and DAFFODIL seemingly astonished.
SOPHIA. Mrs. Dotterel, by all that is virtuous -- [Aside] Signor Daffodillo --
resto Confuso, tat I am com si mal-a proposito.


DAFFODIL. Dear Marquis, no Excuse I beg -- nothing at all -- a Relation of
mine -- my Sister only -- Miss Daffodil, this is, il Merchese de Macaroni, an
Intimate of Sir Charles Vainlove's -- This was lucky [Aside] -- Well, then, my
dear Sister, I will wait upon you Tomorrow, and settle the whole Affair.
[Aloud] I am the most miserable of Mortals, and have lost the most precious
Moments of my Life.

[Aside to Mrs. DOTT.
Mrs. DOTTEREL. You are a Villain -- I despise you, and detest you -- and will
never see you more.

[Exit Mrs. DOTT.
DAFFODIL. Ha, ha, ha! -- My Sister has a noble Spirit, my Lord.


SOPHIA. Mi dispiace infinamente -- it tisplis me, tat I haf interrumpato, gli
Affari of you Famili.


DAFFODIL. It is the old Family-business, my Lord; and so old, that, by my
Honor, I am quite tired of it.


SOPHIA. I hate him already. [Aside.] -- Signor Daffodillo, she is una
belissima Sorella in Verita, a very prit' Siss' intit.


DAFFODIL. I must confess to you, my Lord, that my Sister is a young distressed
Damsel, married to an old Gentleman of the Neighborhood, Ha, ha, ha.


SOPHIA. O Cara Inghilterra! vat a fortunata Contree is it is! te olt Men marri
de young fine Girl, and te young fine Girl visit te young Signors -- O, preciosa
Liberta! --


DAFFODIL. Indeed, my Lord, Men of Fashion here have some small Privileges; we
gather our Roses without fear of Thorns -- Husbands and Brothers don't deal in
Poison and Stilletos, as they do with you.


SOPHIA. Il nostro amico, Signor Carlo, has tol me a tousant Volti, dat you vas
de Orlando Innamorato himself.


DAFFODIL. But not Furioso, I can assure you, my Lord, Ha, ha, ha! I am for
Variety, and Badinage, without Affection -- Reputation is the great Ornament,
and Ease the great Happiness of Life -- To ruin Women would be troublesome; to
trifle and make Love to 'em amuses one -- I use my Women as daintily as my
Tokay; I merely sip of both, but more than half a Glass palls me.


SOPHIA. Il mio proprio Gusto -- Tukely is right; he is a Villain. [Aside] --
Signor Daffodillo; Vil you do me de Favor to give me Stranger, una Introduzione
to some of your Signorine, let vostro amico taste a littel, un Poco of your
dulce Tokay.


DAFFODIL. O, Certamente! -- I have half a hundred Signorines at your Service.


SOPHIA. Multo obligato, Signor Daffodillo.


Enter SERVANT. SERVANT. Here is a Letter for your Honor.

[Surlily.
DAFFODIL. What is the Matter with the Fellow?


SERVANT. Matter, your Honor! -- the Lady that went out just now, gave me such
a Souse on the Ear, as I made my Bow to her, that I could scarce tell, for a
Minute, whether I had a Head or no.


DAFFODIL. Ha! ha! -- Poor Fellow! -- there is Smart Money for you. [Gives him
Money.] -- [Exit Servant.] -- Will your Lordship give me Leave? --


SOPHIA. Senza Ceremony -- now for it.

[Aside.
DAFFODIL. Reads. SIR,
I Shall return from the Country next Week, and shall hope to meet you at Lady
Fanny Pewit's Assembly next Wednesday.

I am very much your humble Servant, SOPHIA SPRIGHTLY.


-- My Lord Marquis, here is a Letter has started Game for you already -- the
most lucky Thought imaginable.


SOPHIA. Cosa e questa -- Cosa, e -- vat is?


DAFFODIL. There are two fine Girls you must know, Cousins, who live together;
this is a Letter from one of 'em, Sophia is her Name -- I have addressed 'em
both, but as Matters become a little serious on their Side, I must raise a
Jealousy between the Friends; discover to one the Treachery of the other; and
so in the Bustle steal off as quietly as I can.


SOPHIA. O! Spiritoso Amico -- I can scarce contain myself.

[Aside.
DAFFODIL. Before the Mine is sprung, I will introduce you into the Town.


SOPHIA. You are great Generalissimo in verita ma. I feel in mio Core vat de
poor infelice Sophia vil feel for de Loss of Signor Daffadillo.


DAFFODIL. Yes, poor Creature; I believe she will have a Pang or two -- tender
indeed! and I believe will be unhappy for some Time.


SOPHIA. What a Monster!

[Aside.
DAFFODIL. You must dine with our Club today, where I will introduce you to
more of Sir Charles's Friends, all Men of Figure and Fashion.


SOPHIA. I must primo haf my Lettere, dat your Amici may be assicurati dat I am
no Impostore.


DAFFODIL. In the Name of Politeness, my Lord Marquis, don't mention your
Letters again; none but a Justice of Peace, or a Constable, would ever ask for
a Certificate of a Man's Birth, Parentage, and Education, Ha, ha, ha!


SOPHIA. Viva, viva il Signor Daffodillo! You shall be il mio Conduttore in
tutte le Partite of Love and Pleasure.


DAFFODIL. With all my Heart -- You must give me Leave now, my Lord, to put on
my Clothes -- In the mean Time, if your Lordship will step into my Study there,
if you choose Music, there is a Guittar, and some Venetian Ballads; or, if you
like reading, there is Infidelity, and baudy Novels for you -- Call Ruffle there.

[Exit DAFF.
SOPHIA. [Looking after him] I am shocked at him -- He is really more abandoned
than Tukely's Jealousy described him -- I have got my Proofs, and will not
venture any further; I am vexed that I should be angry at him, when I should
only despise him -- But I am so angry, that I could almost wish myself a Man,
that my Breeches might demand Satisfaction for the Injury he has done my
Petticoats. --

Exit.
End of the FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE, Mrs. DAMPLY'S Lodgings. Enter ARABELLA and SOPHIA. SOPHIA. IN short,
his own Declarations, the unexpected Meeting of Mrs. Dotterel, his Usage of my
Letter, and twenty Things beside, determined me not to go among the Set of 'em
-- So making the best Excuse I could, I got quit of him and his Companions.


ARABELLA. All this may be true, Sophy -- Every young Fellow has his Vanities;
Fashion has made such Irregularities Accomplishments, and the Man may be worth
having, for all your Discoveries.


SOPHIA. What! an abandoned, rash, profligate Male-Coquette; a Wretch, who can
assume Passions he never feels, and sport with our Sex's Frailties -- Fie, fie,
Bell.


ARABELLA. Well, well, you are too angry to be merciful -- If he is such a
Monster, I am glad you are out of his Clutches, and that you can so easily
resign him to another.


SOPHIA. To another! there is not that Woman, be she ever so handsome, that I
hate enough, to wish her so much Evil; and happy it is for you, Bell, that you
have a Heart to resist his Allurements.


ARABELLA. Yes, I thank my Stars -- I am not so susceptible of Impressions of
that Kind -- and yet -- I will not swear -- if an agreeable Man -- I -- I --


SOPHIA. No, no, Bell, you are not absolute Stone -- you you may be mollified
-- She is confounded --

[Aside.
ARABELLA. Surely he has not betrayed me -- It Is impossible, I cannot be
deceived.

[Aside.
SOPHIA. Well, shall we go in to the Ladies and Mr. Tukely? Were they not
surpised when he opened the Business to 'em?


ARABELLA. 'Twas the finest Scene imaginable -- You could see, though they all
endeavored to hide their Liking to Daffodil, all were uneasy at Tukely's
Discovery. At first, they objected to his Scheme; but they began to listen to
his Proposal the Moment I was called out to you; what farther he intends, is a
Secret to us all; but here he comes, and without the Ladies.


[Enter TUKELY: TUKELY. Pray, Miss Bell -- Bless me! Miss Sophy returned! I
dare not ask -- and yet if my Eyes do not flatter my Heart -- your Looks --


SOPHIA. Don't rely too much upon Looks, Mr. Tukely.


TUKELY. Madam -- why sure --


SOPHIA. Don't imagine, I say, that you can always see the Mind in the Face.


TUKELY. I can see, Madam, that your Mind is not disposed to wish, or make me
happy.


SOPHIA. Did not I bid you not to rely upon Looks; for do you know now that my
Mind is at this Time most absolutely disposed -- to do every thing that you
would have me.

[Curtsys.
TUKELY. Then I have nothing more to wish or ask of Fortune.

[Kneels, and kisses her Hand.
ARABELLA. Come, come, this is no Time to attend to one, when you have so many
Ladies to take Care of.


TUKELY. I will not yet enquire into your Adventures, 'till I have accomplished
my own. The Ladies within have at last agreed, to attend me this Evening;
where, if you have a Mind to finish the Picture you have begun this Morning, an
Opportunity may offer.


SOPHIA. I am contented with my Sketch -- However, I Will make one; and if you
have an Occasion for a Second in any thing -- I am your Man -- command me.


TUKELY. A Match -- from this Moment I take you as my Second; nay, my First in
every Circumstance of our future Lives.


ARABELLA. Mighty pretty, truly! -- and so I am to stand cooling my Heels here,
while you are making yourselves ridiculous.


SOPHIA: Bell's in the Right -- to Business, to Business -- Mr. Tukeley, you
must introduce me to the Ladies; I can at least make as good a Figure as Mr.
Daffodil among 'em.

[Exit Sophia and Tukely.
ARABELLA. When Daffodil's real Inclinations are known, how those poor Wretches
will be disappointed.

[Exit Arab.
SCENE, The Club-Room. Lord RACKET, Sir TAN-TIVY, Sir WILLIAM WHISTER, SPINNER
writing, and DAFFODIL. [Waiter behind. DAFFODIL. What do you say, my Lord, that
I don't do it in an Hour?


Lord RACKET. Not in an Hour and Half, George.


DAFFODIL. Done with you, my Lord -- I Will take your Seven to Five -- Seventy
Poud to Fifty.


Lord RACKET. Done -- I Will lay the Odds again, with you, Sir William -- and
with you, Sir Tivy.


Sir WILLIAM. Not I, faith; -- Daffodil has too many fine Women -- he will never
do it.


DAFFODIL. I Will go into the Country for a Week, and not a Petticoat shall come
near me -- I Will take the Odds again.


Sir TAN-TIVY. Done, Daffodil.


Lord RACKET. You are to hop upon one Leg, without changing, mind that -- Set
it down, Spinner.


SPINNER. I have -- Shall I read it?


Lord RACKET. Silence in the Court.


SPINNER. Reads.] Lord Racket has betted 70 Pounds to 50, with the Honorable
George Daffodil -- that the Latter does not walk from Bukingham-Gate, to the
Bun-house, at Chelsea -- eat a Bun there, run back to the Turnpike, and from
thence hop upon one Leg, with the other tied to the Cue of his Wig, to
Buckingham-Gate again, in an Hour and Half.



DAFFODIL. I say, done --


Lord RACKET. And done.


Sir WILLIAM. Consider your Women -- you will never do it, George.


DAFFODIL. Not do it! [hops] Why, I Will get a Chelsea Pensioner shall do it in
an Hour, with his wooden Leg -- What Day shall we fix for it?


Sir WILLIAM. The first of April, to be sure.


ALL. Ha, ha, ha. --


Lord RACKET. Come, Daffodil, read the Betts and Matches of Today -- then let
us finish our Champaigne, and go to the Opera.


DAFFODIL. Reads.] March 24, 1757, Sir Tan-Tivy, has pitted Lady Pettitoe,
against Dowager Lady Periwinkle, with Sir William Whister, for 500 l. -- I Will
pit my Uncle. Lord Chalkstone, against 'em both.



Sir TAN-TIVY. Done.


Lord RACKET. The Odds are against you, Daffodil -- my Lord has got to plain
Nantz now every Morning.


DAFFODIL. And the Ladies have been at it to my Knowledge, this half Year.


DAFFODIL. Good, again, George.


Sir WILLIAM. The Honorable George Daffodil, has betted one hundred Pound,
with Sir William Whister, that he produces a Gentleman, before the 5th of June
next, that shall live for five Days successively, without Eating, Drinking, or
Sleeping. --



Sir WILLIAM. He must have no Books, George.


DAFFODIL. No, no; the Gentleman I mean cannot read.


Sir WILLIAM. It Is not yourself, George!


OMNES. Ha, ha, ha; it is impossible, it must kill him.


DAFFODIL. Why, then I lose my Bet.

Reads.] Lord Racket has matched Sir Joslin Jolly against Major Calipash, with
Sir Tan-Tivy, to run fifty Yards upon the Mall after Dinner, if either tumbles,
the Wages is lost -- for Fifty Pounds.



SPINNER. I Will lay Fifty more, neither of 'em run the Ground in Half an Hour.


DAFFODIL. Not in an Hour.


Sir TAN-TIVY. Done, Daffodil -- I Will bet you a Hundred of that.


DAFFODIL. Done, Baronet; I Will double it, if you will.


Sir TAN-TIVY. With all my Heart -- Book it, Spinner.

[Spinner writes.
Lord RACKET. You Will certainly lose, George.


DAFFODIL. Impossible, my Lord; Sir Joslin is damnably out of Wind.


Lord RACKET. What, Asthmatic?


DAFFODIL. No, quite cured of his Asthma -- he died Yesterday Morning -- Bite.


ALL. Bravo, George.


Lord RACKET. Now you talk of dying -- how does your Cousin Dizzy?


DAFFODIL. Lingers on -- better and worse -- Lives upon Asses Milk, Panada, and
Eringo Root.


Lord RACKET. You Will have a fine Wind-fall there, George -- a good Two Thousand
a Year.


DAFFODIL. It Is better, my Lord; but I love Dick so well, and have had so many
Obligations to him -- he saved my Life once -- that I could wish him better
Health.


Sir WILLIAM. Or in a better Place -- there is devilish fine Timber in Staunton
Woods.


Sir TAN-TIVY. Down with 'em, Daffodil.


Lord RACKET. But let Dizzy drop first -- a little Blast will fell him.


Enter DIZZY. DIZZY. Not so little as you may imagine, my Lord -- hugh, hugh --

[Coughs.
ALL. Ha, ha, ha.


DAFFODIL. Angels and Ministers! what Cousin! We were got among your Trees.


DIZZY. You are heartily welcome to any one of 'em, Gentlemen, for a proper
Purpose -- hugh, hugh.


Lord RACKET. Well said, Dick. How quick his Wit, and how youthful the Rogue
looks!


DAFFODIL. Bloomy and plump -- the Country Air is a fine Thing, my Lord --


DIZZY. Well, well, be as jocular as you please; I am not so ill, as you may
wish, or imagine; -- I can walk to Knightsbridge in an Hour, for a Hundred
Pound.


Lord RACKET. I bet you a Hundred of that, Dizzy.


DAFFODIL. I Will lay you a Hundred, Dick, that I drive a Sow and Pigs to your
Lodgings, before you can get there.


DIZZY. Done, I say; [Draws his Purse.] Done -- Two Hundred -- done -- Three.


Lord RACKET. I Will take Dizzy, against your Sow and Pigs.


Sir WILLIAM. I take the Field against Dizzy.


Lord RACKET. Done.


SPINNER. Done.


DIZZY. Damn your Sow and Pigs; I am so sick with the Thoughts of running with
'em, that I shall certainly faint -- [Smells to a Bottle] -- hugh, hugh --


DAFFODIL. Cousin Dizzy cannot bear the Mention of Pork -- he hates it -- I knew
it would work.

[Aside to the rest.
DIZZY. I wish you had not mentioned it -- I cannot stay -- Damn your Sow and
Pigs -- Here, Waiter, call a Chair -- Damn your Sow and Pigs! -- hugh, hugh.

[Exit Dizzy.
DAFFODIL. Poor Dizzy -- What a Passion he is in! -- Ha, ha, ha.


Lord RACKET. The Woods are yours, George; you may whet the Axe -- Dizzy will not
live a Month.


DAFFODIL. Pooh, this is nothing -- he was always weakly --


Sir WILLIAM. It Is a Family Misfortune, Daffodil.


Enter WAITER. WAITER. Mr. Dizzy, Gentlemen, dropped down at the Stair Foot,
and the Cook has carried him behind the Bar.


DAFFODIL. Lay him upon a Bed, and he will come to himself.

[Exit Waiter.
Lord RACKET. I Will bet Fifty Pound, that he don't live till Morning.


SIR WILLIAM. I Will lay Six to Four, he don't live a Week.


DAFFODIL. I Will take your Fifty Pound.


SPINNER. I Will take your Lordship again.


Lord RACKET. Done, with you both.


Sir TAN-TIVY. I Will take it again.


Lord RACKET. Done, done, done; -- but I bar all Assistance to him -- Not a
Physician, or Surgeon sent for -- or I am off.


DAFFODIL. No, no; we are upon Honor -- There shall be none, else it would be
a bubble Bet. -- There shall be none.


Sir WILLIAM. If I were my Lord, now, the Physicians should attend him.


Enter WAITER, with a Letter. WAITER. A Letter for his Honor --

[Gives it to Daff. [ Daffodil reads it to himself.
Sir WILLIAM. Daffodil, remember the First of April -- and let the Women alone.


DAFFODIL. Upon my Soul you have hit it -- it is a Woman, faith -- Something
very particular, and if you are in Spirits for a Scheme --


Lord RACKET. Ay, ay; come, come; a Scheme, a Scheme!


DAFFODIL. There then, have among you.

[Throws the Letter upon the Table.
Lord RACKET. Reads, all looking on.] Hum -- If the liking your Person be a
Sin, what Woman is not guilty? -- hum hum -- at the End of the Bird-cage Walk
-- about Seven -- where the Darkness and Privacy will befriend my Blushes; I
will convince you, what Trust I have in your Secrecy and Honor --

Yours, INCOGNITA.





DAFFODIL. Will you go?


Lord RACKET. What do you propose?


DAFFODIL. To go -- If after I have been with her half an Hour, you will come
upon us -- and have a Blow up.


Sir WILLIAM. There Is a Gallant for you!


DAFFODIL. Prithee, Sir William, be quiet -- must a Man be in Love with every
Woman that invites him!


Sir WILLIAM. No; but he should be honorable to 'em, George -- and rather
conceal a Woman's Weakness, than expose it -- I hate this Work -- so, I Will go
to the Coffee-house.

[Exit Sir William.
Lord RACKET. Let him go -- don't mind him, George; he is married, and past
fifty -- this will be a fine Frolic -- Devilish high --


DAFFODIL. Very! -- Well, I Will go and prepare myself -- put on my Surtout, and
take my Chair to Buckingham-Gate -- I know the very Spot.


Lord RACKET. We'll come with Flambeaux -- you must be surprised, and --


DAFFODIL. I know what to do -- Here, Waiter, Waiter;

Enter WAITER. How does Cousin Dizzy?


WAITER. Quite recovered, Sir; -- he is in the Phoenix, with two Ladies, and
has ordered a boiled Chicken and Jellies.


Lord RACKET. There Is a Blood for you! -- without a Drop in his Veins.


DAFFODIL. Do you stay with him, then, till I have secured my Lady; and in Half
an Hour from this Time come away, and bring Dizzy with you.


Lord RACKET. If he will leave the Ladies -- Don't the Italian Marquis dine with
us Tomorrow?


DAFFODIL. Certainly.


Lord RACKET. Well, do you mind your Business -- and I Will speak to the Cook to
show his Genius -- Allons!

[Exit Daff.
Lord RACKET. Tom, bid the Cook attend me Tomorrow Morning, on special Affairs
--

1st WAITER. Coming, Sir; -- I Will make it Shillings, Tom.


2d WAITER. No, Harry, you have the best on it. [Bell rings.] Coming, Sir. I Will
take Five Shillings to Two. [Bell rings] Coming, Sir. --


1st WAITER. Coming, Sir. -- No, Five to Three.

[Exeunt.
Enter ARABELLA, Mrs. DAMPLY, Lady FAN. PEWIT, Mrs. DOTTEREL, TUKELY in Women's
Clothes, and SOPHIA in Men's. Ladies ALL. Ha, ha, ha.


ARABELLA. What a Figure! And what a Scheme.


TUKELY. Dear Ladies, be as merry with my Figure as you please -- Yet you shall
see, this Figure, awkward as it is, shall be preferred in its Turn, as well as
you have been.


SOPHIA. Why will you give yourself this unnecessary Trouble, Mr. Tukely, to
convince these Ladies, who had rather still be deluded, and will hate your
Friendship for breaking the Charm.


ARABELLA. My dear Cousin, though you are satisfied, these Ladies are not; and if
they have their particular Reasons for their Infidelity; pray, let 'em enjoy
it, 'till they have other Proofs than your Prejudices.


SOPHIA. Ay, Bell, we have all our Prejudices.


TUKELY. What signifies reasoning, when we are going upon the Experiment?
Dispose of yourselves behind those Trees, and I will repair to the Place of
Appointment, and draw him hither; but you promise to contain yourselves, let
what will happen. Hear, and see; but be silent. --

[Exit TUKELY.
SOPHIA. A severe Injunction, indeed, Ladies -- But I must to my Post.

[Exit. SOP.
Widow DAMPLY. If he is a Villain, I can never hold!


Lady PEWIT. I shall tear his Eyes out.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. For my Part, if I was unmarried, I should not think him worth
my Anger.


ARABELLA. But as you are, Madam --


Mrs. DOTTEREL. I understand your Insinuations, Miss Bell; but my Character and
Conduct need no Justification.


ARABELLA. I beg Pardon, Madam; I intended no Offense. -- But haste to your
Posts, Ladies; the Enemy's at Hand.

[They retire behind the Trees.
Enter TUKELY and DAFFODIL. TUKELY. In a Woman's Voice.] For Heaven's Sake, let
(...) be cautious -- I am sure I heard a Noise.


DAFFODIL. 'Twas nothing but your Fear, my Angel! -- don't be alarmed -- There
can be no Danger, while we have Love and Darkness to befriend us.


TUKELY. Bless me, how my Heart beats!


DAFFODIL. Poor Soul! what a Fright it is in! -- You must not give Way to these
Alarms -- Were you as well convinced of my Honor, as I am of your Charms, you
would have nothing to fear --

[Squeezes her Hand.
ARABELLA. Upon my Word! --

[Aside.
Widow DAMPLY. So, so, so.

[Aside.
TUKELY. Hold, Sir, you must take no Liberties -- But, if you have the least
Feeling for an unhappy Woman, urged by her Passion to this imprudent Step,
assist me -- forgive me -- let me go.


DAFFODIL. Can you doubt my Honor? Can you doubt my Love? What Assurances can
I give you to abate your Fears?


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Very slender Ones, I can assure her.

[Aside.
TUKELY. I deserve to suffer all I feel -- For what, but the most blinded
Passion, could induce me to declare myself to one, whose Amors and
Infidelities are the common Topic of Conversation.


DAFFODIL. Flattering Creature! [Aside.] -- May I never know your dear Name,
see your charming Face, touch your soft Hand, or hear your sweet Voice, if I am
not more sincere in my Affection for this little Finger, than for all the Sex
besides.

[The Ladies seem astonished.
TUKELY. Except the Widow Damply --


DAFFODIL. She! -- Do you know her, Madam;


TUKELY. I have not that Honor --


DAFFODIL. I thought so -- Did you never see her, Madam, nodling and gogling in
her Old-fashioned heavy Chariot, drawn by a pair of lean hackney Horses, with a
fat Blackamoor Footman behind, in a scanty Livery, Red greasy Stockings, and a
dirty Turban?

[The Widow seems disordered.
TUKELY. All which may be only a Foil to her Beauty.

[Sighs.
DAFFODIL. Beauty! Don't sigh, Madam; she is past Forty, wears a Wig, and has
lost two of her fore Teeth. -- And then, she has so long a Beard upon her upper
Lip, and takes so much Spanish Snuff, that she looks, for all the World, like
the Great Mogul in Petticoats; ha, ha, --


Widow DAMPLY. What Falsehood and Ingratitude!

[Aside.
TUKELY. Could I descend to the Slander of the Town, there is a married Lady --


DAFFODIL. Poor Mrs. Dotterel, you mean --


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Why am I to be mentioned! -- I have nothing to do --


Widow DAMPLY. Nay, nay; you must have your Share of the Panegyric.


TUKELY. She is young, and has Wit.


DAFFODIL. She Is an Idiot, Madam; and as Fools are generally loving, she has
forgot all her Obligations to old Mr. Dotterel, who married her without a
Petticoat; and now seizes upon every young Fellow she can lay her Hands upon;
she has spoiled me three Suits of Clothes, with tearing the Flaps and Sleeves.
-- Ha, ha, ha.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. Monster of Iniquity! --


DAFFODIL. She has even stormed me in my own House; but with all my Faults,
Madam, you will never find me over-fond of Age, or Ignorance.


Widow DAMPLY. I could tear him to Pieces. --


Mrs. DOTTEREL. I will tear him to Pieces.


ARABELLA. Be quiet -- and we'll all tear him to Pieces.


TUKELY. He has swallowed the Hook, and cannot escape.

[Aside.
DAFFODIL. What do you say, Madam?


TUKELY. I am only sighing, Sir.


DAFFODIL. Fond Creature! [Aside.] I know there are a thousand Stories about
me: You have heard too of Lady Fanny Pewit, I suppose? Don't be alarmed.


TUKELY. I cannot help it, Sir. She is a fine Woman, and Woman of Quality.


DAFFODIL. A fine Woman, perhaps, for a Woman of Quality -- but she is an
absolute old Maid, Madam, almost as thick as she is long -- middle-aged, homely
and wanton! That Is her Character.


Lady PEWIT. Then there is no Sincerity in Man.

[Going.
ARABELLA. Positively, you shall not stir.


DAFFODIL. Upon my Soul, I pity the poor Creature! -- She is now upon her last
Legs. -- If she does not run away with some foolish Gentleman this Winter --
She Will return into the Country, and marry her Footman. -- Ha, ha, ha.


Lady PEWIT. My Footman shall break his Bones, I can tell him that.


DAFFODIL. Hush, Madam! I protest, I thought I heard a Voice -- I wonder they
don't come.

[Aside.
TUKELY. 'Twas only I, Mr. Daffodil -- I was murmuring to you.

[Sighs.
DAFFODIL. Pretty Murmurer! -- Egad, if they don't come soon, the Lady will
grow fond.

[Aside.
TUKELY. But among your Conquests, Mr. Daffodil, you forget Miss Sophy
Sprightly.


DAFFODIL. And her Cousin Arabella. -- I was coming to 'em; poor, silly,
good-natured, loving Fools; -- I made my Addresses to one through Pique, and the
other for Pity -- That was all.


TUKELY. O, that I could believe you.


DAFFODIL. Don't be uneasy, I Will tell you how it was, Madam -- You must know,
there is a silly, self-sufficient Fellow, one Tukely --


TUKELY. So, so, [Aside.] I know him a little.


DAFFODIL. I am sorry for it -- The less you know of him the better; the Fellow
pretended to look fierce at me, for which I resolved to have his Mistress: So I
threw in my Line, and without much Trouble, hooked her. Her poor Cousin too,
nibbled at the Bait, and was caught. -- So I have had my Revenge upon Tukely,
and now I shall willingly resign poor Sophy, and throw him in her Cousin, for a
Make-Weight. -- Ha, ha, ha!


Lady PEWIT. This is some Comfort at least.


ARABELLA. Your Ladyship is better than you was.

[Noise without.
TUKELY. I vow I hear a Noise. -- What shall we do? It comes this Way.


DAFFODIL. They cannot see us, my Dear. -- I wish my Friends would come.
[Aside.] Don't whisper or breath.


Enter SOPHIA, in a Surtout, and slouch'd Hat. SOPHIA. If I could but catch her
at her Pranks -- she certainly must be this Way -- for the Chair is waiting at
the End of Rosamond's Pond -- I have thrown one of her Chairmen into it -- and
if I could but catch her --


TUKELY. O, Sir! My Passion has undone me -- I am discovered; it is my Husband,
Sir George, and he is looking for me --


DAFFODIL. The Devil it is! Why then, Madam, the best Way will be for you to go
to him -- and let me sneak off the other Way.


TUKELY. Go to him, Sir! What can I say to him?


DAFFODIL. Any Thing, Madam -- say you had the Vapors, and wanted Air.


TUKELY. Lord, Sir! -- he is the most passionate of Mortals; and I am afraid is
in Liquor too -- and then he is mad.


SOPHIA. If I could but catch her --

[Looking about.
DAFFODIL. For your Sake, Madam, I Will make the best of my Way Home --

[Going.
TUKELY. What! would you leave me to the Fury of an enraged Husband! -- Is that
your Affection.

[Holds him.
SOPHIA. If I could but catch her -- Ha! what is that? I saw something move in
the Dark -- the Point of my Sword shall tickle it out, whatever it is.

[Draws, and goes toward 'em.
TUKELY. For Heaven's Sake draw, and fight him, while I make my Escape.


DAFFODIL. Fight him! -- 'twou'd be cowardly to fight in the Dark, and with a
drunken Man -- I Will call the Sentery.


TUKELY. And expose us to the World?


DAFFODIL. I would to Heaven we were [Aside] -- [He comes forward.] Let me go,
Madam, you pinch me to the Bone.


TUKELY. He will not know us -- I have my Masque on.


LADIES. Ha! ha! ha!


SOPHIA. What, is the Devil and his Imps playing at Blindman's Buff? -- Ay, ay,
here he is, indeed -- Satan himself, dressed like a fine Gentleman -- Come, Mr.
Devil, out with your Pitch-fork, and let us take a Thrust or two.


DAFFODIL. You mistake me, Sir, I am not the Person -- indeed, I am not -- I
know nothing of your Wife, Sir George -- and if you know how little I care for
the whole Sex, you would not be so furious with an innocent Man.


SOPHIA. Who are you then? -- And what are you doing with that Blackamoor Lady
there -- dancing a Saraband with a Pair of Castanets? Speak, Sir!


DAFFODIL. Pray forbear, Sir; here is Company coming that will satisfy you in
every Thing -- Hallo, hallo -- Here, here, here; [Hallo's faintly] my Lord, my
my Lord -- Spinner, Dizzy -- Hallo!


Enter Lord RACKET, Sir TAN-TIVY, SPINNER, and DIZZY, with Torches. Lord
RACKET. What Is the Matter here? -- Who calls for Help?


DAFFODIL. [Running to 'em with his Sword drawn] O, my Friends, I have been
wishing for you this half Hour. I have been set upon by a dozen Fellows -- They
have all made their Escape, but this -- My Arm is quite dead -- I have been at
Cart and Tierce with 'em all, for near a Quarter of an Hour.


SOPHIA. In Buckram, my Lord! -- He was got with my Property here, and I would
have chastis'd him for it, if your Coming had not prevented it.


DAFFODIL. Let us throw the Rascal into Rosamond's Pond.


Lord RACKET. Come Sir, can you swim?

[All going up. TUKELY snatches SOPHIA's Sword, and she runs behind him.
TUKELY. I Will defend you, my Dear -- What, would you murder a Man, and lie with
his Wife too? -- Oh! you are a wicked Gentleman, Mr. Daffodil.

[Attacks DAFF.
DAFFODIL. Why, the Devil's in the Woman, I think.

[All the Ladies advance from behind.
LADIES. Ha, ha, ha! your humble Servant, Mr. Daffodil -- Ha, ha, ha.

[Courtsying.
DAFFODIL. This is all Enchantment!


Lady PEWIT. No, Sir, the Enchantment is broke -- and the old Maid, Sir, homely
and wanton, before she retires into the Country, has the Satisfaction of
knowing that the agreeable Mr. Daffodil is a much more contemptible Mortal,
than the Footman which his Goodness has been pleased to marry her to.


LADIES. Ha, ha, ha.


Widow DAMPLY. Would Mr. Daffodil please to have a Pinch of Spanish Snuff, out
of the Great Mogul's Box? It Is the best Thing in the World for low Spirits.

[Offers her Box.
LADIES. Ha, ha, ha.


Mrs. DOTTEREL. If a Fool may not be permitted to speak, Mr. Daffodil, let her
at least be permitted to laugh at so fine a Gentleman -- Ha, ha, ha.


ARABELLA. Were you as sensible of Shame, as you are of Fear, the Sight of me,
whom you loved for Pity, would be Revenge sufficient -- But I can forgive your
Baseness to me, much easier than I can myself, for my Behavior to this happy
Couple.


DAFFODIL. Who the Devil are they?


ARABELLA. The Marquess and Marchioness of Macaroni, Ladies -- Ha ha.


SOPHIA. Ha! Mio Carrissimo Amico, il Signior Daffodillo!


DAFFODIL. How! Tukely and Sophia! -- If I don't wake soon, I shall wish never
to wake again.


SOPHIA. Who bids fairest now for Rosamond's Pond?


Lord RACKET. What, in the Name of Wonder, is all this Business? I don't
understand it.


DIZZY. Nor I neither; but it is very drole, faith.


TUKELY. The Mystery will clear in a Moment.


DAFFODIL. Don't give yourself any Trouble, Mr. Tukely, Things are pretty clear
as they are -- The Night's cool, and my Cousin Dizzy, here, is an Invalid -- If
you please, another Time, when there is less Company, [Ladies laugh] -- The
Ladies are pleased to be merry, and you are pleased to be a little angry; and
so, for the Sake of Tranquillity -- I Will go to the Opera.

[DAFF. sneaking out by Degrees.
Lord RACKET. This is a fine blow-up, indeed! Ladies, your humble Servant --
Hallo! Daffodil.

[Exit Lord RACK.
DIZZY. I Will lay you a Hundred, that my Cousin never intrigues again -- George!
George! Don't run -- hugh, hugh --

[Exit DIZ.
TUKELY. As my Satisfaction is complete, I have none to ask of Mr. Daffodil. I
forgive his Behavior to me, as it has hastened and confirmed my Happiness
here; [to Sophia.] -- But as a Friend to you, Ladies, I shall insist upon his
making you ample Satisfaction -- However, this Benefit will arise, that you
will hereafter equally detest and shun these Destroyers of your Reputation --

In You Coquettry is a Loss of Fame;
But in Our Sex, it is that detested Name,
That marks the Want of Manhood, Virtue, Sense, and Shame.

FINIS.
