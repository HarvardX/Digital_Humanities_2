High Life Below Stairs.
ACT I. SCENE, An apartment in Freeman's house.
Freeman and Lovel entering. Freeman. A Country boy! ha, ha, ha! How long has
this scheme been in your head?


Lov. Some time. -- I am now convinced of what you have often been hinting to
me, that I am confoundedly cheated by my servants.


Free. Oh, are you satisfied at last, Mr. Lovel? I always told you, that there
is not a worse set of servants in the parish of St. James's than in your
kitchen.


Lov. It Is with some difficulty I believe it now, Mr. Freeman; though, I must
own, my expenses often make me stare. -- Phillip, I am sure* is an honest
fellow; and I will swear for my blacks -- If there is a rogue among my folks,
it is that surly dog Tom.


Free. You are mistaken in every one. Phillip is an hyprocritical rascal; Tom
has a good deal of surly honesty about him; and for your blacks, they are as
bad as your whites.


Lov. Prithee, Freeman, how came you to be so well acquainted with my people?
None of the wenches are handsome enough to move the affections of a middle-aged
gentleman as you are -- ha, ha, ha!


Free. You are a young man, Mr. Lovel, and take a pride in a number of idle
unnecessary servants, who are the plague and reproach of this kingdom.


Lov. Charles you are an old-fashioned fellow. Servants a plague and reproach!
ha, ha, ha! I would have forty more, if my house would hold them. -- Why, man,
in Jamaica, before I was ten years old, I had a hundred blacks kissing my feet
every day.


Free. You gentry of the western isles are high-metled ones, and love pomp and
parade. I have seen it delight your soul, when the people in the street have
stared at your equipage; especially if they wispered loud enough to be heard,
"That is squire Lovel, the great West-Indian" -- ha, ha, ha!


Lov. I should be sorry if we were splenetic as you northern islanders, who are
devoured with melancholy and fog -- ha, ha, ha! No, Sir, we are children of the
sun, and are born to diffuse the bounteous favor which our noble parent is
pleased to bestow on us.


Free. I wish you had more of your noble parent's regularity, and less of his
fire. As it is you consume so fast, that not one in twenty of you live to be
fifty years old.


Lov. But in that fifty we live two hundred, my dear; mark that -- But (...)
business -- I am resolved upon my frolic -- I will know whether my servants are
rogues or not. If they are, I Will bastmado the rascals; if not, I think I ought
to pay for my impertinence. Pray tell me, is not your Robert acquainted with my
people? Perhaps he may give a little light into the thing.


Free. To tell you the truth, Mr. Lovel, your servants are so abandoned, that I
have forbid him your house. However, if you have a mind to ask him any
question, he shall be forthcoming.


Lov. Let us have him.


Free. You shall: But it is an hundred to one if you get any thing out of him;
for though he is a very honest fellow, yet he is so much of a servant, that
he^ll never tell any thing to the disadvantage of another. -- Who waits? --
[Enter servant.] Send Robert to me. [Exit servant.] And what was it determined
you upon this project at last?


Lov. This letter. It is an anonymous one, and so ought not to be regarded; but
it has something honest in it, and put me upon satisfying my curiosity -- Read
it.


[Gives the letter. Free. I should know something of this hand -- [Reads. To
Peregrine Lovel, Esquire Please your honor,
I take the liberty to acquaint your honor, that you are sadly cheated by your
servants -- Your honor will find it as I say -- I am not willing to be known;
whereof, if I am, it may bring one into trouble.

So no more from your honor's Servant to command.


-- Odd and honest! Well -- and now what are the steps you intend to take?


Lov. I shall immediately apply to my friend the manager for a disguise. --
Under the form of a gawky country boy, I will be an eyewitness of my servants
behavior. You must assist me Mr. Freeman.


Free. As how, Mr. Lovel?


Lov. My plan is this -- I gave it out that I was going to my borough in
Devonshire; and yesterday set out with my servant in great form, and lay at
Basingstoke.


Free. Well?


Lov. I ordered the fellow to make the best of his way down into the country,
and told him that I would follow him; instead of that. I turned back, and am
just come to town: -- Ecce fignum!

[Points to his boots.
Free. It is now one o'clock.


Lov. This very afternoon I shall pay my people a visit.


Free. How will you get in?


Lov. When I am properly habited, you shall get me introduced to Philip as one
of your ^enants sons, who wants to be made a good servant of.


Free. They will certainly discover you.


Lov. Never fear; I Will be so countryfied, that you shall not know me. As they
are thoroughly persuaded I am many miles off, they will be more easily imposed on.
Ten to one but they begin to celebrate my departure with a drinking bout, if
they are what you describe them.


Free. Shall you be able to play your part?


Lov. I am surprised, Mr. Freeman, that you, who have known me from my infancy,
should not remember my abilities in that way. -- How I played Daniel in the
Conscious Lovers at school, and afterward arrived at the distinguished
character of the mighty Mr. Scrub.

[Mimickin.
Free. Ha, ha, ha! that is very well -- Enough -- Here is Robert.


Enter Robert. Rob. Your honor ordered me to wait on you.


Free. I did, Robert. -- Robert --


Rob. Sir --


Free. Come here. You know, Robert, I have a good opinion of your integrity.


Rob. I have always endeavored that your honor should.


Free. Pray, have not you some acquaintance among Mr. Lovel's people?


Rob. A little, please your honor.


Free. How do they behave? -- We have nobody but friends -- you may speak out.


Lov. Ay, Robert, speak out.


Rob. I hope your honors will not insist on my saying any thing in an adair of
this kind.


Lov. Oh, but we do insist -- If you know any thing --


Rob. Sir, I am but a servant myself; and it would not become me to speak ill
of a brother-servant.


Free. Psha! this is false honesty -- speak out.


Rob. Don't oblige me, good Sir. Consider, Sir, a servant's bread depends upon
his carackter.


Lov. But if a servant uses me ill --


Rob. Alas, Sir! what is one man's poison is another man's meat.


Free. You see how they trim for one another.


Rob. Service, Sir, is no inheritance. -- A servant that is not approved in one
place, may give satisfaction in another. Every body must live, your honor.


Lov. I like your heartiness as well as your caution; but in my case, it is
necessary that I should know the truth.


Rob. The truth, Sir, is not to be spoken at all times: it may bring one into
trouble, whereof if --


Free. [Musing.] Pray, Mr. Lovel, let me see that letter again. [Lovel gives
the letter.] -- Aye -- It must be so -- Robert.


Rob. Sir.


Free. Do you know any thing of this letter?


Rob. Letter, your honor?


Free. Yes, letter.


Rob. I have seen the hand before.


Lov. He blushes.


Free. I ask you if you were concerned in writing this letter? You never told
me a lie yet, and I expect the truth from you now


Rob. Pray, your honor, don't ask me.


Free. Did you write it? -- Answer me.


Rob. I cannot deny it.

[Bowing.]
Lov. What induced you to do it?


Rob. I will tell the truth. I have seen such waste and extravagance, and riot
and drunkenness, in your kitchen, Sir, that as my master's friend, I could not
help discovering it to you.


Lov. Go on.


Rob. I am sorry to say it to your honor, but your honor is not only imposed
on, but laughed at by all your servants especially by Philip, who is a very bad
man.


Lov. Philip? An ungrateful dog! well?


Rob. I could not presume to speak to your honor; and therefore I resolved,
though but a poor scribe, to write your honor a letter.


Lov. Robert, I am greatly indebted to you -- Here --


[Offers money. Rob. On any other account than this, I should be proud to
receive your honor's bounty; but now I beg to be excused.


[Refuses the money. Lov. Thou have a noble heart, Robert, and I Will not forget
you. Freeman, he must be in the secret. Wait your master's orders.


Rob. I will, your honor.


[Exit Free. Well Sir, are you convinced now?


Lov. Convinced? Yes; and I Will be among the scoundrels before night. You or
Robert must contrive some way or other to get me introduced to Philip as one of
your cottagers boys out of Essex.


Free. Ha, ha! You Will make a fine figure.


Lov. They shall make a fine figure. -- It must be done this afternoon: -- Walk
with me across the park, and I Will tell you the whole. -- My name shall be
Jemmy; and I am come to be a gentleman's servant -- and will do my best, and
hope to get a good carackter.

[Mimicking.
Free. But what will you do if you find them rascals?


Lov. Discover myself, and blow them all to the devil. -- Come along.


Free. Ha, ha, ha! -- Bravo -- Jemmy -- Bravo, ha, ha!


[Exeunt. SCENE, The Park. Duke's Servant. What wretches are ordinary servants,
that go on in the same vulgar track every day! eating, working, and sleeping,
-- But we, who have the honor to serve the nobility, are of another species.
We are above the common forms -- have servants to wait upon us, and are are as
lazy and luxurious as our masters. Ha! my dear sir Harry.

Enter sir Harry's Servant. How have you done these thousand years?

Sir Har. My lord duke! your grace's most obedient servant.


Duke. Well, baronet and where have you been?


Sir Har. At Newmarket my lord. We have had devilish fine sport.


Duke. And a good appearance, I hear. Pox take it, I should have been there;
but our old Duchess died, and we were obliged to keep house, for the decency
of the thing.


Sir Har. I picked up fifteen pieces.


Duke. Psha! a trifle!


Sir Har. The viscount's people, have been bloodily taken in this meeting.


Duke. Credit me, baronet, they knew nothing of the turf.


Sir Har. I assure you, my lord, they lost every match; for Crab was beat
hollow, Caresess threw his rider, and miss Slammerkin had the distemper.


Duke. Ha, ha, ha! I Am glad on it. Taste this snuff, sir Harry:

[Offers his box.
Sir Har. It Is good rappee.


Duke. Right Strasburgh, I assure you; and of my own importing.


Sir Har. Aye!


Duke. The city-people adulterate it so confoundedly that I always import my
own snuff -- I wish my lord would do the same; but he is so indolent -- When
did you see the girls? I saw lady Bab this morning; but, before Gad, whether it
be love or reading, she looked as pale as a penitent.


Sir Har. I have just had this card from Lovel's people. -- [Reads.] "Philip
and Mrs Kitty present their compliments to Sir Harry, and desire the honor of
his company this evening, to be of a small party, and eat a bit of supper."


Duke. I have the same invitation. -- Their master it seems is gone to his
borough.


Sir Har. You Will be with us, my lord? -- Philip's a blood.


Duke. A buck of the first head. I Will tell you a secret, -- he is going to be
married.


Sir Har. To whom?


Duke. To Kitty.


Sir Har. No!


Duke. Yes, he is; and I intend to cuckold him.


Sir Har. Then we may depend upon your grace for certain ha, ha, ha!


Duke. If our house breaks up in a tolerable time, I Will be with you. -- Have
you any thing for us?


Sir Har. Yes a little bit of poetry. -- I must be at the Cocoa tree till eight.


Duke. Heigh-ho! I am quite out of spirits -- I had a damned debauch last
night, baronet. -- Lord Francis, Bob the bishop, and I, tipped off four bottles
of Burgundy a piece. -- Ha! there are two fine girls coming! -- Faith -- lady
Bab -- aye, and lady Charlotte.

[Takes out his glass.
Sir Har. We'll not join them.


Duke. O yes -- Bab is a fine wench, notwithstanding her complexion; though I
should be glad she would keep her teeth cleaner. -- Your English women are
damned negligent about their teeth. -- How is your Charlotte in that particular?


Sir Har. My Charlotte!


Duke. Ay the world says you are to have her.


Sir Har. I own I did keep her company; but we are off, my lord.


Duke. How so?


Sir Har. Between you and me, she has a plaguey thick pair of legs.


Duke. Oh! damn it that is insufferable.


Sir Har. Besides, she is a fool, and missed her opportunity with the old
countess.


Duke. I am afraid baronet, you love money. Rot it, I never save a shilling.
Indeed I am sure of a place in the excise. Lady Charlottee is to be of the
party to night; how do you manage that?


Sir Har. Why, we do meet at a third place; are very civil, and look queer, and
laugh, and abuse one another, and all that.


Duke. A-la-mode, ha! Here they are.


Sir Har. Let us retire.


[They retire. Enter lady Bab's maid and lady Charlotte's maid. L. Bab. Oh fie,
lady Charlotte! you are quite indelicate; I am sorry for your taste.


L. Char. Well I say it again, I love Vauxhall.


L. Bab. O my stars! Why there is nobody there but filthy citizens.


L. Char. We were in hopes the raising the price would have kept them out, ha,
ha, ha!


L. Bab. Ha, ha, ha! Runelow for my money.


L. Char. Now you talk of Runelow, when did you see the colonel lady Bab!


L. Bab. The colonel! I hate the fellow. He has had the assurance to talk of a
creature in Glocestershire before my face.


L. Char. He is a pretty man for all that, soldiers you know have their
mistresses every where.


L. Bab. I despise him. How goes on your affair with the baron^t?


L. Char. The baronet is a stupid wretch, and I shall have nothing to say to
him. You are to be at Lovel's to night lady Bab,


L. Bab. Unless I alter my mind. I don't admire visiting these commoners, lady
Charlotte.


L. Char. Oh, but Mrs Kitty has taste.


L. Bab. She affects it.


L. Char. The duke is fond of her, and he has judgment.


L. Bab. The duke might show his judgment much better.

[Holding up her head.
L. Char. There he is, and the baronet too. Take no notice of them. We'll rally
them bye-and-bye.


L. Bab. Dull souls! Let us set up a loud laugh, and leave em.


L. Char. Aye, let us be gone; for the common people do so stare at us we shall
certainly be mobb'd.


Both. Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!


[Exeunt. Duke and Sir Harry come forward. Duke. They certainly saw us, and are
gone off laughing at us. I must follow.


Sir Har. No, no.


Duke. I must I must have a party of raillery with them, a bon mot, or so. Sir
Harry you will excuse me adien. I Will be with you in the evening, if possible --
Though, bark ye! there is a bill depending in our house, which the ministry
make a point of our attending; and so you know, mum! we must mind the stops of
the great fiddle. Adieu.


[Exit. Sir Har. What a coxcomb this is! and the fellow cannot read. It was but
the other day that he was cow boy in the country, then was bound 'prentice to a
periwig maker, got into my lord duke's family, and now sets up for a fine
gentleman. O tempora! O mores!


Re-enter Duke's servant Duke. Sir Harry, prithee what are we to do at Lovell's
when we come there;


Sir Har. We shall have the fiddles, I suppose.


Duke. The fiddles! I have done with dancing ever since the last sit of the
gout. I Will tell you what, my dear boy, I possitively cannot be with them,
unless we have a little --

[Makes a motion as if with the dice box.
Sir Har. Fie, my lord duke.


Duke. Look you, baronet, I insist on it. Who the devil of any fashion can
possibly spend an evening without it? bu^ I shall loose the girls, how grave
you look, ha, ha, ha, Well let there be fiddles.


Sir Har. But, my dear lord, I shall be quite miserable without you.


Duke. Well, I will not be particular; I Will do as the rest do. Tol, lol, lol.


[Exit singing and dancing. Sir Har. [solus.] He had the assurance, last
winter, to court a tradesman's daughter in the city, with two thousand pounds
to her fortune, and got me to write his love letters. He pretended to be an
ensign in a marching regiment, so wheedled the old folks into consent, and
would have carried the girl off, but was unluckily prevented by the washerwoman
who happened to be his first cousin.


Enter Philip. Mr. Philip your servant.

Phil. You are welcome to England, Sir Harry, I hope you received the care, and
will do us the honor of your company. My master is gone into Devonshire. We'll
have a roaring night


Sir Har. I Will certainly wait on you.


Phil. The girls will be with us.


Sir Har. Is this a wedding supper, Phillip.


Phil. What do you mean, sir Harry.


Sir Har. The duke tells me so.


Phil. The duke's a fool.


Sir Har. Take care what you say; his grace is a bruiser.


Phil. I am a pupil of the same academy, and not afraid of him, I assure you.
Sir Harry we'll have a noble batch I have such wine for you!


Sir Har. I am your man, Phil.


Phil. Egad the cellar shall bleed: I have some Burgundy that is fit for an
emperor my master would have given his ears for some of it the other day, to
treat my lord what do you call him with. But I told him it was all gone ha!
Charity begins at home ha; Odso, here is Mr. Freeman, my masters intimate
friend; he is a dry one. Don't let us be seen together he will suspect something.


Sir Har. I am gone.


Phil. Away, away; remember, Burgundy is the word.


Sir Har. Right long corks! ha, Phil? [Mimicks the drawing of a cork.] Yours.


Phil. Now for a cast of my office a starch phiz, a canting phrase and as many
lies as necessary hem!


Enter Freeman. Free. Oh, Philip! how do you do, Philip? You have lost your
master, I find.


Phil. It is a loss, indeed, sir, so good a gentleman* He must be nearly got
into Devonshire by this time. Sir, your servant.


[Going. Free. Why in such a hurry, Philip?


Phil. I shall leave the house as little as possible, now his honor is away.


Free. You are in the right, Philip.


Phil Servants at such times are too apt to be negligent and extravagant, sir.


Free. True; the master's absence is the time to try a good servant in.


Phil. It is so, sir, sir, your servant.

[Going.
Free. Oh, Mr, Philip! pray stay; you must do me a piece of service.


Phil. You command me sir


[Bowing. Free. I look upon you, Philip, as one of the best behaved, most
sensible, completest -- [Philip bows.] rascals in the world.


[Aside. Phil. Your honor is pleased to compliment.


Free. There is a tenant of mine in Essex, a very honest man Poor fellow, he
has a great number of children and they have sent me one of 'em, a tall gawky
boy, to make a servant of; but my folks say they can do nothing with him.


Phil. Let me have him, sir,


Free. In truth he is an unlik'd cub.


Phil. I will lick him into something. I warrant you, sir. Now my master is
absent, I shall have a good deal of time upon my hands; and I hate to be idle,
sir in two months I Will engage to finish him.


Free. I don't doubt it.

[Aside.
Phil. I have twenty pupils in the parish of St. James's and for a table, or a
side-board, or behind a equipage, or in the delivery of a message, or any thing.


Free. What have you for entrance?


Phil. I always leave it to gentlemen's generosity.


Free. Here is a guinea. I beg he may be taken care of.


Phil. That he shall, I promise you [Aside.] Your honor knows me.


Free. Thoroughly.


[Aside. Phil. When can I see him, sir?


Free. Now; directly call at my my house, and take him in your hand.


Phil. Sir, I will be with you in a minute. I will but step into the market to
let the next tradesmen know they must not trust any of our servants, now they
are at board wages Humph!


Free. How happy is Mr. Lovel in so excellent a servant!


[Exit. Phil. Ha; ha, ha! This is one of my master's prudent friends, who dines
with him three times a week, and thinks he is mighty generous in giving me five
guineas at Christmas. Damn all such sheaking scoundrels, I say.


[Exit. SCENE, The Servants Hall in Lovell's House. Kingston and Coachman drunk
and sleepy. [A knocking at the door. King. Somebody knocks coachy, go, go to
the door coachy!


Coach. I Will not go do you go, you black dog.


King. Devil shall fetch me if I go.


[Knocking. Coach. Why then let him stay I Will not go damme. Ay, knock the door
down and let yourself in.


[Knocking. King. Ay, ay, knock again, knock again.


Coach. Master is gone into Devonshire, so he cannot be there So I Will go to
sleep.


King. So will I, I Will go to sleep too.


Coach. You lie devil, you shall not go to sleep till I am asleep, I am king of
the kitchen.


King. No, You are not king; but when you are drunk, you are sulky as hell.
Here is cooky coming she is king and queen too.


Enter Cook. Cook. Somebody has knocked at the door twenty times, and nobody
hears, Why, coachman, Kingston, ye drunken bears! why don't one of you go to
the door?


Coach. You go, cook, you go.


Cook. Hang me if I go.


King. Yes, yes, cooky, go, Mollsy, Pollsy, go.


Cook. Out, you black toad. It is none of my business, and go I will not.

[Sits down.
Enter Philip with Lovel disguised. Phil. I might have stayed at the door all
night, as the little man in the play says, if I had not had the key of the door
in my pocket. What is come to you all?


Cook, There is John coachman and Kingston as drunk as two bears.


Phil. Ah, ha, my lads! what finished already? These are the very best of
servants. Poor fellows; I suppose they have been drinking their master's good
journey ha, ha!


Lov. No doubt on it.

[Aside.
Phil. Yo ho! get to bed, you dogs, and sleep yourselves sober, that you may be
able to get drunk again bye-and-bye. They are as fast as a church Jemmy.


Lov. Anon.


Phil. Do you love drinking?


Lov. Yes I loves ale.


Phil. You dog you shall swim in Burgundy.


Lov. Burgundy! what is that?


Phil. Cook, wake those honest gentlemen, and see them to bed


Cook. It is impossible to wake them.


Lov. I think I could wake 'em sir, if I might, heh


Phil. Do, Jemmy, wake 'em, ha, ha, ha!


Lov. Hip, Mr. Coachman.

[Gives him a great slap on the face.
Coach. Oh! oh! What! Zounds! Oh! damn you.


Lov. What blackey, blackey!

[Pulls him by the nose.
King. Oh, oh! What now, Curse you! Oh


Lov. Ha, ha, ha,


Phil. Ha, ha, ha, -- Well done, Jemmy. Cook see those gentry to bed.


Cook. Marry come up, I say so too; not I indeed.


Coach. She shall not see us to bed. We'll see ourselves to bed.


King. We got drunk together, and we'll go to bed together,


[Exeunt reeling. Phil. You see how we live, boy.


Lov. Yes, I sees how you live.


Phil, Let the supper be elegant, cook.


Cook. Who pays for it?


Phil. My master to be sure; who else? ha, ha, ha, He is rich enough, I hope,
ha, ha, ha,


Lov. Humph?


Phil. Each of us must take a part, and sink it in our next weekly bills; that
is the way.


Lov. Soh!


[Aside. Cook. Prithee, Phillip, what boy is this?


Phil. A boy of Freeman's recommending.


Lov. Yes, I Am 'squire Freeman's boy -- heh --


Cook. Freeman is a stingy bound, and you may tell him I say so. He dines here
three times a week, and I never saw the color of his money yet.


Lov. Ha, ha, ha! that is good -- Freeman shall have it

[Aside.
Cook. I must step to the tallow-chandler's to dispose of some of my
perquisites; and then I Will set about supper.


Phil. Well said cook, that is right; the perquisite is the thing, cook.


Cook. Cloe, Cloe! where are you, Cloe? --

[Calls.
Enter Cloe. Cloe. Yes, mistress --

Kit. Who have we here?


[Lovel bows. Phil. A boy of Freeman's; a poor, silly fool --

[Aside.
Lov. Thank you


Phil. I intend the entertainment this evening as a compliment to you, Kitty.


Kit. I am your humble. Mr. Phillip.


Phil. But I beg I may see none of your airs, or hear any of our French
Gibberish with the duke.


Kit. Don't be jealous, Phil.

[Fawningly.
Phil. I intend, before our marriage, to settle something handsome upon you;
and with the five hunderd pounds which I have already saved in this extravagant
fellow's family --


Lov. A dog! [Aside] O la, la! what! have you five hundred pounds?


Phil. Peace, blockhead.


Kit. I Will tell you what you shall do, Phil.

is so course, and so carotty.


Lov. All my brothers be red in the pole.


[P^illip and Kitty laugh. Kit. There, now you are something like Come. Phillip,

[Loud.
[Imitating. Phil. Admirable! the knave has a good ear Now, Sir tell me a lie.


Lov. O la! I never told a lie in all my life.


Phil. Then it is high time you should begin now; what is a servant good for
that cannot tell a lie?


Kit. And stand in it Now I Will lecture him [Takes out a book.] This is "The
servant's guide to wealth, by Tymothy Shouldernot, formerly servant to several
noblemen, and now an officer in the customs; necessary for all servants."

well. Come, Kitty, begin.

Kit. "At market never think it stealing
"To keep with tradesmen proper dealing?

Kit. To the groom,

"Never allow your master able
"To judge of matters in the stable:
"If he should roughly speak his mind,
"Or to dismiss you seems inclined,

Kit. To the coachman.
"If your good master on you doates,
"Never leave his house to serve a stranger;
"But pocket hay, and straw, and oats,
"And let the horses eat the manger.

Lov. Eat the manger! he, he, he!


Kit. I will not give you too much at a time Here, boy, take the book, and read it
every night and morning before you say your prayers.


Phil. Ha, ha, ha! very good; but now for business.


Kit. Right I Will go and get one of the damask tablecloaths. and some napkins;

let 'em come as soon as they will, we shall be ready for 'em.


Phil. It Is all very well, but --


Kit. But what?


Phil. Why, I wish we could get that snarling cur, Tom, to make one.


Kit. What is the matter with him?


Phil. I don't know he his a queer son of a --


Kit. Oh, I know him; he is one of your sneaking, half bred fellows, that
prefers his master's interest to his own.


Phil. Here he is.


Enter Tom. -- And why will not you make one tonight, Tom? Here Is cook and
coa^hman, and all of us*

Tom. I tell you again, I will not make one.


Phil. We shall have something that is good.


Tom. And make your matter pay for it.


Phil. I warrant, now you think yourself mighty honest, ha, ha, ha?


Tom. A little honester than you. I hope, and not brag neither.


Kit. Hark you, Mr. Honesty, don't be saucy.


Lov. This is worth listening to.

[Aside.
Tom. What, madam, you are afraid for your cully, are you?


Kit. Cully, sirrah, cully! Afraid, sirrah! afraid of what.

[Goes up to Tom.
Phil. Ay, Sir, afraid of what?

[Goes upon the other side.
Lov. Ay, Sir, afraid of what?

[Goes up too Tom
Tom. I value none of you. I know your tricks.


Phil. What do you know, sirrah?


Kit. Ay, what do you know?


Lov. Ay, Sir, what do you know?


Tom. I know that you are in see with every tradesman belonging to the house,
and that you Mr Clodpole, are in a fair way to be hanged.

[Strikes Lovel.
Phil. What do you strike the boy for?


Lov. It is an honest blow.

[Aside.
Tom. I Will strike him again. It Is such as you that bring a scandal upon as all.


Kit. Come, none of your impudence, Tom.


Tom. Egad, madam, the gentry may well complain, when they get such servants as
you in their houses. -- There Is your good friend, mother Barter, the old
clothes woman, the greatest thief in town, just now gone out with her apron
full of his honor's linen.


Kit. Well, Sir, and did you never ha?


Tom. No, never: -- I have lived with his honor four years and never took the
value of that [Snapping his fingers.] -- His honor is a prince gives noble
wages, and keeps noble company; and yet you two are not contented, but cheat
him wherever you can lay your fingers. Shame on you!


Lov. The fellow I thought a rogue, is the only honest servant in my house.

[Aside.
Kit. Out, you mealy-mouthed cur.


Phil. Well, go tell his honor, do -- ha, ha, ha!


Tom. I scorn that. Damn an informer! But yet I hope his honor will find you
two out one day or other that^s all.


[Ex Kit. this fellow must be taken care of.


Phil. I Will do his business for him, when his honor comes to town.

Phil. No, no; he will have his share bye-and-bye; come along.


Lov. Yes.


(Exeunt Phillip and Lovel. Kit. Indeed I thought your grace an age in coming.


Duke. Upon honor, our house is but this moment up; You have a damned vile
collection of pictures, I observe, above stairs, Kitty. -- Your 'squire has no
taste.


Kit. No taste? that is impossible, for he has laid out a vast deal of money.


Duke. There is not an original picture in the whole collection; Where could he
pick 'em up?


Kit. He employs three or four men to buy for him, and he always pays for
originals.


Duke Donnez moi votre eau de luce -- My head achs confoundedly -- ( She gives
a smelling bottle.) -- Kitty my dear I hear you are going to be married.


Kit. Pardonnez moi for that.

see you first.


Duke. At the play, Madamseile.


Kit. Your grace loves a play?


Duke. No, it is a dull, old-fashioned entertainment I hate it.


Kit. Well, give me a good tragedy.


Duke. It must not be a modern one then -- You are devilish handsome, Kate --
Kiss me

(Offers to kits her.
Enter Sir Harry's Servant. Sir Har. Oh oh! are you thereabouts, my lord duke?
That may do very well bye-and-bye; However, you will never find me behind hand.

(Offers to kiss her.
Duke. Stand of, you are a commoner -- Nothing under nobility approaches Kitty.


Sir Har. You are so devilish proud of your nobiliy; Now I think, we have more
true nobility than you -- Let me tell you Sir, a knight of the shire


Duke A knight of the shire! ha, ha, ha! a mighty honor, truly, to represent
all the fools in the county.


Kit. O Lud this is charming, to see two nobleman quarrel.


Sir Har. Why, any fool may be born to a title, but only a wise man can make
himself honorable.


Kit. Well said, Sir Harry, that is good morillity.


Duke. I hope you make some difference between hereditary honors and the
huzzas of a mob.


Kit. Very smart, my lord; Now, Sir Harry --


Sir Har. If you make use of your hereditary honor to screen you from debt.


Duke. Zounds, Sir, what do you mean by that?


Kit. Hold, hold! I shall have some fine old noble blood spilt here -- Have
done, Sir Harry;


Sir Har. Not I; Why, he is always valuing himself upon his upper house.


Duke. We have dignity.

But I got into my favorite author,


Duke. Yes, I found her ladyship at her studies this morning. Some wicked poem
--


L. Bab. O you wretch? I never read but one book.


Kit. What is your ladyship so fond of?


L. Bab. Shikspur. Did you never read Shikspur?


Kit. Shikspur! Shikspur! Who wrote it? No, I never read Shikspur.


L. Bab. Then you have an immense pleasure to come.


Kit. Well then, I Will read it over one afternoon or other. Here Is lady

[Scornfully.
Sir Har. Dear lady Charlotte*


Lady Char. No, sir; I have observed your coldness of late, and despise you. A
trumpery baronet?


Sir Har. I see how it is; nothing will satisfy you but nobility. That fly dog
the marquis.


L. Char. None of your reflections. Sir: The marquis is a person of honor, and
above enquiring after a lady's fortune, as you mean^y did.


Sir Har. I, I, madam? I scorn such a thing. I assure you madam. I never, that
is to say Egad. I am confounded My lord duke, what shall I say to lier? Pray
help me out.

Are only dependants, no better than we.
[Cho].Both high and low in this do agree,
It Is here fellow servant.
And there fellow servant,
And all ^ a livery.
See yonder fine spark in embroidery dressed,
Who bows to the great, and if they smile is blessed;
What is he, in faith, but a servant at best;
Cho. ^oth high, etc.
Nature made all alike, no distinction she craves:
So we laugh at the great world, its fools and its knavee,
For we are all servants, but they are all slaves.
Cho. Both high etc.
The fat shining glutton looks up to the shelf.
The wrinkled lean miser (...) down to his pelf.
And the curl pated beau is a slave to himself.
Cho. Both high, etc.
The gay sparkling belle, who the whole town alarm
And with eyes, lips, and neck, sets the (...) all in arms,
Is a vassal herself, a mere drudge to her charms.
Cho. Both h^gh, etc.
Then we'll drink like our betters, and laugh, sing and love,
And when sick of one place, to another we'll move;
For, with little and great, the best joy is to rove.
Cho. Both high and low in thus do agree,
That it is here fellow servant,
And there fellow servant,
And all in a livery.

my word.


Kit. Yes, indeed your honor, if it was the last word I had to speak.


Lov. Take up that bottle. ( Philip takes up a bottle with a ticket to it, and
is going off.) Bring it back. Do you usually entertain your company with Tokay
Monsieur?


Phil. I, Sir, treat with wine!


Lov. O yes, from humble port to imperial Tokay too. Yes I love^ Kokay.

(Mimicking himself.
Phil. How! Jemmy, my master!


Kit. Jemmy! the devil!


Phil. Your honor is at present in liquor but in the morning when your honor
is recovered I will set all to rights again.


Lov. ( Changing his countenan^^.) We'll set all to r^ghts now. There I am
sober at your service. What have you to say, Philip. ( Philip starts.) You may
well start. Go get out of my sight.


Duke. Sir I have not the honor to be known to you, but I have the honor to
serve his grace the duke of --


Lov. And the imprudence familiarly to assume his title. Your grace will give
me leave to tell you, that is the door and if you ever enter there again, I
assure you, my lord duke. I will break every bone in your grace's skin. Begone.


Duke. ( Aside.) Low bred fellows!


(Exit. Lov. I beg their ladyships pardon; perhaps they cannot go without
chairs ha ha, ha!


(...). Ha, ha, ha?


(Sir Harry steals off. L. Char. This comes of visiting commoners.


(Exit. L. Bab. They are downright Hottenpots.

(Exit
Phil. and Kit. I hope your honor will not take away our bread.


Lov. "Five hundred pounds will set you up in a chocolate house. You Will shine
in the (...) madam." I have been an eye witness of your roguery, extravagance,
and ingratitude.


Phil. add Kit. Oh, Sir good sir!


Lov. You madam, may stay here till to morrow morning. And there madam, is the
book you lent me, which I beg you will read "night and morning before you say
your prayers."


Kit. I am ruined and undone.


(Exit. Lov. But you Sir, for your villainy, and (what I hate worse) your
hypocrisy, shall not stay a minute longer in the house; and here comes an
honest man to show you the way but. Your keys, sir.


(Philip gives the key^. Enter Tom. Tom, I respect and value you. You are an
honest servant and shall never want encouragement. Be so good, Tom as to (...)
that gentleman out of my house (Points to Philip.) and then take charge of the
cellar and plate.

Tom. I thank your honor; but I would not rise on the ruin of a fellow servant.


Lov. No remonstrance Tom, it shall be as I say.


Phil. What a cursed fool have I been.


(Exeunt servants. Lov. Well Charles, I (...) thank you for my frolic -- it has
been a wholesome one to me. Have I done right?


Free. Entirely. No judge could have determined bett^^ As you punish the bad,
it was but justice to reward the good.


Lov. A faithful servant is a worthy character.


Free. But what an insufferable piece of assurance is it (...) some of these
fellows to affect and imitate their masters manner.


Lov. What manners must those be which they can imitate


Free. True.


Lov. If persons of rank would act up to their own standard it would be
impossible that their servants could ape them. But when they affect every thing
that is rid^culous, it will be in the power of any low creature to follow their
example.


FINIS.
