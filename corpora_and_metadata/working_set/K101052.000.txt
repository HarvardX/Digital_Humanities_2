THE CASTLE SPECTRE: A DRAMA. IN FIVE ACTS. FIRST PERFORMED AT THE THEATER
ROYAL, DRURY LANE, ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1797.

Io me n' andro colla barchetta mia,
Quanto l'acqua comporta un picciol legno;
E cio, ch' io penso colla fantasia,
Di piacere ad ognuno e il mio disegno:
Ben so, che spesso, come gia Morgante,
Lasciato ho forse troppo andar la mazza;
Ma dove sia poi judice bastante,
Materia c' e da camera, e da piazza.

PROLOGUE.
SPOKEN BY MR. WROUGHTON.
FAR from the haunts of men, of vice the foe,
The moon-struck child of genius and of woe,
Versed in each magic spell, and dear to fame,
A fair enchantress dwells, Romance her name.
She loathes the sun, or blazing taper's light:
The moon-beam'd landscape and tempestuous night
Alone she loves; and often, with glimmering lamp,
Near graves new-open'd, or 'midst dungeons damp,
Drear forests, ruined aisles, and haunted towers,
Forlorn she roves, and raves away the hours!
Anon, when storms howl loud and lash the deep,
Desperate she climbs the sea-rock's beetling steep;
There wildly strikes her harp's fantastic strings,
Tells to the moon how grief her bosom wrings,
And while her strange song chaunts fictitious ills,
In wounded hearts Oblivion's balm distills.
A youth, who yet has lived enough to know
That life has thorns, and taste the cup of woe,
As late near Conway's time-bowed towers he strayed,
Invoked this bright enthusiasts magic aid.
His prayer was heard. With arms and bosom bare,
Eyes flashing fire, loose robes, and streaming hair,
Her heart all anguish, and her soul all flame,
Swift as her thoughts, the lovely maniac came!
High heaved her breasts, which struggling passions rent,
As pressed to give some fear-fraught mystery vent:
And often, with anxious glance and altered face,
Trembling with terror, she relaxed her pace,
And stopped! and listened! -- Then with hurried tread
Onwards again she rushed, yet backwards bent her head,
As if from murderous swords or following fiends she fled!
Soon as near Conway's walls her footsteps drew,
She bade the youth their ancient state renew:
Eager he sped the fallen towers to rear:
'Twas done, and fancy bore the fabric here.
Next choosing from great Shakspeare's comic school,
The gossip crone, gross friar, and gibing fool --
These, with a virgin fair and lover brave,
To our young author's care the enchantress gave;
But charged him, ere he blessed the brave and fair,
To lay the exulting villain's bosom bare,
And by the torments of his conscience show,
That prosperous vice is but triumphant woe!
The pleasing task, congenial to his soul,
Often from his own sad thoughts our author stole:
Blessed be his labors, if with like success
They soothe their sorrows whom I now address.
Beneath this dome, should some afflicted breast
Mourn slighted talents, or desert oppressed,
False friendship, hopeless love, or faith betrayed;
Our author will esteem each toil o'er-paid,
If, while his muse exerts her livelier vein,
Or tells imagined woes in plaintive strain,
Her flights and fancies make one smile appear
On the pale cheek, where trickled late a tear;
Or if her fabled sorrows steal one groan,
Which else her hearers would have given their own.

EPILOGUE.
SPOKEN BY MRS. JORDAN.
OSMOND by this arrived at Charon's ferry,
My honor saved, and dad alive and merry,
Hither I come the public doom to know,
But come not uncompell'd -- the more's my woe!
Even now, (oh! pity, friends, my hard mishap!)
My shoulder felt a Bow-Street runner's tap,
Who, while I shook with fear in every limb,
Thus spoke, with accent stern and visage grim --
"Mistress!" quoth he, "to me it given in trust is,
"To bring you straight before our larned Justice;
"For, know, it is said, tonight, the whole town over,
"You Have killed one Osmond, alias Barrymore."
"The fellow's mad!" 'twas thus amazed I spoke;
"Lord! Sir, I murdered Osmond for a joke.
"This dagger, free from blood, will make it certain,
"He died but till the prompter dropped the curtain;
"And now, well pleased to quit this scene of riot,
"The man's gone home to sup in peace and quiet!"
Finding that all I said was said in vain,
And Townshend still his first design maintain,
I thought 'twere best to fly for shelter here,
And beg my generous friends to interfere.
But though the awkward nature of my case
May spread some slight confusion over my face,
No terrors awe my bosom, I Will assure ye;
Just is my cause, and English is my jury!
Besides, it must appear, on explanation,
How very ticklish was my situation,
And all perforce, his crimes when I relate,
Must own that Osmond well deserved his fate.
He heeded not papa's pathetic pleading;
He stabbed mama -- which was extreme ill-breeding;
And at his feet for mercy when I sued,
The odious wretch, I vow, was downright rude.
Twice his bold hands my person dared to touch!
Twice in one day! -- 'Twas really once too much!
And therefore justly filled with virtuous ire,
To save my honor, and protect my fire,
I drew my knife, and in his bosom stuck it;
He fell, you clapped -- and then he kicked the bucket!
So perish still the wretch, whose soul can know
Selfish delight, while causing other's woe;
Who blasts that joy, the sweetest God has given,
And makes an hell, where love would make an heaven!
Forbear, thou lawless libertine! nor seek
Forced favors on that pale averted cheek:
If thy warm kisses cost bright eyes one tear,
Kisses from loveliest lips are bought too dear --
Unless those lips with thine keep playful measure,
And that sweet tear should be a tear of pleasure!
Now as for Osmond -- at that villain's name
I feel reviving wrath my soul inflame!
And shall one short and sudden pang suffice
To clear so base a fault, so gross a vice?
No! To your bar, dear friends, for aid I fly!
Bid Osmond live again, again to die;
Nightly with plaudits loud his breath recall,
Nightly beneath my dagger see him fall,
Give him a thousand lives! -- and let me take them all.

THE CASTLE SPECTRE.
ACT I.
SCENE I. -- A Grove.
Enter Father PHILIP and MOTLEY. Father PHILIP. NEVER tell me! -- I repeat it,
you are a fellow of a very scandalous course of life!


MOTL. And I repeat it, I Am a perfect image of the purest virtue, compared to
whom, for sobriety and continence, Cato was a drunkard, and Lucretia little
better than she should be.


F. PHIL. Oh! hardened in impudence! -- Can you deny being a pilferer, a liar,
a glutton --


MOTL. Can I? -- Heaven be thanked, I Have courage enough to deny any thing!


F. PHIL. Does Not all the world cry out upon you?


MOTL. Certainly my transcendant merit has procured me some enemies, and, in
common with many other great men, my virtue at present labors under something
of a cloud. But understand me right, Father: Though I don't assent to the
sum-total of your accusations, possibly I may acknowledge some of the items;
the best actions frequently appear culpable, merely because their motives are
unexplained. Therefore produce your charges, let me justify my conduct, and I
doubt not I shall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure
as a new sheet of foolscap.


F. PHIL. To begin then with your pilfering -- Did you, or did you not, break
open the pantry-door, and steal out the great goose-pye?


MOTL. Begging your pardon, Father, that was no fault of mine.


F. PHIL. Whose then?


MOTL. The cook's undoubtedly; for if he had not locked the pantry-door, it is an
hundred to one I shouldn't have taken the trouble to break it open.


F. PHIL. Nonsense! Nonsense! -- I tell you, you have been guilty of stealing,
which is a monstrous crime! And what did you steal? Had you taken any thing
else I might have forgiven you: but to lay irreverent hands upon the goose-pye!
-- As I Am a Christian, the identical goose-pye which I intended for my own
supper! -- But this is not my only objection to your conduct.


MOTL. No?


F. PHIL. What principally offends me is, that you pervert the minds of the
maids, and keep kissing and smuggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh! fie!
fie!


MOTL. I kiss and smuggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, Father, it is
they who kiss and smuggle me. I protest I do what I can to preserve my modesty;
and I wish that Archbishop Dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which I
read last night to the dairy-maid in the dark! he would have been quite edified.
But yet what does talking signify? The eloquence of my lips is counteracted by
the luster of my eyes; and really the little devils are so tender, and so
troublesome, that I Am half angry with nature for having made me so very
bewitching.


F. PHIL. Nonsense! Nonsense!


MOTL. Why it was but yesterday that Cicely and Luce went to fifty-cuffs,
quarrelling which looked neatest -- my red leg, or my yellow one. Then they are
so fond and so coaxing! They hang about one so lovingly! And one says, "Kind
Mr. Motley!" and to other, "Sweet Mr. Motley!" -- Ah! Father Philip! Father
Philip! How is a poor little bit of flesh and blood, like me, to resist such
temptation? -- Put yourself in my place: Suppose that a sweet smiling rogue,
just sixteen, with rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, pouting lips, etc.


F. PHIL. Oh! fie! fie! fie! -- To hear such licentious discourse brings the
tears into my eyes!


MOTL. I believe you, Father; for I see the water is running over at your
mouth. However, this shows you --


F. PHIL. It shows me that you are a reprobate, and that my advice is thrown
away upon you: In future I shall keep those counsels to myself, which I offered
you from motives of pure Christian charity.


MOTL. Charity, my good Father, should always begin at home: Now, instead of
giving yourself so much trouble to mend me, what if you thought a little of
correcting yourself?


F. PHIL. I? -- I have nothing to correct.


MOTL. No, to be sure!


F. PHIL. The odor of my sanctity perfumes the whole kingdom.


MOTL. It has a powerful smell about it, I own, not unlike carrion; you may
wind it a mile off.


F. PHIL. All malice!


MOTL. Not exactly: I could mention some little points which might be altered
in you still better than in myself; such as intemperance, gluttony --


F. PHIL. Gluttony? -- Oh! abominable falsehood!


MOTL. Plain matter of fact! -- Why will any man pretend to say that you came
honestly by that enormous belly, that tremendous tomb of fish, flesh, and fowl?
I protest I Am grateful to Heaven that among the unclean Beasts who accompanied
Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they must infallibly
have created a famine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled. --
Next, for incontinence, you must allow yourself that you are unequalled.


F. PHIL. I? I?


MOTL. You, you. -- May I ask what was your business in the beech-grove the
other evening, when I caught you with buxom Margery the miller's pretty wife?
Was it quite necessary to lay your heads together so close?


F. PHIL. Perfectly necessary: I was whispering in her ear wholesome advice.


MOTL. Indeed? Faith then she took your advice as kindly as it was given, and
exactly in the same way too: you gave it with your lips, and she took it with
hers! -- Well done, Father Philip!


F. PHIL. Son, Son, you give your tongue too great a license.


MOTL. Nay, Father, be not angry: Fools, you know, are privileged persons.


F. PHIL. I know they are very useless ones; and in short, Master Motley, to be
plain with you, of all fools I think you the worst; and for fools of all kinds
I Have an insuperable aversion.


MOTL. Really? Then you have one good quality at least, and I cannot but admire
such a total want of self-love! An horn sounds. But hark! it is the dinner-horn.
Away to table, Father -- Depend upon it, the servants will rather eat part of
their dinner unblessed, than stay till your stomach comes like Jonas's whale,
and swallows up the whole.


F. PHIL. Well, well, fool, I am going: but first let me explain to you, that
my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite. No, son, no: Little
sustenance do I take; but St. Cuthbert's blessing is upon me, and that little
prospers with me most marvellously. Verily, the Saint has given me rather too
plentiful an increase, and my legs are scarce able to support the weight of his
bounties. Exit.


MOTL. Alone. He looks like an over grown turtle, waddling upon its hind fins!
-- Yet at bottom it is a good fellow enough, warm-hearted, benevolent, friendly,
and sincere; but no more intended by nature to be a monk, than I to be a maid
of honor to the queen of Sheba. Going.


Enter PERCY. PERCY. I cannot be mistaken: in spite of his dress, his features
are too well known to me! Hist! Gilbert! Gilbert!


MOTL. Gilbert? Oh Lord, that is I! -- Who calls?


PERCY. Have you forgotten me?


MOTL. Truly, sir, that would be no easy matter; I never forgot in my life what
I never knew.


PERCY. Have ten years altered me so much, that you cannot --


MOTL. Hey! -- Can it be -- Pardon, my dear master, pardon! -- In truth, you
may well forgive my having forgotten your name, for at first I didn't very well
remember my own. However, to prevent further mistakes, I must inform you, that
he who in your father's service was Gilbert the knave, is Motley the fool in
the service of Earl Osmond.


PERCY. Of Earl Osmond? This is fortunate. Gilbert, you may be of use to me;
and if the attachment which as a boy you professed for me still exists --


MOTL. It does with ardour unabated, for I Am not so unjust as to attribute to
you my expulsion from Alnwic Castle: in fact I deserved it, for I cannot deny
but that at twenty I was as good-for-nothing a knave as ever existed;
consequently old Earl Percy dismissed me from his service, but I know that it
was sorely against your inclination. You were then scarce fourteen, and I had
been your companion and play-fellow from your childhood. I remember well your
grief at parting with me, and that you slipped into my hand the purse which
contained the whole of your little treasure. That act of kindness struck to my
heart: I swore at the moment to love you through life, and it ever I forget my
oath, damn me!


PERCY. My honest Gilbert! -- And what made you assume this habit?


MOTL. Ah, my Lord! what could I do? -- In spite of my knavery and tricks I was
constantly upon the point of starving, and having once contracted an idle habit
of eating, I never could bring myself to leave it off. After living five years
by my wits, want drove me almost out of them: I knew not what course to take,
when I heard that Earl Osmond's jester had fled the country. I exerted my
knavery for the last time in stealing the fugitive's cast coat, was accepted in
his place by the Earl, and now gain an honest livelihood by persuading my
neighbors that I Am a greater fool than themselves.


PERCY. And your change is for the better?


MOTL. Infinitely; indeed your fool is universally preferred to your knave --
and for this reason; your fool is cheated, your knave cheats: Now everybody
had rather cheat, than be cheated.


PERCY. Some truth in that.


MOTL. And now, sir, may I ask, what brings you to Wales?


PERCY. A woman, whom I adore.


MOTL. Yes, I guessed that the business was about a petticoat. And this woman
is --


PERCY. The orphan ward of a villager, without friends, without family, without
fortune!


MOTL. Great points in her favor, I must confess. And which of these excellent
qualities won your heart?


PERCY. I hope I had better reasons for bestowing it on her. No, Gilbert; I
loved her for a person beautiful without art, and graceful without affectation
-- for an heart tender without weakness, and noble without pride. I saw her at
once beloved and reverenced by her village companions: they looked on her as a
being of a superior order; and I felt, that she who gave such dignity to the
cottage-maid, must needs add new luster to the coronet of the Percies.


MOTL. From which I am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic.


PERCY. Could I mean otherwise, I should blush for myself.


MOTL. Yet surely the baseness of her origin --


PERCY. Can to me be no objection: in giving her my hand I raise her to my
station, not debase myself to hers; nor ever, while gazing on the beauty of a
rose, did I think it less fair because planted by a peasant.


MOTL. Bravo! -- And what says your good grumbling father to this?


PERCY. Alas! he has long slept in the grave!


MOTL. Then he is quiet at last! Well, God grant him that peace in heaven, which
he suffered, nobody to enjoy on earth! -- But, his death having left you master
of your actions, what obstacle now prevents your marriage?


PERCY. You shall hear. -- Fearful lest my rank should influence this lovely
girl's affections, and induce her to bestow her hand on the noble, while she
refused her heart to the man, I assumed a peasant's habit, and presented myself
as Edwy the low-born and the poor. In this character I gained her heart, and
resolved to hail, as Countess of Northumberland, the betrothed of Edwy the
low-born and the poor!


MOTL. I warrant the pretty soul was not displeased with the discovery!


PERCY. That discovery is still unmade. Judge how great must have been my
disappointment, when, on entering her guardian's cottage with this design, he
informed me, that the unknown, who sixteen years before had confided her to his
care, had reclaimed her on that very morning, and conveyed her no one knew
whither.


MOTL. That was unlucky.


PERCY. Was it not? -- Ah! had I declared myself one day sooner, ere this she
would have been my wife.


MOTL. True; and being your wife, if a stranger then had conveyed her no one
knew whither, you might have thought yourself mightily obliged to him.


PERCY. However, in spite of his precautions, I have traced the stranger's
course, and find him to be Kenric, a dependent upon Earl Osmond.


MOTL. Surely it is not Lady Angela, who --


PERCY. The very same! Speak, my good fellow! do you know her?


MOTL. Not by your description; for here she is understood to be the daughter of
Sir Malcolm Mowbray, my master's deceased friend. And what is your present
intention?


PERCY. To demand her of the Earl in marriage.


MOTL. Oh! -- that will never do: -- for in the first place you will not be able
to get a sight of him. I Have now lived with him five long years, and, till
Angela's arrival, never witnessed a guest in the Castle. -- Oh! it is the most
melancholy mansion! And as to its master, he is the very antidote to mirth: He
always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes louring on you with
a gloomy scowl: He never smiles; and to laugh in his presence would be high
treason. He looks at no one -- speaks to no one. None dare approach him, except
Kenric and his four blacks -- all others are ordered to avoid him; and whenever
he quits his room, ding! dong! goes a great bell, and away run the servants
like so many scared rabbits.


PERCY. Strange! -- and what reasons can be have for --


MOTL. Oh! reasons in plenty. You must know there is an ugly story respecting
the last owners of this Castle -- Osmond's brother, his wife, and infant child,
were murdered by banditti, as it was said: unluckily the only servant who
escaped the slaughter, deposed, that he recognized among the assassins a black
still in the service of Earl Osmond. The truth of this assertion was never
known, for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning.


PERCY. Good heavens!


MOTL. Since that time no sound of joy has been heard in Conway Castle. Osmond
instantly became gloomy and ferocious; he now never utters a sound except a
sigh, has broken every tie of society, and keeps his gates barred unceasingly
against the stranger.


PERCY. Yet Angela is admitted: -- But, no doubt, affection for her father --


MOTL. Why, no; I rather think that affection for her father's child --


PERCY. How?


MOTL. If I Have any knowledge in love, the Earl feels it for his fair ward: But
the Lady will tell you more of this, if I can procure for you an interview.


PERCY. The very request which --


MOTL. It Is no easy matter, I promise you; but I Will do my best. In the
meanwhile wait for me in yonder fishing hut -- its owner's name is Edric; --
tell him that I sent you, and he will give you a retreat.


PERCY. Farewell, then, and remember that whatever reward --


MOTL. Dear master, to mention a reward insults me. You have already shown me
kindness; and when it is in my power to be of use to you, to need the inducement
of a second favor would prove me a scoundrel undeserving of the first. Exit.


PERCY. How warm is this good fellow's attachment! Yet our Barons complain that
the great can have no friends! If they have none, let their own pride bear the
blame. Instead of looking with scorn on those whom a smile would attract, and a
favor bind for ever, how many firm friends might our nobles gain, if they
would but reflect that their vassals are men as they are, and have hearts whose
feelings can be grateful as their own. Exit.


SCENE II. The Castle-Hall.
SAIB and HASSAN meeting. SAIB. Now, Hassan, what success?


HASS. My search has been fruitless. In vain have I paced the river's banks,
and pierced the grove's deepest recesses. Nor glen nor thicket have I passed
unexplored, yet found no stranger to whom Kenric's description could apply.


SAIB. Saw you no one?


HASS. A troop of horsemen passed me as I left the wood.


SAIB. Horsemen, say you? -- Then Kenric may be right. Earl Percy has
discovered Angela's abode, and lurks near the Castle in hopes of carrying her
off.


HASS. His hopes then will be vain. Osmond's vigilance will not easily be
eluded -- sharpened by those powerful motives, love and fear.


SAIB. His love, I know; but should he lose Angela, what has he to fear?


HASS. If Percy gains her, every thing! Supported by such wealth and power,
dangerous would be her claim to these domains should her birth be discovered.
Of this our Lord is aware; nor did he sooner hear that Northumberland loved
her, than he hastened to remove her from Allan's care. At first I doubt his
purpose was a foul one: her resemblance to her mother induced him to change it.
He now is resolved to make her his bride, and restore to her those rights of
which himself deprived her.


SAIB. Think you the Lady perceives that our Master loves her?


HASS. I know she does not. Absorbed in her own passion for Percy, on Osmond's
she bestows no thought, and, while roving through these pompous halls and
chambers, sighs for the Cheviot Hills, and Allan's humble cottage.


SAIB. But as she still believes Percy to be a low-born swain, when Osmond lays
his coronet at her feet, will she reject his rank and splendor?


HASS. If she loves well, she will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how
painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung; how incapable was all else
to supply her loss! I have exchanged want for plenty, fatigue for rest, a
wretched hut for a splendid palace. But am I happier? Oh! no! Still do I regret
my native land, and the partners of my poverty. Then toil was sweet to me, for
I labored for Samba; then repose ever blessed my bed of leaves, for there by my
side lay Samba sleeping.


SAIB. This from you, Hassan? -- Did love ever find a place in your flinty
bosom?


HASS. Did it? Oh Saib! my heart once was gentle, once was good! But sorrows
have broken it, insults have made it hard! I have been dragged from my native
land, from a wife who was every thing to me, to whom I was every thing! Twenty
years have elapsed since these Christians tore me away: they trampled upon my
heart, mocked my despair, and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed,
and wondered how a negro's soul could feel! In that moment when the last point
of Africa faded from my view, when as I stood on the vessel's deck I felt that
all I loved was to me lost for ever, in that bitter moment did I banish
humanity from my breast. I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I
gave to the sea the precious token, and, while the high waves swift bore it
from me, vowed aloud endless hatred to mankind. I have kept my oath, I will
keep it!


SAIB. Ill-starred Hassan! your wrongs have indeed been great.


HASS. To remember them unmans me -- Farewell! I must to Kenric. Hold! -- Look,
where he comes from Osmond's chamber!


SAIB. And seemingly in wrath.


HASS. His conferences with the Earl of late have had no other end. The period
of his favor is arrived.


SAIB. Not of his favor merely, Hassan.


HASS. How? Mean you that.....


SAIB. His anxiety for independence, his wish to withdraw himself from Wales --
yet more, certain mysterious words and threats for some time past have made our
Lord uneasy. By him was I this morning commissioned.... Silence! He Is here! you
shall know more anon.


Enter KENRIC. KENR. His promise ever evaded! My request still heard with
impatience, and treated with neglect! -- Osmond, I will bear your ingratitude
no longer. -- Now, Hassan, found you the man described?


HASS. Nor any that resembled him.


KENR. Yet, that I saw Percy, I am convinced. As I crossed him in the wood, his
eye met mine. He started as had he seen a basilisk, and fled with rapidity. Be
on your guard, my friends! Doubtless he will attempt to gain admission to the
Castle.


HASS. Can we be otherwise than watchful, when we see how well the Earl rewards
his followers?


SAIB. Of that, Kenric, you are an example. Have you obtained that recompense
so long promised? Do you enjoy that independence which.....


KENR. Saib, the Earl's ingratitude cuts me to the heart! Attached to him from
his infancy, I have long been his friend, long fancied him mine. The illusion
is now over. He sees that I can serve him no further -- knows that I can harm
him much; therefore he fears, and, fearing, hates me! But I will submit no
longer to this painful dependence. Tomorrow, for the last time, will I summon
him to perform his promise: If he refuses, I will bid him farewell for ever,
and, by my absence, free him from a restraint equally irksome to myself and him.


SAIB. Will you so, Kenric? -- Be speedy then, or you will be too late.


KENR. Too late! And wherefore?


SAIB. You will soon receive the reward of your services.


KENR. Ha! Know you what that reward will be?


SAIB. I guess, but may not tell.


KENR. Is it a secret?


SAIB. Can you keep one?


KENR. Faithfully!


SAIB. As faithfully can I. Come, Hassan.


Exeunt. KENR. alone. What meant the slave? Those doubtful expressions......
Ha! should the Earl intend me false...... Kenric! Kenric! how is thy nature
changed! There was a time when fear was a stranger to my bosom -- when,
guiltless myself, I dreaded not art in others. Now, wherever I turn me, danger
appears to lurk; and I suspect treachery in every breast, because my own heart
hides it. Exit.


Enter Father PHILIP, followed by ALICE. F. PHIL. Nonsense! -- You silly woman,
what you say is not possible.


ALICE. I never said it was possible. I only said it was true; and that if ever
I heard music, I heard it last night.


F. PHIL. Perhaps the fool was singing to the servants.


ALICE. The fool indeed? Oh! fie! fie! How dare you call my Lady's ghost a fool?


F. PHIL. Your Lady's ghost! -- You silly old woman!


ALICE. Yes, Father, yes: I repeat it, I heard the guitar lying upon the
Oratory table play the very air which the Lady Evelina used to sing while
rocking her little daughter's cradle. She warbled it so sweetly, and ever at
the close it went singing Lullaby! Lullaby! hush thee, my dear!
Thy father is coming, and soon will be here!



F. PHIL. Nonsense! nonsense! -- Why, pr'ythee, Alice, do you think that your
Lady's ghost would get up at night only to sing Lullaby for your amusement? --
Besides, how should a spirit, which is nothing but air, play upon an instrument
of material wood and cat-gut?


ALICE. How can I tell? -- Why, I know very well that men are made; but if you
desired me to make a man, I vow and protest I shouldn't know how to set about
it. I can only say, that last night I heard the ghost of my murdered Lady.....


F. PHIL. -- Playing upon the spirit of a cracked guitar! -- Alice! Alice!
these fears are ridiculous! The idea of ghosts is a vulgar prejudice; and they
who are timid and absurd enough to encourage it, prove themselves the most
contemptible --


ALICE screaming. Oh! Lord bless us!


F. PHIL. What? -- Hey! -- Oh! dear!


ALICE. Look! look! -- A figure in white! -- It comes from the haunted room!


F. PHIL. dropping on his knees. Blessed St. Patrick! -- Who has got my beads?
Where Is my prayer book?


ALICE. It comes! -- it comes! -- Now! now! -- Lack-a-day, it is only Lady
Angela!


F. PHIL. rising. Lack-a-day! I Am glad of it with all my heart!


ALICE. Truly so am I. -- But what say you now, Father, to the fear of specter?


F. PHIL. In good faith, Alice, that my theory was better than my practice.
However, the next time that you are afraid of a ghost, remember and make use of
the receipt which I shall now give you; and instead of calling for a priest to
lay the spirits of other people in the red sea, call for a bottle of red wine
to raise your own. Probatum est.


Exit. ALICE alone. Wine indeed! -- I believe he thinks I like drinking as well
as himself. No, no! Let the old toping friar take his bottle of wine; I shall
confine myself to plain cherry-brandy.


Enter ANGELA. ANG. I am weary of wandering from room to room; in vain do I
change the scene, discontent is every where. There was a time when music could
delight my ear, and nature could charm my eye: -- when, as the dawn unveiled
the landscape, each object it disclosed to me looked pleasant and fair; and
while the last sunbeams yet lingered on the western sky, I could pour forth a
prayer of gratitude, and thank my good angels for a day unclouded by sorrow! --
Now all is gone, all lost, all faded!


ALICE. Lady!


ANG. Perhaps at this moment he thinks upon me! Perhaps he wanders on those
mountains where we so often have strayed, reclines on that bank where we so often
have sat, or listens sadly to the starling which he taught to repeat my name.
Perhaps then he sighs, and murmurs to himself, The flowers, the rivulets, the
birds, every object reminds me of my well-beloved; but what shall remind her of
Edwy? -- Oh! that will my heart, Edwy; I need no other remembrancer!


ALICE. Lady! Lady Angela! -- She minds me no more than a post!


ANG. Oh! are you there, good Alice? What would you with me?


ALICE. Only ask, how your Ladyship rested?


ANG. Ill! very ill!


ALICE. Lack-a-day! and yet you sleep in the best bed!


ANG. True, good Alice; but my heart's anguish strewed thorns upon my couch of
down.


ALICE. Marry, I Am not surprised that you rested ill in the Cedar-room. Those
noises so near you --


ANG. What noises? I heard none.


ALICE. How? -- When the clock struck one, heard you no music?


ANG. Music! -- None.


ALICE. And never have heard any while in the Cedar-room?


ANG. Not that I -- Stay! now I remember that while I sat alone in my chamber
this morning --


ALICE. Well, Lady, well!


ANG. Methought I heard some one singing; it seemed as if the words ran thus --
singing -- "Lullaby! Lullaby! Hush thee, my dear!"


ALICE screaming. The very words! -- It was the ghost, Lady! it was the ghost!


ANG. The ghost, Alice! -- I protest I thought it had been you.


ALICE. Me, Lady! -- Lord, when did you hear this singing?


ANG. Not five minutes ago, while you were talking with Father Philip.


ALICE. The Lord be thanked! -- Then it was not the ghost. It was I, Lady! It
was I! -- And have you heard no other singing since you came to the castle?


ANG. None. But why that question?


ALICE. Because, Lady -- But perhaps you may be frightened?


ANG. No, no! -- Proceed, I entreat you!


ALICE. Why, then, they to say, that the chamber in which you sleep is haunted.
You may have observed two folding-doors, which are ever kept locked: they lead
to the Oratory, in which the Lady Evelina passed most of her time, while my
Lord was engaged in the Scottish wars. She would fit there, good soul! hour
after hour, playing on the lute, and singing airs so sweet, so sad, that many a
time and often have I wept to hear her. Ah! when I kissed her hand at the
Castle-gate, little did I suspect that her fate would have been so wretched!


ANG. And what was her fate?


ALICE. A sad one, Lady! Impatient to embrace her Lord, after a year's absence,
the Countess set out to meet him on his return from Scotland, accompanied by a
few domestics and her infant-daughter, then scarce a twelvemonth old. But, as
she returned with her husband, robbers surprised the party scarce a mile from
the Castle; and since that time no news has been received of the Earl, of the
Countess, the servants, or the child.


ANG. Dreadful! Were not their corses found?


ALICE. Never! The only domestic who escaped pointed out the scene of action;
and as it proved to be on the river's banks, doubtless the assassins plunged
the bodies into the stream.


ANG. Strange! And did Earl Osmond then become owner of this Castle? -- Alice!
was he ever suspected of --


ALICE. Speak lower, Lady! It was said so, I own: but for my own part I never
believed it. To my certain knowledge Osmond loved the Lady Evelina too well to
hurt her; and when he heard of her death, he wept, and sobbed as if his heart
were breaking. Nay, it is certain that he proposed to her before marriage, and
would have made her his wife, only that she liked his brother better. Well she
might indeed, for Earl Reginald was a sweeter gentleman by half.


ANG. And in that Oratory, you say -- Good Alice, you have the key of it: Let
me see that Oratory tonight.


ALICE. Tonight, Lady? Heaven preserve me! I wouldn't enter it after dark for
the world!


ANG. But before dark, Alice?


ALICE. Before dark? Why that indeed -- Well, well, we'll see, Lady. But I hope
you're not alarmed by what I mentioned of the Cedar-room?


ANG. No, truly, Alice; from good spirits I have nothing to fear, and heaven
and my innocence will protect me against bad.


ALICE. My very sentiments, I protest! But Heaven forgive me, while I stand
gossiping here I warrant all goes wrong in the kitchen! Your pardon, Lady: I
must away! I must away! Exit.


ANG. musing. Osmond was his brother's heir. His strange demeanor! -- Yes, in
that gloomy brow is written a volume of villainy! -- Heavenly powers! an
assassin then is matter of my fate! -- An assassin too who -- I dare not bend
my thoughts that way! -- Oh! would I had never entered these Castle-walls! --
had never exchanged for fearful pomp the security of my pleasures -- the
tranquillity of my soul! Return, return, sweet Peace! and over my breast
Spread thy bright wings, distill thy balmy rest,
And teach my steps thy realms among to rove;
Wealth and the world resigned, naught mine but love!
Ah! cease thy suit, fond girl! thy prayer is vain,
For thus did Love his tyrant law ordain.
-- "Peace still must fly that heart where I still reign."



Exit. END of the FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE I. -- The Armoury. -- Suits of Armor are arranged on both Sides upon
Pedestals, with the Names of their Possessors written under each.
Enter MOTLEY, peeping in. THE coast is clear! -- Hist! Hist! -- You may enter.

Enter PERCY. PERCY. Loiter not here! -- Quick, my good fellow! -- Conduct me
to Angela!


MOTL. Softly, softly! A little caution is needful; and I promise you just now
I Am not upon roses. -- You remember the servant who hinted that Earl Osmond had
an hand in his brother's murder? -- Should I be suspected of admitting you to
the Castle, his fate might be mine; and whatever you may think of it, my Lord,
I shouldn't be at all pleased at waking tomorrow morning, to find myself dead
in my bed.


PERCY. If such are your fears, why not lead me at once to Angela? Are we not
more exposed in this open hall?


MOTL. Be contented, and leave all to me: I will contrive matters so that
Osmond shall have you before his eyes, and be no jot the wiser. -- Here! --
Taking down a suit of armor -- Put on this coat of mail: you must make up your
mind to play a statue for an hour or two.


PERCY. How?


MOTL. Nay, it is absolutely necessary. -- Quick! quick! ere the servants quit
the hall, where they are now at dinner. -- Here Is the helmet! -- the gauntlet!
-- the shield! -- So now take this truncheon in your hand; and there we have
you armed cap-a-pee!


PERCY. And now be good enough to explain what purpose this masquerade is to
answer.


MOTL. Willingly. You are to know, that since the late Earl's death the Castle
is thought to be haunted: the servants are fully persuaded that his ghost
wanders every night through the long galleries, and parades the old towers and
dreary halls which abound in this melancholy mansion. He is supposed to be
dressed in complete armor; and that which you wear at present was formerly his.
Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a conference with Lady Angela; even
now I heard her summoned to attend him in the Armoury. Placed upon this
pedestal you may listen to their discourse unobserved, and thus form a proper
judgment both of your mistress and her guardian. As soon as it grows dark I
will conduct you to Angela's apartments: the obscurity will then shelter you
from discovery; and even should you be observed, you will pass for Earl
Reginald's spectre.


PERCY. I do not dislike your plan: but tell me, Gilbert, do you believe this
tale of the apparition?


MOTL. Oh! Heaven forbid! Not a word of it. Had I minded all the strange things
related of this Castle, I should have died of fright in the first half-hour.
Why, they say that Earl Hubert rides every night round the Castle on a white
horse; that the ghost of Lady Bertha haunts the west pinnacle of the
Chapel-Tower; and that Lord Hildebrand, who was condemned for treason some
sixty years ago, may be seen in the Great Hall, regularly at midnight, playing
at football with his own head! Above all, they say that the spirit of the late
Countess sits nightly in her Oratory, and sings her baby to sleep! However, if
it be so -- A bell sounds thrice, loud and solemn -- Hark! it is the Earl! --
Quick to your post! -- Percy ascends the pedestal -- Farewell! I must get out
of his way; but as soon as he quits this chamber I Will rejoin you.


PERCY. Do so; and farewell. Exit Motley.


The folding-doors are thrown open: Saib, Hassan, Muley, and Alaric enter,
preceding Earl Osmond, who walks with his arms folded, and his eyes bent upon
the ground. Saib advances a sopha, into which, after making a few turns through
the room, Osmond throws himself. He motions to his attendants, and they
withdraw. He appears lost in thought; then suddenly rises, and again traverses
the room with disordered steps. OSM. I will not sacrifice my happiness to hers!
For sixteen long years have I thirsted; and now when the cup of joy again
stands full before me, shall I dash it from my lip? No, Angela, you ask of me
too much. Since the moment when I pierced her heart, deprived of whom life
became odious; since my soul was stained with his blood who loved me, with hers
whom I loved, no form has been grateful to my eye, no voice spoken pleasure to
my soul, save Angela's, save only Angela's! Doting upon one whom death has long
clasped in his arms; tortured by desires which I never hoped to satisfy, many a
mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguish, no guest but remorse
at committing a fruitless crime. Hope, that stranger, once more revisits my
bosom: the fiend, who led me through passion's mazes to the heights of guilt,
owns that a crime so great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws
unclose: Evelina revives in her daughter, and soon shall the fires which
consume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's? What
though she prefer a basilisk's kiss to mine? Because my short-lived joy may
cause her eternal sorrow, shall I reject those pleasures sought so long,
desired so earnestly? That will I not, by Heaven! Mine she is, and mine she
shall be, though Reginald's bleeding ghost flit before me, and thunder in my
ear -- "Hold! Hold!" -- Peace, stormy heart! She comes!


Enter ANGELA. OSM. in a softened voice. Come hither, Angela. Wherefore so sad?
That downcast eye, that listless air, neither suit your age or fortunes. Raised
from obscurity to rank and splendor, can this change call no smile upon your
cheek? Wheree'er you turn, respect and adoration wait you; a thousand servants
move obedient to your nod. The treasures of India are lavished to adorn your
person; yet still do I see you, forgetting what you are, look back with regret
to what you were!


ANG. Oh! my good Lord, esteem me not ungrateful! I acknowledge your bounties,
but they have not made me happy. I still linger in thought hear those scenes
where I passed the blessed period of infancy; I still thirst for those simple
pleasures which habit has made to me most dear. The birds which my own hands
reared, and the flowers which my own hands planted; the banks on which I rested
when fatigued, the wild tangled wood which supplied me with strawberries, and
the village church where I prayed to be virtuous, while I yet knew of vice and
virtue but the name, all have acquired rights to my memory and my love!


OSM. What? these costly dresses, these scenes of pomp and greatness --


ANG. Dazzle my eyes, but leave my heart unsatisfied. What I would meet with is
affection, not respect; I had rather be obliged than obeyed; and all these
glittering gems are far less dear to me, than one flower of a wreath which
Edwy's hands have woven.


OSM. Confusion!


ANG. While I saw you, Cheviot Hills, I was happy, Oh! how happy! While I
listened to your artless accents, friends of my childhood, how swelled my fond
heart with gratitude and pleasure! At morn when I left my bed, light were my
spirits, and gay as the zephyrs of summer; and when at night my head again
pressed my pillow, I whispered to myself, "Happy has been today, and tomorrow
will be as happy!" Then sweet was my sleep; and my dreams were of those whom I
loved dearest.


OSM. Romantic enthusiast! These thoughts did well for the village maid, but
disgrace the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray: Let them be changed for others,
better suited to your birth, to the fortune which awaits you. Hear me, Angela;
an English baron loves you, a nobleman than whom our island boasts few more
potent. It Is to him that your hand is destined, it is on him that your heart
must be bestowed.


ANG. I cannot dispose of that which has long been another's -- My heart is
Edwy's.


OSM. Edwy's? A peasant's?


ANG. For the obscurity of his birth chance must be blamed; the merit of his
virtues belongs wholly to himself.


OSM. By Heaven, you seem to think that poverty is a virtue!


ANG. Sir, I think it is a misfortune, not a crime: And when in spite of
nature's injustice, and the frowns of a prejudiced and illiberal world, I see
some low-born but illustrious spirit prove itself superior to the station which
it fills, I hail it with pleasure, with admiration, with respect! Such a spirit
I found in Edwy, and, finding, loved!


OSM. My blood boils with passion!


ANG. You say, that by two sentiments I disgrace my rank: I say, that to break
my given word would disgrace it more. Edwy has my plighted faith: He received
it on the last evening which I passed in Northumberland, as we sat on a low
bench before old Allan's cottage. It was an heavenly night, sweet and tranquil
as the loves of angels: A gentle breeze whispered among the honeysuckles which
bloomed above us, and the full moon tinged with her silver light the distant
towers of Alnwic. It was then that for the first time I gave him my hand, and I
swore that I never would give it but to him! It was then that for the first
time he pressed his lips to mine, and I swore that my lips should never be
pressed by another!


OSM. Girl! girl! you drive me to distraction!


ANG. You alarm me, my Lord! Permit me to retire. -- Going, Osmond detains her
violently by the arm.


OSM. Stay! -- in a softer tone. Angela! I love you!


ANG. starting. My Lord!


OSM. passionately. Love you to madness! -- My bosom is a gulf of devouring
flames! I must quench them in your arms, or perish! -- Nay, strive not to
escape: Remain, and hear me! I offer you my hand: If you accept it, mistress of
these fair and rich domains, your days shall glide away in happiness and
honor; but if you refuse and scorn my offer, force shall this instant --


ANG. Force? Oh! No! -- You dare not be so base!


OSM. Reflect on your situation, Angela; you are in my power -- remember it,
and be wise!


ANG. If you have a generous mind, that will be my surest safeguard. Be it my
plea, Osmond, when thus I sue to you for mercy, for protection! Look on me with
pity, Osmond! It Is the daughter of the man you loved, it is a creature,
friendless, wretched, and forlorn, who kneels before you, who flies to you for
refuge! True, I am in your power: Then save me, respect me, treat me not
cruelly; for -- I am in your power!


OSM. I will hear no more. Will you accept my offer?


ANG. Osmond, I conjure you --


OSM. Answer my question!


ANG. Mercy! Mercy!


OSM. Will you be mine? -- Speak! Speak!


ANG. after a moment's pause, rises, and pronounces with firmness Never, so
help me Heaven!


OSM. seizing her. Your fate then is decided! Angela shrieks.


PERCY in a hollow voice. -- Hold!


OSM. starts, but still grasps Angela's arm -- Ha! What was that?


ANG. struggling to escape. Hark! Hark! -- Heard you not a voice?


OSM. gazing upon Percy -- It came from hence! -- From Reginald! -- Was it not
a delusion? -- Did indeed his spirit -- relapsing into his former passion.
Well, be it so! Though his ghost should rush between us, thus would I clasp her
-- Horror! What sight is this? -- At the moment that he again seizes Angela,
Percy extends his truncheon with a menacing gesture, and descends from the
pedestal. Osmond releases Angela, who immediately rushes from the chamber,
while Percy advances a few steps, and remains gazing on the Earl steadfastly --
I know that shield! -- that helmet! -- Speak to me, dreadful vision! -- Tax me
with my crimes! -- Tell me, that you come -- Stay! Speak! -- Following Percy,
who, when he reaches the door, through which Angela escaped, turns, and signs
to him with his hand. Osmond starts back in terror. -- He forbids my following!
-- He leaves me! -- The door closes -- in a sudden burst of passion, and
drawing his sword -- Hell, and fiends! I Will follow him, though lightnings blast
me! -- He rushes distractedly from the chamber When I wrote the foregoing
scene, I really believed the invention to be entirely my own: But the
situations of Angela, Osmond and Percy, so closely resemble those of Isabella,
Manfred, and the animated portrait in The Castle of Otranto, that I am
convinced the idea must have been suggested to me by that beautiful Romance. --
Wherever I can trace any plagiarisms, whether wilful or involuntary, I shall
continue to point them out to the reader without reserve.
.


SCENE II. -- The Castle-Hall.
Enter ALICE. ALICE. Here Is rudeness! Here Is ill-breeding! On my conscience,
this house grows worse and worse every day!


Enter MOTLEY. MOTL. What can he have done with himself? Perhaps weary of
waiting for me in the Armoury, he has found his way alone to Angela. How now,
dame Alice, what has happened to you? You look angry.


ALICE. By my troth, fool, I Have little reason to look pleased. To be frightened
out of my wits by night, and thumped and bumped about by day, is not likely to
put one in the best humor.


MOTL. Poor soul! And who has been thumping and bumping you?


ALICE. Who has? You should rather ask who has not. -- Why only hear: -- As I
was just now going along the narrow passage which leads to the Armoury --
singing to myself, and thinking of nothing, I met Lady Angela flying away as if
for dear life! -- So I dropped her a curtsey -- but might as well have spared
my pains. Without minding me any more than if I had been a dog or a cat -- she
pushed me on one side; and before I could recover my balance, somebody else,
who came bouncing by me, gave me the other thump -- and there I lay sprawling
upon the floor. However, I tumbled with all possible decency, and took great
care that my petticoats should cover my legs.


MOTL. Somebody else! What somebody else?


ALICE. I know not -- but he seemed to be in armor.


MOTL. In armor? Pray, Alice, looked he like a ghost?


ALICE. What he looked like, I cannot say; -- but I Am sure he didn't feel like
one: However, you have not heard the worst. While I was sprawling upon the
ground, my Lord comes tearing along the passage -- The first thing he did was
to stumble against me -- away went his heels -- over he came -- and in the
twinkling of an eye there lay his Lordship! As soon as he got up again --
Mercy! how he stormed! -- He snatched me up -- called me an ugly old witch --
shook the breath out of my body -- then clapped me on the ground again, and
bounced away after the other two!


MOTL. My mind misgives me! -- But what can this mean, Alice?


ALICE. The meaning I neither know, or care about; -- but this I know -- I Will
stay no longer in an house where I Am treated so disrespectfully. "My Lady!" --
says I -- "Out of my way!" -- says she, and pushes me on one side. "My Lord,"
-- says I -- "You be damned!" -- says he, and pushes me on the other! -- I
protest I never was so ill used, even when I was a young woman! Exit.


MOTL. This account alarms me! -- Should Percy be discovered -- The very
thought gives me a creak in my neck! -- At any rate I had better enquire
whether -- going


Enter Father PHILIP hastily. F. PHIL. stopping him. Get out of the house! --
That Is your way!


MOTL. Why, what is the meaning --


F. PHIL. Don't stand prating here, but do as I bid you!


MOTL. But first tell me --


F. PHIL. I can only tell you to get out of the house. Kenric has discovered
Earl Percy -- You are known to have introduced him -- The Africans are in
search of you -- If you are found, you will be hung out of hand. Fly then to
Edric's cottage -- hide yourself there! -- Hark! -- Some one comes! Away, away,
ere it is too late! -- pushing him out.


MOTL. confused But Earl Percy -- But Angela --


F. PHIL. Leave them to me! You shall hear from me soon. Only take care of
yourself, and fly with all diligence! -- Away! Exit Motley.


F. PHIL. alone. So, so, he is off, and now I Have time to take breath. I Have not
moved so nimbly for the last twenty years; and, in truth, I Am at present but
ill calculated for velocity of motion. However, my exertions have not been
thrown away: I Have saved this poor knave from Osmond's vengeance -- and should
my plan for the Lady's release succeed -- Poor little soul! -- To see how she
took on, when Percy was torn from her! Well, well, she shall be rescued from
her tyrant. The moveable pannels -- the subterraneous passages -- the secret
springs well-known to me -- Oh! I cannot fail of success: But in order to
secure it, I Will finally arrange my ideas in the Buttery. Whenever I Have any
great design in hand, I always ask advice of a flaggon of ale, and mature my
plan over a cold venison-pasty. Oh! what an excellent genius must that man have
had, who first invented eating and drinking! Exit.


SCENE III. -- A spacious Chamber: On one Side is a Couch: on the other a
Table, which is placed under an arched and lofty Window.
Enter OSMOND, followed by SAIB, HASSAN, MULEY and ALARIC, who conduct PERCY
disarmed. OSM. This, Sir, is your prison; but, doubtless, your confinement will
not continue long. The moment which gives me Angela's hand shall restore you to
liberty; and, till that moment arrives, farewell.


PERCY. Stay, Sir, and hear me! -- By what authority presume you to call me
captive? -- Have you forgotten that you speak to Northumberland's Earl?


OSM. Well may I forget him, who could so far forget himself. Was it worthy of
Northumberland's Earl to steal disguised into my Castle, and plot with my
servant to rob me of my most precious treasure?


PERCY. Mine was that treasure -- You deprived me of it basely, and I was
justified in striving to regain my own.


OSM. Earl, nothing can justify unworthy means. If you were wronged, why sought
you not your right with your sword's point? I then should have esteemed you a
noble foe, and as such would have treated you: But you have stooped to paltry
artifice, and attacked me like some midnight ruffian, privately, and in
disguise. By this am I authorized to forget your station, and make your penance
as degrading as your offense was base.


PERCY. If such are indeed your sentiments, prove them now. Restore my sword,
unsheathe your own, and be Angela the conqueror's reward!


OSM. No, Earl Percy! -- I am not so rash a gamester as to suffer that cast to
be recalled, by which the stake is mine already. Angela is in my power: The
only man who could wrest her from my arms, has wilfully made himself my
captive: Such he is, and such he shall remain.


PERCY. Insulting tyrant! Your cowardice in refusing my challenge proves
sufficiently --


OSM. Be calm, Earl Percy! -- You forget yourself. That I am no coward, my
sword has proved in the fields of Scotland. -- My sword shall again prove it,
if, when you are restored to liberty, you still question the courage of my
heart! Angela once mine, repeat your defiance, nor doubt my answering.


PERCY. Angela thine? -- That she shall never be! There are angels above who
favor virtue, and the hour of retribution must one day arrive! -- throws
himself upon the couch.


OSM. But long ere the arrival of that hour shall Angela have been my bride;
and now farewell, Lord Percy! -- Muley and Saib!


BOTH. My Lord!


OSM. To your charge I commit the Earl; quit not this apartment, nor suffer him
for one moment from your sight.


SAIB and MULEY. My Lord, we shall obey you.


OSM. aside. If she refuse me still, the death of this, her favorite -- his
death! Oh! through what bloody paths do I wander in pursuit of happiness! Yes,
I am guilty! -- Heaven! how guilty! Yet lies the fault with me? Did my own
pleasure plant in my bosom these tempestuous passions? No! they were given me
at my birth; they were sucked in with my existence! Nature formed me the slave
of wild desires; and Fate, as she frowned upon my cradle, exclaimed, "I doom
this babe to be a villain and a wretch Having had good opportunities of knowing
how wonderful are the talents for misinterpretation possessed by certain
persons, I think it necessary to observe to my readers, that the foregoing
speech is not meant to contain a moral sentiment, but to display the false
reasoning of a guilty conscience -- If I were not to make this explanation, I
should expect to see it asserted that the whole Play was meant to inculcate the
doctrine of Fatality.
!"


Exit, followed by Hassan and Alaric, who lock the door after them. SAIB. Look,
Muley, how bitterly he frowns!


MULLY. Now he starts from the sopha! -- 'Faith, he is in a monstrous fury!


SAIB. That may well be: -- When you mean to take in other people, it certainly
is provoking to be taken in yourself.


PERCY after walking a few turns with a disordered air, suddenly stops. -- He
is gone to Angela! Gone, perhaps, to renew that outrage whose completion my
presence alone prevented! Helpless and unprotected, with no friend but
innocence -- no advocates save tears -- how will she now repel his violence?


MULEY. Now he is in a deep study: -- Marry, if he studies himself out of this
Tower, he is a cleverer fellow than I take him for.


PERCY. Were I not Osmond's captive, all might yet be well. Summoning my
vassals, who by this time must be near at hand, forcing the Castle, and tearing
Angela from the arms of her tyrant -- -- Alas! my captivity has rendered his
plan impracticable! Eternal curses upon Gilbert, who persuaded me to adopt this
artifice! -- Curses on my own rash folly, which has thrown me thus defenseless
in the power of my foe! --


MULEY. That Is right! -- Another stamp or two, and the Tower comes rattling
about our ears.


PERCY. And are there then no hopes of liberty?


SAIB. He fixes his eyes on us.


PERCY. Might not these fellows -- I can but try. -- Now stand my friend, thou
master-key to human hearts! -- Aid me, thou potent devil, gold! -- Hear me, my
worthy friends! -- Come nearer!


SAIB. His worthy friends! -- Are we such, Muley?


MULEY. Yes, truly are we -- for friends in need are friends indeed: -- Marry,
if he were not in need, he would call us his mortal foes.


PERCY. My good fellows, you are charged with a disagreeable office, and to
obey a tyrant's mandates cannot be pleasant to you; there is something in your
looks which has prejudiced me too much in your favor to believe it possible.


SAIB. Nay, there certainly is something in our appearance highly prepossessing.


MULEY. And I knew that you must admire the delicacy of our complexions!


PERCY. The tincture of your skin, my good fellow, is of little consequence:
Many a worthy heart beats within a dusky bosom, and I am convinced that such an
heart inhabits yours; for your looks tell me that you feel for, and are anxious
to relieve, my sufferings. -- See you this purse, my friends?


MULEY. It Is too far off, and I Am short-sighted. -- If you will put it a little
nearer --


PERCY. Restore me to liberty! -- and not this purse alone, but ten times its
value shall be yours.


SAIB. To liberty?


MULEY. That purse?


SAIB. Muley!


MULEY. Saib!


PERCY. aside. By all my hopes, they hesitate! -- You well know, that my wealth
and power are equal, not to say superior, to Earl Osmond's: Release me from my
dungeon, and share that power and wealth! -- On the events of today depends my
life's future happiness, nay perhaps my life itself: Judge then, if you assist
me, how great will be the service rendered me, and believe that your reward
shall equal my obligation.


SAIB. I know not what to answer.


MULEY. In truth, my Lord, your offers are so generous, and that purse is so
tempting -- -- Saib, what say you? -- winking to him.


SAIB. The Earl speaks so well, and promises so largely, that I own I Am
strangely tempted --


MULEY. Look you, Saib; will you stand by me?


SAIB after a moment's thought. I will!


MULEY. There Is my hand then! -- My Lord, we are your servants!


PERCY. This is beyond my hopes! -- A thousand thanks, my worthy fellows! -- Be
assured that the performance of my promises shall soon follow the execution of
yours.


SAIB. Of that we make no doubt.


PERCY. You agree then to release me?


MULEY. It Is impossible to do otherwise; for I feel that pity, generosity, and
every moral feeling command me to trouble your Lordship for that purse.


PERCY. There it is! -- And now unlock the door!


MULEY chinking the purse. Here it is! -- And now I Am obliged to you. As for
your promises, my Lord, pray don't trouble yourself to remember them, as I
sha'n't trouble myself to remember mine.


PERCY starting. Ha! -- What mean you?


SAIB firmly. Earl, that we are faithful!


MULEY. I wonder you didn't read that too in our amiable looks!


PERCY. What! Will you not keep your word?


MULEY. In good truth, No; we mean to keep nothing -- except the purse.


PERCY. Perfidious villains!


SAIB. You mistake us, Sir; -- we cannot be villains, for I, you know, am your
Lordship's "worthy friend!"


MULEY. And I your Lordship's unworthy pensioner!


PERCY. Confusion! -- To be made the jest of such rascals!


SAIB. Earl Percy, we are none! -- but we should have been, could your gold
have bribed us to betray our master. We have but done our duty -- you have but
gained your just reward; for they who seek to deceive others, should ever be
deceived themselves.


PERCY. Silence, fellow! -- Leave me to my thoughts! -- throwing himself
passionately upon the couch.


MULEY. Oh! with all our hearts! We ask no better.


SAIB. Muley, we share that purse?


MULEY. Undoubtedly: Sit down, and examine its contents. -- They seat
themselves on the floor in the front of the stage.


PERCY. How unfortunate, that the only merit of these villains should be
fidelity! -- No hope now is left! Angela is lost, and with her my happiness!


CHORUS OF VOICES singing without Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee! MULEY. Hark! --
What Is that?


SAIB. I Will see. mounting upon the table. -- This window is so high --


MULEY. Here, here! Take this chair. -- Saib places the chair upon the table,
and thus lifts himself to a level with the window, which he opens. --


SONG AND CHORUS.
MOTLEY singing without. Sleep you, or wake you, Lady bright?

CHORUS without. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MOTLEY. Now is the fittest time for flight.

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MOTLEY. Know, from your tyrant father's power
Beneath the window of your tower
A boat now waits to set you free:
Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

PERCY -- who has half-raised himself from the couch during the latter part of
the Song, and listened attentively -- Surely I know that voice!


MULEY. Now, what is the matter?


SAIB. A boat lies at the foot of the tower, and the fishermen sing while they
draw their nets.


PERCY. I could not be mistaken: -- it was Gilbert!


SAIB. Hark! They begin again! --


SECOND STANZA.
MOTLEY. Though deep the stream, though high the wall,

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MOTLEY. The danger, trust me, Love, is small:

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MOTLEY. To spring below then never dread;
My arms to catch you shall be spread;
And far from hence you soon shall be,
Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

PERCY. I understand him! -- He bids me -- Yet the danger -- What course shall
I pursue?


MULEY. Pr'ythee, come down, Saib; I long to divide the purse --


SAIB. Stay a moment: one more stanza, and I Am with you. Now, silence!


THIRD STANZA.
MOTLEY. Fair Emma hushed her heart's alarms:

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MOTLEY. She sprang into her Lover's arms;

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MOTLEY. Unhurt she fell; then swift its way
The boat pursued without delay,
While Emma placed on Edgar's knee
Sang "Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!"

CHORUS. Sing Megen-oh! Oh! Megen-Ee!

MULEY. Will you never quit that window?


SAIB shutting it, and descending. Here I am, and now for the purse! -- They
resume their seats upon the ground; Saib opens the purse, and begins to reckon
the gold. --


PERCY. Yes, I must brave the danger -- I will feign to sleep; and when my
gaolers are off their guard, then aid me, blessed Providence! -- extending
himself upon the couch.


SAIB. Hold, Muley! -- What if, instead of sharing the purse, we throw for its
contents? Here are dice.


MULEY. With all my heart: -- And look! to pass our time the better, here is a
bottle of the best sack in the Earl's cellar.


SAIB. Good! Good! -- And now, be this angel the stake! -- But, first, what is
our prisoner doing?


MULEY. Oh! He sleeps: Mind him not. -- Come, come -- T^row!


SAIB. Here goes -- Nine! -- Now to you.


MULEY. Nine too! -- Double the stake.


SAIB. Agreed! and the throw is mine. -- Hark! What noise? -- During this
dialogue, Percy has approached the table in silence; at the moment that he
prepares to mount it, Saib looks round, and Percy hastily throws himself back
upon the couch.


MULEY. Oh! -- Nothing, nothing!


SAIB. Methought I heard the Earl --


MULEY. Mere fancy! -- You see he is sleeping soundly. Come, come -- Throw!


SAIB. There then -- Eleven!


MULEY. That Is bad -- Huzza! -- Sixes!


SAIB. Plague on your fortune! -- Come, Double or quits!


MULEY. Be it so, and I throw. -- Zounds! Only Five!


SAIB. Then I think this hit must be mine. -- Aces, by heavens!


MULEY. Ha! Ha! Ha! Your health, friend!


PERCY -- who has again reached the table, mounted the chair, and, opening the
window, now stands at it, and signs to the men below. -- They see me, and
extend a cloth beneath the window! -- It Is a fearful height!


SAIB. Do you mean to empty the bottle? -- Come, come -- Give it me.


MULEY. Take it, blunder-head! -- Saib drinks.


PERCY. They encourage me to venture! -- Now then, or never! -- Aloud. Angels
of bliss, protect me! -- He throws himself from the window This incident has
been cried out against by many people, as being improbable; and some have gone
so far as to term it impossible. To this I can only answer, with Alice in the
First Act -- "I never said it was possible, I only say it is true!" -- This
incident was furnished me by the German History, in which it appears, that a
certain Landgrave of Thuringia, being condemned to death, made his escape by
taking so desperate a leap from the window of his prison, that he was
afterward known throughout Germany by the name of 'Ludwig the Springer.' --
There is a German Play on this subject, whence I borrowed the idea of making
the gaolers play at dice; and Motley's Song bears some resemblance to an
incident in Richard Coeur-de-Lion.
. --


MULEY and SAIB -- starting at the noise. -- Hell and Furies!


SAIB -- dashes down the bottle, and climbs to the window hastily, while Muley
remains below in an attitude of surprise. -- Escaped! Escaped!


PERCY, MOTLEY, etc. without -- Huzza! huzza! huzza!


END of the SECOND ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE I. -- A View of the River Conway, with a Fisherman's Hut. -- Sunset.
Enter ALLAN and EDRIC. ALLAN. STILL they come not! -- Dear, dear, still they
come not! -- Ah! these tumults are too much for my old body to bear.


EDRIC. Then you should have kept your old body at home. It Is a fine thing
truly for a man of your age to be galloping about the country after a girl,
who, by your own account, is neither your chick nor child!


ALLAN. Ah! She was more to me! She was my all, Edric, my all! -- How could I
bear my home when it no longer was the home of Angela? How could I rest in my
cottage at night when her sweet lips had not kissed me -- and murmured,
"Father, sleep well!" -- She is so good! so gentle! -- I was sick once, sick
almost to death! Angela was then my nurse and comforter: She watched me when I
slept, and cheered me when I woke: She rejoiced when I grew better; and when I
grew worse, no medicine gave me ease like the tears of pity which fell on my
burning cheeks from the eyes of my darling!


EDRIC. Tears of pity indeed! A little rhubarb would have done you more good by
half. -- But our people stay a long time: Perhaps Motley has been discovered
and seized; if so, he will lose his life, the Earl his freedom, Angela her
lover, and, what is worst of all, I shall lose my boat! I wish I had not lent it,
for I doubt that Motley's scheme has failed.


ALLAN. I hope not -- Oh! I hope not! -- Should Percy remain a captive, Angela
will be left unprotected in your wicked Lord's power -- Oh! that will break my
poor old wife's heart for certain!


EDRIC. And if it should break it, a mighty misfortune truly! -- Zounds, Master
Allan, any wife is at best a bad thing: a poor one makes matters get worse; but
when she is old, Lord! it is the very devil!


ALLAN. Hark! Hark! Do you hear? -- It Is the sound of oars! -- They are our
friends! -- Oh! Heaven be thanked! the Earl is with them.


A boat appears with Percy, Motley, and soldiers disguised as fishermen. They
land. PERCY springing on shore. -- Once more then I breathe the air of liberty!
-- Worthy Gilbert, what words can suffice to thank you?


MOTLEY. None -- therefore do not waste your breath in the attempt. You are
safe, thanks to St. Peter and the Blanket! and your Lady's deliverance now
demands all your thoughts. -- Ha! who is that with Edric?


PERCY. Allan, by all my hopes! -- Welcome, welcome, good old man! -- Say, came
my vassals with you?


ALLAN. Three hundred chosen men are within the sound of your bugle. They
scarce gave me time to signify your orders ere they sat in their saddles; and
as I would needs come with them, Heaven forgive them for it! they put me on an
hard-trotting horse! -- Marry, he shook me rarely! he has almost broken my old
bones: -- But that matters little; my heart would have been broken had I staid
behind. -- But now, my Lord, tell me of Angela. Is she well? Did you speak to
her? and speaks she sometimes of me?


PERCY. She is well, my old friend, and I have spoken to her -- though but for
a moment. Scarce had I time to confess to her my rank, when Kenric, whose
suspicious eye had penetrated my disguise, forced me from her presence. But be
comforted, good Allan! Should other means fail, I will this very night attack
the Castle, and compel Osmond to resign his prey.


ALLAN. Heaven grant that you may succeed! -- Let me but once see Angela your
bride! Let me but once hear her say the sweet words, "Allan, I am happy!" then
I and my old wife will seek our graves, lay us down, and die with pleasure!


MOTL. Die with pleasure, you silly old man! you shall do nothing so
ridiculous: You shall live a great many years; and, instead of lying down in
your grave, we'll tuck you up warm with your old wife in the best down-bed of
Alnwic Castle. -- But now let us talk of our affairs, which, if I mistake not,
are in the high road to success.


PERCY. How? Has any intelligence reached you of your ally, the Friar?


MOTL. You have guessed it. As it passed beneath his window, the pious porpus
contrived to drop this letter into the boat. Its contents must needs be of
consequence; for I assure you it comes from one of the greatest men in England.
Pray examine it, my Lord! I never can read when the wind's easterly.


PERCY. I believe, Gilbert, were it northerly you would be no jot the wiser: I
remember that many a sound stick did our preceptor break upon your back in
vain; and before you had learned to spell, your schooling had cost my father a
forest.


MOTL. while Percy reads. Nay, if learning could have been beaten into me, by
this time I should be a prodigious scholar! -- To do him justice, Father
Benjamin had a most instructive jirk with his arm, and frequently used
arguments so forcible when pointing out my faults, that many a time and often has
he brought tears into my eyes: Then I generally felt so penitent, and so low,
that I was obliged to steal his brandy-bottle in order to recover my spirits.
-- Well, Sir, what says the letter?


PERCY. Listen. -- "I have recognized you in spite of your disguise, and seize
the opportunity to advise your exerting yourself solely to obtain Earl Percy's
liberty. Heed not Angela: I have sure and easy means for procuring her escape;
and before the clock strikes two, you may expect me with her at the fisherman's
hut. Farewell, and rely upon Father Philip." -- Now, Gilbert, what say you? May
the monk's fidelity be trusted?


MOTL. His fidelity may undoubtedly; but whether his success will equal his
good intentions is a point which time alone can decide. Should it not --


PERCY. Then with my faithful vassals will I storm the Castle tomorrow.


ALLAN. What, storm the Castle? -- Oh! no, no! My darling never saw a bird die
but she wept; then how will she bear to look on when men perish?


PERCY. Be assured, old man, that nothing save invincible necessity shall
induce me to bathe my hands in the blood of my fellow creatures. -- But where
are my followers?


ALLAN. Fearing lest their numbers should excite suspicion, I left them
concealed in yonder wood.


PERCY. Guide me to them. Edric, for this night I must request the shelter of
your hut.


EDRIC. Willingly, my Lord! But my cottage is so humble, your treatment so
wretched --


PERCY. Silence, my good fellow! The hut, where good will resides, is to me
more welcome than a palace, and no food can be so sweet as that which is
seasoned with smiles -- You give me your best; a monarch could give no more,
and it happens not often that men ever give so much. Now farewell for an hour
-- Allan, lead on!


Exeunt Percy, Allan, etc. Manent MOTLEY and EDRIC. MOTL. And in the
meanwhile, friend Edric, I Will lend you an hand in preparing supper.


EDRIC. Truly the task will not give you much trouble, for times have gone hard
with me of late. Our present Lord sees no company, gives no entertainments, and
thus I sell no fish. Things went better while Earl Reginald lived!


MOTL. What! you remember him?


EDRIC. Never shall I forget him, or his sweet Lady! Why, I very believe, they
possessed all the cardinal virtues! -- So pious, so generous, so mild! so kind
to the poor, and so fond of fish!


MOTL. Fond of fish! -- One of the cardinal virtues, of which I never heard
before!


EDRIC. But these thoughts make me sad. Come, Master Motley; your Lord's supper
still swims in the river: -- if you will help to catch it, why do so, and thank
you heartily. Can you fish?


MOTL. Can I? Who in this world cannot? -- I Will assure you, friend Edric, there
is no profession more universal than yours; we all spread our nets to catch
something or other -- and alas! when obtained, it seldom proves worth the
trouble of taking. The Coquette fishes for hearts which are worthless; the
Courtier, for titles which are absurd On the strength of this single sentence,
it was boldly asserted on the morning after the first performance, that the
whole Play was written to support the Cause of Equality; and that I said in it,
all distinctions of rank ought to be abolished, and thought it extremely wrong
for any persons to accept titles! To make the thing complete, the assertors
should have added, that I thought it extremely wrong for any persons to pay
compliments, or possess hearts!
; and the Poet, for compliments which are empty. -- Oh! happy are they in this
world of disappointments, who throw out no nets save fishing ones. Exeunt.


SCENE II. -- The Castle-Hall.
Enter KENRIC. KENRIC. Yonder he stalks, and seems buried in himself! -- Now
then to attack him while my late service is still fresh upon his memory. Should
he reject my petition positively, he shall have good cause to repent his
ingratitude. Percy is in the neighborhood; and that secret, known only to
myself, will surely -- But, silence! -- Look where he comes!


Enter OSMOND. OSM. It shall not be! Away with these foreboding terrors, which
weigh down my heart! -- Does not all smile upon my fortunes? My rival wears my
chains; he cannot wrest her from me, and with tomorrow's dawn Angela shall be
mine. Bound then high, my heart! Pleasure, sweet guest, so long a stranger, Oh!
to my bosom welcome once more! -- I will forget the past, I will enjoy the
present, and make those raptures again mine, which -- Ah! no, no, no! --
Conscience, that serpent, winds her folds round the cup of my bliss, and, ere
my lips can reach it, her venom is mingled with the draught.


KENR. How profound the gloom which obscures his brow! -- How fixed, how
hopeless glares his dark eye-ball! -- Oh! dreadful is the villain's look, when
he ponders on committed crimes!


OSM. Evening approaches fast -- drawing near and opening the window. Already
the air breathes cooler, and the beams of the setting sun sparkle on the waters
of Conway. How fair, how tranquil all without! How dark, how comfortless all
within! -- Hark! the sound of music! -- The peasants are returning from labor:
they move with gay and careless steps, carolling as they go some rustic ditty;
and will pass the night in rest, for they have passed the day in innocence!


CHORUS without. Pleased the toils of day to leave,
Home we haste with footsteps light:
Oh! how gay the cotter's eve!
Oh! how calm the cotter's night!

OSM. closing the window with violence. -- Curses upon them -- I will look, I
will listen no more! I sicken at the sight of happiness, which I never more
must enjoy; I hate the possessors of hearts untainted -- hate, for I envy! --
Oh! fly from my eyes, bright Day! Speed thy pace, Darkness! thou art my Love!
Haste to unfold thy sable mantle, and robe the world in the color of my soul!


KENR. Now then to accost him -- Yet I tremble!


OSM. Anguish! endless, hopeless anguish! -- Day or night, no moment of rest --
When I sleep, dreams of strange horror still fright me from my couch! When I
wake, I find in every object some cause for distrust -- read the dread charge
in every eye, "Thou art a murderer!" -- and tremble lest the agents of my guilt
should work its punishment. -- And see where he walks, the chief object of my
fears! -- He shall not be so long! -- His anxiety to leave me, his late
mysterious threats -- No, no! I will not live in fear. -- Soft! -- he advances!


KENR. So melancholy, my Lord?


OSM. Aye, Kenric, and must be so, till Angela is mine. Know that even now she
extorted from me a promise, that till tomorrow I would leave her unmolested.


KENR. But till tomorrow?


OSM. But till tomorrow? -- Oh! in that little space a lover's eye views
myriads of dangers! -- Yet think not, good Kenric, that your late services are
undervalued by me, or that I have forgotten those for which I have been long
your debtor. When, bewildered by hatred of Reginald, and grief for Evelina's
loss, my dagger was placed on the throat of their infant, your hand arrested
the blow -- Judge then how grateful I must feel when I behold in Angela her
mother's living counterpart -- behold her such as when, shielding with her body
her fallen husband, Evelina received that dagger in her breast which I aimed at
the heart of Reginald! -- Worthy Kenric, how can I repay your services!


KENR. These you may easily. -- But what, Earl Osmond, what can repay me for
the sacrifice of my innocence? -- I was virtuous till you bade me be guilty --
my hands were pure till you taught me to stain them with blood -- you painted
in strong colors the shame of servitude -- you promised freedom, riches,
independence -- you vanquished the resistance of my better Angel, and never
since have I known one moment of rest!


OSM. Good Kenric --


KENR. All here reminds me of my guilt -- every object recalls to me Reginald
and his murdered Lady! -- Let me then claim that independence so long promised,
and seek for peace in some other climate, since memory forbids me to taste it
in this.


OSM. Kenric, ere named, your wish was granted. In a far distant country a
retreat is already prepared for you: there may you hush those clamours of
conscience, which must reach me, I fear, even in the arms of Angela. -- Yet do
not leave me till she is my bride -- Stay yet a week in Conway Castle; and
then, though 'twill cost me many a pang, Kenric, you shall bid it a long adieu.
-- Are you contented?


KENR. affected. My Lord! -- Gratitude -- Amazement -- And I doubted -- I
suspected -- Oh! my good Lord, how have I wronged your kindness!


OSM. No more -- I must not hear you! -- aside -- Shame! shame! that ever my
soul should stoop to dissembling with my slave! -- Kenric, farewell! -- Till
Angela is mine, keep a strict eye on Percy; and then --


SAIB enters, and advances with apprehension. OSM. How now? -- Why this
confusion? -- Why do you tremble? -- Speak!


SAIB. My Lord! -- the prisoner --


OSM. The prisoner? -- Go on! go on!


SAIB kneeling. Pardon, my Lord, pardon! Our prisoner has escaped!


OSM. Villain! -- Wild with rage he draws his dagger, and rushes upon Saib --
Kenric holds his arm.


KENR. Hold! hold! -- What would you do?


OSM. struggling. Unhand me, or by Heaven --


KENR. Away! away! -- Fly, fellow, fly and save yourself! Exit Saib.


KENR. releasing Osmond. Consider, my Lord -- happily 'twas not by his keeper's
fault that --


OSM. furiously. What is it to me by whose? -- Is not my rival fled? -- Soon
will Northumberland's guards encircle my walls, and force from me -- Yet that
by Heaven they shall not! No! Rather than resign her, my own hand shall give
this Castle a prey to flames: then plunging with Angela into the blazing gulf,
I Will leave these ruins to tell posterity how desperate was my love, and how
dreadful my revenge! -- Going, he stops, and turns to Kenric. -- And you, who
dared to rush between me and my resentment -- you who could so well succeed in
saving others -- now look to yourself! Exit.


KENR. Ha! that look -- that threat -- Yet he seemed so kind, so grateful! --
He smiled too! -- Oh! there is ever danger when a villain smiles.


SAIB enters softly, looking round him with caution. SAIB. in a low voice.
Hist! -- Kenric!


KENR. How now? -- What brings --


SAIB. Silence, and hear me! -- You have saved my life, nor will I be
ungrateful -- Look at this phial!


KENR. Ha! did the Earl --


SAIB. Even so: a few drops of this liquor should tonight have flavoured your
wine -- you would never have drank again! Mark me then -- When I offer you a
goblet at supper, drop it as by accident. For this night I give you life: use
it to quit the Castle; for no longer than till tomorrow dare I disobey our
Lord's commands. Farewell, and fly from Conway -- You bear with you my thanks!


Exit. KENR. Can it be possible? Is not all this a dream? -- Villain! villain!
-- Yes, yes, I must away! -- But tremble, traitor! -- A bolt, of which you
little thinks, hangs over, and shall crush you! -- The keys are still in my
possession -- Angela shall be the partner of my flight. -- My prisoner too --
Yet hold! May not resentment -- may not Reginald's sixteen years captivity --
Oh! no! Angela shall be my advocate; and, grateful for her own, for her
parent's life preserved, she can, she will obtain my pardon -- Yet, should she
fail, at least I shall drag down Osmond in my fall, and sweeten death's bitter
cup with vengeance! Exit.


SCENE III. -- The Cedar-room, with folding Doors in the middle, and a large
antique Bed; on one Side is the Portrait of a Lady, on the other that of a
Warrior armed. Both are at full length. -- After a pause the female Portrait
slides back, and Father Philip, after looking in, advances cautiously.
F PHIL. closing the panel. Thus far I have proceeded without danger, though
not without difficulty. Yon narrow passage is by no means calculated for
persons of my habit of body. By my Holidame, I begin to suspect that the fool
is in the right! I certainly am growing corpulent. -- And now, how shall I
employ myself? -- Sinner that I am, why did I forget my bottle of sack? -- The
time will pass tediously till Angela comes. -- And, to complete the business,
yonder is the haunted Oratory. What if the ghost should pop out on me? Blessed
St. Bridget, there would be a tete-a-tete! -- Yet this is a foolish fear: --
It Is yet scarce eight o'clock, and your ghosts always keep late hours; yet I
don't like the idea of our being such near neighbors. If Alice says true, the
apparition just now lives next door to me; but the Lord forbid that we should
ever be visiting acquaintance! -- Would I had something to drive her out of my
head! A good book now, or a bottle of sack, St. Augustine, or a cold venison
pasty, would be worth its weight in gold: but in the chambers of these young
girls one finds nothing good either to read, drink, or eat. Now my I last
patroness, the Baroness O'Drench -- Ah! to hear the catalogue of her crimes was
quite a pleasure, for she always confessed them over a fir-loin of beef, and,
instead of telling a bead, swallowed a bumper! -- Oh! she was a worthy soul! --
But hark! -- Angela comes.


OSM. without. What, Alice! -- Alice, I say!


F. PHIL. By St. David, it is the Earl! I Will away as fast as I can! -- Trying to
open the door -- I cannot find the spring! -- Lord forgive me my sins! -- Where
can I hide myself? -- Ha! the bed! -- It Is the very thing. -- Throws himself
into the bed, and conceals himself under the clothes. -- Heaven grant that it
may not break down with me; for, Oh! what a fall would be there, my countrymen!
-- They come! --


The door is unlocked. Enter OSMOND, ANGELA, and ALICE. OSM. entering. You have
heard my will, Lady. Till your hand is mine, you quit not this chamber.


ANG. If then it must be so, welcome my eternal prison! -- Yet eternal it shall
not be! -- My hero, my guardian-angel is at liberty! Soon shall his horn make
these hateful towers tremble, and your fetters be exchanged for the arms of
Percy!


OSM. Beware, beware, Angela! -- Dare not before me --


ANG. Before you! before the world! -- Is my attachment a disgrace? No! it is my
pride; for its object is deserving. Long ere I knew him, Percy's fame was dear
to me. While I still believed him the peasant Edwy, often, in his hearing, have
I dwelt upon Northumberland's praise, and chid him that he spoke of our Lord so
coldly! Ah! little did I think that the man then seated beside me was he whom I
envied for his power of doing good, whom I loved for exerting that power so
largely! -- Judge then, Earl Osmond, on my arrival here how strongly I must
have felt the contrast! -- What peasant names you his benefactor? What beggar
has been comforted by your bounty? what sick man preserved by your care? --
Your breast is unmoved by woe, your ear is deaf to complaint, your doors are
barred against the poor and wretched. Not so are the gates of Alnwic Castle;
they are open as their owner's heart.


ALICE. My hair stands on end to hear her!


OSM. Insulting girl! -- This to my face?


ANG. Nay, never bend your brows! -- Shall I tremble, because you frown? Shall
my eye sink, because anger flashes from yours? -- No! that would ill become the
bride of Northumberland.


OSM. Amazement! -- Can this be the gentle, timid Angela?


ANG. Wonder you that the worm should turn when you trample it so cruelly? --
Oh! wonder no more: Ere he was torn from me, I clasped Percy to my breast, and
my heart caught a spark of that fire which flames in his unceasingly!


ALICE. Caught fire, Lady! -- Bless me, I hope you didn't burn yourself?


OSM. Silence, old crone! -- I have heard you calmly, Angela; now then hear me.
Twelve hours shall be allowed you to reflect upon your situation: till that
period is elapsed, this chamber shall be your prison, and Alice, on whose
fidelity I can depend, your sole attendant. This term expired, should you still
reject my hand, force shall obtain for me what love denies. Speak not: I will
hear nothing! -- I swear that tomorrow sees you mine, or undone! and, Skies,
rain curses on me if I keep not my oath! -- Mark that, proud girl! mark it, and
tremble! Exit.


F. PHIL. Heaven be praised, he is gone!


ANG. Tremble, did he say? -- Alas! how quickly is my boasted courage vanished!
-- Yet I will not despair: there is a Power in heaven, there is a Percy on
earth; on them will I rely to save me.


ALICE. The first may, Lady; but as to the second, he will be of no use, depend
on it. Now might I advise, you would accept my Lord's offer: What matters it whether
the man's name be Osmond or Percy? An Earl's an Earl after all; and though one
may be something richer than the other --


ANG. Oh! silence, Alice! -- nor aid my tyrant's designs: rather instruct me
how to counteract them. You have influence in the Castle; assist me to escape,
and be assured that Percy's gratitude and generosity --


ALICE. I help you to escape! Not for the best gown in your Ladyship's
wardrobe! I tremble at the very idea of my Lord's rage; and, besides, had I the
will, I Have not the power. Kenric keeps the keys; we could not possibly quit the
Castle without his knowledge; and if the Earl threatens to use force with you
-- Oh Gemini! what would he use with me, Lady?


ANG. Threatens, Alice! -- I despise his threats! Ere it pillows Osmond's head
will I plunge this poniard in my bosom.


ALICE. Holy fathers! -- A dagger!


ANG. Even now, as I wandered through the Armoury, my eye was attracted by its
glittering handle. -- Look, Alice! it bears Osmond's name; and the point --


ALICE. Is rusty with blood! -- Take it away, Lady! -- Take it away! -- I never
see blood without fainting!


ANG. putting up the dagger. This weapon may render me good service. -- But,
ah! what service has it rendered Osmond! -- Happily 'twas this very poniard which
drank his brother's blood -- or which pierced the fair breast of Evelina! --
Said you not, Alice, that this was her portrait?


ALICE. I did, Lady; and the likeness was counted excellent.


ANG. How fair! -- How heavenly! -- What sweetness, yet what dignity, in her
blue, speaking eyes!


ALICE. No wonder that you admire her, Lady; she was as like you as one pea to
another. But this morning you know I promised to show you her Oratory, and here
I Have brought the key. -- Shall I unlock the door?


ANG. Do so, good Alice! -- Happily for a moment it may abstract my thoughts from
my own sorrows.


F. PHIL. while Alice unlocks the door Will the old woman never be gone? -- I
dare not discover myself in her presence.


ALICE having opened the folding doors, an Oratory is seen, richly ornamented
with carving and painted glass: Angela and Alice enter it. This room has not
been opened since my Lady's death, and every thing remains as she left it.
Look, here is her veil -- her prayer book too, in which she was reading on the
very night before she quitted the Castle, never to return!


F. PHIL. I Am out of all patience.


ALICE. And that guitar! -- How often have I heard her play upon that guitar!
She would sit in yonder window for hours, and still she played airs so sad, so
sweet -- To be sure, she had the finest voice that ever -- During this speech
Angela, who at first looks round with curiosity, throws the veil carelessly
over her face, and, taking the guitar from the table, strikes a few wild and
melancholy notes. Alice, whose back is toward her, turns hastily round,
screams, and rushes from the Oratory. Angela casts the veil and guitar upon the
table, and follows her.


ANG. What alarms you?


ALICE. Is it you, Lady? Let me die, if I didn't take you for the ghost! --
Your air, your look, your attitude, all were so like the deceased Countess,
that -- Well, well! I Will not enter that room again in an hurry! I protest, my
hand trembles so, that I can hardly turn the key!


ANG. How contagious is terror! This silly woman's apprehensions have spread to
my bosom, and scarce can I look round without alarm. The stillness too of
evening -- The wavering and mysterious light which streams through these
painted windows -- And, hark! 'Twas the shriek of the screech-owl, which nests
in the tower above!


ALICE having locked the folding doors Ah! 'twas a sad day for me, when I heard
of the dear Lady's loss! Look at that bed, Lady: -- That very bed was hers.


F. PHIL. Was it so? Oh! ho!


ALICE. How often have I seen her sleeping in that bed -- and, oh! how like an
angel she looked when sleeping! I remember, that just after Earl Reginald --
Oh! Lord! didn't somebody shake the curtain?


ANG. Absurd! It was the wind.


ALICE. I declare it made me tremble! Well, as I was saying, I remember, just
after Earl Reginald had set out for the Scottish wars, going into her room one
morning, and hearing her sob most bitterly. -- So advancing to the bedside, as
it might be thus -- "My Lady!" says I, with a low curtsey, "Is Not your Ladyship
well?" -- So, with that, she raised her head slowly above the quilt, and,
giving me a mournful look -- Here, unseen by Angela, who is contemplating
Reginald 's portrait, Father Philip lifts up his head, and gives a deep groan.


ALICE. Jesu Maria! the devil! the devil! the devil This incident is borrowed
from "The Mysteries of Udolpho," but employed very differently. In the Romance
it brings forward a terrific scene. In the Play it is intended to produce an
effect entirely ludicrous.
! Exit.


ANG. turning round How now? Father Philip rising from the bed -- it breaks
under him, and he rolls at Angela 's feet. -- Good heavens! a man concealed! --
Attempting to pass him, he detains her by her robe.


F. PHIL. Stay, daughter, stay! If you run, I can never overtake you!


ANG. Amazement! Father Philip!


F. PHIL. The very same, and at present the best friend that you have in the
world. Daughter, I came to save you.


ANG. To save me? Speak! Proceed!


F. PHIL. Observe this picture; it conceals a spring, whose secret is unknown
to all in the Castle except myself. Upon touching it, the panel slides back,
and a winding passage opens into the marble hall. Thence we must proceed to the
vaulted vestibule; a door is there concealed, similar to this; and, after
threading the mazes of a subterranean labyrinth, we shall find ourselves in
safety on the outside of the Castle-walls.


ANG. Oh! worthy, worthy Father! quick let us hasten! Let us not lose one
moment!


F. PHIL. Hold! hold! Not so fast. You forget, that between the hall and
vestibule we must traverse many chambers much frequented at this early hour.
Wait till the Castle's inhabitants are asleep. Expect me, without fail, at one;
keep up your spirits, and doubt not of success. Now then I must away, lest the
Earl should perceive my absence.


ANG. Stay yet one moment. Tell me, does Percy --


F. PHIL. I have apprised him, that this night will restore you to liberty, and
he expects you at the fisherman's cottage. Now, then, farewell, fair daughter!


ANG. Good Friar, till one, farewell!


Exit F. Philip through the sliding panel, closing it after him. ANG. This is
thy doing, God of Justice! Receive my thanks. -- Yes, Percy, we shall meet once
more -- shall meet never again to separate! Those dreams shall be realized --
those smiling golden dreams which floated before us in Allan's happy cottage.
Hand in hand shall we wander together through life -- partners in pleasure --
partners in woe -- and when the night of our existence arrives, one spot shall
receive our bodies -- one stone shall cover our grave. -- Allan too, and the
worthy Maud! -- my parents -- my more than parents! -- to smooth the pillow of
their age -- to gild their last hours with sunshine! That thought is heaven.
So glorious are my prospects, that they dazzle me to look on, and scarce can I
believe them really to exist. -- Oh! gracious God! should my brain be
bewildered by fancy -- should I be now the sport of some deceitful dream, seal
up my eyes for ever, never let me wake again! -- I must not expect the Friar
before one. -- Till that hour arrives, will I kneel at the feet of yonder
Saint, there tell my beads, and pray for morning!


END of the THIRD ACT.
ACT IV.
SCENE I. -- The Castle-Hall: The Lamps are lighted.
Enter Father PHILIP. Father PHILIP. IT IS near midnight, and the Earl is
already retired to rest. What if I ventured now to the Lady's chamber? Hark! I
hear the sound of footsteps!


Enter ALICE. F. PHIL. How, Alice, is it you?


ALICE. So! So! -- Have I found you at last, Father? -- I have been in search
of you these four hours! -- Oh! I Have been so frightened since I saw you, that I
wonder I keep my senses!


F. PHIL. So do I; for I Am sure they are not worth the trouble. And, pray, what
has alarmed you thus? I warrant you have taken an old cloak pinned against the
wall for a spectre, or discovered the devil in the shape of a tabby-cat.


ALICE looking round in terror. For the love of heaven, Father, don't name the
devil! or, if you must speak of him, pray mention the good gentleman with
proper politeness. I Am sure, for my own part, I had always a great respect for
him, and if he hears me, I dare say he will own as much.


F. PHIL. Respect for the devil, you wicked woman! -- for that perfidious
serpent -- that crafty seducer --


ALICE. -- Hush! -- Hush! -- Father, you make my teeth chatter with fright. For
aught I know he is within hearing, for he certainly haunts this Castle in the
form of my late Lady.


F. PHIL. Form of a fiddlestick! -- Don't tell me of your --


ALICE. Father, on the word of a virgin, I saw him this very evening in Lady
Angela's bed!


F. PHIL. In Lady Angela's? -- On my conscience, the devil has an excellent
taste! But, Alice! -- Alice! -- how dare you trot about the house at this time
of night, propagating such abominable falsehoods? -- One comfort is, that
nobody will believe you. Lady Angela's virtue is too well known, and I Am
persuaded she woudn't suffer the devil to put a single claw into her bed for
the universe!


ALICE. How you run on! -- Lord bless me, she was not in bed herself.


F. PHIL. Oh! -- Was she not?


ALICE. No, to be sure: But you shall hear how it happened. We were in the
Cedar-room together; and while we were talking of this and that, Lady Angela
suddenly gave a great scream. I looked round, and what should I see but a tall
figure all in white extended upon the bed! At the same time I heard a voice,
which I knew to be the Countess Evelina's, pronounce in an hollow tone --
"Alice! -- Alice! -- Alice!" -- three times. You may be certain that I was
frightened enough. I instantly took to my heels; and just as I got without side
of the door, I heard a loud clap of thunder, and the whole chamber shook as if
tumbling into a thousand pieces!


F. PHIL. Well done, Alice! -- A very good story, upon my word: It has but one
fault -- It Is not true.


ALICE. Ods my life, Father, how can you tell any thing about it? Sure I should
know best; for I was there, and you were not. I repeat it -- I heard the voice
as plain as I hear yours: Do yon think I Have no ears?


F. PHIL. Oh! far from it: I think you have uncommonly good ones; for you not
only hear what has been said, but what has not. Hark! -- the clock strikes
twelve: -- It Is late, and I Am sleepy, so shall bid you farewell for the
present. As to this wonderful story of yours, Alice, I don't believe one word
of it: I Will be sworn that the voice was no more like your Lady's than like
mine; and that the devil was no more in the bed than I was. Therefore, take my
advice, set your heart at rest, and go quietly to your chamber, as I am now
going to mine. -- Goodnight.


ALICE. Goodnight? -- Surely you will not have the heart to leave me in this
terrible situation! -- Suppose Satan should appear to me when I Am alone! --
Sinner that I am, I should certainly die of the fright! -- Good Father, you are
a priest, and an holy man; your habit frightens the evil spirits, and they dare
not come near you: -- Oh! if you will but suffer me to pass the night in your
company --


F. PHIL. Oh! monstrous! -- Oh! impudence unparalleled! -- You naughty, naughty
woman, what could put such thoughts in your head?


ALICE. What Is the matter now?


F. PHIL. Does not my sacred habit inspire you with awe? -- Does not the
exemplary chastity of my past life warn you to conceal such licentious desires?
-- Pass the night with me indeed? -- I Am shocked at the very thought!


ALICE. The man's mad! -- Father, as I hope to be saved --


F. PHIL. Nay! -- Come not near me! -- Offer not to embrace me!


ALICE. I embrace you? -- Lord! Fellow, I wouldn't touch you for the universe!


F. PHIL. Was it for this that you still flattered my person, and declared that
nothing became a man more than a big belly? -- Was it for this that you strove
to win my heart through the medium of my stomach; that you used to come
languishing every day with some liquorish dish; and, while you squeezed my
left hand tenderly, placed a sack-posset in the right? -- Heavens! how
deep-laid were your plans of seduction! -- But mark me, tempter: In vain has
the soup been salted, the ragout seasoned, and the pepper-box shaken with
unsparing hand! My virtue is proof against all your culinary spells; the
fairness of my innocence is still unblemished; and in spite of your luscious
stews and savoury hashes, I retire like a second St. Anthony, victorious from
Temptation's lists!


Exit. ALICE. There, he is gone! -- Dear heart! Dear heart! what shall I do now?
-- It Is past twelve o'clock, and stay by myself I dare not. -- I Will even wake
the laundry-maid, make her sit up in my room all night; and it is hard if two
women a'n't a match for the best devil in Christendom.


Exit. Enter SAIB and HASSAN. SAIB. The Earl then has forgiven me! -- A moment
longer, and his pardon would have come too late. Had not Kenric held his hand,
by this time I should be at supper with St. Peter.


HASS. Your folly well deserved such a reward. Knowing the Earl's hasty nature,
you should have shunned him till the first storm of passion was past, and
circumstances had again made your ministry needful. Anger then would have armed
his hand in vain; for interest, the white-man's God, would have blunted the
point of his dagger.


SAIB. I trusted that his gratitude for my past services --


HASS. European gratitude? -- Seek constancy in the winds -- fire in ice --
darkness in the blaze of sunshine! -- But seek not gratitude in the breast of
an European!


SAIB. Then, why so attached to Osmond? For what do you value him?


HASS. Not for his virtues, but for his vices, Saib: Can there for me be a
greater cause to love him? Am I not branded with scorn? Am I not marked out for
dishonor? Was I not free, and am I not a slave? Was I not once beloved, and am
I not now despised? What man, did I tender my service, would accept the negro's
friendship? What woman, did I talk of affection, would not turn from the negro
with disgust? Yet, in my own dear land, my friendship was courted, my love was
returned. I had parents, children, wife! -- Bitter thought -- in one moment all
were lost to me! Can I remember this, and not hate these white men? Can I think
how cruelly they have wronged me, and not rejoice when I see them suffer? --
Attached to Osmond, say you? Saib, I hate him! Yet viewing him as an avenging
Fiend sent hither to torment his fellows, it glads me that he fills his office
so well! Oh! it is a thought which I would not barter for empires, to know that
in this world he makes others suffer, and will suffer himself for their
tortures in the next!


SAIB. But say, you be one of those whom he causes to suffer, how then? --
Hassan, I will sleep no more in the Lion's den! -- My resolve is taken -- I
will away from the Castle, and seek in some other service that security --


OSM. within. -- What -- Hoa! -- Help! -- Lights there! -- Lights! --


HASS. Hark! -- Surely 'twas the Earl!


OSMOND rushes in wildly. OSM. Save me! Save me! -- They are at hand! -- Oh!
let them not enter! -- Sinks into the arms of Saib.


SAIB. What can this mean? -- See, how his eyes roll! -- How violently he
trembles!


HASS. Speak, my Lord -- Do you not know us?


OSM. recovering himself. -- Ha! Whose voice? -- Hassan's? -- And Saib too
here? -- Oh! Was it then but a dream? -- Did I not hear those dreadful, those
damning words -- Still, still they ring in my ears. Hassan! Hassan! Death must
be bliss, in flames or on the rack, compared to what I have this night suffered!


HASS. Compose yourself, my Lord: Can a mere dream unman you thus?


OSM. A mere dream, say thou? Hassan, 'twas a dream of such horror! Did such
dreams haunt my bitterest foe, I would wish him no severer punishment. Mark you
not, how the ague of fear still makes my limbs tremble? Rolls not my eye, as if
still gazing on the Spectre? Are not my lips convulsed, as were they yet pressed
by the kiss of corruption? Oh! 'twas a sight, that might have bleached joy's
rosy cheek for ever, and strowed the snows of age upon youth's auburn ringlets!
Yet, away with these terrors! -- Hassan, thou said, 'twas but a dream: I was
deceived by fancy. Hassan, thou said true; there is not, there cannot be, a
world to come.


HASS. My Lord! --


OSM. Answer me not! -- Let me not hear the damning truth! -- Tell me not, that
flames await me! -- that for moments of bliss I must endure long ages of
torture! -- Plunge me rather in the thickest gloom of Atheism! -- Say, that
with my body must perish my soul! -- For, oh! should my fearful dream be
prophetic! -- Hark, fellows! -- Instruments of my guilt, listen to my
punishment! -- Methought I wandered through the low-browed caverns, where
repose the relics of my ancestors! -- My eye dwelt with awe on their tombs,
with disgust on Mortality's surrounding emblems! -- Suddenly a female form
glided along the vault: It was Angela! -- She smiled upon me, and beckoned me
to advance. I flew toward her; my arms were already unclosed to clasp her --
when suddenly her figure changed, her face grew pale, a stream of blood gushed
from her bosom! -- Hassan, 'twas Evelina!


SAIB and HASSAN. Evelina!


OSM. Such as when she sank at my feet expiring, while my hand grasped the
dagger still crimsoned with her blood! -- "We meet again this night!" murmured
her hollow voice! "Now rush to my arms, but first see what you have made me! --
Embrace me, my bridegroom! We must never part again!" -- While speaking, her
form withered away: the flesh fell from her bones; her eyes burst from their
sockets: a skeleton, loathsome and meagre, clasped me in her mouldering arms!
--


SAIB. Most horrible!


OSM. Her infected breath was mingled with mine; her rotting fingers pressed my
hand, and my face was covered with her kisses! -- Oh! then, then how I trembled
with disgust! -- And now blue dismal flames gleamed along the walls; the tombs
were rent asunder; bands of fierce specter rushed round me in frantic dance!
-- Furiously they gnashed their teeth while they gazed upon me, and shrieked in
loud yell -- "Welcome, thou fratricide! -- Welcome, thou lost for ever!" --
Horror burst the bands of sleep; distracted I flew hither: -- But my feelings
-- words are too weak, too powerless to express them.


SAIB. My Lord, my Lord, this was no idle dream! -- 'Twas a celestial warning;
-- 'twas your better Angel that whispered -- "Osmond, repent your former
crimes! -- Commit not new ones!" -- Remember, that this night should Kenric --


OSM. Kenric? -- Oh! speak! Drank he the poison?


SAIB. Obedient to your orders, I presented it at supper; but ere the cup
reached his lips, his favorite dog sprang upon his arm, and the liquor fell to
the ground untasted.


OSM. Praised be Heaven! -- Then my soul is lighter by a crime! -- Kenric shall
live, good Saib. What though he quit me, and betray my secrets? Proofs he
cannot bring against me, and bare assertions will not be believed. At worst,
should his tale be credited, long ere Percy can wrest her from me, shall Angela
be mine. Angela! -- Oh! At that name all again is calm in my bosom. Hushed by
her image my tumultuous passions sink to rest, and my terrors subside into that
single fear, her loss! -- I forget that I have waded to her arms through blood;
forget all save my affection and her beauty!


SAIB. You forget too that her heart is another's? Oh! my Lord, reflect on your
conduct while it is yet time; restore the poor Angela to liberty; resign her to
her favored lover --


OSM. Sooner will I resign my life! -- Fellow, you know not what you say: My
heart strings are twisted round the maid; ere I resign her, those strings must
break. If I exist tomorrow night, I will pass it in her arms. -- If I exist?
-- Ha! Whence that doubt? "We meet again this night!" -- So said the Spectre!
-- Dreadful words, be ye blotted from my mind for ever! -- Hassan, to your
vigilance I leave the care of my beloved. Fly to me that instant, should any
unbidden foot-step approach yon chamber door. I Will to my couch again. Follow
me, Saib, and watch me while I sleep. Then, if you see my limbs convulsed, my
teeth clenched, my hair bristling, and cold dews trembling on my brow, seize
me! -- Rouse me! -- Snatch me from my bed! -- I must not dream again. -- Oh!
faithless Sleep, why art thou too leagued with my foes? There was a time, when
thy presence brought oblivion to my sorrows; when thy poppy-crown was mingled
with roses! -- Now, Fear and Remorse thy sad companions, I shudder to see thee
approach my couch! -- Blood trickles from thy garments; snakes writhe around
thy brows: thy hand holds the well-known fatal dagger, and plunges it still
reeking in my breast! -- Then do I shriek in agony; then do I start distracted
from thy arms! -- Oh! how I hate thee, Sleep! -- Friend of Virtue, oh! how I
dread thy coming This scene will doubtless have reminded the Reader of
Clarence's Dream, Richard's Dream, etc.: But it bears a much closer resemblance
to the Dream of Francis in Schil^er's Robbers, which, in my opinion, is
surpassed by no vision ever related upon the Stage. Were I asked to produce an
instance of the terrific and sublime, I should name the Parricide's confession
-- " Ich ^^^nte den M^^n!"
! Exit with Saib.


HASS. alone. -- Yes, thou art sweet, Vengeance! -- Oh! how it joys me when the
white man suffers! -- Yet weak are his pangs, compared to those I felt when
torn from thy shores, O native Africa! -- from thy bosom, my faithful Samba! --
Ah! do thou still exist, my wife? -- Has sorrow for my loss traced thy smooth
brow with wrinkles? -- My boy too, whom on that morning when the man-hunters
seized me, I left sleeping on thy bosom, say, Lives he yet? -- Does he ever
speak of me? -- Does he ask, "Mother, describe to me my father; show me how the
warrior looked I suspect this last idea to be the property of some other
person, but what other person I know not: It is much at the service of any one
who may think it worth claiming.
?" -- Ha! has my bosom still room for thoughts so tender? Hence with them!
Vengeance must possess it all! -- Oh! when I forget my wrongs, may I forget
myself! -- When I forbear to hate these Christians, God of my fathers! may
thou hate me! -- Ha! Whence that light? A man moves this way with a lamp! --
How cautiously he steals along! -- He must be watched. This friendly column
will shield me from his regards. Silence! He comes. Retires.


KENRIC enters softly with a Lamp. KENRIC. All is hushed! -- The Castle seems
buried in sleep. -- Now then to Angela! Exit.


HASSAN advancing. -- It was Kenric! -- Still he moves onwards -- Now he stops
-- It Is at the door of Angela's chamber! -- He unlocks it! -- He enters! --
Away then to the Earl: Christian, soon shall we meet again! Exit.


SCENE II. -- ANGELA's Apartment.
ANGELA stands by the Window, which is open, and through which the Moon is
seen. ANGELA. Will it never arrive, this tedious lingering hour? Sure an age
must have elapsed since the Friar left me, and still the bell strikes not One!
-- Percy, does thy impatience equal mine? Do thou too count the moments which
divide us? -- Do thou too chide the slowness of Time's pinions, which moved
so swiftly when we strayed together on the Cheviot Hills? -- Methinks I see him
now, as he paces the Conway's margin: If a leaf falls, if a bird flutters, he
flies toward it, for he thinks it is the foot-step of Angela: Then, with slow
steps and bending head, disappointed he regains the fisher's cottage. Perhaps,
at this moment, his eyes like mine are fixed on yonder planet; perhaps, this
sweet wind which plays on my cheek, is freighted with the sighs of my Lover. --
Oh! sigh no more, my Percy! -- Soon shall I repose in safety on your bosom;
soon again see the moon shed her silver light on Cheviot, and hea: its green
hills repeat the carol of your mellow horn! SONG.
HOW slow the lingering moments wear!
Ye hours, in pity speed your flight,
Till Cheviot's hills so fresh and fair
Again shall meet my longing sight!
Oh! then what rapture 'twill afford
Once more those scenes beloved to see,
Where Percy's heart first told its Lord,
He loved the Lass of low degree!
No sounding titles graced my name,
No bounteous kinsmen swelled my dower;
But Percy sought no highborn Dame,
But Percy sought not wealth or power.
He sought a fond, a faithful heart,
He found the heart he sought in me;
He saw her pure and free from art,
And loved the Lass of low degree Owing to the great exertions which Angela's
character demanded, Mrs. Jordan omitted this Song.
.
The Castle seems to be still already: -- Would the Friar had named an earlier
hour! -- By this I might have been safe in the fisher's cottage. -- Hark! --
Surely I heard -- Some one unlocks the door! -- Oh! should it be the Earl! --
Should he not retire ere the Monk, arrives! -- The door opens! -- How! --
Kenric here! -- Speak -- What would you?


Enter KENRIC. KENR. Softly, Lady! -- If overheard, I am lost, and your fate
is connected with mine -- placing his lamp upon the table.


ANG. What means this mystery? -- This midnight visit --


KENR. Is the visit of a Friend, of a Penitent! -- Lady, I must away from the
Castle: -- The keys are in my possession: -- I will make you the companion of
my flight, and deliver you safe into the hands of Percy. -- But, ere we depart
kneeling -- Oh! tell me, Lady, will you plead for me with one, who to me alone
owes sixteen years of hard captivity?


ANG. Rise, Kenric -- I understand you not. -- Of what captive do you speak?


KENR. Of one, who by me has been most injured -- who to you will be most dear!
-- Listen, Lady, to my strange narration. -- I was brought up with Osmond --
was the partner of his pleasures -- the confident of his cares. The latter
sprang solely from his elder brother, whose birthright he coveted, whose
superiority he envied. Yet his aversion burst not forth, till Evelina Neville,
rejecting his hand, bestowed hers with her heart on Reginald. -- Then did
Osmond's passion over-leap all bounds. He resolved to assassinate his brother
when returning from the Scottish wars, carry off the Lady, and make himself
master of her person by force. -- This scheme he imparted to me: he flattered,
threatened, promised, and I yielded to his seduction!


ANG. Wretched man!


KENR. Condemn me not unheard. It Is true, that I followed Osmond to the scene
of slaughter, but no blood that day imbrued my hand. It was the Earl whose
sword struck Reginald to the ground: it was the Earl whose dagger was raised to
complete his crime, when Evelina threw herself upon her husband's body, and
received the weapon in her own.


ANG. Dreadful! Dreadful!


KENR. His hopes disappointed by this accident, Osmond's wrath became madness.
He gave the word for slaughter, and Reginald's few attendants were butchered on
the spot. Scarce could my prayers and arguments save from his wrath his infant
niece, whose throat was already gored by his poniard. Angela, yours still wears
that mark.


ANG. Mine? -- Almighty powers!


KEN. Lady, it is true. I concealed in Allan's cottage the heiress of Conway:
There were you doomed to languish in obscurity, till, alarmed by the report of
his spies that Percy loved you, and dreading your meeting with so powerful a
supporter, Osmond decreed your death a second time. With this intention he
sought your retreat; but when in you he beheld Evelina's living image, he
changed his bloody purpose. He caused me to reclaim you from Allan, and
resolved, by making you his wife, to give himself a lawful claim to these
possessions.


ANG. The monster! Now then I know, when he pressed my hand, why still my blood
ran cold! 'Twas nature, that revolted at the fratricide's touch: 'Twas my
mother's spirit, that whispered, "Love not my murderer!" Oh! Good good Kenric!
And you knelt to me for pardon? You, to whom I owe my life! You, to whom --


KEN. Hold! oh! hold! -- Lady, how little do I deserve your thanks! -- Oh!
listen! listen! -- I was the last to quit the bloody spot: Sadly was I
retiring, when a faint groan struck my ear. I sprang from my horse; I placed my
hand on Reginald's heart; it beat beneath the pressure!


Here Osmond appears at the door, motions to Saib, etc. to retire, and advances
himself unobserved. ANG. It beat! It beat! Cruel, and your dagger --


KEN. Oh! that would have been mercy! No, Lady, I preserved his life to rob him
of liberty. It struck me, how strong would be my hold over Osmond, while his
brother was in my power; and this reflection determined me to preserve him,
Having plunged the other bodies in the Conway's stood, I placed the bleeding
Earl's on my horse before me, and conveyed him still insensible to a retreat,
to all except myself a secret. There I tended his wounds carefully, and
succeeded in preserving his life. -- Lady, Reginald still exists. --


Here Osmond with a furious look draws his dagger, and motions to stab Kenric.
A moment's reflection makes him stay his hand, and he returns the weapon into
the sheath. ANG. Still exists, say you? My father still exists?


KEN. He does, if a life so wretched can be termed existence. While his swoon
lasted, I chained him to his dungeon wall; and no sooner were his wounds
healed, than I entered his prison no more. Through a wicket in his dungeon-door
I supplied him with food; and when in plaintive terms he sued to me for mercy,
hasty I fled, nor gave an answer. Lady, near sixteen years have passed, since
an human voice struck the ear of Reginald!


ANG. Alas! alas!


KEN. But the hour of his release draws near: I discovered this night that
Osmond seeks my life, and resolved to throw myself on your mercy. Then tell me,
Lady, will you plead for me with your father? Think you, he can forgive the
author of his sufferings?


ANG. Kenric, you have been guilty, cruel -- But restore to me my father; aid
us to escape; and all shall be forgiven, all forgot.


KEN. Then follow me in silence: I will guide you to Reginald's dungeon: This
key unlocks the Castle gates; and ere the cock crows, safe in the arms of Percy
-- Here his eye falls upon Osmond, who has advanced between him and Angela. She
shrieks, and sinks into a chair Horror! -- The Earl! -- Undone for ever!


OSM. Miscreant! -- Within there!


Enter SAIB, HASSAN, MULEY, and ALARIC. OSM. Hence with that traitor! confine
him in the western tower!


ANG. starting wildly from her seat. Yet speak once more, Kenric! -- Where is
my Father? -- What place conceals him?


OSM. Let him not speak! -- Away with him!


Kenric is forced off by the Africans. OSM. Paces the stage with a furious air,
while Angela eyes him with terror: at length he stops, and addresses her. Nay,
stifle not your curses! Why should your lips be silent when your eye speaks? --
Is there not written on every feature Vengeance on the assassin! Justice on my
mother's murderer? -- But mark me, Angela! Compared to that which soon must be
thine, these titles are sweet and lovely. Know thou the word parricide,
Angela? Know thou their pangs who shed the blood of a parent? -- Those pangs
must be thine tomorrow. This long-concealed captive, this newfound father --


ANG. Your brother, Osmond? -- Your brother? -- Surely you cannot -- will not
--


OSM. Still doubt you, that I both can, and will? -- Remember Kenric's tale! --
Remember, though the first blow failed, the second will strike deeper! -- But
from whom must Reginald receive that second? -- Not from his rival brother! not
from his inveterate foe! -- From his daughter, his unfeeling daughter! It Is
she, who, refusing me her hand, will place a dagger in mine; it is she, whose
voice declaring that she hates me, will bid me plunge that dagger in her
father's heart!


ANG. Man! man! drive me not mad!


OSM. pointing to Reginald 's portrait Look upon this picture! Mark, what a
noble form! How sweet, how commanding the expression of his full dark eye! --
Then fancy that he lies in some damp solitary dungeon, writhing in death's
agonies, his limbs distorted, his eye strings breaking, his soul burdened with
crimes from which no priest has absolved him, his last words curses on his
unnatural child, who could have saved him, but who would not!


ANG. Horrible! horrible!


OSM. Yet if you still reject my offers, thus must it be. Tortures shall compel
Kenric to reveal what dungeon conceals your father; and ere tomorrow dawns
shall Angela lie a bride in my arms, or Reginald a corse at my feet. Nay, spare
entreaties! -- Why should I heed your sorrows? -- You have gazed unmoved upon
mine! -- Why should I be softened by your tears? -- Mine never were dried by
your pity! -- Cold and inflexible have you been to my despair, so will I be to
yours. Speak then, is Percy's love or your father's life most dear to you? --
Does the false mistress or the unnatural child sound most grating in your ears?
-- Must Reginald die, or will Angela be mine?


ANG. Thine? -- She will perish first!


OSM. You have pronounced his sentence, and his blood be on your head! --
Farewell!


ANG. detaining him, and throwing herself on her knees. Hold! hold! -- Oh! --
go not, go not yet! -- Wretch that I am, where shall I fly for succor? --
Mercy, Osmond! -- Oh! mercy, mercy! -- Behold me at your feet, see me bathe
them with my tears! Look with pity on a creature whom your cruelty has bowed to
the earth, whose heart you have almost broken, whose brain you have almost
turned! -- Mercy, Osmond! -- Oh! mercy! mercy!


OSM. Lovely, lovely suppliant! -- And why not profit by the present moment?
Why owe to cold consent what force may this instant give me? -- It shall be so,
and thus -- -- attempting to clasp her in his arms, she starts from the ground
suddenly, and draws her dagger with a distracted look.


ANG. Away! -- Approach me not! -- Dare not to touch me, or this poniard --


OSM. Foolish girl! -- Let me but say the word, and thou art disarmed that
moment.


ANG. But not by thee, Osmond! -- Oh! never by thee! -- Had thou the force of
fabled giants, vainly would thou strive to wrest this dagger from my hand.


OSM. Let this convince you how easily -- Attempting to seize it, his eye rests
upon the hilt, and he starts back with horror. By hell, the very poniard which
--


ANG. in an exulting tone. Ha! have thou sound me, villain? -- Villain, do
thou know this weapon? Know thou whose blood incrusts the point? Murderer,
it flowed from the bosom of my mother!


OSM. Within there! -- Help! -- Hassan and Alaric enter. Oh! God in heaven! He
falls senseless into their arms, and they convey him from the chamber: the door
is locked after them.


ANG. alone. He faints! -- Long may the villain wear thy chains, Oblivion! Long
be it ere he wakes to commit new crimes! -- My father in Osmond's power? -- Oh!
it is a dreadful thought! -- But no, it must not, shall not be! -- I will to
Osmond -- will promise to be his -- will sacrifice my love, my happiness, my
peace of mind -- every thing but my father! -- Yet, to bid an assassin rest
upon my bosom, to press that hand in mine which pierced the heart of my parent
-- Oh! it were monstrous! -- Kneeling before Evelina 's portrait. Mother!
Blessed Mother! If indeed thy spirit still lingers amidst these scenes of
sorrow, look on my despair with pity! fly to my aid! oh! fly, and save my
father! -- She remains for some moments prostrate on the ground in silent
sorrow. The Castle bell tolls the hour: she raises herself and counts the
quarters, after which it strikes "one!" Hark! the bell tolls! -- It Is the time
which the Monk appointed. He will not tarry: -- But I must not follow him! -- I
will not fly and abandon my father! -- Yet may not my flight preserve him? Yes,
yes, I will away to Percy: By the same passage which favors my escape, his
vassals may easily surprise the Castle, may seize Osmond ere he effects his
crime, and tomorrow may see Reginald restored to freedom, to his domains, and
to his daughter! -- Oh! then sweet indeed will be my feelings! -- Then only can
my heart know joy, when it throbs against a father's! -- Ha! what was that? --
Methought the sound of music floated by me! It seemed as some one had struck
the guitar! -- I must have been deceived -- it was but fancy.


A plaintive voice sings within, accompanied by a guitar Lullaby! -- Lullaby!
-- Hush thee, my dear,
Thy father is coming, and soon will be here!
ANG. Heavens! The very words which Alice -- The door too! -- It moves! it
opens! -- Guard me, good Angels!


The folding-doors unclose, and the Oratory is seen illuminated. In its center
stands a tall female figure, her white and flowing garments spotted with blood;
her veil is thrown back, and discovers a pale and melancholy countenance; her
eyes are lifted upwards, her arms extended toward heaven, and a large wound
appears upon her bosom. Angela sinks upon her knees, with her eyes riveted upon
the figure, which for some moments remains motionless. At length the Spectre
advances slowly, to a soft and plaintive strain; she stops opposite to Reginald
's picture, and gazes upon it in silence. She then turns, approaches Angela,
seems to invoke a blessing upon her, points to the picture, and retires to the
Oratory. The music ceases. Angela rises with a wild look, and follows the
Vision, extending her arms toward it. ANG. Stay, lovely spirit! -- Oh! stay
yet one moment!


The Spectre waves her hand, as bidding her farewell. Instantly the organ's
swell is heard; a full chorus of female voices chaunt "Jubilate!" a blaze of
light flashes through the Oratory, and the folding doors close with a loud
noise. ANG. Oh! Heaven protect me! -- She falls motionless on the floor.


END of the FOURTH ACT.
ACT V.
SCENE I. -- A View of Conway Castle by Moonlight.
Enter PERCY and MOTLEY. MOTLEY. IN truth, my Lord, you venture too near the
Castle. Should you fall into Osmond's power a second time, your next jump may
be into a better world.


PERCY. Oh! there is no danger, Motley. My followers are not far off, and will
join me at a moment's warning; then fear not for me.


MOTL. With all my heart, but permit me to fear for myself. We are now within
bow-shot of the Castle. The archers may think proper to amuse us with a proof
of their skill; and were I to feel an arrow quivering in my gizzard, probably I
should be much more surprised than pleased. Good my Lord, let us back to the
fisherman's hut.


PERCY. Your advice may be wise, Gilbert, but I cannot follow it. Angela^s
escape may be discovered -- she may be pursued, and in need of my assistance.
Then counsel not my retiring; my fears of losing Angela are too strong, the
flame which burns in my bosom too ardent!


MOTL. I Am sure no flame burning in your bosom can give you so much pain as an
arrow would give me sticking in mine; and as to your fears of losing the Lady,
I Would bet mine of losing my life against any fears in Christendom!


PERCY. How, Gilbert? Have you not promised to stand by me to the last? Did you
not say you could die in my service with pleasure?


MOTL. Very true. -- But, Lord! if a man was always taken at his word, the
world would soon be turned upside down. When a polite gentleman begs you to
consider his house as your own, and assures you that all he has is at your
disposal, he would be in a terrible scrape if you began knocking down his walls, or
requested the loan of his wife or daughters! -- No, no, Sir! -- When I said
that I should die in your service with pleasure, I intended to live in it many
long years; since, to tell you the truth, from a child I had always a
particular dislike to dying, and I think that with every hour the prejudice
grows stronger. -- Good my Lord, let us be gone. Ere long I doubt not --


PERCY. Hark! Did I not hear -- No! She comes not! -- Heavens, should the
Friar's plot have failed!


MOTL. Failed, and a Priest and a Petticoat concerned in it? -- Oh! no; a plot
composed of such good ingredients cannot but succeed. -- Ugh! Would I were
again seated by the Fisher's hearth! -- The wind blows cruel sharp and bitter!


PERCY. For shame, Gilbert! -- Am I not equally exposed to its severity?


MOTL. Oh! The flame in your bosom keeps you warm; and in a cold night love
wraps one up better than a blanket Sancho makes nearly the same observation
upon sleep.
. But that not being my situation, the present object of my desires is a
blazing wood-fire, and Venus would look to me less lovely than a smoking
sack-posset! -- Oh! when I was in love, I managed matters much better: I always
paid my addresses by the fireside, and contrived to urge my soft suit just at
dinnertime. Then how I filled my fair-one's ears with fine speeches, while she
filled my trencher with roast-beef! -- Then what figures and tropes came out of
my mouth, and what dainties and tid-bits went in! -- 'Twould have done your
heart good to hear me talk, and see me eat -- and you would have found it no easy
matter to decide, whether I had most wit or appetite.


PERCY. And who was the object of this voracious passion?


MOTL. A person well calculated to charm both my heart and my stomach: It was a
Lady of great merit, who did your Father the honor to superintend his culinary
concerns. I was scarce fifteen, when she kindled a flame in my heart, while
lighting the kitchen fire, and from that moment I thought on nothing but her.
My mornings were passed in composing poems on her beauty, my evenings in
reciting them in her ear; for Nature had equally denied the fair creature and
myself the faculty of reading and writing.


PERCY. You were successful, I hope?


MOTL. Why, at length, my Lord, a Pindaric Ode upon her grace in frying
pancakes melted her heart. She consented to be mine -- when, oh! cruel Fortune!
taking one night a drop too much -- poor dear creature! she never got the
better of it! -- I wept her loss, and composed an Elegy upon it, which has been
thought, by many persons of great judgment, not totally destitute of taste and
sublimity. It began thus --


Baked be the pies to coals! -- Burn, roast-meat, burn!
Boil over, ye pots! -- Ye spits, forget to turn!
Cindrelia's death --
PERCY. Peace! peace! -- See you nothing near yonder tower?


MOTL. Yes, certainly. -- Two persons advance toward us -- Yet they cannot be
our friends, for I see neither the Lady's petticoat nor the Monk's paunch!


PERCY. Still they approach, though slowly -- One leans on his companion, and
seems to move with pain. -- Let us retire and observe them.


MOTL. Away, Sir -- I Am at your heel. --


They draw back. Enter SAIB conducting KENRIC. SAIB. Nay, yet hold up a while!
-- Now we are near the Fisher's cottage.


KENR. Good Saib, I needs must stop! -- Enfeebled by Osmond's tortutes, my
limbs refuse to bear me further! -- Here lay me down: Then fly to Percy, guide
him to the dungeon, and, ere it is too late, bid him save the Father of Angela!


PERCY to Motley. -- Hark! Did you hear?


SAIB. Yet, to leave you thus alone! --


KENR. Oh! heed not me! -- Think, that on these few moments depends our safety,
Angela's freedom, Reginald's life! -- You have the master-key! -- Fly then --
oh! fly to Percy!


PERCY starting forward. -- Said he not Reginald? -- Speak again, stranger! --
What of Reginald?


SAIB. Ha! Look up, Kenric! -- It Is Percy's-self!


PERCY and MOTLEY. How! -- Kenric?


KENR. sinking at Percy 's feet. Yes, the guilty, the penitent Kenric! -- Oh!
surely 'twas Heaven sent you hither! -- Know, Earl Percy, that Reginald lives,
that Angela is his daughter!


PERCY. Amazement! -- And is this known to Osmond?


KENR. Two hours have scarcely passed since he surprised the secret. --
Tortures compelled me to avow where Reginald was hidden, and he now is in his
brother's power. -- Fly then to his aid! -- Alas! perhaps at this moment his
destruction is completed! -- Perhaps even now Osmond's dagger --


PERCY. Within there! -- Allan! -- Harold! -- Quick, Gilbert, sound your horn!
-- Motley sounds it.


Enter ALLAN, EDRIC, HAROLD, and Soldiers. PERCY. Friends, may I depend on your
support?


HAR. While we breathe, all will stand by you!


SOLDIERS. All! -- All!


PERCY. Follow me then! -- Away!


KENR. Yet stay one moment! -- Percy, to this grateful friend have I confided a
master-key, which will instantly admit you to the Castle, and have described to
him the retreat of Reginald! -- Be he your guide, and hasten -- Oh! that pang!
-- He faints; Allan and Edric support him.


PERCY. Look to him! -- He sinks! -- Bear him to your hut, Edric, and there
tend his hurts -- To Saib. Now on, good fellow, and swiftly! -- Osmond,
despair! -- I come!


Exit, with Saib, Motley, Harold, and Soldiers on one side, while Allan and
Edric convey away Kenric still fainting on the other. SCENE II. -- A Vaulted
Chamber.
Enter Father PHILIP, with a Basket on his Arm and a Torch, conducting ANGELA.
F. PHIL. Thanks to St. Francis, we have as yet passed unobserved! -- Surely, of
all traveling companions, Fear is the least agreeable: I couldn't be more
fatigued, had I run twenty miles without stopping!


ANG. Why this delay? -- Good Father, let us proceed.


F. PHIL. Ere I can go further, Lady, I must needs stop to take breath, and
refresh my spirits with a taste of this cordial -- taking a bottle from the
basket.


ANG. Oh! not now! -- Think that Osmond may discover me, and mar your kind
intentions. -- This room, you say, conceals the private door: -- Pry'thee,
unclose it! -- Let us from hence! -- Wait till we are safe under Percy's
protection, and then drink as you list. -- But not now, Father! -- In pity, not
now!


F. PHIL. Well, well, be calm, Daughter! -- Oh! these women! these women! --
They mind no one's comfort but their own! -- Now, where is the door?


ANG. How tedious seems every moment which I pass within the sehated walls! --
Ha! Yonder comes a light!


F. PHIL. So, so -- I Have found it at last -- touching a spring, a secret door
flies open.


ANG. It moves this way! -- By all my fears, it is Osmond! -- In, Father, in! --
Away, for Heaven's sake! -- Exeunt, closing the door after them.


Enter OSMOND and HASSAN with a Torch. OSM. after a pause of gloomy meditation
Is all still within the Castle?


HASS. As the silence of the grave.


OSM. Where are your fellows?


HASS. Saib guards the traitor Kenric: Muley and Alaric are buried in sleep.


OSM. Their hands have been stained with blood, and yet can they sleep? -- Call
your companions hither. -- Hassan offers to leave the torch. -- Away with the
light! Its beams are hateful!


Exit Hassan. OSM. alone Yes! this is the place. If Kenric said true, for
sixteen years have the vaults beneath me rang with my brother's groans. -- I
dread to unclose the door! -- How shall I sustain the beams of his eye when
they rest on Evelina's murderer? -- How will his proud heart swell with rage at
meeting his usurping brother! -- Ah! the beams of his eye must long since have
been quenched in tears! -- The pride of his heart must by this be subdued by
sufferings! -- Great have been those sufferings -- in truth so great, that even
my hatred bends before them. -- Yet for that hatred had I not cause? -- At
Tournaments, 'twas on Reginald that each bright eye was bent; at Court, 'twas
to Reginald that each noble proffered friendship. Evelina too! -- Ha! at that
name my expiring hate revives! -- Reginald! Reginald! for thee was I
sacrificed! -- Oh! when it strikes a second blow, my poniard shall stab surer!


Enter HASSAN, MULEY, and ALARIC, with Torches. THE AFRICANS. together My Lord!
My Lord!


OSM. Now, why this haste?


HASS. I tremble to inform you, that Saib has fled the Castle. -- A master-key,
which he found upon Kenric, and of which he kept possession, has enabled him to
escape.


OSM. Saib too gone? -- All are false! All forsake me!


HASS. Yet more, my Lord; he has made his prisoner the companion of his flight.


OSM. starting How? Kenric escaped?


ALARIC. It Is but too certain; doubtless he has fled to Percy.


OSM. To Percy? -- Ha! Then I must be speedy: my fate hangs on a thread!
Friends, I have ever sound ye faithful; mark me now! -- opening the private
door. Of these two passages, the left conducts to along chain of dungeons: In
one of these my brother still languishes. Once already have you seen him
bleeding beneath my sword -- -- but he yet exists. -- My fortune, my love, nay
my life, are at stake! -- Need I say more? -- Each half-unsheathes his sword.
-- That gesture speaks me understood. On then before, I follow you. -- The
Africans pass through the private door: Osmond is advancing toward it, when be
suddenly starts back. -- Ha! Why roll these seas of blood before me? Whose
mangled corse do they bear to my feet? -- Fratricide? -- Oh! it is a dreadful
name! -- Yet how preserve myself and Reginald? -- It cannot be! We must not
breathe the same atmosphere. -- Fate, thy hand urges me! -- Fate, thy voice
prompts me! -- Thou have spoken -- I obey. -- He follows the Africans; the door
is closed after him.


SCENE III. -- A gloomy subterraneous Dungeon, wide and lofty: The upper part
of it has in several places fallen in, end left large chasms. On one side are
various passages leading to other Caverns: On the other is an Iron Door with
steps leading to it, and a Wicket in the middle. Reginald, pale and emaciated,
in coarse garments, his hair hanging wildly about his face, and a chain bound
round his body, lies sleeping upon a bed of straw. A lamp, a small basket, and
a pitcher, are placed near him. After a few moments he awakes, and extends his
arms.
REG. My child! My Evelina! -- Oh! fly me not, lovely forms! -- They are gone,
and once more I live to misery. -- Thou were kind to me, Sleep! -- Even now,
methought, I sat in my Castle-hall: -- A maid, lovely as the Queen of Fairies,
hung on my knee, and hailed me by that sweet name, "Father!" -- Yes, I was
happy! -- Yet frown not on me therefore, Darkness! -- I am thine again, my
gloomy bride! -- Be not incensed, Despair, that I left thee for a moment; I
have passed with thee sixteen years! -- Ah! how many have I still to pass? --
Yet fly not my bosom quite, sweet Hope! -- Still speak to me of liberty, of
light! -- Whisper, that once more I shall see the morn break -- that again
shall my fevered lips drink the pure gale of evening! -- God, thou know that
I have borne my sufferings meekly; I have wept for myself, but never cursed my
foes; I have sorrowed for thy anger, but never murmured at thy will. -- Patient
have I been -- Oh! then reward me! -- Let me once again press my daughter in my
arms! -- Let me, for one instant, feel again that I clasp to my heart a being
who loves me! -- Speed thou to heaven, prayer of a captive! -- He sinks upon a
stone, with his hands clasped, and his eyes bent steadfastly upon the flame of
the lamp.


ANGELA and Father PHILIP are seen through the chasms above, passing along
slowly. ANG. Be cautious, Father! -- Feel you not how the ground trembles
beneath us?


F. PHIL. Perfectly well; and would give my best breviary to find myself once
more on terrafirma. But the outlet cannot be far off: Let us proceed.


ANG. Look down upon us, blessed Angels! -- Aid us! -- Protect us!


F. PHIL. Amen, fair daughter! -- And now away. Exeunt.


REG. after a pause'Tis that door which divides me from happiness. How often
against that door have I knelt and prayed, and ever knelt and prayed in vain!
-- Fearful, lest my complaints should move him from his purpose, my jailer
listens not, replies not: -- Hasty through yon wicket he gives my food, then
flies as if this dungeon held a serpent. -- Oh! then how my heart swells with
bitterness, when the sound of his retiring steps is heard no more, when through
yon lofty chasm I catch no longer the gleam of his departing torch! -- How
wastes my lamp? -- The hour of Kenric's visit must long be past, and still he
comes not. -- How, if death's hand has struck him suddenly? -- My existence
unknown -- -- Away from my fancy, dreadful idea! -- Rising, and taking the lamp
-- The breaking of my chain permits me to wander at large through the wide
precincts of my prison, -- Happily the late storm, whose pealing thunders were
heard even in this abyss, may have rent some friendly chasm: -- Happily some nook
yet unexplored -- Ah! no, no, no! -- My hopes are vain, my search will be
fruitless. Despair in these dungeons reigns despotic; she mocks my complaints,
rejects my prayers, and, when I sue for freedom, bids me seek it in my grave!
-- Death! Oh! Death! how welcome will thou be to me! Exit.


The noise is heard of an heavy bar falling; the door opens. Enter Father
PHILIP and ANGELA. F. PHIL. How Is this? A door?


ANG. It was barred on the outside.


F. PHIL. That we'll forgive, as it was not bolted on the in. But I don't
recollect -- Surely I Have not --


ANG. What Is the matter?


F. PHIL. By my faith, daughter, I suspect that I Have missed my way.


ANG. Heaven forbid!


F. PHIL. Nay, if it is so, I sha'n't be the first man who of two ways has
preferred the wrong.


ANG. Provoking! And did I not tell you to choose the right hand passage?


F. PHIL. Truly, did you; and that was the very thing which made me choose the
left. Whenever I Am in doubt myself, I generally ask a woman's advice. When
she is of one way of thinking, I Have always found that reason's on the other. In
this instance, perhaps, I have been mistaken: But wait here for one moment, and
the fact shall be ascertained. But, perhaps, you fear being alone in the dark?


ANG. I fear nothing, except Osmond.


F. PHIL. Nay, I Have no more inclination to fall into his clutches again, than
yourself. What would be the consequence? You would be married, I should be
hung! Now, daughter, you may think that I Have a very bad taste; but, as I Am a
Christian, I Would rather be married fifty years, than hung for one little
half-hour. Exit.


ANG. How thick and infectious is the air of this cavern! Yet perhaps for
sixteen years has my poor father breathed none purer. Hark! Steps are quick
advancing! The Friar comes, but why in such confusion?


Re-enter Father PHILIP running. F. PHIL. Help! Help! It follows me!


ANG. detaining him What alarms you? Speak!


F. PHIL. His ghost! his ghost! -- Let me go! -- let me go! -- let me go!
Struggling to escape from Angela, he falls, and extinguishes the torch; then
hastily rises, and rushes up the staircase, throwing the door after him.


ANG. alone. Father! Father! Stay, for heaven's sake! -- He Is gone, I cannot
find the door! -- Hark! -- 'Twas the clank of chains! -- A light too! -- It
comes yet nearer! -- Save me, ye powers! -- What dreadful form! -- It Is here!
-- I faint with terror! -- Sinks almost lifeless against the dungeon's side.


Re-enter REGINALD with a lamp. REG. He is gone! -- Emaciated and stiff from
long disuse, scarce can I draw my limbs along, and I strive in vain to overtake
the fugitive.


ANG. recovering herself. Still is it there, that fearful vision!


REG. placing his lamp upon a pile of stones. Why did Kenric enter my prison?
Happily, when he heard not my groans at the dungeon door, he thought that my woes
were relieved by death. Oh! when will that thought be verified?


ANG. How sunk his eye! -- How wildly hangs his matted hair on his pale and
furrowed brow! -- Oh! those are the furrows of anguish, not of age.


REG. I have often wiped away tears, but never caused them to flow; -- often have I
lightened the prisoner's chains, but never increased their burden: -- Yet I am
doomed to chains and tears!


ANG. Each sound of his hollow plaintive voice strikes to my heart. Dared I
accost him -- Yet perhaps a maniac -- No matter; he suffers, and the accents of
pity will flow sweetly in his ears!


REG. Thou art dead, and at rest, my wife! -- Safe in yon skies, no thought of
me molests thy quiet. Yet sure I wrong thee! At the hour of death thy spirit
shall stand beside me, shall close mine eyes gently, and murmur, "Die,
Reginald, and be at peace!"


ANG. Hark! Heard I not -- Pardon, good stranger --


REG. starting wildly from his seat'Tis she! She comes for me! Is the hour at
hand, fair vision? Spirit of Evelina, lead on, I follow thee!


He extends his arms toward her, stagge^s a few paces forwards, then sinks
exhausted on the ground. ANG. He faints! -- perhaps expires! -- Still, still!
-- See, he revives!


REG. It Is gone! Once more the sport of my bewildered brain -- starting up
Powers of bliss! Look, where it moves again! -- Oh! say, what art thou? If
Evelina, speak, oh! speak!


ANG. Ha! Named he not Evelina? That look! -- This dungeon too! -- The emotions
which his voice -- It is, it must be! -- Father! Oh! Father! Father! -- falling
upon his bosom.


REG. Said you? -- Meant you? -- My daughter -- my infant, whom I left -- Oh!
yes, it must be true! My heart, which springs toward you, acknowledges my
child! -- embracing her.


ANG. And is it thus I find you? Burdened with chains, no warmth, no air, no
comfort!


REG. Think of it no more, my dearest! But say, how gained you entrance? Has
Osmond --


ANG. Oh! that name recalls my terrors! -- Alas! you see in me a fugitive from
his violence! Guided by a friendly Monk, whom your approach has frightened from
me, I was endeavoring to escape: We missed our way, and chance guided us to
this dungeon. But this is not a time for explanation. Answer me! Know you the
subterraneous passages belonging to this Castle?


REG. Whose entrance is without the walls? I do.


ANG. Then we may yet be saved! Father, we must fly this moment. Percy, the
pride of our English youth, waits for me at the Conway's side. Come then, oh!
come! -- Stay not one moment longer. -- As she approaches the door, lights
appear above.


REG. Look! look, my child! The beams of distant torches flash through the
gloom!


ANG. Ha! -- Yet, perhaps, ashamed of his desertion, it is but the Monk, who
returns to seek me.


REG. Grant, Heaven, that it may prove so!


OSM. above. Hassan, guard you the door. -- Follow me, friends. -- The lights
disappear.


ANG. Osmond's voice? Undone! Undone! Oh! my father! he comes to seek you,
perhaps to -- Oh! it is a word too dreadful for a daughter's lips!


REG. If he seeks none but me, I am happy: But should your steps have been
traced, my child -- Hark! they come! The gloom of yonder cavern may awhile
conceal you: Fly to it: Hide yourself: Stir not, I charge you.


ANG. What, leave you? Oh! no, no!


REG. Dearest, I entreat, I conjure you, fly! Fear not for me! -- Hark! they
are at the door! Speed to the cavern! Speak not, move not; if possible, breathe
not!


ANG. Father! Oh! Father!


REG. Farewell! perhaps for ever! -- He forces Angela into the cavern, then
returns hastily, and throws himself on the bed of straw. -- Now then to hear my
doom!


Enter OSMOND, followed by MULEY and ALARIC with torches. OSM. The door
unbarred? -- Softly, my fears were false! -- Lo! where stretched on the ground,
straw his couch, a stone his pillow, he tastes that repose which flies from my
bed of down! -- Wake, Reginald, and arise!


REG. You here, Osmond? -- What brings you to this scene of sorrow? -- Alas!
hope flies while I gaze upon your frowning eye! -- Have I read its language
aright, Osmond?


OSM. Aright, if you have read my hatred. Reginald, I bring you truth! -- What
other present could you expect from me? -- Have you not been ever a thorn in my
path, a speck in my sight? -- Was not "Submit to your elder brother," the
galling lesson for ever sounded in my ears? And when I praised some favorite
spot of these domains, some high-browed hill, or blooming valley, was not my
father's answer still, That will be your elder brother's? Yes, the first
thought which struck my brain was, I am a younger son! -- The first passion
which tortured my heart was hate to him who made me one!


REG. Have I deserved that hate? -- You often injured me, but as often I
forgave. -- You were ever my foe, but I never forgot you were my brother.


OSM. Hypocrite!


REG. Was I one when my weapon struck the fierce Scot to the ground, whose
sword already glittered above your head? -- Was I one when, as embarrassed by
your armor you sank beneath the Severn's waves, I sprang into the flood, I
seized, I saved you? -- Twice have I preserved your life! -- Oh! let it not be
for my own destruction! -- See, my brother, the once proud Reginald lies at
your feet, for his pride has been humbled by suffering! -- Hear him adjure you
by her ashes, within whose bosom we both have lain, not to stain your hands
with the blood of your brother!


OSM. aside. He melts me in my own despite!


REG. The fountains of my eyes have been long dried up: I have no tears that
can soften, no eloquence that can persuade; but Heaven has lightnings that can
blast! -- Then spare me, Osmond! -- Kenric has told me that my daughter lives!
-- Restore me to her arms; permit us in obscurity to pass our days together! --
Then shall my last sigh implore upon your head Heaven's forgiveness, and
Evelina's.


OSM. It shall! be so. -- Rise, Reginald, and hear me! -- You mentioned even
now your daughter -- Know, she is in my power; know also, that I love her!


REG. How?


OSM. She rejects my offers. -- Your authority can oblige her to accept them.
-- Swear to use it, and this instant will I lead you to her arms.


REG. Osmond, she is your niece!


OSM. I have influence at Rome -- That obstacle will be none to me. -- What is
your answer? -- You hesitate! -- Say, will you give the demanded oath?


REG. I cannot dissemble, Osmond; I never will This is the third time that
Osmond has asked the same question, and the poor man always receives the same
answer.
.


OSM. How? -- Reflect that your life --


REG. Would be valueless, if purchased by my daughter's tears -- would be
loathsome, if embittered by my daughter's misery. Osmond, I will not take the
oath.


OSM. almost choked with passion. -- It Is enough! -- to the Africans. -- You
know your duty! -- Drag him to yonder cavern! -- Let me not see him die!


REG. holding by a fragment of the wall, from which the Africans strive to
force him. -- Brother, for pity's sake! for your soul's happiness!


OSM. Obey me, slaves! -- Away!


ANGELA rushes in wildly. ANG. Hold off! -- Hurt him not! -- He is my father!


OSM. Angela here?


REG. Daughter, what means --


ANG. embracing him. -- You shall live, Father! -- I will sacrifice all to
preserve you! -- Here is my hand, Osmond! -- It Is yours; but spare my father!


OSM. transported. -- Lovely Angela! --


REG. How, rash girl? -- What would you do?


OSM. Reginald, reflect --


REG. Your uncle! -- Your mother's murderer! -- Remember -- --


ANG. Your life is in danger; I must forget all else. -- Osmond, release my
father, and solemnly I swear --


REG. Hold, girl, and first hear me! -- kneeling. -- God of Nature, to Thee I
call! -- If ever on Osmond's bosom a child of mine rests -- if ever she calls
him husband who pierced her hapless mother's heart, that moment shall a wound,
by my own hand inflicted --


ANG. Hold! -- Oh! hold! -- End not your oath!


OSM. I burn with rage!


REG. Swear never to be Osmond's!


ANG. I swear! --


REG. Be repaid by this embrace!


OSM. Be it your last! -- Tear them asunder!


ANG. Away! -- Away! -- I will not leave him!


OSM. Part them, I say! -- Ha! What noise?


Enter HASSAN hastily. HASS. My Lord, all is lost! -- Percy has surprised the
Castle, and speeds this way!


OSM. Confusion! -- Then I must be sudden. -- Aid me, Hassan! -- Hassan and
Osmond force Angela from her Father, who suddenly disengages himself from Muley
and Alaric.


REG. Friends so near? -- Villains! at least you shall buy my life dearly! --
suddenly seizing Hassan 's sword.


OSM. employed with Hassan in retaining Angela, while Reginald defends himself
against Muley and Alaric. -- Down with him! -- Wrest the sword from him! --
Alaric is wounded, and falls; Muley gives back; at the same time Osmond 's
party appears above, pursued by Percy 's. -- -- Hark! -- They come! --
Dastardly villains! -- Nay then my own. hand must -- -- Drawing his sword, he
rushes upon Reginald, who is disarmed, and beaten upon his knees; when at the
moment that Osmond lifts his arm to stab him, Evelina 's Ghost throws herself
between them: Osmond starts back, and drops his sword.


OSM. Horror! -- What form is this?


ANG. Die! -- Disengaging herself from Hassan, she springs suddenly forwards,
and plunges her dagger in Osmond 's bosom, who falls with a loud groan, and
faints. The Ghost vanishes; Angela and Reginald rush into each other's arms.


ANG. Father, thou art mine again!


Enter PERCY, MOTLEY, SAIB, HAROLD, etc. pursuing Osmond 's Party. All stop on
seeing him bleeding upon the ground. PERCY. Hold, my brave friends! -- See
where lies the object of our search!


ANG. Percy! -- Dear Percy!


PERCY -- flying to her. -- Dearest Angela!


ANG. My friend, my guardian angel! -- Come, Percy, come! embrace my father! --
Father, embrace the protector of your child!


PERCY. Do I then behold Earl Reginald?


REG. embracing him. -- The same, brave Percy! -- Welcome to my heart! -- Live
ever next it.


ANG. Oh moment that o'erpays my sufferings! -- And yet -- Percy, that wretched
man -- He perished by my hand!


SAIB. Hark, he sighs! -- There is life still in him!


ANG. Life? -- Then save him, save him! -- Bear him to his chamber! -- Look to
his wound! -- Heal it, if possible! -- At least gain him time to repent his
crimes and errors! -- Osmond is conveyed away: -- Servants enter with torches,
and the Stage becomes light


PERCY. Though ill-deserved by his guilt, your generous pity still is amiable.
-- But say, fair Angela what have I to hope? -- Is my love approved by your
noble father? -- Will he --


REG. Percy, this is no time to talk of love. -- Let me hasten to my expiring
brother, and soften with forgiveness the pangs of death!


PERCY. And can you forget your sufferings?


REG. Ah! youth, has he had none? -- Oh! in his stately chambers, far greater
must have been his pangs than mine in this gloomy dungeon; for what gave me
comfort was his terror -- what gave me hope was his despair. I knew that I was
guiltless -- knew that, though I suffered in this world, my lot would be happy
in that to come!


And, Oh thou wretch! whom hopeless woes oppress,
Whose day no joys, whose night no slumbers bless!
When pale Despair alarms thy phrensied eye,
Screams in thine ear, and bids thee Heaven deny,
Court thou Religion! Strive thy faith to save!
Bend thy fixed glance on bliss beyond the grave!
Hush guilty murmurs! Banish dark mistrust!
Think there is a Power above! nor doubt that Power is just!
FINIS.
TO THE READER.
MANY erroneous assertions have been made respecting this Drama; some, that the
language was originally extremely licentious; others, that the sentiments were
violently democratic; and others again, that if Mr. Sheridan had not advised me
to content myself with a single Spectre, I meant to have exhibited a whole
regiment of Ghosts. To disprove these reports I have deviated from the usual
mode of publishing Plays, as performed, and have printed mine almost verbatim,
as originally written. Whether it merited the above accusations, the reader has
now had an opportunity of judging for himself. I must just mention that the
last line of the Piece is altered, and that in the Second Scene of the Fifth
Act, The Friar was made to stick in the door-way, whereas he now makes his exit
without difficulty.

Other charges, however, have been brought against me on better grounds, and I
must request the reader's patience while I say a few words respecting them. To
originality of character I make no pretense. Persecuted heroines and
conscience-stung villains certainly have made their courtesies and bows to a
British audience long before the appearance of "The Castle Spectre;" the Friar
and Alice are copies, but very faint ones, from Juliet's Nurse, and Sheridan's
Father Paul, and Percy is a mighty pretty-behaved young gentleman with nearly
no character at all. I shall not so readily give up my claim to novelty, when I
mention my misanthropic Negro: He has been compared to Zanga; but Young's Hero
differs widely from what I meant in Hassan. Zanga's hatred is confined to one
object; to destroy the happiness of that object is his sole aim, and his
vengeance is no sooner accomplished, than he repents its gratification. Hassan
is a man of violent passions, and warm feelings, whose bosom is filled with the
milk of human kindness, but that milk is soured by despair; whose nature was
susceptible of the tenderest affections, but who feels that all the chains of
his affections are broken for ever. He has lost every thing, even hope; he has
no single object against which he can direct his vengeance, and he directs it
at large against mankind. He hates all the world, hates even himself; for he
feels that in that world there is no one that loves him.

Lorsque l'on peut souffrir, sure que ses douleurs
D'aucun mortel ne font jamais color les pleurs,
On se desinteresse a la fin de soi-meme;
On cesse de s'aimer, si quelqu'un ne nous aim!
But though Hassan's heart is changed by disappointment and misfortune, that
heart once was feeling and kind; nor could he hate with such inveteracy, if he
had not loved with extreme affection. In my opinion this character is not
Zanga's; but this I must leave to the public decision. I may, however, boldly,
and without vanity, assert, that Motley is quite new to the Stage. In other
plays the Fool has always been a sharp knave, quick in repartee, and full of
whim, fancy, and entertainment; whereas my Fool (but I own I did not mean to
make him so) is a dull, flat, good sort of plain matter of fact fellow, as in
the course of the performance Mr. Bannister discovered to his great sorrow.

That Osmond is attended by negroes is an anachronism, I allow; but from the
great applause which Mr. Dowton constantly received in Hassan (a character
which he played extremely well), I am inclined to think that the audience was
not greatly offended at the impropriety. For my own part, I by no means repent
the introduction of my Africans: I thought it would give a pleasing variety to
the characters and dresses, if I made my servants black; and could I have
produced the same effect by making my heroine blue, blue I should have made her.

In the Friar's defense, when he most ungallantly leaves Angela in the cavern
to shift for herself, I can only plead the necessity of the case. Stay where he
was he could not; go he must at any rate: I trundled him off in the best way
that I could; and, for the sake of the public, I heartily wish that way had
been better. With regard to his not meeting Osmond in his flight, a little
imagination will soon conquer that difficulty: It may be supposed, that as he
lost his way in coming, he lost it again in going; or, that he concealed
himself till the Earl had passed him; or, that he tumbled down and broke his
neck; or, that he....did any thing else you like better. I leave this matter
entirely to the reader's fancy.

Against my Spectre many objections have been urged: one of them I think rather
curious. She ought not to appear, because the belief in Ghosts no longer
exists! In my opinion, this is the very reason why she may be produced without
danger; for there is now no fear of increasing the influence of superstition,
or strengthening the prejudices of the weak-minded. I confess I cannot see any
reason why Apparitions may not be as well permitted to stalk in a tragedy, as
Fairies be suffered to fly in a pantomime, or Heathen Gods and Goddesses to cut
capers in a grand ballet; and I should rather imagine that Oberon and Bacchus
now find as little credit to the full as the Cock-lane Ghost, or the Spectre of
Mrs. Veal.

Never was any poor soul so ill-used as Evelina's, previous to her presenting
herself before the audience. The Friends to whom I read my Drama, the Managers
to whom I presented it, the Actors who were to perform in it -- all combined to
persecute my Spectre, and requested me to confine my Ghost to the Green-Room.
Aware that without her my catastrophe would closely resemble that of the
Grecian Daughter, I persisted in retaining her. The event justified my
obstinacy: The Spectre was as well treated before the curtain as she had been
ill-used behind it; and as she continues to make her appearance nightly with
increased applause, I think myself under great obligations both to her and her
representative.

But though I am conscious that it is very imperfect, I shall not so far offend
my own feelings, or insult the judgment of the public, which has given it a
very favorable reception, as to say that I think my Play very bad. Had such
been my opinion, instead of producing it on the stage, or committing it to the
press, I should have put it behind the fire, or, throwing it into the Thames,
made a present of it to the British Scombri. Still its success on the stage
(great enough to content even an author) does not prevent my being very
doubtful as to its reception in the closet, when divested of its beautiful
music, splendid scenery, and, above all, of the acting, excellent throughout.
Without detracting from the merits of the other performers (to all of whom I
think myself much indebted for their respective exertions), I must here be
permitted to return particular thanks to Mrs. Jordan, whose manner of
sustaining her character exceeded my most sanguine hopes, and in whose hands my
heroine acquired an importance for which she was entirely indebted to the
talents of the actress.
