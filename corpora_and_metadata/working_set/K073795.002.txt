ADDRESS TO THEODORE MAURICE, ESQUIRE.
DORUS, the present lay is thine,
The tale to Friendship I consign;
To thee, who well do comprehend
The zeal and fervor of a friend:
Thou, who have known my infant Muse,
Since first she could her go-cart use,
This plaything heartily receive,
And smile, and censure, and forgive.
How often does memory enjoy
The sports, that did our days employ,
When gentle HOTCHKIS Upper-Master of the Charterhouse-School, when the Author
was a Student there.
held the rule
Over SUTTON's long-renowned school! THOMAS SUTTON, Esquire. Founder of the
Charterhouse.

Some age ago, whose annals shone
With deathless STEEL and ADDISON:
And in our days from BLACKSTONE's The late eminent Judge BLACKSTONE.
name
Have gathered dignity and fame.
For many a trick, and many a feat,
I love the reverend bound'ry yet;
And can, even now, in thought run over
The gambols I enjoyed before.
I love it for the lore I gained,
For all that pleased, and all that pained;
For tasks of each denomination,
Theme, verse, night study, and translation:
Nay, to this hour, when I engage
With HORACE's or VIRGIL's page,
Right mindful I my tribute pay
Of gratitude to Founder's Day. The Carthusian building -- so called, because
it was originally a Convent of Carthusian Monks.

But chief I love the antique walls,
For that each well-known path recalls
The basis of our friendship laid,
Which has for years stood undecay'd.
What though awhile the Atlantic ran,
With envious course, 'twixt man and man,
No time, no distance could unbind
The sacred league 'twixt mind and mind.
Long may we hail, with honest mirth,
The place which gave our friendship birth,
And, in libation to the school,
When, chatting over a social bowl,
Through life, it seemly may become us
To toast CARTHUSIANA DOMUS. The 12th of December, set apart as a yearly
festival, in honor of the Founder.

THE TALE OF MULEY-ZEYDAN. This Tale is founded on an event in the reign of
LOUIS XIV. of France, during a war, wherein the Algerines refused to exchange
prisoners with him.

HIGH on the rampart MULEY-ZEYDAN stood,
Where the broad main Algiers' strong towers o'erlook,
Pond'ring awhile with fixed eye the flood,
Then to his son his painful silence broke:
II.
Thou see, my boy, yon tall and garish fleet,
How proud their streamers flaunt it to the air,
There Gallic chiefs in warlike councils meet,
And to assail these rugged walls prepare.
III.
What does their master, royal LOUIS, claim?
Only to set war's wretched captives free,
By cartel to conclude the date of shame,
And give the valiant air and liberty.
IV.
The bloody business of the battle over,
The clarion mute, the falchion thrown aside,
The loss of freedom why should they deplore,
And saucy taunts of servile guards abide?
V.
Why daily pore, with dim, desponding eye,
On the worn flint, or damp-impaired wall,
Or through the chink one scanty gleam descry
Of cheering light, which God gave free to all?
VI
"The bloody business of the battle over,"
Each party should accord a full release,
Each captive-mourner to his friends restore,
And with the slaughter bid his sufferings cease.
VII.
Yet this our DEY, severe of soul, denies,
His hands refuse to loose the galling chain;
But keep the imprisoned brave to vent their sighs,
Far from their home, unpitied, and in vain.
VIII.
Nay more -- his unrelenting heart commands
What reason, manhood, tremble but to hear!
Soon as the Gallic fleet her ports expands,
And with their fatal thunders fills the air,
IX.
Before each cannon, which our towers desends,
A captive Frenchman pinioned shall be placed,
Thence to be rendered to their Christian friends,
Or stain with mangled limbs the watery waste.
X.
And must CHOISEUL, the virtuous and the brave,
Enriched with every elegance of mind,
Among the groupe, an undistinguished slave,
To such a barbarous sentence be consigned?
XI.
CHOISEUL -- (who, when I lay, as now does he,
An helpless captive to the chance of war,
No means to soften my calamity,
From thy dear mother's care removed far),
XII.
CHOISEUL beheld me with compassion's eye,
He hastened to relieve a stranger's woes,
To Nature's every craving dealt supply,
And taught my throbbing heart to feel repose.
XIII.
When sickness bound me to a restless bed,
CHOISEUL's assiduous hand was ever near,
At closing night he bound my aching head,
And watched my wakings with a brother's care.
XIV.
And shall this man of matchless virtue sink
To rancour and barbarity a prey?
No -- let me snatch him from destruction's brink,
By supplication to our rigid DEY.
XV.
See, where he stands on yonder turret's height,
To give the signal for his own decree,
And lo! indignant, frowning at his fate,
CHOISEUL first brought for horrid destiny.
XVI.
"Swift let me fly" -- before the obdurate chief
Prostrate he plunged -- "O spare him, spare my friend,
"Regard these tears, this agony of grief,
"And at thy vet'ran's suit his fate suspend!
XVII.
"Have not we been in war together reared,
"Ere since our arms a scymitar could wield,
"Then by the toils, the dangers we have shared,
"In watchful councils, and th'ensanguin'd field.
XVIII.
"Kneeling I thus implore thee, grant the life
"Of brave CHOISEUL; call back that dreadful morn,
"When struggling in the battle's hottest strife,
"And by the tide of conquest overborne,
XIX.
"Thy favorite son was rescued by this hand
"From the gigantic Moor's descending sword;
"Did thou not then, to whatsoever demand
"I might exact, accord thy plighted word?
XX.
"Never did I 'vail me of that service done,
"Never, never, till now, for retribution bend;
"Then do not pause, but grant thy warrior's boon,
"Regard thy plighted word, and save my friend."
XXI.
Fierce from the swelling eye-ball of the DEY
Shot forth indignant sparks of hottest ire,
As 'twixt the clouds red meteors force their way,
And fill the firmament with gleams of fire.
XXII.
"Is it too much to grant this pious grace?
"One only boon is left me then to ask;
"Bind, bind me to him in a close embrace,
"And bid the cannoneer perform his task.
XXIII.
"See, at the fatal point my friend they place,
"Best of the good, the bravest of the brave!
"Thus, thus, I clasp him in this last embrace,
"And perish with the man I could not save."
XXIV.
The DEY abhors to give the cruel sign,
Down to the platform rushing he descends,
Mild drops of mercy on his visage shine,
As with amazement he surveys the friends.
XXV.
"What sense is this," the altered man exclaims,
"What warmth, unfelt till now, pervades my heart?
"The wondrous ardour which your souls inflames,
"To me its sudden influence does impart.
XXVI.
"Untwine that churlish misbeseeming cord!
"Live for each other! long and happy live!
"The mutual transport, which I thus afford,
"Not to my promise, but thy worth I give.
XXVII.
"Ye Gallic chiefs, take ransomeless the rest,
"Bid your bold prows exulting cleave the wave,
"The FORCE OF FRIENDSHIP this barbarian breast
"Has taught to feel, to pity, and to save."
TALE THE NINTH.

MUTUAL SELF-REPROOF: OR, THE TALE OF CADWAL.

IN TWO PARTS.

The candid mind, by acknowledging and discarding its faults, has reason and
truth for the foundation of all its passions and desires, and consequently is
happy. SPECTATOR. INTRODUCTION.
WHAT! -- shall the Muse, in labored rhymes,
Retrace events of former times,
And shall no duteous verse attend
On him who was my earliest friend?
Forbid it every feeling good,
Obedience, love, and gratitude!
Remembrance bears his image strong
And perfect, as when life was young;
His image rough, his mien austere,
His heart kind, tender, and sincere;
Even now he seems to meet my sight,
And fancy trembles with delight.
Often, when at eve I trace the glade,
My mind pourtrays him in the shade,
And often benignant smiles he beams,
Presiding over my midnight dreams.
Still, SIRE BELOVED, my fancy fill,
Exert thine influence over me still,
Still through my soul thy virtues stream,
And mingle with life's latest dream,
Till, winged for yon aetherial plain,
I seek thy loved embrace again.
THE TALE OF CADWAL.
PART I.
I.
DARK December was the month,
The air was dank and chill,
When CADWAL's weary foot had reached
The summit of the hill;
II.
Beneath whose ample verge he wont
To labor at the plough,
And, to relieve his father's age,
Bedew his infant brow.
III.
When eighteen years had over him passed,
He left his rustic home,
(Sore-smote with grief) in distant grounds,
And stranger-fields to roam.
IV.
Twelve winters had his exile seen,
When lo! his bosom burns
Again to clasp his father's knees,
And homeward he returns.
V.
And now descending to the vale,
With slow and trembling feet,
Re-viewing this, his native soil,
The pulses fluttering beat.
VI.
And now with penetrating eye,
He pierces the close dell,
Where in his thatch-beshelter'd cot
His Sire did whilom dwell.
VII.
Yet in his sad and troubled look,
Such terror might ye see,
As when we almost wish to shun
The thing, we wish should be.
VIII.
He pryed here, he pryed there,
No cottage could he spy,
Nor smallest trace of human tread
Appeared to his eye.
IX.
No monarch of the feathered brood
Was heard aloud to crow,
Nor labored ox the vocal air
Awaken with his low.
X.
In strange amazement and suspense
Awhile benumbed he stood,
Then fell, despairing on the earth,
And wept, and wail'd aloud.
XI.
His piercing cries an hermit drew
Forth from his lonely cell,
Whose pliant sense was quick to feel
Affliction's poignant yell.
XII.
Compassion held him mute at first,
While as he pondered him
With fixed eye, where nature's floods
Up-swelled to the brim.
XIII.
Then thus -- "My son, your plaints I heard,
"They smote me to the heart,
"To me, without reserve or fear,
"The weighty cause impart.
XIV.
"Deep-vers'd in sorrow's plaintive task
"Full many a weary hour,
"Right well I know what aggravates,
"And what abates its power.
XV.
"Close-pent within restraining bounds,
"The river foams and roars,
"Tumultuous boils with mighty heaves,
"And wounds its kindred shores,
XVI.
"The load removed, that choked its course,
"The violence subsides,
"The tumult lessens by degrees,
"And smooth the current glides.
XVII.
"Give, then, the struggling griefs to flow,
"Which thy clogged heart oppress,
"Each word will take a part away,
"And make the burden less."
XVIII.
'Old CADWAL here distraught I seek,
'Here CADWAL dwelt of yore,
'Here, here, his quiet cottage rose,
'But now is here no more.'
XIX.
"Old CADWAL seek'st thou? Hapless man!
"New torments must thou have --
"Beneath this venerable elm,
"Behold the rustic's grave!"
XX.
'Oh! wretch accurs^d I was the cause,
'I 'reft him of his breath,
'I robbed these fields of CADWAL's worth,
'I brought him to his death.
XXI.
'Was he not to his various kin,
'(Unworthy I alone!)
'Was he not guardian, comforter,
'Friend, father, all in one?
XXII.
'What honest hind, that near him toiled,
'But of his store partook?
'Was he not to the needy swain,
'As to the mead the brook?
XXIII.
'Did he not deal to all around
'His smile as well as care?
'Not even the sparrow of the hedge,
'But in his love had share.
XXIV.
'And, wretch accursed! I was the cause,
'I 'reft him of his breath,
'I robbed these fields of CADWAL's worth,
'I brought him to his death.'
XXV.
"Too rigidly, perchance, my son,
"Thyself thou do accuse,
"And heapest on thy burdened heart
"Unnecessary woes.
XXVI.
"Ah! how severe the punishment,
"When we ourselves arraign!
"And hatred often, and malice 'self,
"Inflict a milder pain.
XXVII.
"Less harshly censure thy offense,
"(Some youthful warmth, I ween!)
"And give it to mine ear in terms
"Soft, candid, and serene.
XXVIII.
"Here on this bank repose awhile,
"And bid these tumults cease;
"With thine I Will mix my social tears,
"And sooth returning peace."
XXIX.
'Ah, father! this thine holy love
'Embitters what I feel;
'Unwittingly thou add'st a sting
'To sorrows thou would heal.
XXX.
'Here on this bank, what precious hours
'I've known in days of youth,
'List'ning the precepts that he gave
'Of wisdom and of truth!
XXXI.
'Here in the sweetly-tranquil eve,
'(Day's rugged labor done)
'He'd tell how good and glorious men
'Life's arduous race had run.
XXXII.
'What tides of blood had washed these lands,
'Which we in peace had tilled,
'And how the faithful rustic once
'Great ALFRED here concealed.
XXXIII.
'But, oh! my grief-bewilder'd mind
'From reason wanders far,
'And with vague fancies idly mocks
'Thy kind, thy pious care.'
XXXIV.
"Heed not, my son -- use any means
"That may assuage thy pain;
"It is the privilege of woe
"At random to complain.
XXXV.
"And who of patient sympathy
"The liberal largess scant,
"Withold a bounty, great I ween
"As Wealth can shower on Want.
PART II.
I.
'OLD CADWAL here distraught I seek --
'Ah me! this wayward heart!
'That dared oppose a father's power,
'That dared his counsel thwart!
II.
'But EMMA's charms had won my love,
'And made it all her own;
'I sought not copious flocks and meads,
'I sought Content alone.
III.
'And oh! so sweetly she conformed
'To all I wished or said,
'You would have sworn our hearts, as twins,
'Were for each other made.
IV.
'And was it, holy father, say,
'Was it a crime to love,
'Or to my early-plighted vows
'Unchang'd and steady prove?
V.
'MATILDA'S lofty friends in store
'Of riches did abound,
'And ample sheaves enriched their meads,
'And orchards rose around;
VI.
'And those possessions, every hour,
'Were poured into mine ear,
'To count them over my father made
'His morn and evening care.
VII.
'Sure, if he any sailing had,
'Twas too fond love for me,
'Hence sprang the wish that of her fields
'I should the master be:
VIII.
'And as he wished, and as he bade,
'O! that I could have done!
'But EMMA'S charms had won my love,
'And made it all her own.
IX.
'Say, father, ought I in the church
'Have joined MATILDA'S hand,
'When love and truth, that should attend,
'Were not at my command?
X.
'Her spacious granaries -- to me
'They no allurement were;
'My EMMA's low-roof'd dairy-hut
'To me was dearer far.
XI.
'Why after large possessions seek?
'My father knew no want;
'Of copious tributes from the field
'His barns were nothing scant.
XII.
'But 'twas his will! -- and oh! that I
'That will could have obeyed,
'Without the guilt of broken vows,
'Or EMMA's peace betrayed!
XIII.
'Now that my frowardness of heart
'Hath brought him to his end,
'For this beside yon hallowed sod
'In duteous wise I Will bend:
XIV.
'For this, will daily wet the turf
'With my repentant eye,
'Nor ever from this solitude
'To fairer refuge fly.'
XV.
"Son," quoth the sage, and cast a look
As chilled the youth all over;
(While minutes past, ere vital warmth
His senses did restore) --
XVI.
"Son," quoth the sage, "thy doubts suspend,
"Their swelling tumults check,
"It is thy father clasps thee thus,
"And weeps upon thy neck.
XVII.
"Long have I held thee in discourse
"With pent-up agony;
"Now let my gushing tears have way,
"They Are blessings shower'd on thee.
XVIII.
"Charmed with thy duteous excellence,
"Thy strength of filial love,
"My full forgiveness let these streams
"And warm embraces prove!
XIX.
"And oh! can thou forgive the cause
"That drove thee from thy home,
"Sore-smote with grief, in distant grounds,
"And stranger-fields to roam?"
XX.
'Can I forgive? -- Oh! father, such
'Unseemly terms restrain;
'Can I forgive? -- It is enough,
'I see thee once again.
XXI.
'But said thou not, beneath yon elm' --
"My dearest son, I did;
"There have I marked my chosen spot,
"There made my latest bed.
XXII.
"Of thee berest, what booted it,
"To tend the furrowed plain,
"Or what from Autumn's fruitful lap
"To heap the ripened grain?
XXIII.
"Whom had I then to cheer my steps
"In Summer's sultry rays?
"For whom should then the social hearth
"In winter-ev'ning blaze?
XXIV.
"My house, my barns, I left at large
"To moulder and decay;
"Yon humble tenement I raised,
"My age's only stay.
XXV.
"Enough for me, who meant forlorn
"To pass life's dragging eve,
"My task, to meditate and pray --
"My punishment, to grieve.
XXVI.
"For oh! my son! too late I felt
"This truth within my heart,
"That to compel the filial mind
"Is not a parent's part.
XXVII.
"And hence this penitential garb,
"And hence these silver hairs,
"Whose hoary length the sad recluse
"Or pensive hermit wears.
XXVIII.
'Dear, honored father, droop no more,
'Thus, on my bended knee,
'I crave, I claim -- renounce thy griefs,
'Cast, cast them all on me.
XXIX.
'With unremitting love and care
'Thy sorrows I Will assuage,
'And with obsequious duty tend
'The remnant of thy age.'
XXX.
"Arise, my son, and to my cell
"Together let us wend,
"Let us beneath one roof embrace,
"Ere yet my days shall end.
XXXI.
"And shall the thought of EMMA's love
"No more suffuse thine eye,
"Nor chide thy father for her loss?" --
'She's buried in this sigh!'
XXXII.
"What wondrous bliss to virtuous minds
"Will Heaven not deign to lend?
"Within my homely hut, my son,
"There all thy sorrows end.
XXXIII.
"There, there, still sweetly-fair, once more
"Thy EMMA shall thou see,
"Within my homely hut she dwells,
"My age's comfort she.
XXXIV.
"Her father dead, I filled his place,
"The guardian of her youth,
"I now restore her to thy love,
"Thy wishes, and thy truth."
XXXV.
Young CADWAL waited not for more,
But to his EMMA flew,
Wherc locked awhile in close embrace,
Each to the other grew.
XXXVI.
From incoherent words and sighs
Such wondrous transports brake,
Far more than honey'd Eloquence
With all her tongues could speak.
XXXVII.
And now with strong enquiring look
They search each other's eye,
To ask if what they see be true,
And doubt the real joy.
XXXVIII.
Anon the father's quickening steps
They greet with bended grace,
And with uplifted eyes adore,
And bless his reverend face.
XXXIX.
"Now, by this hallowed Eve I vow, Probably Christmas-Eve, as December is the
month mentioned in the opening of the Tale.

"Soon as the mass be done,
"The next ensuing holy day
"The priest shall make ye one.
XL.
"And ye shall live (so Heaven permit!)
"To cast one gleam of light
"Athwart your father's gathering eve,
"Or ere he sink in night;
XLI.
"Or ere beneath yon aged elm
"He Is numbered with the dead,
"The chosen spot, where his own hands
"Have made his latest bed.
XLII.
"But while some hours of life are lent,
"By gratitude and prayer,
"Repentant of my errors past,
"Those errors I Will repair:
XLIII.
"And often as I recount them over,
"Thy steady faith I Will praise,
"And for my dearest boy once more
"The social hearth shall blaze.
XLIV.
"Age, even as youth, thou see, my son,
"Is liable to fall,
'And Self-reproof and Penitence
"Alike beseem us all." This Tale of CADWAL, having been, through mistake,
forgotten to be mentioned in the Preface, it is proper to do it now. It was
printed many years ago, in a Collection of Letters; but was read by so few, at
that time, that the Author has been induced to make it part of this Publication.

TALE THE TENTH.

RETRIBUTION: OR, THE TALE OF DURAND.

Blessed is he who considers the Poor and Needy. PSALMS ADDRESS TO MRS. B --.
CHARLOTTE, to thee, whose gentle breast
Of innate goodness is possessed,
To thee a friendly Muse appeals
For truth of what her Tale reveals.
From Gallia's once delightful shore
Thy Sire The late John Rich, Esquire. Patentee of the Theater Royal, Covent Garden.
the sacred symbol bore,
And often exulted to expand,
The test of an Almighty hand,
The wondrous test of bounty given
To humble worth by favoring Heaven.
Thy Sire! the well-remember'd name
Lays on the Muse a sacred claim
To speak his fascinating power,
Who waked to glee the scenic hour;
The private walk of life endeared,
And many an aching bosom cheered;
Who lived applauded and approved,
And died regretted and beloved.
This thy dear parent's well-earn'd praise
Deserves the mead of richer lays.
Here might the Muse with volant quill
From COWLEY COWLEY, near Uxbridge, the seat of the late Mr. RICH.
pass to sweet Rose-Hill, Rose Hill, at Hampton, in Middlesex, the name of Mr.
BEARD's Villa.

With Memory take a random flight,
Whirled in delirium of delight;
Dwell on the name of JOHNNY BEARD,
The friend, who every spot endeared;
Recording the familiar chat,
Often "here he strayed," and "there he sat;"
Or, all beneath yon aged oak,
He twirl'd the pun, or coined the joke;
Or lengthened out the evening walk
On subjects grave, in moral talk;
Or cheerly waked the rosy morn
With chaunting clear his early horn.
Of more exalted worth the Muse would speak,
But needless were the task, and words too weak,
For his innate benevolence of soul,
Fond to dispense the charitable dole,
That energy, wherewith he sought the haunt
Of crippled age, of malady, or want, Mr. BEARD might, with great propriety and
truth, have adopted the phrase, (which that ingenious writer, Mr. CUMBERLAND,
has put into the mouth of Sheva, in his Comedy of the Jew) "I do not ta^k of
charity, I feel it."

And all the virtues which the Muse could find
Lodged in the casket of his consort's mind,
(Which scarce a MASON's pen could amply grace)
Will be recorded in a better place.
THE TALE OF DURAND.
WITHIN the placid Isle of France, The Isle of France is that peculiar Province
wherein the city of Paris stands, and obtained the name of an Island from its
situation, which lies between the rivers Seine, Marne, Oise, and Aisne. The
soil is in general remarkably fertile.

Scene once of taste and elegance,
(When Paris, from her regal bound,
Gave fashions to a world around)
DURAND resided, frugal swain,
And cultured his paternal plain;
With daily care he dressed the land,
And earned his food from Nature's hand.
Contented with his humble state,
He envied not the rich or great.
Each morn he rose, with decent pride
His comfortable roof he eyed,
The garden's growth surveyed with care,
Admired each useful product there;
Now traced, with an enamored look,
The sweetly-winding, limpid brook;
Marked where his fertile meads extended,
By woods from eastern blasts defended;
Then on his grateful knees would fall,
And thank the bounteous LORD OF ALL.
In his plain heart much room had he
For well placed liberality;
Bounteous, not lavish of his pelf,
He loved his neighbor as himself;
But at distress or hunger's call,
He showed himself a friend to all.
With daily toil his ground he tilled,
With constant care each season filled;
From his own hand each eve he fed
The labored ox, and weary steed,
And with endearing touch, approved
The labors of the beast he loved.
JEAN shared the drudg'ry of the field,
MANON domestic duties filled,
Dear children of a dearer wife!
The gentle sweetners of his life.
To Matins and to Vespers true,
They paid their Maker homage due;
On Sabbath Days, with fervent mind,
The public worship constant joined,
And, in the evening sports, were seen
To join the dance upon the green.
Such was the custom, such the lore,
Parisians used in days of yore:
But decent pastimes now are done;
Rule, order, nay, religion gone;
The very name of Sabbath flown,
And Decads count their time alone.
But I digress -- the good DURAND,
Rich in the tribute of his land,
(As all the neighboring farmers were,
Who dwell'd within that Province fair)
With honest pride rejoiced to see
The produce of his industry.
One year (unwonted in that Isle)
Incessant rains oppressed the soil,
The seed even perished in its birth,
And Nature owned a general dearth.
AVARE, with wealth and pride o'ergrown,
Who knew no interest but his own,
Who never sought the dreary shed,
Where Want reclined his aching head,
Who could rebuke, with ruthless lower,
The famished stranger from his door,
Beheld the dearth with joyous look,
And thus the neighboring swains bespoke:
"Now is the time for us, my friends,
"To use our stores for wisest ends;
"'It Is our's the price to regulate,
"And fix it at the highest rate.
"Fools only such occasions lose,
"And Fortune's proffered means a buse;
"The thrifty are the truly wise,
"Who watch each change with wary eyes,
"Each distant means of gain discern,
And to their own advantage turn."
DURAND heard all, but homeward sped
With musing gait, and downcast head,
And at the closing hour of rest,
The great Creator thus addressed:
"Father of All, who know my heart,
"Search, and correct each sinful part!
"Never may illegal thirst of gain,
"Or sordid craft my bosom stain!
"If ever accumulated store
"Make me against Misery close my door,
"For worthier beings, oh! reserve
"The blessings I should ill deserve!
"Of means to succor while possessed,
"If rigor steel my callous breast,
"Let me the want I slight endure,
"And make me poorest of the poor!
"But now, while scarcity prevails,
"And Nature's wonted bounty fails,
"Ought I from treasured hoards refuse
"A moderate share for general use,
"Or added profit dare to grind
"From the afflictions of mankind?
"No -- what thy bounty heaped on me,
"To others I Will distribute free;
"And if I act as I profess,
"May thou the resolution bless!"
He spoke, and felt the dew of sleep
In soft repose his senses steep,
In blissful dreams he passed the night,
And cheerly hailed returning light;
But cold and dreary looked the ground,
A melancholy blank around:
Instead of Autumn's golden grain,
A barren Winter seemed to reign.
DURAND beheld his neighbour-band
For small supplies make high demand,
Yet sanctimoniously he kept
The promise plighted ere he slept;
With scorn the profit he declined
Wrung "from the affliction of mankind."
At easy rates his grain he shared,
Nay, something to the needy spared;
Thus, in relieving others blessed,
Smiled, and enjoyed unbroken rest.
But mark what miracles appear
To signalize the ensuing year!
Let not the doubting, or the bold,
Deride the wonders I unfold,
For lips, that never knew deceit,
To me the story did repeat,
And made each heart with pleasure thrill,
In sweet discoursings, at Rose-Hill.
The ensuing Autumn saw the ground
In grain of every kind abound;
Each husbandman, with joy, beheld
The swelling product of his field;
But chief DURAND -- before whose view
(Scarce crediting the vision true)
Each rising stem was seen to bear,
Replete with grain, a TRIPLE ear. This was the symbol alluded to in the
Address. Mr. RICH was not only an eye witness to this wonderful production in
its state of vegetation, but likewise brought several of them to England, and
showed them to all his visitors.

And none, save his prolific field,
So plenteous a display did yield.
The marvel quickly gathered fame,
From distant quarters numbers came:
All gazed with wonder; some with spite;
Some with extravagant delight;
Tend'ring a gratulating hand
To the loved owner of the land.
DURAND, the merciful and good,
In silence breathed his gratitude; --
AVARE, who mingled in the crowd,
Astounded stood; -- then thus aloud:
"Often have I dared, in accents rude,
"Deny the existence of a GOD;
"Too often absurdly dared advance
"That all is the effect of Chance;
"But wonders, such as here are shown,
"Must spring from Power Divine alone.
TALE THE ELEVENTH.

THE TEST OF LOVE: OR, THE TALE OF EDWARD AND ORRA.

ADDRESS TO W. WILBERFORCE, ESQUIRE. M. P.
I.
To thee, much-honour'd WILBERFORCE,
A stranger-Muse her tribute pays,
And aims thy merits to record
In weak, but well-directed praise.
II.
To thee, of right, the Tale belongs,
Whose pitying heart partakes the pain
Of wretches, who, in distant lands,
Are galled with Slav'ry's rankling chain.
III.
On thy persuasive choice of words,
And the mild accents of thy tongue,
With mute attention and delight
Often has a British Senate hung.
IV.
To pity woes which we have felt,
A partial virtue only proves,
And he who serves a friend distressed,
But mitigates the heart he loves;
V.
But who compassionates the fate
Of suff'rers, whom he never has known;
This universal love displays,
This, WILBERFORCE, is all thine own.
VI.
Oh! had I but the power of verse,
Might with a MASON's talents vie,
Thy firm, disinterested zeal,
Oh! MISERY's FRIEND, should never die!
INTRODUCTION.
I.
THY favors, Nature, goddess dear!
Are not to place or sphere confined,
To shape, complexion, or degree;
They Are dealt, at large, among mankind.
II.
Whatever in station, title, dress,
Bright and respectable we find,
Nature the brilliant polish gives,
That graces and exalts the mind.
III.
COLIN, by birth decreed to share
The servile labors of the field,
Or watch, beneath the milker's hand,
His herds their steaming fullness yield:
IV.
When by his few selected friends
Encircled, at his homely board,
Displayed an elegance of mind
That might have graced the proudsst lord.
V.
COLIN had gracious been, and mild,
Though born over Tartars rude to reign;
And GEORGE been pious, great, and good,
Though born an humble village swain;
VI.
The attributes to regal sway
A cold obedience may invite,
But it is the goodness of his heart
That to obedience adds delight.
VII.
Natives of Europe, wherefore boast
The fair complexion of a skin,
It Is not how climates act without,
But, how great Nature works within:
VIII.
The beauteous tint which she displays
Engages Wisdom's sober eye,
Beyond the fairest outward form,
That blooms beneath our milder sky.
IX.
Nay, Love itself has shone as bright,
As pure, as tender, and as true,
Beneath an Afric's sable breast,
As ever British bosom knew.
X.
How hearts of Moorish climes have loved,
How long, how constant, and how well,
Let EDWARD's and his ORRA's Tale
In plain and simple numbers tell.
THE TALE OF EDWARD AND ORRA. All the principal events, whereon this Tale is
founded, occurred in a private family in the City of London, and that so
recently as about the middle of the present century.

PART I.
I.
WITHIN Angola's regal bounds,
On Afric's wild and sultry waste,
Were JUBA and his ORRA born,
And life's brief morn together passed.
II.
Yet on that drear uncultur'd soil,
Nature their tender minds impressed
With early sense of right and wrong,
And poured her softness over each breast.
III.
Or ere ten years had crowned their youth,
From kin and country were they torn,
For sordid ore to slavery sold,
To strange and different climates borne.
IV
Mates in their infant sports, they grieved
When sunder'd from each other's side,
And with their tears a farewell took,
As either vessel cut the tide.
V.
She, by the master of her fate,
Was landed on Barbado^s' Isle,
There to a wealthy merchant sold,
'Mid groups of fellow-slaves to toil.
VI.
And many a heavy hour she passed,
As over her painful task she hung,
And sometimes thought of JUBA lost,
And now she wept, and now she sung.
VII.
The music of her plaintive voice
Attracted every listening ear,
And her demeanor, meek and kind,
To each good heart made ORRA dear.
VIII.
But chief her younger mistress' breast
Her ditties wild to pity moved,
As through the circuit of the grounds
The gentle ANNA daily roved.
IX.
Some three years more advanced in age,
Often would the British Maiden stray
Where patient ORRA plied her task,
To listen to her artless lay.
X.
At her request, the tender Moor
Was from the field of labor led,
From scorching suns, and rulers harsh,
And to domestic duties bred.
XI.
Here, all she was prescribed to learn
With docile cheerfulness attained,
Unconscious of her own desert,
She daily praise and favor gained.
XII.
And when her evening task was over,
Oft-time would ANNA soothe her forth
To wander in the cedar-grove,
And learn the story of her birth.
XIII.
As often in tears would ORRA tell,
Of parents to her heart scarce known,
Who sent her into stranger lands,
Unblessed, unfriended, and alone.
XIV.
Hence an attachment mutual grew,
Nor could a sister's love be more,
Than ANNA's susceptible heart
To poor deserted ORRA bore.
XV.
Here ORRA found a better home
For many a rising happy year,
Dear to the equals of her state,
Nor less to her superiors dear:
XVI.
And here fidelity and love
Attached and lengthened ORRA's stay,
Until with mingled smiles and tears,
She witnessed ANNA's bridal day.
PART II.
I.
MEANTIME the ship, which JUBA bore,
To mild Virginia's harbor sailed,
There a new master JUBA owned,
Whose desperate schemes in traffic failed;
II.
Whether 'twere ignorance, or neglect,
Or dissipation thinn'd his gold,
But all his hopes were scattered wide,
Slaves, lands, and buildings, all were sold.
III.
When, for integrity renowned,
And sense above his servile sphere,
JUBA (so Fate ordained) allured
The notice of the British Peer,
IV.
Who then by equitable laws
Virginia's rich plantation swayed,
And in his lord's esteem and love
A daily progress JUBA made;
V.
For in all knowledge, that became
His station, an adept he grew,
True to the talents Nature lent,
And to his master's interest true.
VI.
Approved, instructed, and beloved,
An easy servitude he wore;
And by his lord was still retained
When home recalled to Britain's shore.
VII.
The Peer, right noble by descent,
But nobler in a generous mind,
Lamenting that a virtuous heart
Should be in slavish bonds confined;
VIII.
When settled in his native land,
His faithful JUBA thus addressed,
(Who in his master's cital kneeled,
With sore dismay, and doubt oppressed:)
IX.
"Rise, faithful man! no longer sigh
"Beneath base Slav'ry's grievous thrall;
"Here, in this happy land, enjoy
"That dower, our laws afford to all.
X.
"Henceforth, be free! Religion's hand
"Shall seal thee with a mark divine --
"That done, thine own assenting will,
"And that alone, can make thee mine."
XI.
He led him to the sacred font,
With new-enkindled hopes inflamed,
The holy rituals were performed,
And JUBA now is EDWARD named.
XII.
With pride he to his Lord's abode
Returned, and, with redoubled zeal,
He strove by actions to express
What words were powerless to reveal.
XIII.
Often he essayed in vain to speak
The love and duty of his breast,
As often convulsive sobs and tears,
With swelling throes, his voice suppressed.
XIV.
His Lord the painful strugglings felt,
Fraught with intelligence refined,
With smile complacent soothed his pain,
And in his silence read his mind.
XV.
First favorite in his master's train,
Some years in comfort EDWARD lived;
Nor felt a pain, but when his heart
For ORRA's dubious fortune grieved.
XVI.
Nor did good EDWARD ever forget
He wore a Christian's sacred sign,
But duly sought the House of Prayer,
And worshipped at the Holy Shrine.
PART III.
I.
TIME, that unravels every doubt,
Time, that allays the keenest smart,
That wondrous mysteries unfolds,
To vex, or please the human heart,
II.
At this blessed prime of EDWARD's youth,
Wrought forth a singular event,
A sweet return for EDWARD's worth,
As by his better angel sent;
III.
For now unwieldy grown in wealth,
Fair ANNA's parents strongly yearn
To barter their Barbadian lands,
And to their native clime return.
IV.
The lands are sold at mighty price,
And now for England they prepare,
With ORRA in their train, to lend
The infant family her care.
V.
Four daughters now her mistress owned,
Whom ORRA's fond attention reared;
But none to ORRA's tender heart
Like lovely ANNA was endeared.
VI.
Arrived in safety, they select
A dwelling fit for upstart pride;
Hence, in contiguous mansions placed,
EDWARD and ORRA now reside.
VII.
When bliss to worthy hearts is dealt,
Some call it Fortune's casual dower;
Forgive the Muse, if she ascribes
Such bliss to a superior Power.
VIII.
EDWARD, at sound of ORRA's name,
Yearns to engage in converse sweet,
When soon, comparing past events,
Their hearts with mutual rapture beat.
IX.
Their infant moments they recount,
Their separation on the main,
And EDWARD pours a shower of tears
On his dear play-mate found again.
X.
No wonder such an early bent
Should to maturer passion rise,
They felt alike the kindling flame,
And read it in each other's eyes.
XI.
They plighted love; they plighted troth;
He vowed to live for her alone,
And, soon as fit occasion served,
Connubial rites should make them one.
XII.
But 'midst these secret hours of bliss
A sudden grief smote EDWARD's heart;
His Lord a rapid fever seized,
That baffled medicinal art.
XIII.
Retired to taste his villa's sweets,
A blast of noxious evening wind
Conveyed a poison to his veins,
And wrought insanity of mind.
XIV.
Swift to the villa EDWARD flew,
He left awhile his ORRA dear,
Strong gratitude impelled his heart
To make his Lord his only care.
XV.
And she with patient smile approved,
And yielded to the sacred claim,
Which bounty lays on generous minds,
For ORRA's bosom felt the same.
XVI.
O! could it be, that in the hours
To pious offices assigned,
When EDWARD, with unceasing care,
And with a sore-afflicted mind,
XVII.
Watched every breath his master drew,
Felt every groan that smote his ear,
And for returning sense and health
Made every thought a fervent prayer?
XVIII.
In such a season could it be,
That ANNA's cruel parents strove,
By sordid treach'ry, to divide
Poor ORRA from her EDWARD's love?
XIX.
It was -- O! passion sprung from hell,
Unmitigable thirst of gold!
To what base deeds do thou impell
The bosom that is by thee controlled!
XX.
Thus ruminated ANNA's Sire: --
"Should EDWARD take this ORRA's hand,
"Conduct her to the altar's foot,
"And once be joined in nuptial band,
XXI.
"No remedy were left for me --
"A Christian made, my slave is lost;
"A Christian's wife, with him she goes,
"And with her all the gold she cost.
XXII.
"It shall not be -- this very hour
"A vessel in the river rides,
"Bound straight for Carolina's bay,
"And only waits for favoring tides;
XXIII.
"Her husband, I. -- Tomorrow's sun
"Shall be the last of ORRA's stay,
"For, at the approaching midnight hour
"Shall she be sudden borne away.
XXIV.
A man, perchance, to gain devote,
For ORRA's fate might little grieve,
But that his wife should yield assent,
What gentle female will believe?
XXV.
Though pearly drops from ORRA's eyes
Adown her jetty bosom fell,
While in convulsive sobs she cried
"O! let me bid him one farewell!"
XXVI.
Yet all was vain -- not ORRA's prayers,
Her years of faithful service spent,
Nor lovely ANNA's fond request,
Could make the mother's heart relent;
XXVII.
No, rot the assembled childrens' tears,
Whom ORRA's tender care had reared,
Could draw one drop of pity down;
Against all her callous breast was seared.
XXVIII.
The word was passed -- the morrow's sun
Was doomed the last of ORRA's stay,
And at the ensuing midnight hour
Was faithful ORRA torn away.
PART IV.
I.
Now by his suffering master's bed
Some fourteen wretched days had passed,
Which EDWARD spent in ceaseless moan,
Nor left him till he breathed his last.
II.
Nor left him then, but joined the rites
That laid him in his peaceful home,
And, bending over the coffined clay,
Shed grateful sorrows in the tomb.
III.
But what was now his wild surprise,
On learning that his Lord's regard
Had for his faithful services
Bequeathed an annual rich reward?
IV.
One hundred annual pounds! -- how blessed!
Might now this worthy couple prove,
From slavery ORRA might be freed,
Or bound alone to him and love.
V.
Swift to the wonted haunt he flew,
To pour the news in ORRA's ear,
But like a statue breathless stood,
When told "Your ORRA is not here.
VI.
"Ungratefully she left the house,
"Where she had fostered been so long."
He groaned -- he stamped -- he rent his hair;
But mute, and motionless, his tongue.
VII.
At length, a bursting flood of tears
Gave ease to his o'erloaded breast,
And just supplied sufficient strength
Of words, to make one short request;
VIII.
"Where is she gone?" -- No answer came;
To silence all the train were sworn,
To keep close-lock'd from EDWARD's ear,
When, how, or whither she was borne.
IX.
But ANNA, who lamented sore
Her ORRA, thus by craft betrayed,
Wrote "Carolina" on a card,
And to his hands by stealth conveyed.
X.
He sought, and soon a passage gained,
He saw with joy the streamers spread,
And daily chid the loit'ring waves,
That all so slow the vessel sped.
XI.
At length the wished for port is gained,
He searches each plantation round,
Nor, till some eight long days are passed,
Can ORRA's sad resort be found.
XII.
His eyes discover her at last,
Beneath the toil of noontide suns,
He folds her in one short embrace,
Then to the Planter eager runs:
XIII.
Prostrate upon the ground he falls,
Now at his feet submissive kneels,
In plaintive terms, and broken sighs,
His own and ORRA's tale reveals.
XIV.
Then thus, "O give my ORRA back,
"Give me my first, my only love!
"All, all the treasure I command
"Would little for her ransom prove.
XV.
"Or, if, inhuman, you refuse
"This my fond bosom's ardent prayer,
"Receive me in your fields at least,
"And let me ORRA'S slavery share.
XVI.
"Again to bondage will I bend,
"Again embrace the galling chain,
"Let me but toil by ORRA'S side,
"I will not murmur or complain."
XVII.
This Planter owned a noble heart,
He raised the suppliant with a tear,
Then made a kind inviting sign
To ORRA, who stood weeping near:
XVIII.
"The long-lov'd favorite of thy breast
"From this, a stranger's hand, receive,
"A greater pleasure is not thine,
"Than mine in having power to give:
XIX.
"Unransom'd, take her to thy arms,
"Nor offer me thy treasured ore,
"This transport is more wealth to me
"Than either Indies' boasted store."
TALE THE TWELFTH.

CHEDDER CLIFTS: OR, RAYMOND.

ADDRESSED TO MARIA.

Timor and minae
Scandunt eodem, quo Dominus; neque
Decedit aerata triremi, and
Post equitem sedet atra cura.
Horat. Lib. iii. Od. 1. ADDRESS TO MARIA.
I.
COME, my MARIA, let us onward go,
Nor dread the paths of this romantic ground,
Though the full stream beside sonorous flow,
And dreary rocks and caves beset us round.
II.
So may we hand in hand through years to come
Pursue the course prescribed by Heaven's behest!
Patient abide his wise-ordaining doom,
Enjoy the good, nor murmur at the rest!
III.
What though these paths, remote from public eye,
Exhibit but a drear and desert waste,
Some wonders of the ruling Power on high
May in this awful solitude be traced.
IV.
Bright issuing from the fissures, on the side
Of the rude stone, what lucid rills we see!
So Health's pure sources unimpeded glide
Through the clear veins of rugged Industry.
V.
Behold! beneath yon cliff's o'er-arching brow,
Spontaneous sweets of Nature shoot around,
The modest orchard spreads its pregnant bough,
And the ripe apple bends it to the ground;
VI.
Rich bev'rage yielding to the needy hind,
That holds his dwelling in yon clay-built cot,
Who with the treasure of a blameless mind,
Adoring GOD, abides his lowly lot.
VII.
The soaming flood, which some few minutes past.
Rolled with impetuous course its tide along,
Now, narrow'd to a streamlet, checks its haste,
And hides its course yon ozier-sprays among.
VIII.
Say, might not Contemplation wander here,
With quaint Surmise and Fancy in her train,
Make yon scoop'd rock a giant's cave appear,
Or yon deep cell a Druid-temple feign?
IX.
How high the clifts ascend on either hand,
While on their shrubby sides the wooly flocks
In quest of herbage, take their dangerous stand,
And bleat responsive from the echoing rocks!
X.
Here view the shattered carcass of a hare,
And list the hoary-headed peasant's tale,
How from the summit's ridge, impelled by fear
Of the fell hounds, she plunged into the vale.
XI.
And with compassion view the various scars,
Which deep indent the honest rustic's face,
Nor wonder that with recollected fears
He trembling points to yon tremendous place,
XII.
Yon rugged brow, whence once returning home,
'Mid the thick-rising vapors of the night,
He missed his foot-path in the treacherous gloom,
And headlong fell from the stupendous height;
XIII.
Fell, yet survives, you see; and often pours
His mavelous escape in strangers' ears:
Then with uplifted eyes the skies adores,
While down his scars distill his grateful tears.
XIV.
This cave survey, which witches haunt by night,
(For so the superstitious Eld relate)
Where, scattered round, worn crutches meet the sight,
Conjectured to support their tottering weight.
XV.
Lo! for some furlongs, how confined our walk,
How thick, beneath, the craggy flints abound!
How from the mountain-side loud echoes talk,
Reverberated from the trodden ground!
XVI.
And now the opening path, which wide expands
To circular extent, and verdant sod,
A spacious amphitheatre commands,
Where knighthood whilom might have made abode.
XVI.
Behold those central piles of massy stone,
That over the scene an awful horror shed --
Seems not the whole, from times long past and gone,
A mausoleum for some honored dead?
XVIII.
Soft! soft! -- retire within this sheltering gloom;
Behold, where yonder rushes from his cave
Distracted RAYMOND! there he seeks a tomb,
And daily delves some portion of his grave.
XIX.
Impetuous, hapless man! one hasty deed,
In youth's mad season, damned his riper years;
Nightly he makes the rugged flint his bed,
A prey to contrite grief, and ceaseless tears.
XX.
Make we this nook our seat, nor wound the heart
Of wretched RAYMOND with a searching eye!
Who seems at sight of human form to start,
And in himself in gulf his misery.
XXI.
Attend with patience to the painful tale,
Which HENRY The late RICHARD GRIFFITH, Esquire. of Maidenhall, in the County of
Kilkenny, in Ireland; esteemed and beloved by his intimates for his excellent
natural endowments and philanthropic virtues; but more generally known to the
world by the share he had in the elegant Letters of Henry and Frances, and many
other ingenious publications.
poured into my listening ear,
What time we strayed through Twick'nham's flowery vale --
HENRY lamented ever, ever dear!
XXII.
HENRY, whose friendship I in youth obtained,
When Fortune led me to Hibernia's shore,
From whom full many a moral truth I gleaned
In sweet excursions on the banks of Nore. Nore, the river which runs through
the County of Kilkenny.

THE TALE OF RAYMOND. The name of the country wherein the very singular
transactions occurred, (on which this tale is founded) is, for obvious reasons,
concealed. The Author presumed, therefore, he was at liberty to lay the scene
wherever his fancy suggested. Having, while he was projecting his composition,
visited that stupendous chasm in Somersetshire, called Chedder Clifts, he felt
himself induced to fix on that, and the rather, for that a rumor then
prevailed that a man, whose mind was deranged, had frequently been seen
straying in that romantic solitude.

I.
NOR birth, nor fortune did on RAYMOND frown,
A noble stem he in his lineage traced,
And many a virtuous deed, descending down
From honored ancestry, that lineage graced.
II.
But the large prospect of a father's wealth
Inflamed with frantic joy his youthful mind,
In dissipation he impaired his health,
And prudent counsel scattered to the wind.
III.
The reverend parent, with afflicted eye,
Beheld his boy the race of folly run,
And often lamented, with a stifled sigh,
And often, in gentle phrase, rebuked his son.
IV.
Of riot's bane too soon enamored grown,
The impetuous youth disdains the mild rebuke,
Retorts displeasure in resentful tone,
Or quits his father with indignant look.
V.
For Dissipation, and its boundless train
Of frantic crimes, disgrace his every hour,
Intoxication often invades his brain,
And bids him spurn a doting father's power.
VI.
That doting father, whose indulgent cares
Were all employed on this unduteous boy,
Whose love, (too sanguine) in his ripening years,
Had garner'd up a store of fancied joy;
VII.
But now of his abandoned offspring's vice,
And scorn of admonition, weary grown,
Expostulation mild no more he tries,
But loud upbraids him with imperious tone.
VIII.
The frantic youth his hasty arm uprears,
(Spite of the duty sons to parents owe,
Spite of the reverence due to silver hairs)
And on his father's temples dashed a blow.
IX.
What instant horrors, RAYMOND, then were thine!
Cursing the deed which thine own hand had done,
Surprise, remorse, disgrace, at once combine,
And all hell's torments through thy bosom run.
X.
He thinks each object deprecates the deed;
His mother's portrait, to his troubled eye,
Appears with indignation to recede
From the dire stroke, and frown with agony.
XI.
The father, silent, dries the blushing stream,
Which down his wounded cheek profusely flows,
Within his eye conflicting passions gleam,
And with indignant fire his visage glows;
XII.
For love and pity, mingling in his face,
To check the rising storm of passion try,
As struggling sunny rays attempt to chase
The gathering gloom of an incensed sky.
XIII.
An awful pause ensued -- then, turning slow,
He showed his handkerchief deep stained with gore;
"Behold this blood," he said, "Oh child of woe!
"Behold thy work! -- but see thy sire no more."
XIV.
He said, and left the room. The abandoned son
Stood petrified awhile in cold suspense,
Then forth instinctively he seemed to run,
Robbed of each faculty of sight and sense.
XV.
Impulsive habit led him to the haunts
Of loose associates, and the unnerving bowl,
Where Vice its unrestrained triumph vaunts
Over every finer feeling of the soul.
XVI.
False! short-lived triumph! not the echoed sound
Of mirth tumultuous through the spendthrift's hall,
Can chase the thoughts that his remembrance wound,
But each alluring draught is dashed with gall.
XVII.
When, sated with the treacherous bane, he tries
To woo the balmy comfort of his bed,
"Upon the torment of the mind he lies,"
Successive horrors goad his restless head.
XVIII.
If harrass'd thought a short reprieve enjoy,
Enwrapp'd in Slumber's momentary bands,
Self-open'd, wide the curtains seem to fly,
And by his side his bleeding father stands.
XIX.
He groans, he starts! the restless pillow flies,
To stalk the room in darkness and despair;
Where fancied specter haunt his haggard eyes,
Whose yells and screams incessant wound his ear.
XX.
Sudden he meditates, in frantic rage,
By suicide to end the date of woe;
Doubt fills his mind with fearful black presage,
And startled Nature shudders at the blow.
XXI.
He doubts -- he ruminates. -- "Dares RAYMOND die
"Beneath a parent's unrelenting ire?
"The danger of a new existence try,
"And in the fullness of his crimes expire?
XXII.
"No, Heaven forbid! Despair and Madness, hence!
"With contrite heart I Will seek my father's door,
"Pour the full stream of softening penitence,
"And pardon, prostrate at his feet, implore."
XXIII.
Thus pond'ring, he resolves. His father's door
Against his prayers and tears fast-clos'd remains;
The fatal sentence, "See thy sire no more,"
Now, with redoubled force his mind arraigns.
XXIV.
Yet, day by day he plies a parent's gate,
Again he sues, and is again repelled;
Nor wins admittance, till approaching fate
Compels that parent's rigid heart to yield.
XXV.
He yields, and RAYMOND comes -- with timid eye,
The bed of sickness trembling he surveys,
While Conscience whispers, in a deep-drawn sigh,
"It Is RAYMOND, has cut short a father's days."
XXVI.
Half-rais'd, the parent cast a solemn look,
That penetrated to the culprit's heart,
Whose stream of life awhile its seat forsook,
And life itself seemed ready to depart.
XXVII.
"Approach, my son!" -- At that benignant name,
Poor RAYMOND, falling on his slackened knee,
Feels sudden warmth re animate his frame,
Yet hides his face, in speechless agony.
XXVIII.
Thrice he essayed forgiveness to implore,
The sounds, half-utter'd, fainted on his tongue,
"Cease," said the Sire, "thy fruitless aim give over,
"And hear me speak -- thou will not hear me long."
XXIX.
"Thou see me struggling in the pangs of death,
"The race of painful life well-nigh is run;
"Yet ere I draw the latest gasp of breath,
"Hear my last words, and heed them well, my son.
XXX.
"A child's inheritance is wholly thine,
"Of all I have thou wilt find thyself possessed;
"Thou, left alone of wretched RAYMOND's line,
"Accept that all, and, if thou can, be blessed.
XXXI.
"But, chief over all, this casket I bestow,
"Receive it from thy dying father's hand,
"And, as thou take it, breathe a solemn vow,
"Thou will not disobey this last command;
XXXII.
"Break not the seal that covers this bequest,
"(As thou shall answer at thy awful doom!)
"Till I am sunk in everlasting rest,
"And silent shrouded in thy mother's tomb."
XXXIII.
'I take it, and I swear,' the son replies,
'But O! while Heaven permits thee yet to live,
'Hear thy offender's penitential cries,
'Relieve his torments, bless him, and forgive!'
XXXIV.
"For Heaven's forgiveness of one fatal deed
"My parting spirit breathes a fervent prayer,
"And in a future state, if prayer may plead,
"'Twill sue again for thy remission there."
XXXV.
'Yet ere for ever thou shall close thine eyes,
'O'er my sad heart thy benediction pour."
The wretched father, struggling, strove to rise,
In vain! -- he gasp'd -- he groaned -- and spoke no more.
XXXVI.
RAYMOND remains a monument of grief,
A death-like paleness over his visage spreads;
No tear to his affliction brings relief,
Nor quits he, till compelled, the mournful bed.
XXXVII.
While now the funeral honors were prepared,
Distractedly, from room to room he strayed,
In every breeze his father's voice he heard,
Of every sound, and every eye afraid.
XXXVIII.
The funeral rites now summon; on he goes,
And mingles in the dark sepulchral gloom,
Nor quits the hallowed object of his woes,
Till silent laid within his mother's tomb.
XXXIX.
With one long look he takes his final leave,
And inly murmurs, "Where is my repose?
"Never, till he is sheltered in the peaceful grave,
"Shall RAYMOND's eyes on shame and sorrow close."
XL.
The attendant train his falt'ring steps support,
And guide reluctant to a dreary home,
Where Melancholy keeps her solemn court,
And spreads around one universal gloom.
XLI.
The bed of Death he seeks, where, in his sight,
His father's latest gift, the casket, lay;
Intent he gazes, filled with sore affright,
Yet rising hope attempers his dismay.
XLII.
"Perchance," he cries, "this casket may contain
"The boon I asked with penitential tear;
"The pardon, which his falt'ring tongue in vain
"Essayed to speak, perchance is written here.
XLIII.
"O! grant it, pitying God!" the gift unclos'd,
What aggravated horror meets him there!
His father's blood-stained kerchief lies exposed,
And one soft ring let of his silver hair.
XLIV.
His fixed eye scarce credits what he sees,
Cold drops of sweat his aching brow pervade;
His trembling limbs with gradual horror freeze;
He sinks -- he faints upon the fatal bed.
XLV.
Ah! happy, had he sunk, to rise no more!
But Nature's vivid fount renews its course,
He wakes, afresh his misery to explore,
And feels its torments with redoubled force.
XLVI.
He shrieks, he rends his hair, and loud exclaims,
"Could then no pity to my crime be shown?
"My soul to pangs eternal he condemns;
"He Is gone, and left no pardon for his son.
XLVII.
"Now where shall I betake me? whither fly
"To banish thought from this distracted brain?
"Not mines of wealth can lost repose supply,
"Repose of mind never harbors here again.
XLVIII.
"To distant climes shall wretched RAYMOND go,
"In martial throngs hide his devoted head,
"Where the first friendly arm that lays me low,
"I Will kiss with joy, and bless it for the deed."
XLIX.
Forthwith to distant regions he repaired,
Where Belgic warriors hardy conflict waged,
Urged by despair, to deeds adventurous dared,
And so^ght the ranks where hottest fury raged.
L.
Impetuous darting on the advancing foe,
Confronted by the leader of the band,
His fierce assailant's falchion dealt a blow,
That from the wrist dismembered RAYMOND's hand.
LI.
When thus the victim, bending to the ground,
"Restrain thy fury, let me not expire,
"Till I have knelt, and blessed thee for the wound,
"Which lopped the impious hand that smote my Sire."
LII.
Unfit for further action, quenched his fires,
Acknowledging the justice of his lot,
From public haunts the wretch with shame retires,
And hides his guilt in this sequestered spot.
LIII.
Of all life's comforts by himself denied,
He makes his dwelling in yon dreary cave,
From Nature's bounty Nature's wants supplied,
And daily delves a portion of his grave.

Shakespeare's Hamlet. INTRODUCTION.
O Memory! in thy magic glass
What various scenes and objects pass!
Retentive maid! thine is the power
To brighten, or overcast the hour.
To me, sweet nymph, extend thine aid,
And, in thy brightest hues portrayed,
To give my sense supreme delight,
Restore AMANDA to my sight!
Her polished mien, complexion fair,
The glossy ringlets of her hair,
Her easy gesture, lively air;
The expressive brow, the azure eye,
With all its glancing witchery,
And nameless sweets, that seemed to steep
In roseate dew her ruby lip!
Thanks, Goddess, thanks! she greets my sight,
With all the fullness of delight;
And, through thy aid, while thus I trace
Each charm of that alluring face,
Her converse sweet again I hear,
Her judgment strong, conception clear;
Her turn for raillery and wit
Impressive, elegant, and neat.
Such was she, when her partial praise
With smiles approved these early lays;
Now, though that flattering praise be over,
Those cheering smiles exist no more,
Shall I a second sanction choose
To shield a cold, forgetful Muse?
No -- be the page as first designed,
The tribute of a grateful mind,
To her and Friendship still consigned!
PREFACE.
As the Author of the following Work does not presume either to support or deny
the REALITY of APPARITIONS, he chooses to decline all unnecessary suggestions on
a subject, wherein every person has a right to enjoy his own opinion
undisturbed; and, as it was conceived with a view of instruction, and the whole
tendency is moral and just, he hopes, with the generality of readers, to pass
uncensured for treating them with SO PECULIAR A STORY.

If there should remain any over-scrupulous, or over-witty persons, who are
inclined peremptorily to condemn, or illiberally to deride him, he begs leave
to answer them with the sentiments of Mr. ADDISON on such subjects, and those
of LUCRETIUS and JOSEPHUS, quoted by him, in the second volume of his Spectator.

I think a person, who is thus terrified with the imaginations of GHOSTS and
SPECTER, much more reasonable than one, who, contrary to the reports of all
historians, sacred and profane, ancient and modern, and to the traditions of
all nations, thinks the APPEARANCE of SPIRITS fabulous and groundless. -- Could
I not give myself up to this general testimony of mankind, I should to the
relations of particular persons, who are now living, and whom I cannot distrust
in other matters of fact. So far Mr. ADDISON's own opinion -- he then proceeds
--

LUCRETIUS himself, though, by the course of his philosophy, he was obliged to
maintain that the soul did not exist separate from the body, makes no doubt of
the REALITY OF APPARITIONS, AND THAT MEN HAVE OFTEN APPEARED AFTER THEIR DEATH.
And further having related, from JOSEPHUS, a circumstance of this kind, which
befell GLAPHIRA, daughter of ARCHELAUS, he closes his discourse thus: The
example deserves to be taken notice of, as it contains a most certain proof of
the IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, and of DIVINE PROVIDENCE. -- If any man thinks
these facts incredible, let him enjoy his own opinion to himself; but let him
not endeavor to disturb the belief of others, who, by INSTANCES OF THIS NATURE
ARE EXCITED TO THE STUDY OF VIRTUE.

To the testimony of this excellent modern writer might likewise be added the
many striking uses which have been made, and the noble purposes of justice
which have been effected, through the means of such EXTRAORDINARY APPEARANCES,
by several of our ancient Poets, and particularly by that honor to Nature and
Genius, our own immortal SHAKESPEARE.

THE ADVANTAGES OF REPENTANCE. The following Tale was given to the Public above
twenty years ago, unconnected with any other work. It had the good fortune to
pass through four editions; but the whole impression having been long since
sold off, it is, at the earnest request of the Author's friends, subjoined to
the present collection.

DREADFUL the state of him, whose hardened heart
Remorse could never pierce! whose early youth,
To evil prone, has drank the bitter cup
Of Guilt, regardless of the poison misery,
Wherewith it is imbrued, till all his veins
Are filled and bloated with the dangerous venom,
And Health and Ease are flown! mature in life,
Grown ripe in wickedness, and swollen with crimes,
Who finds his malady, yet dares refuse
The sweet and wholesome draught of Penitence,
Which the distempered mind's physician, Conscience,
Even to the worst of men will deign to offer.
Him sleepless nights and loaded days weigh down
To blackness and despair; to him remembrance
Is as a fiend, that watches all his steps,
Stands in his path, and intercepts his walk;
Makes even the rushing wind alarm his sense,
As if some power, more than natural,
Rode on the gale; while, at the gloom of eve,
From room to room, through all the house he flies,
Scared by affright -- and seeks, (alas! how vain!)
A moment's peace. At length, deep furrowed age,
The herald of his dreadful end, appears,
But to foretell the fatal stroke, and ring
Loud peals of torment in his ears -- he dies
Reluctant -- screaming -- fearing even to lose
A being which he loathes -- in his last pang,
Vainly he rolls his struggling eye balls round,
To catch a single ray to cheer his mind --
But all is dark and comfortless -- he dies.
Not so the Man of Virtue -- youth to him
Is the fair plain of bliss; his riper years
Are the deep mines of wisdom, whence he draws
Discretion, temperance, and a thousand rich
Materials, to improve his after hours
With profit and delight; when Memory,
Clad like a guardian spirit, a chaplet brings
Rich with the flowers he cultured in his youth,
And crowns his honest brow. Thence silvered age
Seems as the treasury of hoarded good,
Joys well preserved -- and Death the blessed vale
Of Hope and Expectation -- the dear path
To happiness immortal! -- to his GOD.
Such was the state of SHENSTONE, virtuous man,
'Who walked through goodness, as he walked through life,' See Visions in
Verse, Page 73.

Whom the Muse loved, and ever will lament;
Fair wisdom, truth, and sense of generous worth
Sat comely on his brow; within his eye
Sweet charity, and meek humility,
Played lovely, and within his ample heart
The milk of human kindness copious flowed.
Thus blameless, fearless, with a graceful smile
He met his fate, and sought his native skies. Mr. SHENSTONE died in his
arm-chair, with a gentle sigh, and a smile on his countenance.

Yet let not un-enlighten'd minds suppose
No middle state between the extremes of Vice
And Virtue: -- He, who made, well knows his creatures,
How weak, how frail; and if, perchance, awhile
(As in the best it may) incautious youth
Has suffered truth and constancy to slumber
Within the breast, and, their best guard, Discretion,
Desert his charge, or slacken in his duty,
He looks with sorrowing eye. -- Hear this, ye rigid,
And if, by happier talents, ye have gained
Perfection's mount, at least, with pity view,
With mildness judge the wretch, whom human weakness,
And venial errors doom to lag beneath.
REPENTANCE is the means, through Heaven's dear grace,
Which from the blotted sheet of life can wipe
A thousand errors; and the King of Heaven
Has mercy and compassion, more, I trust,
Than man has power of sinning. Hence, be warned,
Ye wicked tribe! never think the hour too late,
The crime too black, the means of grace too distant.
They cannot be, if true remorse of heart,
And sorrow for the crime, attends your prayer;
However bad, betake you to your knees;
Think ye address your Counselor, your friend,
Your father, who with readiness of love
Will raise, and comfort his repentant child,
And lead him to the mansions of delight,
Rescrv'd for such as love his holy laws.
Nay, even on earth, or Time's recorded page
Is sullied with untruth, the virtue, penitence,
Has met a large reward. -- Is there who doubts?
With candid patience let him here peruse
The moral tale, which in expression weak,
And tuneless numbers, I attempt to sing.
Thrice had the sun renewed his annual course,
Since hapless EDWARD, on the sultry plains
Of India, had endured increasing woes,
And numbered all his moments by afflictions.
When the fourth year began to store the earth
With fruits and flowers, (unlimited expanse,
And prodigality of bounty), EDWARD
Arose, one morn, cheered by refreshing sleep,
Which long had been a stranger to his bed.
His heart was light within him, and his eye
Looked clear around; the dross within his breast,
Which lim'd his soul to guilt, seemed purged away;
He heaved the softening sigh, and, as by instinct,
Bent low to Heaven -- a posture new to him!
He did not pray -- he knew not what to ask;
While thus 'twixt doubt and sore dismay suspended,
Officious Memory set before his view
An awful register of sad misdeeds;
He gazed astonished: -- here, a dow'rless sister
Upbraided him, for leaving her, at large
To wander through a false and treacherous world,
Without a brother's safe-conducting hand:
There, a weak mother, sore oppressed with age
And poverty, let fall a sacred drop,
And cried, "Thus is it with me." -- Down he sunk,
And, in a torrent of religious tears,
Let loose the fullness of his swelling heart;
Wide, fast, and copious did they flow; as erst
The streams forth deluged from the hardened rock,
Touched, and resolved by MOSES' holy wand.
His pains awhile relieved, EDWARD aloud
Discharged his grief; "Ah woe is me! thus tossed
"Upon a foreign shore, robbed of relief,
"Of hope; no sorrowing sister to condole,
"No mother to advise! no more I boast
"A feeling friend, to share my nearest woe,
"And ease me of a part; where is the man,
"Whom once I wrapped close, close within my heart,
"And called his soul my own? -- he is lost -- estranged --
"And justly -- since with rash misguided step
"I left a parent comfortless; a sister
"Friendless, and unprotected, whom my labors
Might have preserved to better fate, than now,
"I fear, attends them. What have I attained
"By one black deed, one moment's cursed work,
"But anguish and despair? each slender morsel
"Earned by hard labor, and each niggard draught
"Embitter'd by distress! Oh! were that morsel
"The honest meed of Virtue, and that draught
"The pay of genuine worth, how sweet, how grateful!
"But, as it is -- how nauseous! hence! away!
"No more I Will bear this massacre of life,
"This ruin of the soul -- There is a Power,
"Or Nature whispers to my heart in vain,
"Who can, and will restore me to myself;
"To him, to him I bend -- and here disclaim
"The vices of my youth; O! could I wipe
"Their traces from my mind! that cannot be.
"Amidst transgressions huge and numerous, ONE
"Stands foremost, never to be expunged; ONE CRIME,
"Which even to myself I dare not name.
"But if deep sorrow, and sincere remorse,
"May ought avail to expia^e the sin,
"'It Is now within me, and shall there remain
"The tenant of my bosom. If my GOD,
"(That name! how sweet it sounds upon my ear!)
"Deigns to accept my offered penitence,
"I yet may triumph over distress, I yet
"May shield a sister; yet relieve a mother;
"And, far as memory will admit, may cure
"My mind's wide wounds, and chase her throbs away."
He spoke, and rose -- then to his custom'd task
Flew nimbly; gladness in his eye, and speed
Played on his feet; no more the hard-earn'd meal
Seemed tasteless; but, by quick concoction, turned
To florid health, and vigor, while the draught
Ran fresh within the veins, and quickened life.
He toiled, he prosper'd -- every moment gave
Some large addition to his store, and Heaven
Indulgent smiled on all he undertook.
Mean while his mother, tender, good MARIA,
On ALBION's Isle left sorrowing, pined away
In anguish for a son; her only stay
In life was lost; her daughter's sole defense;
Since torn from fortune in their earlier days,
His industry alone maintained the pair.
Whenever she ventured, all alone, to open
The volume of her mind, she saw him here is,
And lost, in one sad moment -- snatched away,
As 'twere by sudden fate -- one hour the board
Smiled at his presence, on the next was blank --
And fruitless every eye looked forth for EDWARD:
No traces left of him; his course unknown,
His motives, his distress. In vain, enquiry
Panted on every various wind to find him.
Thus over their sorrows did this couple brood,
And drank their falling tears, when ghastly Poverty
Intruded, and with meagre, hungry look
Appalled each comely visage; wide he strode,
And, with a horrid joy, cried, "All is mine."
What hope remains, alas! for worth distressed,
And modest want, unless some noble being
Comes timely, like a minister of heaven,
To succor and redress; in largess wide,
To pour his bounties, and prevent the blush,
Ere yet it rises on the conscious cheek
Of merit, undispos'd, unused to ask?
Such was MARIA's happy lot! (ah! would
The sons of fortune oft'ner deigned regard
The claims of worth distressed -- "casting thereon
Their superflux, and showing Heaven more just.") See Shakespeare's King Lear.

Such was MARIA's lot! for young HORATIO,
Who long had doated on fair ANNA's charms,
Half-wither'd in their bloom, stepped forth, and asked
The maiden of MARIA, asked her hand
With humble diffidence, as one, who held
Naught in his power to give, and all to beg;
Yet him the luxury of wealth enriched,
And plenteous meads enclosed: -- the mother blushed,
Blushed for a dow'rless daughter, and refused
The lover's ardent suit -- 'till well assured,
That fond affection long before had tied
Their hearts reciprocal, she gave her last,
Her only bliss away, poured forth her blessings
Profusely over the new-match'd pair -- then turned
To seek the house of poverty again,
A mate with lonely Woe; -- when thus the youth --
"Much as I dote on ANNA's worth, and live
"But in her smile, a something yet to life
"Were wanting, if MARIA will not grace
"My home. In earliest youth, alas! I lost
"The name of son, the blessing of a parent;
"Nor could the ample fortunes thence derived,
"Requite me for that loss; -- O! be it now
"Repaired in thee! Be thou my guardian! parent!
"Be witness to my care, my love of ANNA,
"And share our happiness, my second mother!"
He staid not for reply -- but hasty seized
Her hand, half yielding, half reluctant; seized,
And led her to his home; where every moment
Came winged with new delight. -- His life to ANNA,
Was all attentive love; to good MARIA,
All reverence and esteem; each word had awe,
Each look respect, and every favor grace;
He gave, as one who knew not that he gave,
Or wist not what it meant. ANNA, enriched
With all that love or fortune could bestow,
Was happiest of the happy; and the mother
(Save when the thought of EDWARD, hapless youth!
Struck on her memory) felt a smile return,
And joy rekindle in her aged heart.
Thus flew twelve years on pleasure's silken wing,
And all was comfort, peace, and happiness.
Now had the banished man, persisting still
In penitence to Heaven, and love of virtue,
Accumulated wealth beyond the bounds
Of what his largest hope displayed; and yearn'd,
(Spite of the fears that lingered round his heart)
With ardent wish to seek his native clime;
To see if ANNA's youth was yielded up,
A prey to lawless love; if early sorrow
Had nipt the bud, and blasted all the fruit;
Whether again 'twere given him to behold
A mother's face, to tend and cheer her age
With duteous care and love, or to bedew
Her sacred manes with religious tears.
This lesson had repentance taught his mind:
"Let no weak terrors for thyself withhold
"Thy duteous steps, or stop thy bounty's course;
"Thy mother may survive, and want the pittance
"Thou deal'st to every stranger; thou mays't now
"Raise up her feeble head, restore her heart,
"And brighten up her eve of life; obey --
"A debt to Nature is a debt to GOD"
His treasure safe on board, auspicious winds
Swelled big the bellying sails; old Ocean boiled
Around the cleaving keel; so swift the course,
That wind and vessel seemed throughout to vie
In vigor of dispatch; hence the fifth moon,
Ere quite her course was done, (one April morn,
The hills new tinged with gold) beheld him safe
On English ground! Delight unspeakable
To hearts unknown to vice! The guileless man,
Whom search of foreign wealth provokes, or care
Of merchandise incites, or, (hapless state!)
Disastrous war compels awhile to leave
His native climate and connections dear,
At his long-wish'd return regaining all,
What joys are his! He stops, and, panting, asks
His heart, if all be true; he seems new born,
And drinks, in frequent gasps of happiness,
Large draughts of his own air. Not so poor EDWARD,
Anxious affright and doubt oppress his heart,
And stifle in its birth the rising transport.
More weight of years, and Grief's deforming hand,
Had altered every feature; from his visage
The vacant smile of dissipated life
And empty joy was flown, while solid sense,
And comely reason, and discretion fair,
Supplied the place; -- ah! unavailing all
To chase his fears! Beneath a deep disguise
He veiled each trace of what he once appeared,
Lest, when he saw (were such his happy lot)
His aged parent, strong surprise might seize
Her palsied nerves, and Nature quit her hold.
The dwelling, once familiar to his foot,
With trembling, hasty step, he seeks -- Each eye,
Each passing glance alarms him; seems to cleave
His wounded soul, and lay each thinking bare.
The threshold gained, while yet his shaking hand
Begged for admittance, prone he fell -- o'erspent,
And to the kind inhabitants appeared
A breathless corse. -- With charitable care
They raised him up, and, by appliance meet,
Quickened the pulse, and bade it flow anew.
Revived, and of his proper course informed,
(O blessings on each kindly-temper'd heart
That thus relieves the stranger!) on he hastens
To seek, while every conscious fear returned,
A mother's presence. She, her earliest meal
Dispatched, had tottered forth, as was her wont,
And gained her favorite seat; where each new morn
She gazed with new delight, and in his works
Adored the God of Nature, paid her thanks
For joys, so far beyond the stretch of hope,
Show'r'd on her age, and with one pious wish,
For EDWARD's virtue and return, concluded
Her daily orison. For now her mind,
By time made pliant, had received the stamp
Of that great necessary means of happiness,
Submission to her fate -- thus flowed her hours
Tranquil and smooth, as glides the summer lake;
If chance a sudden sigh a while deformed
Her sweet serenity of soul, 'twas slight,
And momentary as the passing breeze;
For pure Religion cannot long desert
Her willing votaries, but repairs the grace
With added luster, as returning suns
Dispel the transient gloom, and bid the stream
Again be smooth and clear. Nigh where she sat,
Was passion-tortur'd EDWARD doomed to pass;
Big with a thousand various apprehensions,
These words alarmed his ear: "And if he yet
"Survives, O be he worthy of thy care!
"'It Is all I beg." He turned him to the sound,
And saw -- what long he stopped not to survey,
But on the pinions of distraction flew,
Knelt, and embraced, and wept upon a mother.
Struck with affright! -- and "Who art thou," she cried,
"That thus' -- when, as he pressed her trembling knee
With couchant face, all bathed in drops of shame,
A scar, which boyish negligence had thrown
Broad over his neck, awoke remembrance in her
Too strong to bear -- Scarce had she power to say,
"Art thou indeed my long -- lost joy?" A sigh,
Which shook, and all unnerv'd her aged frame,
Burst forth, and on the favorite seat she dropped.
Swift to his duteous care the youth arose,
And, "O forgive my desperate haste," he cried,
"Forgive my zeal, my eagerness of love;
"I meant at leisure to disclose myself,
"But Nature would not let me." -- Motionless
She still remained. "And have I thus destroyed
"The only means of bliss? Forbid it Heaven!
"The dearest purpose of my life?" Then ran
And called aloud for aid, himself unfit,
Unknowing how to act. Forth from the portal
HORATIO, ANNA, and domestics, burst
Alarmed, and haste instinctively to save
Their mansion's honor: from the neighboring spring
They draw the happy means. Once more her eye
Beamed on the day, though faint; it strayed around
With timid glance, till on her EDWARD's face
It rested full; then from the seat she sprung,
As if returning youth new strung her nerves,
And, in her joy triumphant, cried, "Behold him!
"More than I dared to ask, is now bestowed --
"I have a son again:" then eager plunged
Into his clasping arms, and there remained,
Till fainting Nature had repaired her strength,
Resolving all her burden into tears;
That sacred dew, which Heaven, in mercy, gave
To loads of anguish, or excess of joy.
The assistant crow'd stand speechless -- motionless --
And, in each other's eye, alternate seek,
And read the cause of their amaze; till EDWARD
(His pious mother having sought relief
On the same seat, where late she lifeless lay,
From passions which too exqui itely pressed
Her shattered frame) ran, frantic in his joy,
To ANNA, to HORATIO; over and over
He seized them, and, in wildness of embrace,
Seemed to devour their loves. On every visage,
Well as he could, he cast a look -- when lo!
Against a mourning cypress, PHILIP, old,
Leaned, to support his weight of joy -- a man
Of more than fourscore years -- whom EDWARD's father
From infancy had reared; their tempers, customs,
And sentiments alike -- Hence counselor,
Not steward was he called -- often had he given
Advice, clear, just, and wholesome, to our youth,
When early joys and mad pursuits seduced him,
Which, when he found neglected and despised,
Frequent he raised a bitter sigh, and said,
"My good old master, happy, happy thou,
"Whom the dark tomb enclosed, ere this thou saw!'
Soon as the eye of EDWARD caught his form,
And owned his reverend locks, confusion stopped
The purport of his tongue; his heart was full;
But on his knee dropped sudden; he breathed forth,
From fervent heart, a thousand, thousand blessings,
Silent, though not in-eloquent. He longed
To ask how he had weathered out the storm
Of want and sorrow; which the elder reading
In his enquiring eye, thus spoke: -- "I live
"To see thy face once more, thou comely copy
"Of my old master! Know, that righteous Power,
"Who saw my truth, and gratitude to him,
"Raised me another guardian in HORATIO;
"Since thy departure, by his bounty fed,
"I Have seen thy father's virtues all renewed,
"His grace, as well as love of doing good,
"And lived over life again; my joy's so full
"By this last gift, what have I now to do,
"But bless my GOD, and die?" -- "To live, to live,"
Exclaimed the youth, "and see an altered man."
Then rose and clasped him -- more he would have said,
When a kind summons from their host, who late
Retired with his domestics, and prepared
The genial board, (while ANNA tended duteous
On her MARIA) warned them in -- he turned,
And helped to raise a mother -- she (supported
On either hand) betwixt her children moved,
Not meanly proud of two such props; now one,
Now eyed the other, and with graceful joy
Entered the house. Old PHILIP followed, weeping.
Around the social board, profusely spread,
Raptured they take their several seats; but short
And tasteless was the meal; fond recollection,
How long they hopeless languish'd for so dear
An interview, subdued even Nature's claim
Of sweet refreshment. Incoherent phrase,
Short sighs, and interchange of softest looks,
That teemed with all the fullness of affection,
Supplied the place. While now the genial glass,
Crown of the meal, went round, their honest host,
Extravagantly glad, contrived new joys
To grace the coming time, bade night descend
Copious in mirth, with all that music's power,
Or festive dance could add, to cheer the soul,
And make the hours look gay. Thus, far abroad
His fancy flew for fresh and rare delights,
To form a life of bliss -- when EDWARD thus --

cheered the soul,
Till ruddy eve, with golden ray bedecked,
Descended lovely, and around her threw
Her beauties wide and lavish; valleys smiled;
The breeze flew light; more clear and smooth the stream;
Proud were the hills; with more than wonted fragrance
Each flower enriched the gale; in livelier notes
Birds filled the air; as Nature's self were glad
To view the approaching scene -- for now the portal
Capacious stretched, to admit a wretched throng,
Called from the adjacent town (well-known to those
Who steer direct over -- 's furze-blown heath)
With pious care and speed, and each sad object
Encountered on the way; by various woes,
And various wants, reduced to drag with pain
A living death; -- each ghastly form was there,
That Poverty, from out her rueful cave,
Herself could draw, to hurt the eye of man,
And wound the pitying breast -- decrepid age
Bent underneath its load -- sad widowhood,
With sunken eye, and deep entrenched feature,
Pined inly -- tender orphan eyes were washed
In early drops -- and sorrowing fathers mourned
Their infants, by the gripe of meagre Famine
Snatched newly. Lo! beneath the sacred roof
No eye, no hand, no heart was unemploy'd;
All, all united in the virtuous task,
To chase distress, or bid affliction smile,
And saw their fair endeavors well repaid.
Age bloomed afresh -- here widowed breasts were cheered,
And sung with gratitude -- there children wiped
Their eyes, and fed. Transported EDWARD seemed
On every side, at once; from every object
Drew new delight -- (of food, and alms, his largess
So quick, so copious, that the ravished taker
Was scant of power to catch the liberal blessing,
Ere fallen to earth), then took the goblet large,
And to the thirsty soul gave draughts of bliss
Immeasurable; while the rest apart
New stores accumulate, therewith completing
Such sacred rites, as, here and there, the youth,
Through fervent duty, and religious haste,
"Lest needy eyes should tarry long," See Ecclesiastieus, chap. iv.
had left
Unfinished. Thus employed, before him stood,
Unseen till now, a terrifying form!
Within the haggard face, distracted Fear,
And writhing Pain, and agonizing Grief,
Had struck their talons deep; the bushy locks
With crimson streams were clotted, and uprear'd;
From hollow eye looked forth reproachful sorrow,
And damped the pious joy, so newly born
In EDWARD's heart; his glow of blood forsook
His cheek; while, cold, and clammy, over his brow
Big drops were spread; his nerves unstrung, the cup
Fell from his feeble grasp; a statue he
Of wild amazement, while within his ears
(Almost the only sense which now remained)
These heart-astounding accents hideous rung:
"Not for myself do I approach thee, youth,
"Or beg thy charity -- but for a wife,
"And two poor children, who, for more than twelve
"Long years, have lingered out their days in want.
"While strength was theirs, they eat the hardearn'd morsel,
"And drank the passing stream; now deadly sickness
"So sore oppresses them, scarce can they raise
"Their worn-out limbs from earth. Oh! if thou have
"One crime, which, more than all the rest, sits heavy
"Within thy breast, and hop'st, at thy last hour,
"That crime should be forgiven -- follow me."
As by a power from Heaven impelled, the youth
Flew forth, and followed; by HORATIO's eye
Alone observed, who traced his frantic steps;
Which, till they reached the venerable relics
Of an old ruined convent, rested not.
There, westward of the gloomy grove, which gave
A distant, solemn prospect to the pile,
Beneath the mouldering fabric's aweful height,
The form, which thus had drawn the affrighted youth,
Darting an eye of rigor, cried, "Redress,"
And vanished from his sight. -- Awhile he stood,
As one just wakened from a trance, and rolled
His eye balls wildly round, big with surprise
And horror! -- till HORATIO, sore-alarm'd,
Lest, smote by frenzy strange, imperial reason
Were from her throne removed, seized quick his hand,
Assaying to recall his sense; -- in vain --
Eager and loud he cries, "Where is he? Speak?
"I could not be deceived -- my eye -- my heart,
"In dreadful sympathy, acknowledged him;
"The wound was fresh again, the fatal gash
"How wide it yawn'd for vengeance! the red stream
"Again it boiled, and with unrighteous stain
"Crimsoned the golden locks! -- Redress thee! -- ay,
"Or may my woes never cease! the hand that smote,
"This moment shall revenge thee!" From his gripe,
(No quick, nor easy task) HORATIO wrench'd,
And threw the desperate weapon far -- then forced
The enfeebl'd victim of despair to press
The ragged flint, while he, by every art
That friendship could suggest, by look, by speech,
By prayer, and pious tears, assayed to calm
The tempest in his mind; full well he saw
Some Power, superior far to idle fancy,
Assailed the shattered brain. From EDWARD's eye
At length burst forth a sympathetic flood,
And, in disjointed accents, thus he spoke:
"Thou shoulds't not be a stranger here -- forgive,
"Forgive a man, just sunk in misery!
"But I Will atone it; -- yes, beloved HORATIO,
"Fast as my heart permits, I Will tell thee all:
"Know then, the dreadful cause (to mortal breast
"Yet unreveal'd, and by thy truth, thy love,
"Thy hope of future blessings, I conjure thee,
"From every other ear preserve it close)
"Of my removal from my native shore,
"My friends -- my duty -- then, when boiling youth
"Ran madly through my veins (too well thou know
"The fatal time) was this (Oh guilt! -- I tremble
"To give it utt'rance --) know, I carried with me
"A conscience black with murder! -- have thou ear
"For more, or shall I stop? -- One fatal eve,
"The sun, as now, had just retired, (afraid
"To view the deed) with rash, and coward hand,
"(Swill'd hot with wine, and fired by frantic rage,
"At some slight word) I smote a surly hind:
"Smote him -- and life was gone -- I fondly hoped
"That penitence, which deep within my heart
"Poured its soft balm, had cured the rankling sore,
"And bade my mind be still. My hope was vain!
"'It Is not for me to know repose; even now
"The form was with me; nay, it lived, it looked
"It spoke -- exact the same with that, my memory
"Bears, and will ever bear! -- what might this mean?
"Calls it not loud for vengeance? Should I not
"Submit me willing to the law, and pay
"The price of blood with blood? -- Nay, speak in mercy."
Silent and fixed they sat, and pious grief
With pious grief engaged; their levelled eyes
Smote, and transfixed each other -- soul with soul
Conversed, and speech was useless. When a yell
Of woe, which cleft alike their ears and hearts,
Awoke them -- round the ruined walls (which long
Retained, and to each other rattled shrill
The piercing sound) they, trembling, seek the cause.
It Is found. Within a clammy, clay-built hut --
(Which, for support, clung to the solemn stone)
With sticks and straws o'erlaid, whose scant enclosure
Received each gust of the ever shifting wind,
Yielded to every falling flint, and drank
Each drenching shower -- a form, with pallid want,
And misery overspread, lay stretched on earth,
And seemed, as in that moment life had left
Her wretched mansion; of attire so bare,
'Twas Misery's sad emblem! -- EDWARD knelt --
And, while his heart ran over with pity, raised
The dying frame -- then clasped within his bosom,
To kindle warmth, and sooth back wandering breath;
Supplying thus, with charitable care,
The sacred task of two enfeebled children,
Who, in their slender arms, had long sustained
That load of anguish; but worn out, at last,
Despoiled of all their strength, perforce, they gave
Their burden to the ground, and, in that cry
Of mad despair, instinctive seemed to ask
From Heaven that aid, they could no longer give.
With dubious aspect EDWARD eyes his charge:
Now thinks a faintish flush be-tints the cheek;
Now seems the lid, with weak assay, to court
A ray of light; and now, within the bosom,
Deep seems the struggling breath to sob -- but all
So short, and so imperfect, that his hopes
Die, ere they well are born. Just then HORATIO,
(Who in that very moment, when the scene
First met his eye, on mercy's wings had flown
To the next neighboring cottage) came supplied
With food and cordial bev'rage; wholesome wines,
Such as the birch or cowslip's yellow leaf
Yields to the dextrous housewife's art; -- o'erjoy'd,
EDWARD beholds; and, with united care,
Between them they support the famished wretch;
Dealing with prudent, not with niggard hand,
Scanty and slow relief, by soft degrees
Soliciting the coy return of life.
During their task (O man! how graceful thou
In such beseeming offices engaged!)
The elder girl, on whom some fourteen years
Had set their goodly mark, thus answered sweet
HORATIO's earnest questions: "'It Is indeed
"My mother, sir; my good, my loving mother,
"Who from the little that her labor earned,
"Gave us the largest share -- stinting herself
"To feed her children -- Illness now has long
"Made her unfit to labor, and the bounty
"Of charitable passengers has been
"Our only means of living. Oftentimes,
"When in the height of poverty and pain,
"I Have heard her wish to die, and say her heart
"Was dead long, long ago, and, weeping sore,
"Has often related all the dismal cause --
"That when she went with child, and was far gone,
"Of my young sister, sir, who stands beside you,
"(There Is but two years between us) one sad night,
"Expecting my poor father to his supper,
"From evening work, he was brought to her murdered,
"His head and face all over blood. -- By whom
"'It Was done, she never knew." The friends, at once,
From burning cheeks, and fire-emitting eyes,
Flashed wonder on each other; EDWARD starting,
Forgot his charge, and to a place remote
Flew, to assuage the fullness of his mind.
Now the tough father of the bounteous cot,
Whence good HORATIO brought the timely food,
(The evening duties of his farm discharged)
Returning with the guardian of his door,
His honest mastiff, seeks his homely board,
With Nature's plain and wholesome diet crowned;
Where, with his wife, his children, and domestics,
He wont to share the social hour, to hear
The waggish joke, and join the shout of mirth;
Or with delight repeat their labors past,
Re-tread their paths along the pasture sair,
Re-mount the sloping hill, review with glee,
Through Fancy's magic glass, the rising grain;
And thus, in Nature's honest feelings, pay
The God of Harvest not unwelcome praise.
Scarce was HORATIO gone, when he arrived --
(HORATIO, lord of every flowery lawn,
Each fertile mead, and deep-embow'ring grove,
For many miles around -- HORATIO, friend
To the distressed, and father of the poor;
The tenant's pride and favorite!) from his dame
The toiling rustic learns the strange event,
The place, the pressing cause -- deserts his meal,
And hour of mirth, and with his jolly sons,
Three sturdy, sun-burn'd lads, goes forth in haste,
To seek the presence of his much-loved lord,
And proffer honest aid, in home spun phrase.
Weak nature now, in some degree, repaired,
And vital sense and quickening warmth restored,
To them HORATIO glad resigns his charge;
Entreating, with religious care, their home
Might take the strangers in, and feed their wants,
Till he resumed the task; then seeks his friend,
Around the venerable walls -- where fixed,
And silent, he surprises him, with hands
Still clasped, though fallen, and heav'n-ward swelling eyes,
That teemed with holy wonder -- "Gracious God!"
Was all the raptured man could say; HORATIO,
Wistful how much he felt, with meek d^port
Engaged his arm, then with assuasive speech,
Strengthened by Reason, born of righteous Zeal,
Poured balm into his soul, as he beguiled
His wayward steps to seek their friendly home.
"'It Is as thy soul divines -- nay seek no more
"That wretched form -- all thy fond soul could ask
"To gratify the present wish, is done --
"Harbor, and rest, and peaceful bread is here is.
"From her own mouth, when power of speech, at last,
"Though weak, returned, I gained un-erring proofs;
"With temper hear, and as thou hears't adore
"The wonder-working hand (for such I deem it!)
"Which led thee through the maze of this great day;
"Then to thy adoration join, with me,
This firm belief, that from thy LIFE alone
"Redress is claimed -- Nor dare, by impious act
"Of fell despair, reduce thy date of years,
"But patient wait till Providence demands thee!
"Oh! See the Psalms.
tarry thou his leisure! if aright
"I judge, (and not presumptuous be it held!)
"He has not cast thee off, nor holds thy deed,
"Tho-foul, inexpiable -- he regards,
"With Mercy's eye, I trust, the erring hand
"Of youth, and rage -- and sees, (thy heart explored,)
"No love of guilt, no black intention there.
"What voice but his could call? Why interrupt
"The pious office which engaged thy soul?
"Does it not seem to say -- Behold, I show
"A greater duty far, a nearer claim
"Upon thy charity, which, undischarg'd,
"The rest avail thee lightiy? Oh! pursue
"The wondrous track, obey the great command,
"And all may yet be well." "Thou best of friends,"
EDWARD returned, (with softened heart and speech,
And eyes, that melted in affection's dew)
"Thy breath is comfort to my heart; thy words,
"With all conviction's force, assail my sense;
"To this great duty will I dedicate
"My future hours, and leave the rest to Heaven;
"And if he has not wholly cast me off,
"Nor holds my crime, though foul, inexpiable,
"May I, when I neglect this earthly task,
"His purposed mercy forseit!" Mild discourse
Thus sooths and cheers their hearts reciprocal,
Till in their sight the dear abode appears:
Where the forsaken family (surmising
Some distant act of goodness, called the friends,
With grace united, forth) completed well
The righteous work at home, and, ere they sent
The guests rejoicing forth, surcharged with stores,
They blessed the day, and bade its due return
With annual rites of charity be hallowed.
EDWARD, unsuited now to any converse
But that of his own mind, requests his friend
To gloze his absence with some fair excuse,
And to his chamber calm and clear retires.
The chamber gained, with care and anxious haste,
The door he closed, forbidding even a breath
Of transient air should interrupt his thought.
Beside his couch, in zeal precipitate,
Plunging upon his knees, "Almighty Father,
"(If yet by that dear name I dare invoke thee)
"Beam from thy throne of mercy one kind ray
"Of comfort on my breast, and teach my heart
"How, in my conduct, I may best atone
"My former guilt, and, in my hours to come,
"Deserve thy gracious care -- to all, that may
"Find favor in thy sight, far as I know,
"I here devote me -- every morn and eve
"My heart shall duly seek thee -- duly praise
"Thy wondrous power, beneficence and mercy;
"No day unmarked by charity shall pass;
"But chief the unhappy, whom my fatal hand,
"By one dire act, (Oh! pardon! pardon! pardon!)
"Made poor and widowed -- she shall never know
"A care, while life remains, if I have power
"To chase it from her breast -- my fortune's stream
"Shall flow unbounded over her wants, and feed
"Her withered heart with plenty -- to her children
"I Will be another father, in my love;
"And, if thy goodness, oh my GOD, permit
"A length of days for this my pious purpose,
"My gratitude shall bless thee; if denied,
"Right-willing I submit -- in every thing
"Be praised thy justice, and thy will be done!"
Heart-eas'd he rose; then to his pillow quick
Repairs, and coming night (whose thickened gloom
He wont not to behold without dismay,
Reluctant horror, each alarm of soul,
That apprehension breeds in conscious guilt,)
With earnest suit, he now invokes, in sleep
To shed relief on his much harrass'd sense.
His suit was heard; and Sleep, on downy plumes
Descending soft, envelop'd all the man.
When, to his mental eye, the very phantom,
Which all so late disturbed his inmost soul,
Once more appeared, but clad in other guise:
In the late haggard face distracted fear,
And writhing pain, and agonizing grief,
No more were seen; no more the bushy locks
With crimson drops were clotted and uprear'd.
Each placid feature seemed by gentle peace
Becalmed, and Satisfaction's sweetest smile
Beamed lovely; soft Content, in meek array,
Dwelt on the brow, and decent lay the locks:
So mild the form, Tranquillity therein
Seemed to have fixed her residence entire,
Immovable, eternal -- Thus it spoke,
While drops of comfort, from each sacred breath,
Melted on EDWARD's heart, as kindly dews,
From Heaven descending soft on newborn flowers.
"Repentant soul, sleep now a quiet sleep!
"My prayer is heard, my wishes are accomplished;
"Thou now have made a full redress -- awake
"To care and grief no more; henceforth be guilt,
"And pain, and sorrow, strangers to thy breast,
"But Peace, with all her train, inhabit there,
"And Pleasure strew thy paths! through mortal life
"Safe be thy course, and long! smooth be the bed
"Of death, and fairest gleams of opening bliss
"Shine on thy parting spirit! since REFENTANCE,
"In never-failing streams, has washed away
"The stains of guilt, and well thou have discharged
"Thy debt to JUSTICE, CHARITY, and GOD!"
So spoke the form benign; nor seemed to leave
The blessed couch, till Morn, with rosy hand,
Expanded full the golden gates of light.
Refreshed, and full of gladness, EDWARD rose;
First wafted grateful praise, with holy zeal,
Then sought, in haste, his friend; and over, and over,
Revolved, and re-possess'd the vision fair,
With wonder and delight; each greeting eye
He met with transport new; the name of son
He long enjoyed; and, from that hour, awoke
To care and grief no more; thenceforth were guilt,
And pain, and sorrow, strangers to his breast;
Peace, with her lovely train, resided there,
And pleasure strewn his paths; through mortal life
Safe was his course and long; smooth was the bed
Of death, and fairest gleams of opening bliss
Shone on his parting spirit: -- for REPENTANCE,
In never-failing streams, had washed away
The stains of guilt; and well he had discharged
His debt to JUSTICE, CHARITY, and GOD.
THE END.
