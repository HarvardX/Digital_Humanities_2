THE ROYAL GARLAND.
SCENE a romantic Country.
CALLIOPE discovered in a contemplative Attitude. CHORUS of SHEPHERDS. CHORUS.
CHief of the nine! awake! awake!
Oh! snatch thy heavenly lyre:
The poet's sullen silence break,
And all his soul inspire!
With numbers charm the attentive ear,
That kings may condescend to hear.

GENIUS of ENGLAND enters. RECITATIVO. GENIUS. Hear'st thou not, goddess, how
the mingled cries
Of Britain's sons invoke thee?

CALLIOPE. -- What incites
Their eager strain? and wherefore gleam these shades
With that surrounding glow of holy luster,
Shed from thy radiant form?

GENIUS. What? -- shall the royal stranger,
Who graces with his steps thy favorite isle,
Shall he depart, unhonour'd of the muse?
His birth, and near alliance to the throne,
And fond affection for thy plains, alike
Neglected and unsung?

SONG.
Him a nation's shouts approve,
Nobles praise, and monarchs love:
His the grace of Courts, and state,
Regal honors round him wait.
Commerce, lo! unlocks her stores,
At his feet her treasure pours,
Opens all her ample breast,
To thank, and hail the royal guest.
None the grateful debt refuse,
Save alone the slumbering muse.
Awake! awake! thy heavenly lyre,
All the poet's soul inspire!


RECITATIVE. CALLIOPE. It needs not, awful power, in simple phrase
Plain as their honest souls, Britannia's sons
Can speak their gratitude.

CHORUS heard behind. CHORUS. Duly we our tributes bring,
To grace the youth, to praise the king.

CALLIOPE. And hark! their notes --
Spontaneous fill the air Exeunt Shepherds.
. -- So thy good influence
Reigns in their bosoms, and directs their minds;
They want no aid from me.

SONG.
Round the Briton's generous heart
Sincerity instinctive flows,
Strong and clear, as round his isle
Ocean's ample torrent shows;
Labored strains of artful praise
Flattering tongues beseem alone;
Manly sense, and genuine truth
Have a language of their own.


Exeunt separately. SCENE a Wood.
Young SHEPHERD and SHEPHERDESS seated on a Bank. SONG.
YOUNG SHEPHERD. Since my Delia's plighted vow,
Softly-sweet the hours have flown;
Many such may fate allow,
Ere our loves and days are done!

SHEPHERDESS. Since Palemon's plighted vow,
Softly-sweet the hours have flown;
Many such may fate allow,
Ere our loves and days are done!

SONG.
SHEPHERDESS. Oh! what bliss the nuptial vow
On their lives must shower,
Who, like us, with joy look back,
And bless the auspicious hour!
When content approves the wish,
By young desire inflamed,
And reason justifies the choice,
Which early passion framed!



OLD SHEPHERD enters. RECITATIVO. OLD SHEPHERD. Fie, loit'ring boy! -- why sit
you idle here,
Lost to the highest duty of the year?

YOUNG SHEPHERD. Our harvest done, say how should we improve
The moments better than in tales of love?

SONG.
SHEPHERDESS. By your own good example, dear father, we are taught,
That love must be cherished, when once he is caught:

YOUNG SHEPHERD. That time for our pleasure too hastily flies,
And the summer of life is the season of joys.

OLD SHEPHERD. It Is true; yet awhile lay your raptures apart,
Let another enjoyment take place in your heart,
The stranger whose presence has honored your lands,
Your gratitude merits, your tribute demands.
In strains of pure nature our shepherds unite,
To open their bosoms, and show their delight;
To gaze on his glories tumultuous they throng,
And the sense of his virtue enriches the song.
Then away to the grove, where the rites they prepare,
Let Us share their employment, their pleasure let us share,
What task to the bosom so grateful can prove,
As the tribute of duty, sweet offspring of love?

ALL. No task to the bosom so grateful can prove,
As the tribute of duty, sweet offspring of love.



Exeunt. SCENE Opens to an extensive rural Prospect. Shepherds and
Shepherdesses variously employed, in culling Flowers, finishing wreaths, etc. A
large coronet of Flowers in the Center.
GENIUS of ENGLAND enters. SONG.
GENIUS. Is the mystic garland wave,
Token best of rural love?
All arrang'd in order neat?

OLD SHEPHERD. All is finished, -- all complete.


GENIUS. Has the myrtle with the rose
Vy'd in sweetness, to compose
A symbol for the noble youth,
Of early love and mutual truth?
Has the oak his branch entwined,
Of British strength and truth combined,
Emblem firm, memorial meet?

OLD SHEPHERD. All is finished, -- all complete.




RECITATIVO. GENIUS. It Is well, --
Yet 'ere the vessel from the crowded shore
Tear your imperial guest, resume the song;
And let it teem with wishes, such as suit
The grateful, kind, and hospitable heart.
That done, in blythesome measures seek the Youth,
And lay your duties at his royal feet.

SONG.
GENIUS. Gentle seas, propitious gales,
Waft his vessel, swell his sails!
So secure on Dania's plain,
Long and happy may he reign!

CHORUS. So secure on Dania's plain,
Long and happy may he reign!

GENIUS. No hostile arm his realms annoy,
Impair his state, or damp his joy!
So may all his moments prove,
Rich in grandeur, rich in love!

CHORUS. So may all his moments prove,
Rich in grandeur, rich in love!

SHEPHERDESS. In smiles of health and rapture dressed,
His blooming consort charm his breast!
And favored subjects ever sing,
The wife and sister of a king!

CHORUS. And favored subjects ever sing,
The wife and sister of a king!

GENIUS. To our much-loved lord allied,
Nearer by their virtues tied,
May naught destroy the friendly band,
That links our shores to Danian land.

CHORUS. May naught destroy the friendly band,
That links our shores to Danian land.



TO CONCLUDE WITH A GARLAND DANCE.
