ODE FOR MUSIC.
I.
DEscend ye Nine! descend and sing;
The breathing Instruments inspire,
Wake into Voice each silent String,
And sweep the sounding Lyre!
In a sadly-pleasing Strain
Let the warbling Lute complain:
Let the loud Trumpet sound,
Till the Roofs all around
The shrill Ecchos rebound:
While in more lengthened Notes and slow,
The deep, majestic, solemn Organs blow.
Hark! the Numbers, soft and clear,
Gently steal upon the Ear;
Now louder, and yet louder rise,
And fill with spreading Sounds the Skies;
Exulting in Triumph now swell the bold Notes,
In broken Air, trembling, the wild Music floats;
Till, by degrees, remote and small,
The Strains decay,
And melt away
In a dying, dying Fall.
II.
By Music, Minds an equal Temper know,
Nor swell too high, nor sink too low.
If in the Breast tumultuous Joys arise,
Music her soft, assuasive Voice applies;
Or when the Soul is pressed with Cares
Exalts her in enlivening Airs.
Warriors she fires with animated Sounds;
Pours Balm into the bleeding Lover's Wounds:
At Music, Melancholy lifts her Head;
Dull Morpheus rowzes from his Bed;
Sloth from its Lethargy awakes,
And listening Envy drops her Snakes;
Intestine War no more our Passions wage,
Even giddy Factions hear away their Rage.
III.
But when our Country's Cause provokes to Arms,
How martial Music every Bosom warms!
So when the first bold Vessel dared the Seas,
High on the Stern the Thracian raised his Strain,
While Argo saw her kindred Trees
Descend from Pelion to the Main.
Transported Demigods stood round,
And Men grew Heroes at the Sound,
Enflamed with Glory's Charms:
Each Chief his sevenfold Shield displayed,
And half unsheathed the shining Blade;
And Seas, and Rocks, and Skies rebound
To Arms, to Arms, to Arms!
IV.
But when through all the Infernal Bounds
Which flaming Phlegeton surrounds,
Sad Orpheus sought his Consort lost;
The Inexorable Gates were barred,
And naught was seen, and naught was heard
Around the dreary Coast,
But dreadful Gleams,
Dismal Screams,
Fires that glow,
Shrieks of Woe,
Sullen Moans,
Hollow Groans,
And Cries of tortured Ghosts.
But hark! he strikes the golden Lyre;
And see! the tortured Ghosts respire,
See shady Forms advance!
Thy Stone, O Sysiphus, stands still;
Ixion rests upon his Wheel,
And the pale Specter dance!
The Furies sink upon their Iron Beds,
And Snakes uncurl'd hang listening round their Heads.
V.
By the Streams that ever flow,
By the fragrant Winds that blow
Over the Elysian Flowers,
By those happy Souls who dwell
In Yellow Meads of Asphodel,
Or Amaranthine Bowers:
By the Hero's armed Shades
Glittering through the gloomy Glades,
By the Youths that died for Love,
Wandering in the Myrtle Grove,
Restore, restore Eurydice to Life;
Oh take the Husband, or return the Wife.
He sung, and Hell consented
To hear the Poet's Prayer;
Stern Proserpine relented,
And gave him back the Fair.
Thus Song could prevail
Over Death and over Hell,
A Conquest how hard and how glorious?
Though Fate had fast bound her
With Styx nine times round her,
Yet Music and Love were Victorious.
VI.
But soon, too soon, the Lover turns his Eyes:
Again she falls, again she dies, she dies!
How will thou now the fatal Sisters move?
No Crime was thine, if it is no Crime to love.
Now under hanging Mountains,
Beside the Falls of Fountains,
Or where Hebrus wanders,
Rolling in Maeanders,
All alone,
Unheard, unknown,
He makes his Moan;
And calls her Ghost
For ever, ever, ever lost!
Now with Furies surrounded,
Despairing, confounded,
He trembles, he glows,
Amidst Rhodope's Snows:
See, wild as the Winds, over the Desert he flies;
Hark! Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals Cries --
-- Ah see, he dies!
Yet even in Death Eurydice he sung,
Eurydice still trembled on his Tongue,
Eurydice the Woods,
Eurydice the Floods,
Eurydice the Rocks, and hollow Mountains rung.
VII.
Music the fiercest Griefs can charm,
And Fate's severest Rage disarm:
Music can soften Pain to Ease,
And make Despair and Madness please:
Our Joys below it can improve,
And antedate the Bliss above.
This the Divine Cecilia found,
And to her Maker's Praise confined the Sound.
When the full Organ joins the tuneful Quire,
The Immortal Powers incline their Ear;
Born on the swelling Notes our Souls aspire,
While solemn Airs improve the sacred Fire;
And Angels lean from Heaven to hear!
Of Orpheus now no more let Poets tell,
To bright Cecilia greater Power is given;
His Numbers raised a Shade from Hell,
Hers lift the Soul to Heaven.
FINIS.
