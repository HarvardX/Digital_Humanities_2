and C. DILLY, Poultry. M.DCC.LXXXVI.

VOICE Letters, or Vowels,
A, E, I, O, U, and Y.

A sounds like the French e in beat, as in ca-ble, fa-ble, sa-ble, ba-ker,
ha-ven, la-dy, ma-ker.

E like the French i in mill, as in be, he e-vil, le-gal, etc.

U like ew in few, pew, etc. as in du-ty fu-ry hu-man, etc.

Y, when a vowel, like the English i, as in buy, guy, ( wherein u is mute,)
dry, fry, my, dye, etc. in dissyllables accented on the last syllable, as ally,
comply, deny, etc. and in all words compounded with the Latin word fio, as
deify, magnify, specify, etc.

Double Voice-Letters, called Diphthongs.
Au and aw like the foreign a, as in maul, paul, sprawl, law, saw, paw. See
Rule IV.

Oi and oy, as in oil, boil, boy. See Rule V.

Oo like the French ou, as in boot, broom, loop, poor. See Rule VI.

Ou, ow, as in bound, crown. See Rule VII.

Improper Diphthongs, wherein only one of the vowels are sounded.
Ai, ay, and ey, like the English a, or French ai, as ai in Bail, dainty, gain,
nail, sail, Ay in may, pray, say, way. Ey in prey, gray, they, whey, convey,
obey, survey. See Rule VIII.

in pea, sea. Ee in eel, deep, feet, meet, steep. Ei in ceiling, seize, receive.
Ie in shield, grieve, grief, reprieve, Oe in foetus, subpoena, etc. except in
the end of a word ie is like i, as in die, lie, and oe is like o, as in foe,

Ui like a short i, as in build, guild. See Rule XII.

A TABLE of VOWELS, DIPHTHONGS and TERMINATIONS, the English sound of which
cannot be easily expressed in foreign letters, and should therefore be learned
by ear, viz.
I long, There are two ways of sounding the long i and y, (though both long,)
the one a little different from the other, and requiring a little extension of
the mouth, as may be seen by comparing the following words, viz. I and aye,
high and high-ho, by it (for by it) and bite, sighed and side, strive and
strife, etc but this difference, being so nice, is not to be attained but by
much practice, neither is it very material.
as in bible, mitre, nitre, pirate.

O and u short, before a consonant in the same syllable, as in odd, nod, lord,
etc. and in mud, strut, stun, urn, etc.

Oi and oy, which have both the same sound, as in oil, boil, coil, boy, coy,
hoy, etc.

Ou and ow ( not like the French ou, in the pronunciation of which the lips are
almost closed, but) with an open articulation, as in pound, our, gown, power.

Also the following terminations, viz. -ire, -tion -cious -tious
as in dire, fire, salvation, delicious, fictitious, etc.

(EXCEPTIONS to RULE I.)
Particular exceptions concerning a at the end of a syllable.

A is like the French a, or English diphthong aw, in wa-ter; it has a
medium-sund between aw and the English a in fa-ther, and the last syllable of
pa-pa, mam-ma; and it sounds like a short e, or foreign e, in a-ny and ma-ny.

Particular exceptions concerning i.

I sounds like the English e, or foreign i, in ac-qui-esce, bi-er, pi-er, ti-er.

General exceptions concerning i.

I is pronounced short before another vowel in the termination of all words of
more than two syllables when it is not radical; as in a-mi-a-ble, de-mo-ni-ac,

ending in y, which are mentioned in the example; as al-li-ance, com-pli-ance,
de-ni-al, de-fi-ance, and re-li-ance, wherein the i When i is substituted for
y, in the terminations of derivatives, it retains the sound of the y in the
original word, whether long or short; therefore i is short in ca^r-ri-er,
ca^r-r-ed, and ca^rr-es; and is like the y in the primitive words before
specified in al-li ance, de-ni al, digni-fied, im-plies, etc.
retains the sound of the y in the original words, and is accented accordingly.

Particular exceptions concerning o.

O is like oo in do, (and its compounds,) to, and who, though the latter (who)
is pronounced according to the rule in the northern parts of England.

U is like the English ou (hereafter explained) in the first syllable of
cu-cumber.

General exception concerning y.

Y, at the end of all words of two or more syllables, (except those mentioned
in the example,) is pronounced like a short i, as in carry, envy, commissary,
etc. the accent being laid on one of the former syllables.

A Repetition of RULE II. respecting Vowels, or Voice-Letters, in syllables
ending with a consonant.
The vowels are pronounced short in all syllables ending with a consonant,
(except in the particular cases hereafter noted,) and the three first vowels
have the foreign articulation, without any other material difference except
that of being pronounced short.

EXAMPLES.
A has a short articulation of the English aw, or rather of the Italian a, as
in add, bad, lad, mad, etc. E has exactly the sound of the Italian or French e,
as in bed, fed, led, red, etc. I has a short articulation of the French i or
English e, as in bid, did, hid, kid, etc. The short sound of the two other
vowels (viz. o and u) must be acquired by ear, (see page 5,) as in odd, got,
not, rob, etc. and in mud, grub, strut, stun, etc.
EXCEPTIONS to RULE II.
Particular exceptions concerning a before a consonant.

A is like the French ai in an-gel, bass, cam-brick, Cam-bridge, dan-ger, and
man-ger. It has a medium sound between aw and the English a in han't, (for have
not,) mas-ter, and plas-ter,; and is like aw in hal-ser, (wherein l is mute,)

(except in Latin words,) the es may be sounded in the same syllable, as bride,
brides; ride, rides; name, names; etc.

Particular exceptions concerning i before a consonant.

in nd, as bind, rind, wind, etc. though in wind, the substantive, and its
compounds, it is sometimes pronounced short.

It is also long before gh, as in high, nigh, light, etc. in which gh is mute,
having no other use than that of lengthening the i.

It is long also before gn at the end of a word, and the g is mute, as in
be-nign, sign, and its compounds consign, design, etc. and their derivatives in
-er, -ed, -edly, and -meant, but no others; for in re-sig-na-tion,

is pronounced.

original sound, even when the e is omitted, as spar-ing, -ed, from spare;

the same syllable, as weigh, freight, deign, feign, etc. (in all which g is
mute,) feint, teint, etc. except in three words mentioned above, slight,
seignory, and foreign.

Particular exceptions concerning ie.

Ie is like a short e in friend, and like a short i in sieve.

General exceptions concerning ie and oe.

Ie and oe at the end of a word are always like the first vowel in each
diphthong, viz. ie like i long, and oe like o long, as in die, foe, etc. except
in two words, shoe and canoe, wherein oe is commonly like oo.

N. B. The same is to be observed of the diphthong ue and ye at the end of a
word; the former being like a long u, and the latter like a long i, as in due,
pie, etc. the same likewise when s is added to make the plural nouns or third
person singular of verbs, as dies, foes, dues, pies, etc. and the s so added is
pronounced like z.

RULE X.
Eu, ew, and jew, like a single u long, Eau in beauty (and its derivatives) has
likewise the same sound.
as in Eu-rope, eu-nuch, brew, dew, view, etc.

Except ew in sew, which is commonly sounded like a long o.

RULE XI.
Oa is pronounced like o long, as in boat, coat, grown, moan, etc.

Except in broad, a-broad, and groat, wherein it partakes a little of the sound
of aw; and like ai in goal, (for gaol,) and the g is pronounced soft, as if
spelt jail.

RULE XII.
Ue and ui, before a consonant in the same syllable, have the short sound of
the last vowel in each diphthong; viz. ue like a short e, as in guess, guest,
etc. and ui like a short i, as in build, guild, conduit, etc. but in words
ending with silent e, the diphthong ui is pronounced like the English i long,
according to the third rule, as in guide, guile, disguise, etc.

Particular exceptions.

In the following words, the u alone is pronounced, viz. bruise, cruise, fruit,
juice, nui-sance, pur-suit, re-cruit, sluice, suit, and suit-or, which are
sounded as if spelt bruze, cruze, nu-sance, etc.

N. B. When ua, ue, ui, and uo, follow q in the same syllable, the u has the
power of w, which power cannot more easily be expressed to foreigners than by
comparing it to the sound of u in the French word quoi! or quoy! as in
quar-rel, quack, ques-tion, quick, quite, quit, quote, etc.

A TABLE of words, which are independent of the foregoing Rules and Exceptions,
with the common Pronunciation expressed in Italics.
BUOY, boey; victuals, vittles; colonel, curnel; George, Jorge; island, island;
lieutenant, leuftenant; quay, kee; two, too; yacht, yot; yeoman, yewman; yelk,
or yolk, (of an egg,) yoke.

A TABLE of Foreign Words which still retain their original Pronunciation, (or
nearly so,) notwithstanding that they are in a Manner adopted, by frequent Use,
into the English Language.
ACcoutre, antique, archives, arriere, banditti, beau, bureau, caviare,
cartouch, connoisseur, courier, croup, cuirass, environ, escrutoire, fascine,
groupe, intrigue, lieu, machine, magazine, marine, palanquin, pas, piquant,

AN APPENDIX, CONTAINING A brief Account OF THE CHIEF PECULIARITIES OF THE
ENGLISH CONSONANTS, By the late Rev. Mr. T. S.

AN APPENDIX, etc.
1. B is mute before t, or after m, in the same syllable, as debt, lamb, etc.

2. C sounds soft, like s, when followed by e, i, or an apostrophe, (denoting
the absence of e,) as cedar, city, danced, etc.

C sounds like sh, when followed by ea, ia, ie, or io, making different
syllables, as ocean, ancient, precious, social, etc. except society.

CC, when followed by e or i, sounds like x, as in accept, accident, etc.

C is mute in indict, victuals, scene, scent, science, sciatica, scissors,
scission, scymitar, scythe, and the proper names, Scyros, Scylla, and Scythia.

In all other cases c sounds hard like k.

3. Ch, when properly English, has the same sound with the Italian c before e
or i. Example, child, chain, etc.

It sounds also like sh in words derived from the French, as chaise,
Champaigne, etc. and like k in words of Greek extraction, as Christ, school,
stomach, archangel, etc. pronounced ark-angel. But if arch comes before a
consonant, ch has then its proper English sound, as in archbishop.

Ch in loch sounds like f.

Ch is mute in dram, schedule, and schism.

4. D is mute before ge, as in judge, bridge, etc. also in soldier.

5. F in of sounds like v.

6. G sounds soft like j before e, i, or an apostrophe, and hard (like the
Greek g) in all other cases.

Example. Angel, rage, raged, giant, ginger, etc.

Exceptions to g's sounding soft.

1. In the participles passive of words ending in g hard (and also wherever g
is doubled) it continues hard, notwithstanding the vowels e or i, or an
apostrophe, as in dragged, begging, digging, etc.

2. In the termination ger, wherever it makes a distinct syllable, g sounds
hard, as in an-ger, fin-ger, lon-ger, stron-ger, etc. in which kind of words it
may be observed, that the g sounds double, so as to belong to both syllables.

3. Derivatives in er, ed, or ing, from primitives in ng, retain the g hard, as
sing-ing, sing-er, from sing; hang-ing, hang-er, from hang; wing-ed, or winged,
from wing, etc. in which kind of words it may be observed, that g sounds
single, and belongs to the first syllable only.

4. In the following words g is hard notwithstanding it comes before e or i;
viz. geese, gewgaw, geld, gelt, Gertrude, get, (with its compounds,) gibberish,
gibbous, giddy, gift, gig, giggle, gild, girl, give, for-give, gilt, gimblet,
gimp, gird, girt, girdle, be-gin, gizzard, Gideon, Gibbons, Gilbert, and Gilpin.

G is mute before n in the same syllable, as guash, sign, sovereign, etc. also
in phlegm, seraglio, and bagnio.

7. Gh sounds like g hard in ghost, and like ff in cough, lough, laugh,
laughter, rough, slough, tough, trough, and enough. In other words it is mute.

8. H is mute in hour, honor, honest, heir, herb, humor, hostler, thyme,
John, Thomas, Thomasin, and Thames. Also in Greek words when preceded by R, as
rheum, rhyme, rhetoric, myrrh, etc. and, lastly, at the end of words, as ah,
hah, Isaiah, Sarah, etc.

9. K is mute before n in the same syllable, as in knave, know, knight, etc.

10. L is mute in balk, talk, walk, stalk, halm, calm, calf, calves, falcon,
half, ^alves, holme, (an island,) and Holmes, (a surname,) psalm, qualm,
salmon, could, should, and would.

11. N is mute after m in the same syllable, as hymn, autumn, solemn, etc.

12. P is mute before s, and between m and t, as psalm, tempt, etc.

13. Ph is always sounded like f, except in Stephen, nephew, and phial, where
it sounds like v.

Ph is mute in phthisic, and is pronounced tizzic.

14. Q is always followed by u, and, when it begins a syllable, sounds like cw,
by which (as Mr Johnson observes) our Saxon ancestors well expressed it. But,
in terminations from the Latin -quus, and also in words of French extraction,
it sounds like k. Example. Oblique, antique, quoif, conquer, risque, traffic,
etc. some of which words are now more commonly spelt with c or k, as coif,
risk, traffic, etc.

15. S sounds like z.

1. In the third persons singular of all verbs, and the plural number of all
nouns, as in has, was, tries, bees, times, etc.

2. In pronouns possessive, as his, hers, theirs, and also when preceded by the
comma denoting possession, as father's, mother's, Tom's, Will's, etc. Also in
the particle as.

Exceptions to the two last Sections.
S has its proper sound when preceded by c, k, ck, f, p, q, or t, which admit
not the sound of z so easily after them, as in speaks, beats, rocks, Jack's,
Dick's, Gilbert's, cock's spur, cat's paw, etc.

3. S sounds like z preceded by a liquid in the same syllable, as damsel,
crimson, Thames, Jersey, Guernsey, etc. and also,

4. S, between two vowels, most commonly sounds like z, as daisy, reprisal,
pleasant, please, rosin, etc.

Except house, mouse, louse, goose, geese, sausage, purchase, promise, case,
mason, basin, basis, phasis, and thesis. Except also substantives in use,
derived from Latin verbs, as use, abuse, disuse, refuse, excuse, etc. and
adjectives derived from the participles passive of some Latin verbs, as
recluse, profuse, abstruse, etc.

Lastly, Except also the words contained in the next section but one, where s
sounds like zh.
II. S and ss sound like sh in sure, (with its compounds,) issue, tissue,
fissure, pressure, Russian, etc. also in the terminations -assion, -ession,
-ission, -ussion, as in passion, impression, mission, concussion, etc.

III. S, when preceded by a vowel, and followed by ion or ian, sounds like zh,
as invasion, Ephesian, vision, delusion, etc. But if it be preceded by a
consonant, it sounds like sh, as in conversion, Persian, etc.

S sounds also like zh before -ier, as osier, hosier, glasier, brasier, etc.
and in the words leisure, measure, pleasure, and treasure.

S is mute in isle, Lisle, Carlisle, island, viscount, and demesne.

16. T, before io or ia, (making part of the same syllable with i,) sounds like
sh, as nation, cautious, Egyptian, satiate, etc. But, if t belong to the former
syllable, its retains its proper sound, as question, fustian, combustion, etc.

T is mute in words ending with -stle, as castle, thistle, bristle, etc.

Th has two sounds; the one soft, as in thy, the other hard, (like the Greek
th,) as in thigh.

I. Th sounds soft, 1st, in thence, there, (with their compounds,) then, that,
the, thee, these, this, those, thus, thou, thy, thine, their, theirs, them,
though, although, beneath, bequeath, betroth, mouths, tithe, seythe, wreath,
booth, and in the verbs bathe, mouth, sees, loathe, soothe, and breathe. 2dly,
Wherever it occurs between two vowels, as father, mother, etc. except words of
Greek extraction, and also derivatives from words ending with th hard, as
earthen from earth, etc. 3dly, Th sounds soft when placed between r and a
vowel, as burden, murder, etc. though in such words d is often pronounced
instead of th, as murder, burden. In other cases th sounds hard.


Th is mute in asthma, with its derivatives.

18. W is mute before r in the same syllable, as write, wrath, etc. also in
sword, swoon, and answer, with their compounds and derivatives.

The other consonants have the same powers as in other languages.

The Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments, etc. divided into
syllables, (according to the rule for spelling recommended by the learned
Bishop Lowth,) with references placed to those syllables which are exceptions
to the several rules laid down in this book respecting the pronunciation of
vowels and diphthongs.
