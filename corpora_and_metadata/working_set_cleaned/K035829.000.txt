the invasion or a trip to brighthelmstone a farce of two acts as it is performed with universal applause at the theater royal in covent garden written by f pilon  london printed for g kearsley no    fleet street mdcclxviii  entered at stationers hall  dedication to thomas harris esquire sir your treatment to me has been so singularly kind and liberal that it would be inflicting the severest punishment on my pride to oblige me to conceal it from the world i had been taught to believe that without a patron amongst the great or an established literary same it was next to an impossibility to get a piece introduced on the stage but you sir have proved to me that this complaint is groundless though unknown and unprotected your behavior to me has been such as the most delicate mind could suggest or the most powerful influence have procured me if then you countenance thus warmly so humble a tribute as mine at the shrine of the muses how much superior attention must you bestow on the more elevated and sublime efforts of the mind when thalia comes arrayed by the hand of genius with resistless graces or her weeping sister in native fables with all the conflicting passions in her train the encouragement you give to every dawn of talents whilst it wins you the respect and esteem of the public must prove of the most essential service to the cause of letters patronage and success often lend a degree of force and brilliancy to moderate abilities but ripen a truly fine genius into immediate perfection i have the honor to remain  sir your much obliged and faithful humble servant frederick pilon  preface public taste has run so much of late on the french petite comedy of two acts that it seems necessary to say something in justification of farce to prevent its being tried by the too rigid rules of criticism in this refined age low and absurd are terms of reproach heard to echo from the benches of the upper gallery so that whoever attempts to raise a laugh by downright farce must expect critics in all quarters of the house ready to damn him for attempting to put them in good humor  farce has ever been considered so essentially different from comedy that any incident in the latter bordering upon the extravagant has been termed farcical or outre by way of discrimination this species of entertainment is certainly more a caricature than a faithful picture of nature  the outline is preserved but extended and every tint of the coloring considerably heightened for instance  can any thing be more improbable and extravagant than the plot and incidents of the mock doctor yet this has been the production of two of the first comic geniusses this or any other country ever produced it is not to be supposed that moliere and fielding were ignorant of the rules of the drama nevertheless in their best farces they totally lost fight of them appearing to have nothing in view but whimsical characters and laughable situations the humor and characters of the invasion in some places have been censured as low but surely the same charge holds good against the the most celebrated writers smollett fielding gay cervantes all descended to the humble walk of life in search of humor and never rejected her for the homeliness of her garb it is true that if painting low life be a fault those distinguished wits were possessed of beauties sufficient to eclipse little spots in their reputation the writer of the invasion feels but too sensibly the humiliating distance he is thrown from them and that whatever his faults are he has nothing to depend upon for hiding them except the candor of his readers the following little entertainment he meant merely as a farce and as such only he hopes it will be considered and judged of  he cannot conclude without returning his warmest acknowledgments to mr garrick for assistances in the invasion which have contributed more than the merit of the author to its success with the public  the performers in general acquitted themselves with the greatest spirit and propriety particularly mr lee jews who by his speaking the prologue and his acting cameleon proved that he was possessed of all those various and versatile powers which constitute the truly capital comedian  prologue written by the author and spoken by mr lee jews the muse in change and fashion still delighting now raves of nothing but of camps and fighting of mines of ambuscades and heroes slain armed capapie on the embattled plain of covent garden or of drury lane one night a camp by candle light she shows next an invasion without wounds or blows beneath the arches our encampment nigh where walking belles and irish chairmen ply where playbills spread seem like a sentinel to guard the entrance of the citadel a crowd whose wonder our invasion raised with curious comment on each playbill gazed expecting nothing less than war and plunder and cannon louder than the rattling thunder an honest tar with his dear sue in tow whom he from wapping brought to see the show hearing debates run high upon this night put in his word to set his neighbors right avast my masters and i will let you know what these folks mean by their invasion show dont you perceive the invasions all a skit to laugh at monsieurs for their want of wit invade us boys why sluice my english blood and send me home with all my timbers wood if i ben block with half the british fleet would not these parleyvous most soundly beat aye damn me would i or i would lose my life and then the king god bless him keeps my wife an irish blade who heard this heart of oak replied my honey i believe you joke did not monsieur thurot last war sail post to invade old england on the irish coast faith and he did an hell had been to do but that brave elliot shot him through and through which so surpised him as along he cruizd to fight no more he begged to be excused thus britons rudely that great spirit show which always conquered and chastisd her foe that spirit of such energy divine clouds and misfortunes make it brighter shine perfidious gaul now feels this countrys might ashamed to yield and yet afraid to fight pursue your triumph britons strike the blow that humbles in the dust your faithless foe that side which justice strength and valor take honor and conquest never will forsake  dramatis personae men sir john evergreen  mr quick charles evergreen  mr whitfieid beaufort  mr

in waiting beauf come charles fill your glass  here is reformation to your father   drinks charles with all my soul for sure never was reformation more wanted since shaving became fashionable in russia   beauf i have not seen emily this month as he knows she has a fortune of ten thousand pounds independent of him he keeps her a close prisoner and to such an excess does this military mania hurry him that i believe in my conscience he would prefer a sergeant of invalids or a chelsea pensioner to your discarded friend for a soninlaw   charles i left oxford with a full persuasion that your influence would have reconciled us   beau my influence charles ceased the moment i refused to quit the bar and purchase a commission in vain did i expostulate and represent the ridicule as a lawyer i must incur by going into the army he continued inflexible asserted old england was in danger daily of an invasion and that every man who had a regard for her laws and constitution should now fight for them   came then sir it seems he is in great dread of an invasion   beauf in such dread of it that he has got a sergeant and a drummer that are down here on a recruiting party to teach him his exercise  nay i am told he intends sinking a trench round evergreen hall and converting it into a garrison   cha i suppose he is the jest of the whole county   beauf why faith no  very few know any thing about him brighthelmstone during the season is too much engaged with scandal and gallantry  then his house standing so far out of the town    cha sdeath if instead of banishing me for faults he was guilty of himself at my age he had clapped a sword into my hand and bade me fight for my country he would have acted like an englishman and a good father but an old fellow of sixty troubled three or four times a year with the gout to think of going into the army  he may as well think of a wife   beauf i suppose you have heard that your old aunt lady catherine rouge passed this summer for the first time at his house she sir is my most formidable enemy would you believe it charles the old lady actually made love to me and because i did not return her overtures with all the warmth she expected like a true woman she most cordially hates me   came she does  more shame for you sir to put it in her power   beauf why camelion sure you dont suppose i could make love to a woman old enough to be my grandmother   came aye to your grandmother herself provided that was the only method you had left to obtain the real mistress of your heart now had i been in your situation and she had been as withered as a mummy without a tooth in her head or a hair of any color to boast of i would have been at her feet from morning till night swore that she had a cupid in every wrinkle that i loved her more than antony did cleopatra and that if the goddess of discord threw another golden apple upon earth to be given to the fairest and appointed me judge her ladyship without having a tooth to eat it should have had the pippin before tomorrow morning   beauf and cha ha ha ha   beauf why cameleon you are a wit and from some of your slights i should conclude a piece of a scholar   came it is no matter what i am sir i wish to serve my master and serve you too sir and i think i can do it provided my master is not altogether so squeamish as his friend   cha what are you driving at cameleon   came i only hope sir that you are not so refined in your notions of beauty as mr beaufort and that provided it is your interest you can mistake the snow upon an old sapless trunk for blossoms and green leaves and swear you feel the heat of the dog days in the month of december but to wave metaphor i hope sir you will think that lady catherine has still some charms left   cha why you rascal have you forgot she is my aunt   came your aunt what then has not she a great deal of money and dont you think it would be a pity to let it go out of the family has she ever seen you   cha not since i was eight years old when i remember she has often taken me on her knee patted my cheek played with my ringlets and called me her little adonis   came then sir you must now return the compliment you must take her upon your knee pat her cheeks play with her ringlets and call her your fullgrown venus   cha psha fool this will never take a woman that has lived in the sphere she has    came will believe any handsome young fellow who tells her he is love with her the sphere she has lived in sdeath sir do you suppose women of quality live in the sphere of dian or are all born under virgo it might have been so formerly but the present race are certainly under the influence of warmer planets a woman of quality expects lovers to the last moment of her life and as the kings of france from excess of respect are supposed never to die so a woman of fashion from excess of gallantry is supposed never to cease to be beautiful a woman such as lady catherine like ice before the sun will dissolve at the blaze which surrounds a fine young fellow   cha o your humble servant sir   came i am right in my philosophy   beau i relish your scheme exceedingly cameleon the old lady charles is as rich as a jew and can do any thing with your father now if you play your cards skilfully you may with ease draw her into such a ridiculous situation that she will be glad to purchase your silence at any rate   came sir you have hit it make love to her and afterward discard me as a blockhead or stone me for a false prophet if it prove not the means of all your debts being paid and you being reconciled to your father as firmly as ever here waiter bring pen ink and paper  enter waiter with pen ink and paper write to her immediately and entreat an interview which i am sure she will grant   cha and what name am i to assume   sits down came what name  why let me see  suppose you borrow sir george narcissuss name  he is your intimate friend and as utterly unknown in person to lady catherine as you are   cha enough  sits down and writes waiter bring a candle   came i have a scheme to serve you too mr beaufort   beau i thank you cameleon but that i know to be out of your power   came dont think slightly of my power till you are better acquainted with it what would you think if i procured you an interview with miss evergreen this very afternoon   beau think that you are machiavel himself  enter waiter with a candle but prythee tell me how you propose effecting this   came you have no objection to wearing a livery   beau none in the world   cha impudent rascal the next question i suppose you will ask him is whether he will go on board wages   came then sir i will assume the character of the celebrated enamel the dentist from london i lived with him two years and whenever i please we are as like as two eye teeth you shall pass as my servant and in this disguise we will visit sir john as recommended by colonel platoon his particular friend in london to give him a new set of teeth and a left eye that he may look like a soldier when he goes into the militia   beauf but what end will this answer   came why sir while i am amusing sir john with all the fashionable jargon of a firstrate dentist you will have an opportunity of conversing with your mistress and of assuring her that if she will consent you will deliver her this night   beauf this night camelion   came this night sir if there is faith in man  you know he is always raving of an invasion that is my engine i will unsold my plot on our way to evergreenhall you may depend i think on its success when sir johns character is considered therefore employ all your eloquence with your mistress for nothing but her disapprobation of our plan can defeat it   beauf if it succeeds i will make your fortune   came have you finished the loveletter to your aunt yet sir   cha i have just sealed it   came sealed it what before i saw the contents of it   cha why sirrah do you think i want your assistance to write a letter   came but lord sir a love letter is such a different kind of letter from all other letters that without great practice there is no such thing as writing one especially to an elderly lady  for after a certain period the taste becomes so callous it relishes nothing that is not seasoned very high  have you put darts and flames enough into it   cha aye enough to burn the messengers fingers   came then give it to me sir  i will send it to her ladyship piping hot by an old fellow servant whose livery and face i am sure she knows nothing of  away my masters  victory

little respite when the grenadiers march struck up diredtly under my window  then pop pop went the muskets for three or four hours tearing my poor head to pieces till what with the noise and fretting i almost lost my senses   sally lord your ladyship it was sir john and his servants that made all that racket and uproar  he has got a sergeant and a drummer from brighthelmstone to teach him his exercise  if your ladyship was to see him and roger the carter and william the postillion marching and desiling about and turning out their toes and handling their arms you would die with laughing as

at that name and how active is fancy to torment with hopes which are now no more  song i what painful moments counts the maid whose faithful bosom still retains the image love has made against a parents will ii no morn that shakes its rosy wings dawns peace upon her breast and night that balmy slumber brings to her affords no rest iii in vain she hopes that time will prove what absence could not give for should she cease one hour to love she would cease that hour to live iv thus deep within the wounded heart the fatal arrow lies and when to ease we draw the dart the hapless victim dies

boot from the leg of a trooper whose brains were just blown out and entrenched me up to the chin in it in the twirling of a ramrod as soon as i found myself sir safely garrisoned in the boot i bent my knees to take every advantage of my post and damn me if i did not maintain it with the greatest steadiness till the battle was over without receiving a single wound but one and where do you think that

 came after dinner as she was sipping from her water glass an awkward booby of a servant jostled her elbow and drove the edge of the glass with such violence against her fore teeth that the whole set bounced into her lap in a twinkling  every body stared not so much at the accident as it was one might have happened to most of themselves as at the prodigious alteration it made in lady mary  her cheeks which appeared as round and as plump as a peach shrunk into wrinkles her lips fell in her nose and chin approached and from a fine blooming girl of five and twenty  before the cloth was removed she was hagged into an antiquated maiden of threescore   sir j ha ha ha  a very good story sdeath if it were possible for such an accident to befall me i should never be able to show my face again

muzzles  but you shall hear  the handkerchief they took for colors and accordingly discharged a full broadside into me which carried away my mast fails and rigging killed every soul on board except myself and mangled me in a terrible manner   sir john mangled you why you dont seem to have any wounds now   cameleon ah sir if you had seen me when i came on shore this morning  all the cocks of my hat were shot away so that it looked like a bowl or a basin on my head several balls were lodged in the skirts of my coat my trowsers had more holes in em than a cullendar and i should have lost my thigh by a musket ball but for a tobacco box in my breeches pocket however as if that ball had a spite against me it wheeled afterward into the forecastle penetrated the door of a locker and broke into fritters a cardivine of choice cognac i had just purchased from a smuggler   sir john they told you they were coming to brighthelmstone   cameleon they did indeed sir and to show you what it is to be encouraging foreigners they were persuaded to come here by some frenchmen that were down here last season as servants to lady ostrich who told them there was a power of company here and that they would make their fortunes   sir john i thought so i thought that all this mischief was owing to our damned frenchified people of quality   cameleon do you speak french sir   sir john french no
