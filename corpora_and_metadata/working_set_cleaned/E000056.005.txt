convention i have waited for this opportunity of inclosing you a copy of the proposed constitution for the u states i forbear to make any observations on it either on the side of its merits or its faults the best judges of both will be those who can combine with a knowledge of the collective  permanent interest of america a freedom from the bias resulting from a participation in the work if the plan proposed be worthy of adoption the degree of unanimity attained in the convention is a circumstance as fortunate as the very respectable dissent on the part of virginia is a subject of regret the double object of blending a proper stability  energy in the government with the essential characters of the republican form and of tracing a proper line of demarkation between the national and state authorities was necessarily found to be as difficult as it was desirable and to admit of an infinite   diversity concerning the means among those who were unanimously agreed concerning the end i find by a letter from my father that he  my uncle erasmus have lately paid their respects to edmundsbury i infer from his silence as to your health that no unfavorable change had happened in it that this

haste that i had no time to write by him and i thought the omission of the less consequence as your last letter led me to suppose that you must about that time be absent on your trip to frederick i arrived here on monday last  the act of the convention   was then before congress it has been since taken up  by a unanimous vote forwarded to the states to be proceeded on as recommended by the convention what reception this new system will generally meet with cannot yet be pronounced for obvious reasons opposition is as likely to arise in virginia as anywhere the city of philada has warmly espoused it both parties there it is said have united on the occasion it may happen nevertheless that a country party may spring up and give a preponderancy to the opposite scale in this city the general voice coincides with that of philada but there is less apparent unanimity and it is pretty certain that the party in power will be active in defeating the new system in boston the reception given to it is extremely favorable we are told but more will depend on the country than the town the echo from   connecticut  new jersey as far as it has reached us denotes a favorable disposition in those states i inclose a few plumbstones from an excellent tree i am aware that this is not the true mode of propagating the fruit but it sometimes succeeds and sometimes even improves the fruit with my affecte regards to my mother  the family i remain yr dutifl son james madison sepr  0      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york sepr  0      dear sir— i found on my arrival here that certain ideas unfavorable to the act of the convention which had created difficulties in that body had made their way into congress they were patronised chiefly by mr r h lee and mr dane of massts it was first urged that as the new constitution was more than an alteration of the articles of confederation under which congress acted and even subverted those articles altogether there was a constitutional impropriety in their taking any positive agency in the work the answer given was that the resolution of congress in feby had recommended the convention as the best mean of obtaining a firm national government that as the powers of the convention were defined by their commissions in nearly the same terms with the powers of congress given by the confederation on the subject of alterations congress were not more restrained from acceding to the new   plan than the convention were from proposing it if the plan was within the powers of the convention it was within those of congress if beyond those powers the same necessity which justified the convention would justify congress and a failure of congress to concur in what was done would imply either that the convention had done wrong in exceeding their powers or that the government proposed was in itself liable to insuperable objections that such an inference would be the more natural as congress had never scrupled to recommend measures foreign to their constitutional functions whenever the public good seemed to require it and had in several instances particularly in the establishment of the new western governments exercised assumed powers of a very high  delicate nature under motives infinitely less urgent than the present state of our affairs if any faith were due to the representations made by congress themselves echoed by    states in the union and confirmed by the general voice of the people an attempt was made in the next place by r h l to amend the act of the convention before it should go forth from congress  he proposed a bill of rights—provision for juries in civil cases  several other things corresponding with the ideas of colonel mason he was supported by mr melancthon smith of this state it was contended that congress had an undoubted right to   insert amendments and that it was their duty to make use of it in a case where the essential guards of liberty had been omitted on the other side the right of congress was not denied but the inexpediency of exerting it was urged on the following grounds—  that every circumstance indicated that the introduction of congress as a party to the reform was intended by the states merely as a matter of form and respect   that it was evident from the contradictory objections which had been expressed by the different members who had animadverted on the plan that a discussion of its merits would consume much time without producing agreement even among its adversaries   that it was clearly the intention of the states that the plan to be proposed should be the act of the convention with the assent of congress which could not be the case if alterations were made the convention being no longer in existence to adopt them   that as the act of the convention when altered would instantly become the mere act of congress and must be proposed by them as such and of course be addressed to the legislatures not conventions of the states and require the ratification of thirteen instead of nine states and as the unaltered act would go forth to the states directly from the convention under the auspices of that body—some states might ratify the one  some the other of the plans and confusion  disappointment be the least evils that would ensue these difficulties which at one time threatened a serious division in congs and popular alterations   with the yeas and nays on the journals were at length fortunately terminated by the following resolution congress having recd the report of the convention lately assembled in philada resold unanimously that the said report with the resolutions  letter accompanying the same be transmitted to the several legislatures in order to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof in conformity to the resolves of the convention made  provided in that case eleven states were present the absent ones r i  maryland a more direct approbation would have been of advantage in this  some other states where stress will be laid on the agency of congress in the matter and a handle be taken by adversaries of any ambiguity on the subject with regard to virginia  some other states reserve on the part of congress will do no injury the circumstance of unanimity must be favorable every where the general voice of this city seems to espouse the new constitution it is supposed nevertheless that the party in power is strongly opposed to it the country must finally decide the sense of which is as yet wholly unknown as far as boston  connecticut have been heard from the first impression seems to be auspicious i am waiting with anxiety for the echo from virginia but with very faint hopes of its corresponding with my wishes    with every sentiment of respect  esteem  every wish for your health  happiness i am dear sir your obedient humble servt p s a small packet of the size   vol  ° addressed to you lately came to my hands with books of my own from france genl pinkney has been so good as to take charge of them he set out yesterday for s carolina  means to call at mount vernon james madison october        new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph  new york october        dear sir—          we hear nothing decisive as yet concerning the general reception given to the act of the convention the advocates for it come forward more promptly than the adversaries the sea coast seems every where fond of it the party in boston which was thought most likely to make opposition are warm in espousing it it is said that mr s adams objects to one point only viz the prohibition of a religious test mr bowdoins objections are said to be against the great number of members composing the legislature and the intricate election of the president   you will no doubt have heard of the fermentation in the assembly of pennsylvania           james madison octr         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york octr         dear sir— the letter herewith inclosed was put into my hands yesterday by mr de crevecœur who belongs to the consular establishment of france in this country i add to it a pamphlet  which mr pinkney has submitted to the public or rather as he professes to the perusal of his friends and a printed sheet  containing his ideas on a very delicate subject  0 too delicate in my opinion to have been properly confided to the press he conceives that his precautions against any further circulation of the piece than he himself authorizes are so effectual as to justify the step i wish he may not be disappointed in communicating a copy to you i fulfil his wishes only no decisive indications of the public mind in the northn  middle states can yet be collected the reports continue to be rather favorable to the act of the convention from every quarter but its adversaries will naturally be latest in shewing themselves boston is certainly friendly an opposition is known to be in petto in connecticut but it is said not to be much dreaded by the other side rhode island will be divided on this subject in the same manner that it has been on the question of paper money the newspapers here have contained sundry publications animadverting on the proposed constitution  it is known that the government party are hostile to it there are on the other side so many able  weighty advocates and the conduct of the eastern states if favorable will add so much force to their arguments that there is at least as much ground for hope as for apprehension i do not learn that any opposition is likely to be made in n jersey the temper of pennsylvania will be best known to you from the direct information which you cannot fail to receive through the newspapers  other channels congress have been of late employed chiefly in settling the requisition and in making some arrangements for the western country the latter consist    of the appointment of a govr  secretary and the allotment of a sum of money for indian treaties if they should be found necessary the requisition so far as it varies our fiscal system makes the proportion of indents receivable independently of specie  those of different years indiscriminately receivable for any year and does not as heretofore tie down the states to a particular mode of obtaining them mr adams has been permitted to return home after feby next  mr jeffersons appointment continued for three years longer with the most perfect esteem  most affectionate regard i remain dr sir your obedt friend  servt james madison octr         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york octr         dear sir— i have been this day honored with your favor of the  0th instant under the same cover with which is a copy of col masons objections to the work of the convention  as he persists in the temper which produced his dissent it is no small satisfaction to find him reduced to such distress for a proper gloss on it for no other consideration surely could have led him to dwell on an objection    which he acknowledged to have been in some degree removed by the convention themselves—on the paltry right of the senate to propose alterations in money bills—on the appointment of the vice president president of the senate instead of making the president of the senate the vice president which seemed to be the alternative—and on the possibility that congress may misconstrue their powers  betray their trust so far as to grant monopolies in trade c— if i do not forget too some of his other reasons were either not at all or very faintly urged at the time when alone they ought to have been urged such as the power of the senate in the case of treaties  of impeachments and their duration in office with respect to the latter point i recollect well that he more than once disclaimed opposition to it my memory fails me also if he did not acquiesce in if not vote for the term allowed for the further importation of slaves  and the prohibition of duties on exports by the states what he means by the dangerous tendency of the judiciary i am at some loss to comprehend it was never intended nor can it be supposed that in ordinary cases the inferior tribunals will not have final jurisdiction in order to prevent the evils of which he complains the great mass of suits in every state lie between citizen  citizen and relate to matters not of federal cognizance    notwithstanding the stress laid on the necessity of a council to the president i strongly suspect tho i was a friend to the thing that if such an one as col mason proposed had been established and the power of the senate in appointments to offices transferred to it that as great a clamour would have been heard from some quarters which in general echo his objections what can he mean by saying that the common law is not secured by the new constitution though it has been adopted by the state constitutions the common law is nothing more than the unwritten law and is left by all constitutions equally liable to legislative alterations i am not sure that any notice is particularly taken of it in the constitutions of the states if there is nothing more is provided than a general declaration that it shall continue along with other branches of law to be in force till legally changed the constitution of virga drawn up by col mason himself is absolutely silent on the subject an ordinance passed during the same session declared the common law as heretofore  all statutes of prior date to the   of james i to be still the law of the land merely to obviate pretexts that the separation from g britain threw us into a state of nature and abolished all civil rights and objections since the revolution every state has made great inroads  with great propriety in many instances on this monarchical code the revisal of the laws by a com̃ittee of wch col mason was a member though not an acting one abounds with such innovations the abolition of    the right of primogeniture which i am sure col mason does not disapprove falls under this head what could the convention have done if they had in general terms declared the common law to be in force they would have broken in upon the legal code of every state in the most material points they wd have done more they would have brought over from g b a thousand heterogeneous  antirepublican doctrines and even the ecclesiastical hierarchy itself for that is a part of the common law if they had undertaken a discrimination they would have formed a digest of laws instead of a constitution this objection surely was not brought forward in the convention or it wd have been placed in such a light that a repetition of it out of doors would scarcely have been hazarded were it allowed the weight which col m may suppose it deserves it would remain to be decided whether it be candid to arraign the convention for omissions which were never suggested to them—or prudent to vindicate the dissent by reasons which either were not previously thought of or must have been wilfully concealed but i am running into a comment as prolix as it is out of place i find by a letter from the chancellor mr pendleton that he views the act of the convention in its true light and gives it his unequivocal approbation his support will have great effect the accounts we have here of some other respectable characters vary considerably much will depend on mr henry and i am glad to find by your letter that his favorable    decision on the subject may yet be hoped for —the newspapers here begin to teem with vehement  violent calumniations of the proposed govt as they are chiefly borrowed from the pensylvania papers you see them of course the reports however from different quarters continue to be rather flattering with the highest respect  sincerest attachment i remain dear sir yr obedt  affecte servt james madison october         new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york october         my dear friend i mentioned in a late letter that i had addressed to your care a small box of books for the university i now enclose the bill of lading i enclosed also a bill of lading for another box destined for mr w hay will you be so good as to have it handed to him i paid two dollars for its freight from france to this port which he may repay to you the money you remitted by me to col carrington having somewhat exceeded the amount of his demand the two dollars may the more properly pass into your hands i have received no letter from you since your halt at the bolling green we hear that opinions are various in virginia on the plan of the convention i have received within a few days a letter from the chancellor by which i find that he gives it his    approbation and another from the president of william and mary which though it does not absolutely reject the constitution criticises it pretty freely the newspapers in the northern and middle states begin to teem with controversial publications the attacks seem to be principally levelled against the organization of the government and the omission of the provisions contended for in favor of the press and juries c a new combatant however with considerable address and plausibility strikes at the foundation he represents the situation of the united states to be such as to render any government improper and impracticable which forms the states into one nation and is to operate directly on the people judging from the newspapers one would suppose that the adversaries were the most numerous and the most earnest but there is no other evidence that it is the fact on the contrary we learn that the assembly of new hampshire which received the constitution on the point of their adjournment were extremely pleased with it all the information from massachusetts denotes a favorable impression there the legislature of connecticut have unanimously recommended the choice of a convention in that state and mr baldwin who is just from the spot informs me that from present appearances the opposition will be inconsiderable that the assembly if it depended on them would adopt the system almost unanimously and that the clergy and all the literary men are exerting themselves in its favor rhode island is divided the    majority being violently against it the temper of this state cannot yet be fully discerned a strong party is in favor of it but they will probably be outnumbered if those whose numbers are not yet known should take the opposite side new jersey appears to be zealous meetings of the people in different counties are declaring their approbation and instructing their representatives there will probably be a strong opposition in pennsylvania the other side however continue to be sanguine doctor carroll who came hither lately from maryland tells me that the public voice there appears at present to be decidedly in favor of the constitution notwithstanding all these circumstances i am far from considering the public mind as fully known or finally settled on the subject they amount only to a strong presumption that the general sentiment in the eastern and middle states is friendly to the proposed system at this time present me respectfully to mrs r and accept the most fervent wishes for your happiness from your affect friend james madison octr

met with some accident no account whatever can be gathered concerning it it probably was not shipped from france ubbos book i find was not omitted as you seem to have apprehended the charge for it however is which i must beg you to supply the duplicate vol of the encyclopedie i left in virginia and it is uncertain when i shall have an opportunity of returning it your spanish duplicates will i fear be hardly vendible i shall make a trial whenever a chance presents itself a few days ago i recd your favor of    of augst via lorient  boston the letters inclosed along with it were immediately sent to virga you will herewith receive the result of the convention    which continued its session till the   th of september i take the liberty of making some observations on the subject which will help to make up a letter if they should answer no other purpose it appeared to be the sincere and unanimous wish of the convention to cherish and preserve the union of the states no proposition was made no suggestion was thrown out in favor of a partition of the empire into two or more confederacies it was generally agreed that the objects of the union could not be secured by any system founded on the principle of a confederation of sovereign states a voluntary observance of the federal law by all the members could never be hoped for a compulsive one could evidently never be reduced to practice and if it could involved equal calamities to the innocent  the guilty the necessity of a military force both obnoxious  dangerous and in general a scene resembling much more a civil war than the administration of a regular government hence was embraced the alternative of a government which instead of operating on the states should operate without their intervention on the individuals composing them and hence the change in the principle and proportion of representation this groundwork being laid the great objects which presented themselves were   to unite a proper energy in the executive and a proper stability in the legislative departments with the essential characters of republican government   to draw a line of demarkation which would give to the  0 general government every power requisite for general purposes and leave to the states every power which might be most beneficially administered by them   to provide for the different interests of different parts of the union   to adjust the clashing pretensions of the large and small states each of these objects was pregnant with difficulties the whole of them together formed a task more difficult than can be well conceived by those who were not concerned in the execution of it adding to these considerations the natural diversity of human opinions on all new and complicated subjects it is impossible to consider the degree of concord which ultimately prevailed as less than a miracle the first of these objects as respects the executive was peculiarly embarrassing on the question whether it should consist of a single person or a plurality of coordinate members on the mode of appointment on the duration in office on the degree of power on the reeligibility tedious and reiterated discussions took place the plurality of coordinate members had finally but few advocates governour randolph was at the head of them the modes of appointment proposed were various as by the people at large—by electors chosen by the people—by the executives of the states—by the congress some preferring a joint ballot of the two houses—some a separate concurrent ballot allowing to each a negative on the other house—some a nomination of several candidates by one house out of whom a choice should be made by the other several other    modifications were started the expedient at length adopted seemed to give pretty general satisfaction to the members as to the duration in office a few would have preferred a tenure during good behaviour—a considerable number would have done so in case an easy  effectual removal by impeachment could be settled it was much agitated whether a long term seven years for example with a subsequent  perpetual ineligibility or a short term with a capacity to be reelected should be fixed in favor of the first opinion were urged the danger of a gradual degeneracy of reelections from time to time into first a life and then a hereditary tenure and the favorable effect of an incapacity to be reappointed on the independent exercise of the executive authority on the other side it was contended that the prospect of necessary degradation would discourage the most dignified characters from aspiring to the office would take away the principal motive to ye faithful discharge of its duties—the hope of being rewarded with a reappointment would stimulate ambition to violent efforts for holding over the constitutional term—and instead of producing an independent administration and a firmer defence of the constitutional rights of the department would render the officer more indifferent to the importance of a place which he would soon be obliged to quit forever and more ready to yield to the encroachmts of the legislature of which he might again be a member the questions concerning the degree of power turned chiefly on the appointment to offices and the controul on the    legislature an absolute appointment to all offices—to some offices—to no offices formed the scale of opinions on the first point on the second some contended for an absolute negative as the only possible mean of reducing to practice the theory of a free government which forbids a mixture of the legislative  executive powers others would be content with a revisionary power to be overruled by three fourths of both houses it was warmly urged that the judiciary department should be associated in the revision the idea of some was that a separate revision should be given to the two departments—that if either objected two thirds if both three fourths should be necessary to overrule in forming the senate the great anchor of the government the questions as they came within the first object turned mostly on the mode of appointment and the duration of it the different modes proposed were   by the house of representatives   by the executive   by electors chosen by the people for the purpose   by the state legislatures—on the point of duration the propositions descended from good behavior to four years through the intermediate terms of nine seven six  five years the election of the other branch was first determined to be triennial and afterwards reduced to biennial the second object the due partition of power between the general  local governments was perhaps of all the most nice and difficult a few contended for an entire abolition of the states some for indefinite power of legislation in the congress with a    negative on the laws of the states some for such a power without a negative some for a limited power of legislation with such a negative the majority finally for a limited power without the negative the question with regard to the negative underwent repeated discussions and was finally rejected by a bare majority as i formerly intimated to you my opinion in favor of this ingredient i will take this occasion of explaining myself on the subject such a check on the states appears to me necessary   to prevent encroachments on the general authority   to prevent instability and injustice in the legislation of the states   without such a check in the whole over the parts our system involves the evil of imperia in imperio if a compleat supremacy somewhere is not necessary in every society a controuling power at least is so by which the general authority may be defended against encroachments of the subordinate authorities and by which the latter may be restrained from encroachments on each other if the supremacy of the british parliament is not necessary as has been contended for the harmony of that empire it is evident i think that without the royal negative or some equivalent controul the unity of the system would be destroyed the want of some such provision seems to have been mortal to the antient confederacies and to be the disease of the modern of the lycian confederacy little is known that of the amphyctions is well known to have been rendered of little use whilst it lasted and in the end to have    been destroyed by the predominance of the local over the federal authority the same observation may be made on the authority of polybius with regard to the achæan league the helvetic system scarcely amounts to a confederacy and is disguished by too many peculiarities to be a ground of comparison the case of the united netherlands is in point the authority of a stadtholder the influence of a standing army the common interest in the conquered possessions the pressure of surrounding danger the guarantee of foreign powers are not sufficient to secure the authority and interest of the generality agst the antifederal tendency of the provincial sovereignties the german empire is another example a hereditary chief with vast independent resources of wealth and power a federal diet with ample parchment authority a regular judiciary establishment the influence of the neighbourhood of great  formidable nations have been found unable either to maintain the subordination of the members or to prevent their mutual contests  encroachments still more to the purpose is our own experience both during the war and since the peace encroachments of the states on the general authority sacrifices of national to local interests interferences of the measures of different states form a great part of the history of our political system it may be said that the new constitution is founded on different principles and will have a different operation i admit the difference to be material it presents the aspect rather of a feudal system of    republics if such a phrase may be used than of a confederacy of independent states and what has been the progress and event of the feudal constitutions in all of them a continual struggle between the head and the inferior members until a final victory has been gained in some instances by one in others by the other of them in one respect indeed there is a remarkable variance between the two cases in the feudal system the sovereign though limited was independent and having no particular sympathy of interests with the great barons his ambition had as full play as theirs in the mutual projects of usurpation in the american constitution the general authority will be derived entirely from the subordinate authorities the senate will represent the states in their political capacity the other house will represent the people of the states in their individual capactildey the former will be accountable to their constituents at moderate the latter at short periods the president also derives his appointment from the states and is periodically accountable to them this dependence of the general on the local authorities seems effectually to guard the latter against any dangerous encroachments of the former whilst the latter within their respective limits will be continually sensible of the abridgement of their power and be stimulated by ambition to resume the surrendered portion of it we find the representatives of counties and corporations in the legislatures of the states much more disposed to sacrifice the aggregate interest and even    authority to the local views of their constituents than the latter to the former i mean not by these remarks to insinuate that an esprit de corps will not exist in the national government or that opportunities may not occur of extending its jurisdiction in some points i mean only that the danger of encroachments is much greater from the other side and that the impossibility of dividing powers of legislation in such a manner as to be free from different constructions by different interests or even from ambiguity in the judgment of the impartial requires some such expedient as i contend for many illustrations might be given of this impossibility how long has it taken to fix and how imperfectly is yet fixed the legislative power of corporations though that power is subordinate in the most compleat manner the line of distinction between the power of regulating trade and that of drawing revenue from it which was once considered the barrier of our liberties was found on fair discussion to be absolutely undefinable no distinction seems to be more obvious than that between spiritual and temporal matters yet wherever they have been made objects of legislation they have clashed and contended with each other till one or the other has gained the supremacy even the boundaries between the executive legislative  judiciary powers though in general so strongly marked in themselves consist in many instances of mere shades of difference it may be said that the judicial authority under our new system will keep the states within their proper limits and supply the    place of a negative on their laws the answer is that it is more convenient to prevent the passage of a law than to declare it void after it is passed that this will be particularly the case where the law aggrieves individuals who may be unable to support an appeal agst a state to the supreme judiciary that a state which would violate the legislative rights of the union would not be very ready to obey a judicial decree in support of them and that a recurrence to force which in the event of disobedience would be necessary is an evil which the new constitution meant to exclude as far as possible   a constitutional negative on the laws of the states seems equally necessary to secure individuals agst encroachments on their rights the mutability of the laws of the states is found to be a serious evil the injustice of them has been so frequent and so flagrant as to alarm the most stedfast friends of republicanism i am persuaded i do not err in saying that the evils issuing from these sources contributed more to that uneasiness which produced the convention and prepared the public mind for a general reform than those which accrued to our national character and interest from the inadequacy of the confederation to its immediate objects a reform therefore which does not make provision for private rights must be materially defective the restraints agst paper emissions and violations of contracts are not sufficient supposing them to be effectual as far as they go they are short of the mark injustice may be effected by such an infinitude of legislative    expedients that where the disposition exists it can only be controuled by some provision which reaches all cases whatsoever the partial provision made supposes the disposition which will evade it it may be asked how private rights will be more secure under the guardianship of the general government than under the state governments since they are both founded on the republican principle which refers the ultimate decision to the will of the majority and are distinguished rather by the extent within which they will operate than by any material difference in their structure a full discussion of this question would if i mistake not unfold the true principles of republican government and prove in contradiction to the concurrent opinions of the theoretical writers that this form of government in order to effect its purposes must operate not within a small but an extensive sphere i will state some of the ideas which have occurred to me on the subject those who contend for a simple democracy or a pure republic actuated by the sense of the majority and operating within narrow limits assume or suppose a case which is altogether fictitious they found their reasoning on the idea that the people composing the society enjoy not only an equality of political rights but that they have all precisely the same interests and the same feelings in every respect were this in reality the case their reasoning would be conclusive the interest of the majority would be that of the minority also the decisions could only turn on mere opinion concerning the good of the whole of which    the major voice would be the safest criterion and within a small sphere this voice could be most easily collected and the public affairs most accurately managed we know however that no society ever did or can consist of so homogeneous a mass of citizens in the savage state indeed an approach is made towards it but in that state little or no government is necessary in all civilized societies distinctions are various and unavoidable a distinction of property results from that very protection which a free government gives to unequal faculties of acquiring it there will be rich and poor creditors and debtors a landed interest a monied interest a mercantile interest a manufacturing interest these classes may again be subdivided according to the different productions of different situations  soils  according to different branches of commerce and of manufactures in addition to these natural distinctions artificial ones will be founded on accidental differences in political religious or other opinions or an attachment to the persons of leading individuals however erroneous or ridiculous these grounds of dissention and faction may appear to the enlightened statesman or the benevolent philosopher the bulk of mankind who are neither statesmen nor philosophers will continue to view them in a different light it remains then to be enquired whether a majority having any common interest or feeling any common passion will find sufficient motives to restrain them from oppressing the minority an individual is never allowed to be a judge or even a witness  0 in his own cause if two individuals are under the bias of interest or enmity agst a third the rights of the latter could never be safely referred to the majority of the three will two thousand individuals be less apt to oppress one thousand or two hundred thousand one hundred thousand three motives only can restrain in such cases   a prudent regard to private or partial good as essentially involved in the general and permanent good of the whole this ought no doubt to be sufficient of itself experience however shews that it has little effect on individuals and perhaps still less on a collection of individuals and least of all on a majority with the public authority in their hands if the former are ready to forget that honesty is the best policy the last do more they often proceed on the converse of the maxim that whatever is politic is honest   respect for character this motive is not found sufficient to restrain individuals from injustice and loses its efficacy in proportion to the number which is to divide the pain or the blame besides as it has reference to public opinion which is that of the majority the standard is fixed by those whose conduct is to be measured by it   religion the inefficacy of this restraint on individuals is well known the conduct of every popular assembly acting on oath the strongest of religious ties shews that individuals join without remorse in acts agst which their consciences would revolt if proposed to them separately in their closets when indeed religion is kindled into enthusiasm its force like that of other passions is    increased by the sympathy of a multitude but enthusiasm is only a temporary state of religion and whilst it lasts will hardly be seen with pleasure at the helm even in its coolest state it has been much oftener a motive to oppression than a restraint from it if then there must be different interests and parties in society and a majority when united by a common interest or passion cannot be restrained from oppressing the minority what remedy can be found in a republican government where the majority must ultimately decide but that of giving such an extent to its sphere that no common interest or passion will be likely to unite a majority of the whole number in an unjust pursuit in a large society the people are broken into so many interests and parties that a common sentiment is less likely to be felt and the requisite concert less likely to be formed by a majority of the whole the same security seems requisite for the civil as for the religious rights of individuals if the same sect form a majority and have the power other sects will be sure to be depressed divide et impera the reprobated axiom of tyranny is under certain qualifications the only policy by which a republic can be administered on just principles it must be observed however that this doctrine can only hold within a sphere of a mean extent as in too small a sphere oppressive combinations may be too easily formed agst the weaker party so in too extensive a one a defensive concert may be rendered too difficult against the oppression of those entrusted with the administration the    great desideratum in government is so to modify the sovereignty as that it may be sufficiently neutral between different parts of the society to controul one part from invading the rights of another and at the same time sufficiently controuled itself from setting up an interest adverse to that of the entire society in absolute monarchies the prince may be tolerably neutral towards different classes of his subjects but may sacrifice the happiness of all to his personal ambition or avarice in small republics the sovereign will is controuled from such a sacrifice of the entire society but is not sufficiently neutral towards the parts composing it in the extended republic of the united states the general government would hold a pretty even balance between the parties of particular states and be at the same time sufficiently restrained by its dependence on the community from betraying its general interests begging pardon for this immoderate digression i return to the third object above mentioned the adjustments of the different interests of different parts of the continent some contended for an unlimited power over trade including exports as well as imports and over slaves as well as other imports some for such a power provided the concurrence of two thirds of both houses were required some for such a qualification of the power with an exemption of exports and slaves others for an exemption of exports only the result is seen in the constitution s carolina  georgia were inflexible on the point of the slaves    the remaining object created more embarrassment and a greater alarm for the issue of the convention than all the rest put together the little states insisted on retaining their equality in both branches unless a compleat abolition of the state governments should take place and made an equality in the senate a sine qua non the large states on the other hand urged that as the new government was to be drawn principally from the people immediately and was to operate directly on them not on the states and consequently as the states wd lose that importance which is now proportioned to the importance of their voluntary compliances with the requisitions of congress it was necessary that the representation in both houses should be in proportion to their size it ended in the compromise which you will see but very much to the dissatisfaction of several members from the large states it will not escape you that three names only from virginia are subscribed to the act mr wythe did not return after the death of his lady docr mclurg left the convention some time before the adjournment the governour and col mason refused to be parties to it mr gerry was the only other member who refused the objections of the govr turn principally on the latitude of the general powers and on the connection established between the president and the senate he wished that the plan should be proposed to the states with liberty to them to suggest alterations which should all be referred to another general convention to be incorporated into the plan    as far as might be judged expedient he was not inveterate in his opposition and grounded his refusal to subscribe pretty much on his unwillingness to commit himself so as not to be at liberty to be governed by further lights on the subject col mason left philada in an exceeding ill humour indeed a number of little circumstances arising in part from the impatience which prevailed towards the close of the business conspired to whet his acrimony he returned to virginia with a fixed disposition to prevent the adoption of the plan if possible he considers the want of a bill of rights as a fatal objection his other objections are to the substitution of the senate in place of an executive council  to the powers vested in that body—to the powers of the judiciary—to the vice president being made president of the senate—to the smallness of the number of representatives—to the restriction on the states with regard to ex post facto laws—and most of all probably to the power of regulating trade by a majority only of each house he has some other lesser objections being now under the necessity of justifying his refusal to sign he will of course muster every possible one his conduct has given great umbrage to the county of fairfax and particularly to the town of alexandria he is already instructed to promote in the assembly the calling of a convention and will probably be either not deputed to the convention or be tied up by express instructions he did not object in general to the powers vested in the national government so much as to the modification in some respects he    admitted that some further powers would have improved the system he acknowledged in particular that a negative on the state laws and the appointment of the state executive ought to be ingredients but supposed that the public mind would not now bear them and that experience would hereafter produce these amendments the final reception which will be given by the people at large to the proposed system cannot yet be decided the legislature of n hampshire was sitting when it reached that state and was well pleased with it as far as the sense of the people there has been expressed it is generally favorable boston is warm and almost unanimous in embracing it the impression on the country is not yet known no symptoms of disapprobation have appeared the legislature of that state is now sitting through which the sense of the people at large will soon be promulged with tolerable certainty the paper money faction in r island is hostile the other party zealously attached to it its passage through connecticut is likely to be very smooth and easy there seems to be less agitation in this state n york than anywhere the discussion of the subject seems confined to the newspapers the principal characters are known to be friendly the governours party which has hitherto been the popular  most numerous one is supposed to be on the opposite side but considerable reserve is practiced of which he sets the example n jersey takes the affirmative side of course meetings of the people are declaring their approbation and    instructing their representatives penna will be divided the city of philada the republican party the quakers and most of the germans espouse the constitution some of the constitutional leaders backed by the western country will oppose an unlucky ferment on the subject in their assembly just before its late adjournment has irritated both sides particularly the opposition and by redoubling the exertions of that party may render the event doubtful the voice of maryland i understand from pretty good authority is as far as it has been declared strongly in favor of the constitution mr chase is an enemy but the town of baltimore which he now represents is warmly attached to it and will shackle him as far as it can mr paca will probably be as usual in the politics of chase my information from virginia is as yet extremely imperfect i have a letter from genl washington which speaks favorably of the impression within a circle of some extent and another from chancellor pendleton which expresses his full acceptance of the plan and the popularity of it in his district i am told also that innes and marshall are patrons of it in the opposite scale are mr james mercer mr r h lee docr lee and their connections of course mr m page according to report and most of the judges  bar of the general court the part which mr henry will take is unknown here much will depend on it i had taken it for granted from a variety of circumstances that he wd be in the opposition and still think that will be the case there are reports however which favor a    contrary supposition from the states south of virginia nothing has been heard as the deputation from s carolina consisted of some of its weightiest characters who have returned unanimously zealous in favor of the constitution it is probable that state will readily embrace it it is not less probable that n carolina will follow the example unless that of virginia should counterbalance it upon the whole although the public mind will not be fully known nor finally settled for a considerable time appearances at present augur a more prompt and general adoption of the plan than could have been well expected when the plan came before congress for their sanction a very serious effort was made by r h lee  mr dane from massts to embarrass it it was first contended that congress could not properly give any positive countenance to a measure which had for its object the subversion of the constitution under which they acted this ground of attack failing the former gentleman urged the expediency of sending out the plan with amendments  proposed a number of them corresponding with the objections of col mason this experiment had still less effect in order however to obtain unanimity it was necessary to couch the resolution in very moderate terms mr adams has recd permission to return with thanks for his services no provision is made for supplying his place or keeping up any representation there your reappointment for three years will be notified from the office of f affrs it was made     without a negative eight states being present connecticut notwithstanding put in a blank ticket the sense of that state having been declared against embassies massachusts betrayed some scruple on like ground every personal consideration was avowed  i believe with sincerity to have militated against these scruples it seems to be understood that letters to  from the foreign ministers of the u s are not free of postage but that the charge is to be allowed in their accounts the exchange of our french for dutch creditors has not been countenanced either by congress or the treasury board the paragraph in your last letter to mr jay on the subject of applying a loan in holland to the discharge of the pay due to the foreign officers has been referred to the board since my arrival here no report has yet been made but i have little idea that the proposition will be adopted such is the state  prospect of our fiscal department that any new loan however small that should now be made would probably subject us to the reproach of premeditated deception the balance of mr adamss last loan will be wanted for the interest due in holland and with all the income here will it is feared not save our credit in europe from farther wounds it may well be doubted whether the present government can be kept alive during the ensuing year or until the new one may take its place upwards of  00000 acres of the lands of the u s have been disposed of in open market five millions of unsurveyed have been sold by private contract to    a n england company at ⅔ of a dollar per acre payment to be made in the principal of the public securities a negotiation is nearly closed with a n jersey company for two millions more on like terms and another commenced with a company of this city for four millions col carrington writes more fully on this subject you will receive herewith the desired information from alderman broome in the case of mr burke also the virga bill on crimes  punishments sundry alterations having been made in conformity to the sense of the house in its latter stages it is less accurate  methodical than it ought to have been to these papers i add a speech of mr c p on the missiptildepi business it is printed under precautions of secrecy but surely could not have been properly exposed to so much risk of publication  you will find also among the pamphlets  papers i send by com̃odore jones another printed speech of the same gentleman the museum  magazine  philada gazettes will give you a tolerable idea of the objects of present attention the summer crops in the eastern  middle states have been extremely plentiful southward of virga—they differ in different places on the whole i do not know that they are bad in that region in virginia the drought has been unprecedented particularly between the falls of the rivers  the mountains the crops of corn are in general alarmingly short in orange i find there will be scarcely subsistence  0 for the inhabitants i have not heard from albemarle the crops of tobo are every where said to be pretty good in point of quantity  the quality unusually fine the crops of wheat were also in general excellent in quality  tolerable in quantity novr   commodore paul jones having preferred another vessel to the packet has remained here till this time the interval has produced little necessary to be added to the above the legislature of massts has it seems taken up the act of the convention and has appointed or probably will appoint an early day for its state convention there are letters also from georgia which denote a favorable disposition i am informed from richmond that the new electionlaw from the revised code produced a pretty full house of delegates as well as a senate on the first day it had previously had equal effect in producing full meetings of the freeholders for the county elections a very decided majority of the assembly is said to be zealous in favor of the new constitution the same is said of the country at large it appears however that individuals of great weight both within  without the legislature are opposed to it a letter i just have from mr a stuart  names mr henry    genl nelson w nelson the family of cabels st george tucker john taylor and the judges of the genl court except p carrington the other opponents he describes as of too little note to be mentioned which gives a negative information of the characters on the other side all are agreed that the plan must be submitted to a convention we hear from georgia that that state is threatened with a dangerous war with the creek indians the alarm is of so serious a nature that lawmartial has been proclaimed and they are proceeding to fortify even the town of savannah the idea there is that the indians derive their motives as well as their means from their spanish neighbours individuals complain also that their fugitive slaves are encouraged by east florida the policy of this is explained by supposing that it is considered as a discouragement to the georgians to form settlements near the spanish boundaries there are but few states on the spot here which will survive the expiration of the federal year and it is extremely uncertain when a congress will again be formed we have not yet heard who are to be in the appointment of virginia for the next year with the most affectionate attachment i remain dear sir    james madison octr         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york octr         dear sir— the mail of yesterday brought me your favor of the   d instant the communications from richmond give me as much pleasure as they exceed my expectations  as i find by a letter from a member of the assembly however that col mason has not got down and it appears that mr henry is not at bottom a friend i am not without fears that the combined influence and management may yet create difficulties there is one consideration which i think ought to have some weight in the case over and above the intrinsic inducements to embrace the constitution and which i have suggested to some of my correspondents there is at present a very strong probability that nine states at least will pretty speedily concur in establishing it what will become of the tardy remainder they must be either left as outcasts from the society to shift for themselves or be compelled to come in or must come in of themselves when they will be allowed no credit for it can either of these situations be as eligible as a prompt and manly determination to support the union and share its common fortunes my last stated pretty fully the information which    had arrived here from different quarters concerning the proposed constitution i recollect nothing that is now to be added farther than that the assembly of massachusetts now sitting certainly gives it a friendly reception i inclose a boston paper by which it appears that governour hancock has ushered it to them in as propitious a manner as could have been required mr c ps  character is as you observe well marked by the publications which i inclosed his printing the secret paper at this time could have no motive but the appetite for expected praise for the subject to which it relates has been dormant a considerable time and seems likely to remain so a foreign gentleman of merit and who besides this general title brings me a letter which gives him a particular claim to my civilities is very anxious to obtain a sketch of the potomac and the route from the highest navigable part of it to the western waters which are to be connected with the potomac by the portage together with a sketch of the works which are going on and a memorandum of the progress made in them knowing of no other channel through which i could enable myself to gratify this gentleman i am seduced into the liberty of resorting to your kindness and of requesting that if you have such a draught by you your amanuensis may be permitted to take a very rough copy of it for me in making this request i beseech you sir to understand that i do it with not more confidence in your goodness than with    the sincerest desire that it may be disregarded if it cannot be fulfilled with the most perfect convenience with sentiments of the most perfect esteem  the most affecte regard i remain dear sir your obedt friend  hble servt the british packet has arrived but i do not learn that any news comes by her her passage has been a tedious one james madison octr         new york edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  new york octr         dear sir— i have recd and acknowledge with great pleasure your favor of the  th inst the remarks which you make on the act of the convention appear to me to be in general extremely well founded your criticism on the clause exempting vessels bound to or from a state from being obliged to enter c in another is particularly so this provision was dictated by the jealousy of some particular states and was inserted pretty late in the session the object of it was what you conjectured the expression is certainly not accurate is not a religious test as far as it is necessary or would operate involved in the oath itself if the person swearing believes in the supreme being who is invoked and in the penal consequences of offending him either in this or a future world or both he will be under the same restraint from perjury as if he had previously subscribed a test requiring this belief if the person in question be an unbeliever in these points and would notwithstanding take the oath a previous test could    have no effect he would subscribe it as he would take the oath without any principle that could be affected by either i find by a letter from mr dawson  that the proposed constitution is received by the assembly with a more prompt  general approbation than could well have been expected the example of virginia will have great weight and the more so as the disagreement of the deputation will give it more the appearance of being the unbiassed expression of the public mind it would be truly mortifying if anything should occur to prevent or retard the concurrence of a state which has generally taken the lead on great occasions and it would be the more so in this case as it is generally believed that nine of the states at least will embrace the plan and consequently that the tardy remainder must be reduced to the dilemma of either shifting for themselves or coming in without any credit for it there is reason to believe that the eastern states r island excepted will be among the foremost in adopting the system no particular information is yet received from n hampshire the presumptive evidence of its good disposition however is satisfactory the legislature of massts is now sitting and letters from good authority say that everything goes well connecticut has unanimously called a convention and left no room to doubt her favorable disposition this state has long had the character of being antifederal whether she will    purge herself of it on this occasion or not is yet to be ascertained most of the respectable characters are zealous on the right side the party in power is suspected on good grounds to be on the wrong one n jersey adopts eagerly the constitution penna is considerably divided  but the majority are as yet clearly with the convention i have no very late information from maryland the reports are that the opposition will make no great figure  not a word has been heard from the states south of virginia except from the lower parts of n carola where the constitution was well received there can be little doubt i think that the three southern states will go right unless the conduct of virginia were to mislead them    i enclose two of the last newspapers of this place to which i add one of philadelphia containing a report of a late important decision of the supreme court there if the report be faithful i suspect it will not give you a high idea of the chancery knowledge of the chief justice i am dear sir with sincere affection your obedt friend  servt james madison oct  0      new york archibald stuart to archibald stuart va hist soc mss  n y oct  0      dear sir— i have been this day favored with yours of the   st instant  beg you to accept my acknowledgements for it i am truly sorry to find so many respectable names on your list of adversaries to the federal constitution  the diversity of opinion on so interesting a subject among men of equal integrity  discernment is at once a melancholy proof of the fallibility of the human judgement and of the imperfect progress yet made in the science of government     nothing is more common here and i presume the case must be the same with you than to see companies of intelligent people equally divided and equally earnest in maintaining on one side that the general government will overwhelm the state governments    and on the other hand that it will be a prey to their encroachments on one side that the structure of the government is too firm  too strong and on the other that it partakes too much of the weakness  instability of the governments of the particular states what is the proper conclusion from all this that unanimity is not to be expected in any great political question that the danger is probably exaggerated on each side when an opposite danger is concerned on the opposite side that if any constitution is to be established by deliberation  choice it must be examined with many allowances and must be compared not with the theory which each individual may frame in his own mind but with the system which it is meant to take the place of and with any other which there might be a possibility of obtaining i cannot judge so well as yourself of the propriety of mixing with an adoption of the federal constitution a revision of that of the state if the latter could be effected without risks or inconveniency of the former it is no doubt desirable  the practicability of this will depend upon the unanimity with which it could be undertaken i should doubt extremely whether the experiment could safely be made might not the blending of those two things together unite those who are unfriendly to either and thus strengthen the opposition you have to contend with in case the general government should be established  0 it will perhaps be easy to follow it with an amendment of our own constitution the example will have some influence by proving the practicability  safety of such experiments and if the convention think fit they may lay a proper train of themselves for bringing the matter about the public mind in this quarter seems not finally settled as yet with regard to the proposed constitution the first impression has been every where favorable except in rd island nor is there any reason to suspect that the generality of states will not embrace the measure the character of this state has long been antifederal  it is known that a very powerful party continue so penna is also divided into parties but it is supposed that a majority will pretty certainly be on the right side with great respect  regard i am dr sir yr obt servt james madison novr  th      new york ambrose madison to ambrose madison  n y pub lib mss  new york novr  th      dear brother— having mislaid your last favor i cannot acknowledge it by reference to its date it contained two requests the one relating to mr houses rule of calculating the weight of tobacco the other to my being a candidate in orange for the convention  in answer to the first point i inclose the rule    exemplified if this should not suffice i will send you a calculation in detail for the whole account in answer to the second point i am to observe that it was not my wish to have followed the act of the general convention into the convention of the state supposing that it would be as well that the final decision thereon should proceed from men who had no hand in preparing and proposing it as i find however that in all the states the members of the genl convention are becoming members of the state conventions as i have been applied to on the subject by sundry very respectable friends as i have reason to believe that many objections in virginia proceed    from a misconception of the plan or of the causes which produced the objectionable parts of it and as my attendance at philadelphia may enable me to contribute some explanations and informations which may be of use i shall not decline the representation of the county if i should be honored with the appointment you may let this be known in such way as my father or yourself may judge best i shall be glad to hear from you on the subject and to know what competition there will probably be and by whom as far as present appearances denote the n england states r island excepted will all adopt the new constitution n jersey certainly will so will    penna according to the best opinions by a very decided majority i have favorable information also from maryland though it is not improbable that the opposition likely to be made in virginia will have some effect on that side as well as on the side of n carolina which in general has been said to be well disposed like information has been recd from the two more southern states but it is too early to pronounce on their disposition this state n york is much divided the party in power are willing to surrender any portion of it the other party is composed of the more respectable citizens and is warmly attached to the proposed constitution whatever may be the sense of the majority the state will scarcely have a will of its own if new england on one side and n jersey  pena on the other come heartily into the measure     james madison novr         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york novr         dear sir— your favor of the  th instant found me in philada whither i had proceeded under arrangements for proceeding to virginia or returning to this place as i might there decide i did not acknowledge it in philada because i had nothing to communicate which you would not receive more fully and correctly from the mr morrisis who were setting out for virginia all my informations from richmond concur in    representing the enthusiasm in favor of the new constitution as subsiding and giving place to a spirit of criticism i was fearful of such an event from the influence and cooperation of some of the adversaries i do not learn however that the cause has lost its majority in the legislature and still less among the people at large i have nothing to add to the information heretofore given concerning the progress of the constitution in other states mr gerry has presented his objections to the legislature in a letter addressed to them  and signified his readiness if desired to give the particular reasons on which they were founded the legislature it seems decline the explanation either from a supposition that they have nothing further to do in the business having handed it over to the convention or from an unwillingness to countenance mr gerrys conduct or from both of these considerations it is supposed that the promulgation of this letter will shake the confidence of some and embolden the opposition of others in that state but i cannot discover any ground for distrusting the prompt  decided concurrence of a large majority i inclose herewith the   first numbers of the federalist  a paper addressed to the people of this state    they relate entirely to the importance of the union if the whole plan should be executed it will present to the public a full discussion of the merits of the proposed constitution in all its relations from the opinion i have formed of the views of a party in virginia i am inclined to think that the observations on the first branch of the subject may not be superfluous antidotes in that state any more than in this if you concur with me perhaps the papers may be put into the hands of some of your confidential correspondents at richmond who would have them reprinted there i will not conceal from you that i am likely to have such a degree of connection with the publication here as to afford a restraint of delicacy from interesting myself directly in the republication elsewhere you will recognize one of the pens concerned in the task there are three in the whole a fourth may possibly bear a part    the intelligence by the packet as far as i have collected it is contained in the gazette of yesterday virginia is the only state represented as yet when a congress will be formed is altogether uncertain it is not very improbable i think that the interregnum may continue throughout the winter with every sentiment of respect  attachment i remain dear sir ye affecte  hble servant james madison november         new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york november         my dear friend   i returned hither from philadelphia to which place i had proceeded under arrangements for either going on to virginia or coming back as i might there decide your very affectionate favor of the twentythird ultimo found me in philadelphia after traveling to new york and i should have answered before my return had any matters for communication occurred worth the expense of postage i did not make any observations on the scheme mentioned in your letter from the bolling green  because it had an object which i thought it unadvisable to pursue because i conceived that my opinion had been fully made known on the subject and i wished not unnecessarily to repeat or dwell on points on which    our ideas do not accord and because i considered part of your letter merely as a friendly communication and a pleasing pledge of your confidence and not as subject on which my ideas were wished so much indeed was this the case that at the time of answering that letter i had not considered the expedient with sufficient accuracy as a means of attaining the end proposed to justify any opinion or remarks touching its fitness the difficulty which struck me on a subsequent attention to it and which seem insuperable was that several legislatures would necessarily have provided for a convention and even adjourned before amendatory propositions from virginia could be transmitted i have not since my arrival collected any additional information concerning the progress of the federal constitution i discovered no evidence on my journey through new jersey that any opposition whatever would be made in that state the convention of pennsylvania is to meet on tuesday next the members returned i was told by several persons reduced the adoption of the plan in that state to absolute certainty and by a greater majority than the most sanguine advocates had calculated one of the counties which had been set down by all on the list of opposition had elected deputies of known attachment to the constitution i enclose herewith sundry letters which came by the french packet just arrived the letter from col h lewis mr jefferson tells me is of great consequence you will have frequent opportunities during the assembly    of giving it a safe conveyance i have myself no public information by the packet and have not yet learnt that any of moment has been received at the office of foreign affairs the intelligence passing in conversation is that the porte has declared war against russia that notwithstanding the advance of the prussian troops into holland it is not certain that an accommodation may not prevent actual hostilities and that in general it remains doubtful whether war or peace in the western parts of europe is to result from the present crisis of affairs a great change has taken place again in the french ministry the count de la luzerne brother of the chavelier succeeds the marshall de castries in the department of marine the provincial assemblies are established and some of them have already met the marquis de la fayette is a leading member in that of auvergne the parlemont has returned to paris and it is supposed that the court will not enforce either the stamp duty or the territorial impost the count de moustier is appointed to the u states and may shortly be expected i do not find that a single state is represented except virginia and it seems very uncertain when a congress will be made there are individual members present from several states and the attendance of this and the neighbouring states may i suppose be obtained when it will produce a quorum with the most sincere and invariable affection i remain my dear friend yours    james madison novr  0      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york novr  0      dear sir— my last inclosed the seven first numbers of the paper of which i gave you some account i now add the seven following numbers which close the first branch of the subject the importance of the union the succeeding papers shall be forwarded from time to time as they come out the latest authentic information from europe places the dutch in a wretched situation the patriots will probably depend in the event on external politics for the degree of security and power that may be left them the turks  russians have begun a war in that quarter and a general one is not improbable i have heard nothing of consequence lately concerning the progress of the new constitution  the pennsylvania convention has probably by this time come to a decision but it is not known here not more than two or three states are yet convened the prospect of a quorum during the winter continues precarious with every sentiment of respect  attachment i remain dear sir yr affecte humble servt  0 james madison december        new york edmund

quorum will be made up no recent indications of the views of the states as to the constitution have come to my knowledge the elections in connecticut are over and as far as the returns are known a large majority are friendly to it doctr johnson says it will be pretty certainly adopted but there will be opposition the power of taxing anything but imports appears to be the most popular topic among the adversaries the convention of pennsylvania is sitting the result there will not reach you first through my hands the divisions on preparatory questions as they are published in the newspapers show that the party in favor of the constitution have    or    vs    or    or thereabouts the enclosed paper contains two numbers of the federalist this paper was begun about three weeks ago and proposes to go through that subject i have not been able to collect all the numbers since my return from philada or i would have sent them to you i have been the less anxious as i understand the printer means to make a pamphlet of them when i can give them to you in a more convenient    form you will probably discover marks of different pens i am not at liberty to give you any other key than that i am in myself for a few numbers  that one besides myself was a member of the convention i wish you all happiness and remain my dear sir yr affect friend james madison decemr        new york

adopted in connecticut the returns of the deputies being now known and a very great majority found to be its declared and firm friends there will be more opposition in massachusetts but its friends there continue to be very sanguine of victory new hampshire as far as i can learn may be set down on the right list i remain dear sir with the highest respect and the most unfeigned attachment your

twenty of the sugar maple they were obtained from a mr prince in the neighborhood of this city who deals largely in this way and is considered as a man of worth i learn from him that he has executed various commissions for europe  the west indies as well as places less distant and that he has been generally very successful in preserving the trees from perishing by such distant transplantations he does not use moss as you prescribe but encloses the roots in a bag of earth as moss is not to be got as he says it is uncertain whether necessity or choice gives the preference to    the latter i

forwarding both along with the box of trees i send by the packet to the care of mr limosin   barrels of newtown pippins and   of cranberries in one of the latter the cranberries are put up dry in the other in water the opinions and accounts differing as to the best mode you will note the event of the experiment the constitution proposed by the late convention engrosses almost the whole political attention of america all the legislatures except that of r island which has assembled have agreed in submitting it to state conventions virginia has set the example of opening a door for amendments if the convention there should chuse to propose them maryland has copied it the states which preceded referred the constitution as recommended by the genl convention to be ratified or rejected as it stands the convention of pennsylvania is now sitting there are about    or    on the affirmative and about half that number on the opposite side a considerable number of the constitutional party as it was called having joined the other party in espousing the federal constitution the returns of deputies    for the convention of connecticut are known and prove as is said by those who know the men that a very great majority will adopt it in that state the event in massachusetts lies in greater uncertainty the friends of the new govt continue to eb sanguine n hampshire from every account as well as from some general inducements felt there will pretty certainly be on the affirmative side so will new jersey and delaware n york is much divided she will hardly dissent from n england particularly if the conduct of the latter should coincide with that of n jersey and pennsylva a more formidable opposition is likely to be made in maryland than was at first conjectured mr mercer it seems who was a member of the convention though his attendance was but for a short time is become an auxiliary to chase johnson the carrolls govr lee and most of the other characters of weight are on the other side mr t stone died a little before the government was promulged the body of the people in virgina particularly in the upper and lower country and in the northern neck are as far as i can gather much disposed to adopt the new constitution the middle country and the south side of james river are principally in the opposition to it as yet a large majority of the people are under the first description as yet also are a majority of the assembly what change may be produced by the united influence and exertions of mr henry mr mason  the governor  with some pretty able auxiliaries    is uncertain my information leads me to suppose there must be three parties in virginia the first for adopting without attempting amendments this includes genl w and ye other deputies who signed the constitution mr pendleton mr marshall i believe mr nicholas mr corbin mr zachy johnson col innes mr b randolph as i understand mr harvey mr gabriel jones docr jones c c at the head of the  d party which urges amendments are the govr  mr mason these do not object to the substance of the governt but contend for a few additional guards in favor of the rights of the states and of the people i am not able to enumerate the characters which fall in with their ideas as distinguished from those of a third class at the head of which is mr henry this class concurs at present with the patrons of amendments but will probably contend for such as strike at the essence of the system and must lead to an adherence to the principle of the existing confederation which most thinking men are convinced is a visionary one or to a partition of the union into several confederacies mr harrison the late govr is with mr henry so are a number of others the general and admiralty courts with most of the bar oppose the constitution but on what particular grounds i am unable to say genl nelson mr jno page col bland c are also opponents but on what principle and to what extent i am equally at a loss to say in general i must note that i speak with respect to many of these names from information that may not    be accurate and merely as i should do in a free and confidential conversation with you i have not yet heard mr wythes sentiments on the subject docr mcclurg the other absent deputy is a very strenuous defender of the new government mr henry is the great adversary who will render the event precarious he is i find with his usual address working up every possible interest into a spirit of opposition it is worthy of remark that whilst in virga and some of the other states in the middle  southern districts of the union the men of intelligence patriotism property and independent circumstances are thus divided all of this description with a few exceptions in the eastern states  most of the middle states are zealously attached to the proposed constitution in n england the men of letters the principal officers of govt the judges  lawyers the clergy and men of property furnish only here and there an adversary it is not less worthy of remark that in virginia where the mass of the people have been so much accustomed to be guided by their rulers on all new and intricate questions they should on the present which certainly surpasses the judgment of the greater part of them not only go before but contrary to their most popular leaders and the phenomenon is the more wonderful as a popular ground is taken by all the adversaries to the new constitution perhaps the solution in both these cases would not be very difficult but it would lead to observations too diffusive and to you unnecessary i will barely observe that the case in    virga seems to prove that the body of sober  steady people even of the lower order are tired of the vicissitudes injustice and follies which have so much characterized public measures and are impatient for some change which promises stability and repose the proceedings of the present assembly are more likely to cherish than remove this disposition i find mr henry has carried a resolution for prohibiting the importation of rum brandy and other ardent spirits and if i am not misinformed all manufactured leather hats and sundry other articles are included in the prohibition enormous duties at least are likely to take place on the last  many other articles a project of this sort without the concurrence of the other states is little short of madness with such concurrence it is not practicable without resorting to expedients equally noxious to liberty and economy the consequences of the experiment in a single state as unprepared for manufactures as virginia may easily be preconceived the revised code will not be resumed mr henry is an inveterate adversary to it col mason made a regular and powerful attack on the port bill but was left in a very small minority i found at the last session that that regulation was not to be shaken though it certainly owes its success less to its principal merits than to collateral  casual considerations the popular ideas are that by favoring the collection of duties on imports it saves the solid property from direct taxes and that it injures g britain by lessening the advantage she has over other nations in the trade of virginia    we have no certain information from the three southern states concerning the temper relative to the new government it is in general favorable according to the vague accounts we have opposition however will be made in each mr wiley jones and governor caswell have been named as opponents in n carolina so few particulars have come to hand concerning the state of things in georgia  that i have nothing to add on that subject to the contents of my last by commodore jones we have two or three states only yet met for congs as many more can be called in when their attendance will make a quorum it continues to be problematical whether the interregnum will not be spun out through the winter we remain in great uncertainty here with regard to a war in europe reports and suspicions are strongly on the side of one such an event may be considered in various relations to this country it is pretty certain i think that if the present lax state of our general government should continue we shall not only lose certain capital advantages which might be drawn from it but be in danger of being plunged into difficulties which may have a very serious effect on our future fortunes i remain dear sir with the most sincere esteem  affection your obedt servt    p s i have delivered your message to mr thomas  settled the pecuniary matter with him the

this are inclosed a few copies of the latest gazettes containing the additional papers in favor of the federal constitution i find by letters from richmond that the proceedings of the assembly are as usual rapidly  0 degenerating with the progress of the session  and particularly that the force opposed to the act of the convention has gained the ascendance there is still nevertheless a hope left that different characters and a different spirit may prevail in their successors who are to make the final decision in one point of view the present assembly may perhaps be regarded as pleading most powerfully the cause of the new government for it is impossible for stronger proofs to be found than in their conduct of the necessity of some such anchor against the fluctuations which threaten to shipwreck our liberty i am dear sir with the most sincere  perfect esteem your affecte  obedt humble servant    james madison december  0      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york december  0      dear sir— i was favored on saturday with your letter of the  th instant along with which was covered the printed letter of colonel r h lee to the governour  it does not appear to me to be a very formidable attack on the new constitution unless it should derive an influence from the names of the correspondents which its intrinsic merits do not entitle it to he is certainly not perfectly accurate in    the statement of all his facts and i should infer from the tenor of the objections in virginia that his plan of an executive would hardly be viewed as an amendment of that of the convention it is a little singular that three of the most distinguished advocates for amendments and who expect to unite the thirteen states in their project appear to be pointedly at variance with each other on one of the capital articles of the system colonel lee proposes that the president should chuse a council of eleven and with their advice have the appointment of all officers colonel masons proposition is that a council of six should be appointed by the congress what degree of power he would confide to it i do not know the idea of the governour is that there should be a plurality of coequal heads distinguished probably by other peculiarities in the organization it is pretty certain that some others who make a common cause with them in the general attempt to bring about alterations differ still more from them than they do from each other and that they themselves differ as much on some other great points as on the constitution of the executive you did not judge amiss of mr jay the paragraph affirming a change in this opinion of the plan of the convention was an arrant forgery he has contradicted it in a letter to mr j vaughan which has been printed in the philadelphia gazettes tricks of this sort are not uncommon with the enemies of the new constitution col masons objections were as i am told published in boston mutilated    of that which pointed at the regulation of commerce docr franklins concluding speech which you will meet with in one of the papers herewith inclosed is both mutilated  adulterated so as to change both the form  spirit of it i am extremely obliged by the notice you take of my request concerning the potomack i must insist that you will not consider it as an object of any further attention the philada papers will have informed you of the result of the convention of that state n jersey is now in convention  has probably by this time adopted the constitution genl irvine of the pena delegation who is just arrived here and who conversed with some of the members at trenton tells me that great unanimity reigns in the convention connecticut it is pretty certain will decide also in the affirmative by a large majority so it is presumed will n hampshire though her convention will be a little later than could be wished there are not enough of the returns in massts known for a final judgment of the probable event in that state as far as the returns are known they are extremely favorable but as they are chiefly from the maritime parts of the state they are a precarious index of the public sentiment i have good reason to believe that if you are in correspondence with any gentleman in that quarter and a proper occasion should offer for an explicit communication of your good wishes for the plan so as barely to warrant an explicit assertion of the fact that it would be attended with valuable    effects i barely drop the idea the circumstances on which the propriety of it depends are best known to as they will be best judged of by yourself the information from n carolina gave me great pleasure we have nothing from the states south of it james madison december  0      new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson chic hist soc mss  new york december  0      dear sir— the packet has been detained here since the date of the letter which you will receive along with this by some preparations suggested by an apprehension of war the delay is very unfavorable to the trees on board for you mr de la forest  the consul here called on me a few days ago and told me he had information that the farmers general and mr morris having found their contract mutually advantageous are evading the resolution of the committee by tacit arrangements for its continuance he observed that the object of the farmers was singly profit that of the government twofold revenue and commerce it was consequently the wish of the latter to render the monopoly as little hurtful to the trade with america as possible he suggested as an expedient that farmers should be required to divide the contracts among six or seven houses french and american    who should be required to ship annually to america a reasonable proportion of goods this he supposed would produce competition in the purchases here and would introduce a competition also with british goods here the latter condition he said could not be well required of or executed by a single contractor and the government could not abolish the farm these ideas were meant for you since the date of my other letter the convention of delaware have unanimously adopted the new constitution  that of pennsylvania has adopted it by a majority of    against    that of new jersey is sitting and will adopt pretty unanimously these are all the conventions that have met i hear from north carolina that the assembly is well disposed mr henry mr mason r h lee and the governor continue by their influence to strengthen the opposition in virginia the assembly there is engaged in several mad freaks among others a bill has been agreed to in the house of delegates prohibiting the importation of rum brandy and all other spirits not distilled from some american production all brewed liquors under the same description with beef tallowcandles cheese c are included in the prohibition in order to enforce this despotic measure the most despotic means are resorted to if any person be found after the commencement of the act in the use or possession of any of the prohibited    articles tho acquired previous to the law he is to lose them and pay a heavy fine this is the form in which the bill was agreed to by a large majority in the house of delegates it is a child of mr henry and said to be his favorite one they first voted by a majority of  0 that all legal obstruction to the treaty of peace should cease in virginia as soon as laws complying with it should have passed in all the other states this was the result of four days debate with the most violent opposition from mr henry a few days afterward he renewed his efforts and got a vote by a majority of  0 that virginia would not comply until g b shall have complied the states seem to be either wholly omitting to provide for the federal treasury or to be withdrawing the scanty appropriations made to it the latter course has been taken up by massachusetts virginia and delaware the treasury board seems to be in despair of maintaining the shadow of government much longer without money the offices must be shut up and the handful of troops on the frontier disbanded which will probably bring on an indian war and make an impression to our disadvantage on the british garrisons within our limits a letter from mr archd stuart dated richd dec   has the following paragraph yesterday a boat with sixteen men was brought down the canal from westham to its termination which is within one mile and a half of richmond i subjoin an extract from a letter from genl    washington dated dec  th which contains the best information i can give as to the progress of the works on the potomac the survey of the country between the eastern  western waters is not yet reported by the commissioners though promised to be made very shortly the survey being completed—no draught that can convey the adequate idea of the work on this river has been yet taken—much of the labor except at the great falls has been bestowed in the bed of the river in a removal of rocks and deepening the water at the great falls the labour has indeed been great the water there a sufficiency i mean is taken into a canal about two hundred yards above the cateract  conveyed by a level cut through a solid rock in some places and much stone every where more than a mile to the lock seats—five in number by means of which when completed the craft will be let into the river below the falls wch together amount to seventy six feet—at the seneca falls six miles above the great falls a channel which has been formed by the river when inundated is under improvement for navigation—the same in part at shanandoah—at the lower falls where nothing has yet been done a level cut and locks are proposed these constitute the principal difficulties and will be the great expense of this undertaking—the parts of the river between requiring loose stones only to be removed in order to deepen the water where it is too shallow in dry seasons the triennial purge administered to the council in    virga  has removed from their seats samson matthews—and mr selden col wm heth and major jos egglestone supply their places—i remain dr sir yrs affect james madison decr         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york decr         dear sir— i am just informed by a delegate from new hampshire that he has a letter from president sullivan which tells him that the legislature had unanimously agreed to call a convention as recommended to meet in february the second wednesday is the day if i have not mistaken it we have no further information of much importance from massachusetts it appears that cambridge the residence of mr gerry has left him out of the choice for the convention and put in mr dana formerly minister of the u states in europe and another gentleman both of them firmly opposed to mr gerrys politics i observe too in a massts paper that the omission of col masons objection with regard to commerce in the first publication of his objections has been supplied this will more than undo the effect of the mutilated view of them new jersey the newspapers tell us has adopted the constitution unanimously our european intelligence remains perfectly as it stood at the date of my last    with the most affectionate esteem  attachment i am dear sir your obedient  very hble servt james madison january  0      new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york january  0      my dear friend i have put off writing from day to day for some time past in expectation of being able to give you the news from the packets which has been looked for every hour both the french  english have overstayed their usual time ten or    days and are neither of them yet arrived we remain wholly in the dark with regard to the posture of things in europe— i received two days ago your favor of december twenty seventh enclosing a copy of your letter  to the assembly i have read it with attention and i can add with pleasure because the spirit of it does as much honor to your candor as the general reasoning does to your abilities nor can i believe that in this quarter the opponents of the constitution will find encouragement in it you are already aware that your objections are not viewed in the same decisive light by me that they are by you i must own that i differ still more from your opinion that a prosecution of the experiment of a second convention  0 will be favorable even in virginia to the object which i am sure you have at heart it is to me apparent that had your duty led you to throw your influence into the opposite scale it would have given it a decided and unalterable preponderancy and that mr henry would either have suppressed his enmity or been baffled in the policy which it has dictated it appears also that the grounds taken by the opponents in different quarters forbid any hope of concord among them nothing can be further from your views than the principles of different setts of men who have carried on their opposition under the respectability of your name in this state the party adverse to the constitution notoriously meditate either a dissolution of the union or protracting it by patching up the articles of confederation in connecticut and massachusetts the opposition proceeds from that part of the people who have a repugnance in general to good government or to any substantial abridgement of state powers and a part of whom in massachusetts are known to aim at confusion and are suspected of wishing a reversal of the revolution the minority in pennsylvania as far as they are governed by any other views than an habitual opposition to their rivals are manifestly averse to some essential ingredients in a national government you are better acquainted with mr henrys politics than i can be but i have for some time considered him as driving at a southern confederacy and not further concurring in the plan of amendments than as    he hopes to render it subservient to his real designs viewing the matter in this light the inference with me is unavoidable that were a second trial to be made the friends of a good constitution for the union would not only find themselves not a little differing from each other as to the proper amendments but perplexed and frustrated by men who had objects totally different a second convention would of course be formed under the influence and composed in a great measure of the members of the opposition in the several states but were the first difficulties overcome and the constitution reedited with amendments the event would still be infinitely precarious whatever respect may be due to the rights of private judgment and no man feels more of it than i do there can be no doubt that there are subjects to which the capacities of the bulk of mankind are unequal and on which they must and will be governed by those with whom they happen to have acquaintance and confidence the proposed constitution is of this description the great body of those who are both for and against it must follow the judgment of others not their own had the constitution been framed and recommended by an obscure individual instead of a body possessing public respect and confidence there cannot be a doubt that although it would have stood in the identical words it would have commanded little attention from most of those who now admire its wisdom had yourself colonel mason colonel r h l mr henry and a few others seen    the constitution in the same light with those who subscribed it i have no doubt that virginia would have been as zealous and unanimous as she is now divided on the subject i infer from these considerations that if a government be ever adopted in america it must result from a fortunate coincidence of leading opinions and a general confidence of the people in those who may recommend it the very attempt at a second convention strikes at the confidence in the first and the existence of a second by opposing influence to influence would in a manner destroy an effectual confidence in either and give a loose rein to human opinions which must be as various and irreconcileable concerning theories of government as doctrines of religion and give opportunities to designing men which it might be impossible to counteract the connecticut convention has probably come to a decision before this but the event is not known here  it is understood that a great majority will adopt the constitution the accounts from massachusetts vary extremely according to the channels through which they come it is said that s adams who has hitherto been reserved begins to make open declaration of his hostile views his influence is not great but this step argues an opinion that he can calculate on a considerable party it is said here and i believe on good ground that north carolina has postponed her convention till july in order to    have the previous example of virginia should north carolina fall into mr henrys politics which does not appear to me improbable it will endanger the union more than any other circumstance that could happen my apprehensions of this danger increase every day the multiplied inducements at this moment to the local sacrifices necessary to keep the states together can never be expected to coincide again and they are counteracted by so many unpropitious circumstances that their efficacy can with difficulty be confided in i have no information from south carolina or georgia on which any certain opinion can be formed of the temper of those states the prevailing idea has been that both of them would speedily and generally embrace the constitution it is impossible however that the example of virginia and north carolina should not have an influence on their politics i consider every thing therefore problematical from maryland southward i am surprised that col h lea who is a wellwisher of the constitution should have furnished wilkinson with the alarm concerning the mississippi but the political connections of the latter in pennsylvania would account for his bias on the subject we have no congress yet the number of states on the spot does not exceed five it is probable that a quorum will now be soon made a delegate from new hampshire is expected which will make up a representation from that state the termination of    the connecticut convention will set her delegates at liberty and the meeting of the assembly of this state will fill the vacancy which has some time existed in her delegation i wish you every happiness and am with the sincerest affection yrs james madison jany         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york jany         dear sir the daily advertiser of this date contains several important articles of information which need only to be referred to i inclose it with a few other late papers neither french nor english packet is

continue to be as favorable as could be wished from south carolina we get no material information a letter from georgia of the    of decr says that the convention was getting together at augusta and that everything wore a federal complexion  n carolina it seems has been so complaisant to virginia as to postpone her convention till july we are without a congress with perfect esteem  attachment i

days ago as successor to the chevr de la luzerne his passage has been so tedious that i am not sure that the despatches from mr jefferson make any considerable addition to former intelligence i have not yet seen them but am told that this is the case in general it appears that the affairs of holland are put into a pacific train the prussian troops are to be withdrawn and the event settled by negotiations but it is still possible that the war between the russians  turks may spread a general flame throughout europe the intelligence from massachusetts begins to be very ominous to the constitution the antifederal party is reinforced by the insurgents and by the province of mayne which apprehends greater obstacles to the scheme of a separate government from the new system than may be otherwise experienced and according to the prospect at the date of the last letters there was very great reason to fear that the voice of that state would be in the negative the operation of such an event on this state may easily be foreseen its legislature is now sitting and is much divided a majority of the assembly are said to be friendly to the merits of the constitution a majority of the senators actually convened are opposed to a submission of it to a convention the arrival of the absent members will render the voice of that branch uncertain on the point of a convention    the decision of massachusetts either way will involve the result in this state the minority in penna is very restless under their defeat if they can get an assembly to their wish they will endeavour to undermine what has been done there if backed by massts they will probably be emboldened to make some more rash experiment the information from georgia continues to be favorable the little we get from s carolina is of the same complexion if i am not misinformed as to the arrival of some members for congress a quorum is at length made up with the most perfect esteem  attachment i remain dear sir

letter from mr turberville of later date i have the mortification to find that our friend mr jones has not succeeded in his wish to be translated from the executive to the judiciary department i had supposed that he stood on ground that could not fail him in a case of that sort and am wholly at a loss to account for the disappointment the count de moustier arrived a few days ago as successor to the chevr de la luzerne he had so    long a passage that i do not know whether the dispatches brought by him contain much that is new it seems that although the affairs of holland are put into a pacific train those of the russians  turks may yet produce a general broil in europe the prussian troops are to be withdrawn  the fate of the dutch regulated by negociation the intelligence from massachts begins to be rather ominous to the constitution the interest opposed to it is reinforced by all connected with the late insurrection and by the province of mayne which apprehends difficulties under the new system in obtaining a separate government greater than may be otherwise experienced judging from the present state of the intelligence as i have it the probability is that the voice of that state will be in the negative the legislature of this state is much divided at present the house of assembly are said to be friendly to the merits of the constitution the senate at least a majority of those actually assembled are opposed even to the calling a convention the decision of massts in either way will decide the voice of this state the minority of penna are extremely restless under their defeat will endeavor at all events if they can get an assembly to their wish to undermine what has been done there and will it is presumed be emboldened by a negative from massts to give a more direct  violent form to their attack the accounts from georgia are favorable to the constitution so they are also from s carolina as far as they extend if i am not misinformed as to the arrival of some    members of congress in town a quorum is at length made up yours affectly james madison jany         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york jany         dear sir— i have been favored since my last with yours of the  0th inst  with a copy of the governors letter to the assembly i do not know what impression the letter may make in virginia it is generally understood here that the arguments contained in it in favor of the constitution are much stronger than the objections which prevented his assent his arguments are forcible in all places and with all persons his objections are connected with his particular way of thinking on the subject in which many of the adversaries to the constitution do not concur     the information from boston by the mail on the evening before last has not removed our suspense  0 the following is an extract of a letter from mr king dated on the   th inst  we may have   0 members in our convention not more than   0 have yet taken their seats immediately after the settlement of elections the convention resolved that they would consider and freely debate on each paragraph without taking a question on any of them individually  that on the question whether they would ratify each member should be at liberty to discuss the plan at large this resolution seems to preclude the idea of amendments and hitherto the measure has not been suggested i however do not from this circumstance    conclude that it may not hereafter occur the opponents of the constitution moved that mr gerry should be requested to take a seat in the convention to answer such enquiries as the convention should make concerning facts which happened in the passing of the constitution although this seems to be a very irregular proposal yet considering the jealousies which prevail with those who made it who are certainly not the most enlightened part of the convention and the doubt of the issue had it been made a trial of strength several friends of the constitution united with the opponents and the resolution was agreed to and mr gerry has taken his seat tomorrow we are told certain enquiries are to be moved for by the opposition and that mr gerry under the idea of stating facts is to state his reasons c—this will be opposed and we shall on the division be able to form some idea of our relative strength from the men who are in favour of the constitution every reasonable explanation will be given and arguments really new and in my judgment most excellent have been and will be produced in its support but what will be its fate i confess i am unable to discern no question ever classed the people of this state in a more extraordinary manner or with more apparent firmness a congress of seven states was made up on monday mr c griffin has been placed in the chair this is the only step yet taken i remain with the highest respect  attachmt yrs affecty    james madison jany         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york jany         dear sir the information which i have by the eastern mail rather increases than removes the anxiety produced by the last i give it to you as i have recd it in the words of mr king james madison  0 jany      boston george washington boston  0 jany      our convention proceeds slowly an apprehension that the liberties of the people are in danger and a distrust of men of property or education have a more powerful effect upon the minds of our opponents than any specific objections against the constitution if the opposition was grounded on any precise points i am persuaded that it might be weakened if not entirely overcome but any attempt to remove their fixed and violent jealousy seems hitherto to operate as a confirmation of that baneful passion the opponents affirm to each other that they have an unalterable majority on their side the friends doubt the strength of their adversaries but are not entirely confident of their own an event has taken place relative to mr gerry which without great caution may throw us into confusion i informed you by the last post on what terms mr gerry took a seat in the convention yesterday in the course of debate on the construction of the senate mr g unasked informed the convention that he had some information to give the convention on the subject then under discussion mr dana and a number of the most respectable    members remarked upon the impropriety of mr gs conduct mr g rose with a view to justify himself he was immediately prevented by a number of objectors this brought on an irregular conversation whether mr g should be heard the hour of adjournment arrived and the president adjourned the house mr gerry immediately charged mr dana with a design of injuring his reputation by partial information and preventing his having an opportunity to communicate important truths to the convention this charge drew a warm reply from mr dana the members collected about them took sides as they were for or against the constitution and we were in danger of the utmost confusion however the gentlemen separated and i suppose tomorrow morning will renew the discussion before the convention i shall be better able to conjecture the final issue by next post there are other letters of the same date from other gentlemen on the spot which exhibit rather a more favorable prospect some of them i am told are even flattering accounts will always vary in such cases because they must be founded on different opportunities of remarking the general complexion where they take no tincture from the opinions or temper of the writer i remain dear sir with the most perfect esteem  attachment your obedt servt    james madison feby      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york feby      dear sir the eastern mail which arrived yesterday brought me a letter from mr king of which a copy follows our prospects are gloomy but hope is not entirely extinguished gerry has not returned to the convention and i think will not again be invited we are now thinking of amendments to be submitted not as a condition of our assent  ratification but as the opinion of the convention subjoined to their ratification this scheme may gain a few members but the issue is doubtful in this case as in the last mr kings information is accompanied with letters from other persons on the spot which dwell more on the favorable side of the prospect his anxiety on the subject may give a greater activity to his fears than to his hopes and he would naturally lean to the cautious side these circumstances encourage me to put as favorable a construction on his letter as it will bear a vessel is arrived here from charleston which brings letters that speak with confidence of an adoption of the fed government in that state and make it very probable that georgia had actually adopted it some letters from n carolina speak a very equivocal language as to the prospect there the french packet arrived yesterday as she has been out since early in november little news can be expected by her i have not yet got my letters if    there be any for me and i have heard the contents of no others i remain dr sir with the utmost respect  attachment yr affet servt james madison feby  d      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york feby  d      dear sir another mail has arrived from boston without terminating the conflict between our hopes and fears i have a letter from mr king of the    which after dilating somewhat on the ideas in his former letters concludes with the following paragraph  we have avoided every question which would have shewn the division of the house of consequence we are not positive of the numbers on each side by the last calculation we made on our side we were doubtful whether we exceeded them or they us in numbers they however say that they    have a majority of eight or twelve against us we by no means despair another letter of the same date from another member gives the following picture  never was there an assembly in this state in possession of greater ability  information than the present convention yet i am in doubt whether they will approve the constitution there are unhappily three parties opposed to it—  all men who are in favor of paper money  tender laws those are more or less in every part of the state   all the late insurgents  their abettors—in the three great western counties they are very numerous we have in the convention    or  0 who were actually in shays army—  a great majority of the members from the province of main many of them  their constituents are only squatters on other peoples land and they are afraid of being brought to account—they also think though erroneously that their favorite plan of being a separate state will be defeated add to these the honest doubting people and they make a powerful host the leaders of this    party are a mr widgery mr thomson  mr nason from the province of main a docr taylor from the county of worster  mr bishop from the neighbourhood of r island to manage the cause agst them are the present and late govr   judges of the supreme court    members of the senate  0 from among the most respectable of the clergy  0 or    of the first characters at the bar judges of probate high sheriffs of counties  many other respectable people merchants c genls heath lincoln brooks  others of the late army with all this ability in support of the cause i am pretty well satisfied we shall lose the question unless we can take off some of the opposition by amendments i do not mean such as are to be made conditions of the ratification but recommendations only upon this plan i flatter myself we may possibly get a majority of    or    if not more the legislature of this state has voted a convention on june    james madison feby      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york feby      dear sir the prospect in massts seems to brighten if i view in the true light the following representation of it this day jany  0 for the first our president mr handcock took his seat in convention and we shall probably terminate our business on saturday or tuesday next i cannot predict the issue but our hopes are increasing if mr hancock does not    disappoint our present expectations our wishes will be gratified  several reflections are suggested by this paragraph which countenance a favorable inference from it i hope from the rapid advance towards a conclusion of the business that even the project of recommendatory alterations has been dispensed with  the form of the ratification of georgia is contained in one of the papers herewith inclosed every information from s carolina continues to be favorable i have seen a letter from n carolina of pretty late date which admits that a very formidable opposition exists but leans towards a federal result in that state as far as i can discover the state of the question in n carolina is pretty analogous to that in virginia the body of the people are better disposed than some of a superior order the resolutions of new york for calling a convention appear by the paper to have passed by a majority of two only in the house of assembly i am told this proceeded in some degree from an injudicious form in which the business was conducted and which threw some of the federalists into the opposition i am just informed by a gentleman who has seen another letter from boston of the same date with mine that the plan of recommendatory alterations has not been abandoned but that they will be put    into a harmless form and will be the means of saving the constitution from all risk in massts with the highest respect  attachment i remain dear sir your affe  hble servt james madison feby       new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york feby       dear sir the newspaper inclosed with the letter which follows comprises the information brought me by the mail of yesterday james madison feby  d boston george washington boston feby  d i inclose a newspaper containing the propositions communicated by mr hancock to the convention on thursday last mr adams who contrary to his own sentiments has been hitherto silent in convention has given his public and explicit approbation of mr hancocks propositions we flatter ourselves that the weight of these two characters will ensure our success but the event is not absolutely certain yesterday a committee was appointed on the motion of a doubtful character to consider the propositions submitted by mr hancock and to report tomorrow afternoon we have a majority of federalists on this committee and flatter ourselves the result will be favorable p s we shall probably decide on thursday or friday next when our numbers will amount to about      with greatest esteem  attachment i am dear sir yr obedt  affe servt  00 james madison feby         new york george washington to george washington mad mss  new york feby         dear sir i have at length the pleasure to inclose you the favorable result of the convention at boston the amendments are a blemish but are in the least offensive form the minority also is very disagreeably large but the temper of it is some atonement i am assured by mr king that the leaders of it as well as the members of it in general are in good humor and will countenance no irregular opposition there or elsewhere  the convention of new hampshire is now sitting there seems to be no question that the issue there will add a seventh pillar as the phrase now is to the federal temple with the greatest respect  attachment i am dr sir yrs james madison feby         new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mad mss  new york feby         dear sir by the count de moustier i received your favour of the  th of october i recd by his hands also the  0  watch which you have been so good as to provide for me and for which i beg you to accept my particular thanks during the short trial i have made she goes with great exactness since the arrival of the count de moustier i have recd also by the packet mr calonuis publication for myself and a number of the mercuries for mr banister the bearer was a mr stuart i had a conveyance to mr banister a few days after the mercuries came to hand the public here continues to be much agitated by the proposed federal constitution and to be attentive to little else at the date of my last delaware pennsylvania and new jersey had adopted it it has been since adopted by connecticut georgia and massachusetts in the first the minority consisted of  0 against     in georgia the adoption was unanimous in massachusetts the conflict was tedious and the event extremely doubtful on the final question the vote stood     against     a majority of    only being in favor of the constitution the prevailing party comprized however all the men of abilities of property and of influence in the opposite multitude there was not a single character capable of uniting their wills or directing their measures it was made up partly of deputies from the province of maine who apprehended difficulties from the new government to their scheme of  0  separation partly of men who had espoused the disaffection of shays and partly of ignorant and jealous men who had been taught or had fancied that the convention at philada had entered into a conspiracy against the liberties of the people at large in order to erect an aristocracy for the rich the well born and the men of education they had no plan whatever they looked no farther than to put a negative on the constitution and return home the amendments as recommended by the convention were as i am well informed not so much calculated for the minority in the convention on whom they had little effect as for the people of the state you will find the amendments in the newspapers which are sent from the office of foreign affairs it appears from a variety of circumstances that disappointment had produced no asperity in the minority and that they will probably not only acquiesce in the event but endeavour to reconcile their constituents to it this was the public declaration of several who were called the leaders of the party the minority of connecticut behaved with equal moderation that of pennsylvania has been extremely intemperate and continues to use a very bold and menacing language had the decision in massachusetts been averse to the constitution it is not improbable that some very violent measures would have followed in that state the cause of the inflammation however is much more in their state factions than in the system proposed by the convention new hampshire is now deliberating on the constitution it is  0  generally understood that an adoption is a matter of certainty south carolina  maryland have fixed on april or may for their conventions the former it is currently said will be one of the ratifying states mr chace and a few others will raise a considerable opposition in the latter but the weight of personal influence is on the side of the constitution and the present expectation is that the opposition will be outnumbered by a great majority this state is much divided in its sentiment its convention is to be held in june the decision of massts will give the turn in favor of the constitution unless an idea should prevail or the fact should appear that the voice of the state is opposed to the result of its convention north carolina has put off her convention till july the state is much divided it is said the temper of virginia as far as i can learn has undergone but little change of late at first there was an enthusiasm for the constitution the tide next took a sudden and strong turn in the opposite direction the influence and exertions of mr henry and col mason and some others will account for this subsequent information again represented the constitution as regaining in some degree its lost ground the people at large have been uniformly said to be more friendly to the constitution than the assembly but it is probable that the dispersion of the latter will have a considerable influence on the opinions of the former the previous adoption of nine states must have a very persuasive effect on the minds of the opposition though i am told that a very bold language is held  0  by mr h—y and some of his partizans great stress is laid on the selfsufficiency of that state and the prospect of external props is alluded to congress have done no business of consequence yet nor is it probable that much more of any sort will precede the event of the great question before the public the assembly of virginia have passed the district bill of which i formerly gave you an account there are    districts with   new judges mr gabl jones richd parker st george tucker and jos prentis they have reduced much the taxes and provided some indulgences for debtors the question of british debts underwent great vicissitudes it was after long discussion resolvd by a majority of  0 agst the utmost exertions of mr henry that they shd be paid as soon as the other states shd have complied with the treaty a few days afterwards he carried his point by a majority of  0 that g b should first comply adieu yrs affecty p s mr st john has given me a very interesting description of a system of nature lately published at paris will you add it for me the boxes which were to have come for myself g w  illegible have not yet arrived james madison feby  0      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york feby  0      dear sir i am just favored with yours of the  th inst and will attend to your wishes as to the political essays in the press  0  i have given notice to my friends in orange that the county may command my services in the convention if it pleases  i can say with great truth however that in this overture i sacrifice every private inclination to considerations not of a selfish nature i foresee that the undertaking will involve me in very laborious and irksome discussions that public opposition to several very respectable characters whose esteem and friendship i greatly prize may unintentionally endanger the subsisting connection and that disagreeable misconstructions of which samples have been already given may be the fruit of those exertions which fidelity will impose but i have made up my determination on the subject  0  and if i am informed that my presence at the election in the county be indispensable shall submit to that condition also though it is my particular wish to decline it as well to avoid apparent solicitude on the occasion as a journey of such length at a very unpleasant season i had seen the extract of your letter to col carter and had supposed from the place where it first made its appearance that its publication was the effect of the zeal of a correspondent i cannot but think on the whole that it may have been of service notwithstanding the scandalous misinterpretations of it which have been attempted as it has evidently the air of a paragraph to a familiar friend the omission of an argumentative support of the opinion given will appear to no candid reader unnatural or improper we have no late information from europe except through the english papers which represent the affairs of france as in the most ticklish state the facts have every appearance of authenticity and we wait with great impatience for the packet which is daily expected it can be little doubted that the patriots have been abandoned whether from impotency in france misconduct in them or from what other cause is not altogether clear the french apologists are visibly embarrassed by the dilemma of submitting to the appearance of either weakness or the want of faith they seem generally to allege that their engagements being with the republic the nation could not oppose the regular authority of the  0  country by supporting a single province or perhaps a party in it only the validity of this excuse will depend much on the real connection between france and the patriots and the assurances given as an encouragement to the latter from the british kings speech it would seem that france had avowed her purpose of supporting her dutch friends though it is possible her menaces to england might be carried further than her real promises to the patriots all these circumstances however must have galled the pride of france and i have little doubt that a war will prove it as soon as her condition will admit of it perhaps she may be the sooner forced into it on account of her being in a contrary situation i hear nothing yet from the convention of n hampshire i remain yours most respectfully  affectly james madison feby       new york edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  new york feby       dear sir the receipt of your favor of the   th ult  which did not come to hand till a few days ago was rendered particularly agreeable to me by the prospect it gives of a thorough reestablishment of your health i indulge the reflection and the hope that it denotes a remaining energy in the constitution which will long defend it against the gradual waste of time  0  your representation of the politics of the state coincides with the information from every other quarter great fluctuations and divisions of opinion naturally result in virginia from the causes which you describe but they are not the less ominous on that account i have for some time been persuaded that the question on which the proposed constitution must turn is the simple one whether the union shall or shall not be continued there is in my opinion no middle ground to be taken the opposition with some has disunion assuredly for its object and with all for its real tendency events have demonstrated that no coalition can ever take place in favor of a new plan among the adversaries to the proposed one the grounds of objection among the nonsigning members of the convention are by no means the same the disapproving members who were absent but who have since published their objections differ irreconcileably from each of them the writers against the constitution are as little agreed with one another and the principles which have been disclosed by the several minorities where the constitution has not been unanimously adopted are as heterogeneous as can be imagined that of massachusetts as far as i can learn was averse to any government that deserved the name and it is certain looked no farther than to reject the constitution in toto and return home in triumph out of the vast number which composed it there was scarce a man of respectability and not a single one capable of leading the formidable band the men of abilities  0  of property of character with every judge lawyer of eminence and the clergy of all sects were with scarce an exception deserving notice as unanimous in that state as the same description of characters are divided and opposed to one another in virginia this contrast does not arise from circumstances of local interest but from causes which will in my opinion produce much regret hereafter in the opponents in virginia if they should succeed in their opposition n hampshire is now in convention it is expected that the result will be in favor of the constitution r island takes no notice of the matter n york is much divided the weight of abilities and of property is on the side of the constitution she must go with the eastern states let the direction be what it may by a vessel just from charleston we understand that opposition will be made there mr lowndes is the leader of it a british packet brings a picture of affairs in france which indicates some approaching events in that kingdom which may almost amount to a revolution in the form of its government the authority is in itself suspicious but it coincides with a variety of proofs that the spirit of liberty has made a progress which must lead to some remarkable conclusion of the scene the dutch patriots seem to have been the victims partly of their own folly and partly of something amiss in their friends the present state of that confederacy is or ought to be a very emphatic lesson to the u states the want of union and a capable government is the source of all their   0 calamities and particularly of that dependence on foreign powers which is as dishonorable to their character as it is destructive of their tranquillity i remain dr sir yours very affely james madison march        new york edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  new york march        dear sir the convention of n hampshire have disappointed much the general expectation instead of adopting the constitution they have adjourned without any final decision until june this expedient being found necessary to prevent a rejection it seems that a majority of   or   members would have voted in the negative but in this majority were a number who had been proselyted by the discussions but were bound by positive instructions these concurred with the federalists in the adjournment and carried it by a majority of    agst    it is not much doubted that in the event n hampshire will be among the adopting states but the influence of this check will be very considerable in this state n york and in several others  i have enquired whether june was preferred for the  d meeting from any reference to virga or n york and am informed     that it was merely an accommodation to the intermediate annual elections  courts i am just setting out for virga and shall not write again from this place i wish you every happiness  am dr sir yr affee friend james madison march  d      new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york march  d      dear sir the convention of n hampshire has afforded a very disagreeable subject of communication it has not rejected the constitution but it has failed to adopt it contrary to all calculations that had been made it appeared on a meeting of the members that a majority of   or four was adverse to the object before them and that on a final question on the merits the decision would be in the negative in this critical state of things the federalists thought it best to attempt an adjournment and having proselyted some of the members who were positively instructed agst the constitution the attempt succeeded by a majority of    agst    if my information as to the numbers be correct it seems to be fully expected that some of the instructed members will prevail on their towns to unfetter them and that in the event n hampshire will be among the adopting states the mischief elsewhere will in the mean time be of a serious nature the second meeting is to be in june this circumstance will probably be construed     in virga as making cotemporary arrangements with her it is explained to me however as having reference merely to the conveniency of the members whose attendance at their annual elections  courts would not consist with an earlier period the opposition i understand is composed precisely of the same description of characters with that of massts and stands contrasted to all the wealth abilities and respectability of the state i am preparing to set out for orange  and promise myself the pleasure of taking mount vernon in the way i remain yours most respectfully  affectly     james madison march        new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york march        dear sir the convention of new hampshire have disappointed the general expectation they have not rejected the constitution but they have adjourned without adopting it it was found that on a final question there would be a majority of three or four in the negative but in this number were included some who with instructions from their towns against the constitution had been proselyted by the discussions these concurring with the federalists in the adjournment carried it by fiftyseven against fortyseven if i am rightly informed as to the numbers the second meeting is not to be till the last week in june i have inquired of the gentlemen from that quarter what particularly recommended so late a day supposing it might refer to the times fixed by new york and virginia they tell me it was governed by the intermediate annual elections and courts if the opposition in that state be such as they are described it is not probable that they pursue any sort of plan more than that of massachusetts this event whatever cause may have produced it or whatever consequences it may have in new hampshire is no small check to the progress of the business the opposition here which is unquestionably hostile to every thing beyond the federal principle will take new spirits the event in massachusetts had almost extinguished     their hopes that in pennsylvania will probably be equally encouraged col heth arrived a day or so ago with the proceedings of the commissioners they will be laid before congress today i have been detained from setting out for virginia by this circumstance having fixed on yesterday for the purpose i shall probably get away tomorrow and possibly this afternoon james madison april  0      orange george washington to george washington wash mss  orange april  0      dear sir having seen a part only of the names returned for the convention and being unacquainted with the political characters of many of them i am a very incompetent prophet of the fate of the constitution my hopes however are much encouraged by my present conjectures those who have more data for their calculations than i have augur a flattering issue to the deliberations of june i find that col nicholas  who is among the best judges thinks on     the whole that a majority in the convention will be on the list of federalists but very properly takes     into view the turn that may be given to the event by the weight of kentucky if thrown into the wrong scale and by the proceedings of maryland and south carolina if they should terminate in either a rejection or postponement of the question the impression on kentucky like that on the rest of the state was at first answerable to our wishes but as elsewhere the torch of discord has been thrown in and has found the materials but too inflammable i have written several letters since my arrival to correspondents in that district with a view to counteract antifederal machinations i have little expectation however that they will have much effect unless the communications that may go from mr brown in congress should happen to breathe the same spirit and i am not without apprehensions that his mind may have taken an unlucky tincture from the difficulties thrown in the way of the separation of the district as well as from some antecedent proceedings of congress i have taken the liberty of writing also to a friend in south carolina on the critical importance of a right decision there to a favorable one here the inclosed letter which i leave unsealed will shew you that i am doing the same with respect to maryland will you be so good as to put a wafer in it and to send it to the post office for george town or to change the address to annapolis if you should have reason to conclude that mr carrol will be there i have written a similar letter to docr mchenry the difference between even a postponement and adoption in maryland     may in the nice balance of parties here possibly give a fatal advantage to that which opposes the constitution i have done nothing yet in preparing answers to the queries as facts are to be ascertained as well as opinions formed delay will be of course counted upon with every sentiment of respect and attachment i remain dear sir your obedient  humble servt james madison april  0th      orange edmund randolph to edmund randolph mad mss  orange april  0th      my dear friend since i got home which was on the day preceding our election i have received your favor of the   th of feby which did not reach new york before i had left it i view the amendments of massachusetts pretty nearly in the same light that you do they were meant for the people at large not for the minority in the convention the latter were not affected by them their objections being levelled against the very essence of the proposed government i do not see that the  d amendment  if i understand its scope can be more exceptionable to the s sts than the others i take it to mean that the number of reps     shall be limited to  00 who will be apportioned from time to time according to a census not that the apportionment first made when the reps amount to that number shall be perpetual the  th amendment  i have understood was made a very serious point of by s adams i do not know of anything in the new constitution that can change the obligations of the public with regard to the old money the principle on which it is to be settled seems to be equally in the power of that as of the existing one the claim of the indiana company cannot i should suppose be any more validated by the new system than that of all the creditors and others who have been aggrieved by unjust laws you do not mention what part of the constitution could give colour to such a doctrine the condemnation of retrospective laws if that be the part does not appear to me to admit on any principle of such a retrospective construction as to the religious test i should conceive that it can imply at most nothing more than that without that exception a power would have been given to impose an oath involving a religious test as a qualification for office the constitution of necessary offices being given to the congress the proper qualifications seem to be evidently involved i think too there are several other satisfactory points of view in which the exception might be placed     i shall be extremely happy to see a coalition among all the real federalists recommendatory alterations are the only ground that occurs to me a conditional ratification or a second convention appears to me utterly irreconcileable in the present state of things with the dictates of prudence and safety i am confirmed by a comparative view of the publications on the subject and still more of the debates in the several conventions that a second experiment would be either wholly abortive or would end in something much more remote from your ideas and those of others who wish a salutary government than the plan now before the public it is to be considered also that besides the local  personal pride that wd stand in the way it could not be a very easy matter to bring about a reconsideration and rescision of what will certainly have been done in six and probably eight states and in several of them by unanimous votes add to all this the extreme facility with which those who secretly aim at disunion and there are probably some such in most if not all the states will be able to carry on their schemes under the mask of contending for alterations popular in some places and known to be inadmissible in others every danger of this sort might be justly dreaded from such men as this state  n york only could furnish playing for such a purpose into each others hands the declaration of h—y mentioned in your letter is a proof to me that desperate measures will be his game if report does not more than usually exaggerate mason also is ripening   0 fast for going every length  his licentiousness of animadversion it is said no longer spares even the moderate opponents of the constitution james madison april         virginia orange thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mad mss  virginia orange april         dear sir being just acquainted by letter from president griffin that mr paradise is in n york and proposes to sail on the first packet for france i drop you a few lines which will go by that conveyance if they arrive at n york in time which however i do not much expect the proposed constitution still engrosses the public attention the elections for the convention here are but just over and promulged from the returns excepting those from kentucky which are not yet known it seems probable though not absolutely certain that a majority of the members elect are friends to the constitution the superiority of abilities at least seems to lie on that side the characters of most note which occur to me are marshalled thus for the constitution pendleton

the governor is so temperate in his opposition and goes so far with the friends of the constitution that he cannot properly be classed with its enemies monroe is considered by some as an enemy but i

i am told but also is not elected so are jno  man page the adversaries take very different grounds of opposition some are opposed to the substance of the plan others to particular modifications only mr h—y is supposed to aim at disunion col m—n is growing every day more bitter and outrageous in his efforts to carry his point and will probably in the end be thrown by the violence of his passions into the politics of mr h—y the preliminary question will be whether previous alterations shall be insisted on or not should this be carried in the affirmative either a conditional ratification or a proposal for a new convention will ensue in either event i think the constitution and the union will     be both endangered it is not to be expected that the states which have ratified will reconsider their determinations and submit to the alterations prescribed by virga and if a second convention should be formed it is as little to be expected that the same spirit of compromise will prevail in it as produced an amicable result to the first it will be easy also for those who have latent views of disunion to carry them on under the mask of contending for alterations popular in some but inadmissible in other parts of the u states the real sense of the people of this state cannot be easily ascertained they are certainly attached and with warmth to a continuance of the union and i believe a large majority of the most intelligent and independent are equally so to the plan under consideration on a geographical view of them almost all the counties in the n neck have elected federal deputies the counties on the south side of james river have pretty generally elected adversaries to the constitution the intermediate district is much chequered in this respect the counties between the blue ridge  the alleghany have chosen friends to the constitution without a single exception those westward of the latter have as i am informed generally though not universally pursued the same rule kentucky it is supposed will be divided having been in virga but a few weeks i can give you little account of other matters and none of your private affairs or connections particularly of your two nephews the winter here as everywhere else in the     u s was very severe which added to short crops of corn threatened a great scarcity  a high price it is found however that neither of these evils has taken place corn may be purchased for   dollars and even  0s per barrel tobacco is as low at fredg as   s per ct and not higher at richmond than    or   s there is at present a very promising spring especially in the article of fruit the night before last was so cold as to produce an alarm for the vegetation of all sorts but it does not appear that anything less vulnerable than young cucumbers had been injured i shall ask the favor of mr griffin to send you by mr paradise or if he should be gone by some other hand the debates of the conventions in penna  massachusetts and any other publications worth your reading i am dear sir your affect friend  servt speeches in the virginia convention  june  —necessity for the constitution mr madison then arose —but he spoke so low that his exordium could not be heard distinctly i shall not attempt     to make impressions by any ardent professions of zeal for the public welfare we know the principles of every man will and ought to be judged not by his professions and declarations but by his conduct by that criterion i mean in common with every other member to be judged and should it prove unfavorable to my reputation yet it is a criterion from which i will by no means depart comparisons have     been made between the friends of this constitution and those who oppose it although i disapprove of such comparisons i trust that in points of truth honor candor and rectitude of motives the friends of this system here and in other states are not inferior to its opponents but professions of attachment to the public good and comparisons of parties ought not to govern or influence us now we ought sir to examine the constitution on its own merits solely we are to enquire whether it will promote the public happiness its aptitude to produce this desirable object ought to be the exclusive subject of our present researches in this pursuit we ought not to address our arguments to the feelings and passions but to those understandings and judgments which were selected by the people of this country to decide this great question by a calm and rational investigation i hope that gentlemen in displaying their abilities on this occasion instead of giving opinions and making assertions will condescend to prove and demonstrate by a fair and regular discussion it gives me pain to hear gentlemen continually distorting the natural construction of language for it is sufficient if any human production can stand a fair discussion before i proceed to make some additions to the reasons which have been adduced by my honorable friend over the way i must take the liberty to make some observations on what was said by another gentleman mr henry he told us that this constitution ought to be rejected because it endangered the public liberty in his opinion in many instances give me leave to make one answer to that observation let the dangers which this system is supposed to be replete with be clearly pointed out if any dangerous and unnecessary powers be given to the general legislature let them be plainly demonstrated and let us not rest satisfied with general assertions of dangers without examination if powers be necessary apparent danger is not a sufficient reason against conceding them he has suggested that licentiousness has seldom produced the loss of liberty but that the tyranny of rulers has almost always effected it     since the general civilization of mankind i believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations but on a candid examination of history we shall find that turbulence violence and abuse of power by the majority trampling on the rights of the minority have produced factions and commotions which in republics have more frequently than any other cause produced despotism if we go over the whole history of ancient and modern republics we shall find their destruction to have generally resulted from those causes if we consider the peculiar situation of the united states and what are the sources of that diversity of sentiment which pervades its inhabitants we shall find great danger to fear that the same causes may terminate here in the same fatal effects which they produced in those republics this danger ought to be wisely guarded against perhaps in the progress of this discussion it will appear that the only possible remedy for those evils and means of preserving and protecting the principles of republicanism will be found in that very system which is now exclaimed against as the parent of oppression i must confess i have not been able to find his usual consistency in the gentlemans argument on this occasion he informs us that the people of the country are at perfect repose that is every man enjoys the fruits of his labor peaceably and securely and that every thing is in perfect tranquility and safety i wish sincerely sir this were true if this be their happy situation why has every state acknowledged the contrary why were deputies from all the states sent to the general convention why have complaints of national and individual distresses been echoed and reechoed throughout the continent why has our general government been so shamefully disgraced and our constitution violated wherefore have laws been made to authorize a change and wherefore are we now assembled here a federal government is formed for the protection of its individual members     ours has attacked itself with impunity its authority has been disobeyed and despised i think i perceive a glaring inconsistency in another of his arguments he complains of this constitution because it requires the consent of at least threefourths of the states to introduce amendments which shall be necessary for the happiness of the people the assent of so many he urges as too great an obstacle to the admission of salutary amendments which he strongly insists ought to be at the will of a bare majority—we hear this argument at the very moment we are called upon to assign reasons for proposing a constitution which puts it in the power of nine states to abolish the present inadequate unsafe and pernicious confederation in the first case he asserts that a majority ought to have the power of altering the government when found to be inadequate to the security of public happiness in the last case he affirms that even threefourths of the community have not a right to alter a government which experience has proved to be subversive of national felicity nay that the most necessary and urgent alterations cannot be made without the absolute unanimity of all the states does not the thirteenth article of the confederation expressly require that no alteration shall be made without the unanimous consent of all the states could any thing in theory be more perniciously improvident and injudicious than this submission of the will of the majority to the most trifling minority have not experience and practice actually manifested this theoretical inconvenience to be extremely impolitic let me mention one fact which i conceive must carry conviction to the mind of any one—the smallest state in the union has obstructed every attempt to reform the government—that like member has repeatedly disobeyed and counteracted the general authority nay has even supplied the enemies of its country with provisions twelve states had agreed to certain improvements which were proposed being thought absolutely necessary to preserve the existence of the     general government but as these improvements though really indispensable could not by the confederation be introduced into it without the consent of every state the refractory dissent of that little state prevented their adoption the inconveniences resulting from this requisition of unanimous concurrence in alterations in the confederation must be known to every member in this convention it is therefore needless to remind them of them is it not selfevident that a trifling minority ought not to bind the majority would not foreign influence be exerted with facility over a small minority would the honorable gentleman agree to continue the most radical defects in the old system because the petty state of rhode island would not agree to remove them he next objects to the exclusive legislation over the district where the seat of government may be fixed would he submit that the representatives of this state should carry on their deliberations under the control of any one member of the union if any state had the power of legislation over the place where congress should fix the general government this would impair the dignity and hazard the safety of congress if the safety of the union were under the control of any particular state would not foreign corruption probably prevail in such a state to induce it to exert its controlling influence over the members of the general government gentlemen cannot have forgotten the disgraceful insult which congress received some years ago when we also reflect that the previous session of particular states is necessary before congress can legislate exclusively any where we must instead of being alarmed at this part heartily approve of it but the honorable member sees great danger in the provision concerning the militia this i conceive to be an additional security to our liberty without diminishing the power of the states in any considerable degree it appears to me so highly expedient that i should imagine it would have found advocates even in the warmest friends of the present system the authority of training the militia and appointing     the officers is reserved to the states congress ought to have the power of establishing an uniform discipline throughout the states and to provide for the execution of the laws suppress insurrections and repel invasions these are the only cases wherein they can interfere with the militia and the obvious necessity of their having power over them in these cases must convince any reflecting mind without uniformity of discipline military bodies would be incapable of action without a general controlling power to call forth the strength of the union to repel invasions the country might be overrun and conquered by foreign enemies without such a power to suppress insurrections our liberties might be destroyed by domestic faction and domestic tyranny be established the honorable member then told us that there was no instance of power once transferred being voluntarily renounced not to produce european examples which may probably be done before the rising of this convention have we not seen already in seven states and probably in an eighth state legislatures surrendering some of the most important powers they possessed but sir by this government powers are not given to any particular set of men they are in the hands of the people delegated to their representatives chosen for short terms to representatives responsible to the people and whose situation is perfectly similar to our own as long as this is the case we have no danger to apprehend when the gentleman called our recollection to the usual effects of the concession of powers and imputed the loss of liberty generally to open tyranny i wish he had gone on farther upon his review of history he would have found that the loss of liberty very often resulted from factions and divisions from local considerations which eternally lead to quarrels he would have found internal dissentions to have more frequently demolished civil liberty than a tenacious disposition in rulers to retain any stipulated powers here mr madison enumerated the various means whereby nations had lost their liberties   0 the power of raising and supporting armies is exclaimed against as dangerous and unnecessary i wish there were no necessity of vesting this power in the general government but suppose a foreign nation to declare war against the united states must not the general legislature have the power of defending the united states ought it to be known to foreign nations that the general government of the united states of america has no power to raise and support an army even in the utmost danger when attacked by external enemies would not their knowledge of such a circumstance stimulate them to fall upon us if sir congress be not invested with this power any powerful nation prompted by ambition or avarice will be invited by our weakness to attack us and such an attack by disciplined veterans would certainly be attended with success when only opposed by irregular undisciplined militia whoever considers the peculiar situation of this country the multiplicity of its excellent inlets and habours and the uncommon facility of attacking it however much he may regret the necessity of such a power cannot hesitate a moment in granting it one fact may elucidate this argument in the course of the late war when the weak parts of the union were exposed and many states were in the most deplorable situation by the enemys ravages the assistance of foreign nations was thought so urgently necessary for our protection that the relinquishment of territorial advantages was not deemed too great a sacrifice for the acquisition of one ally this expedient was admitted with great reluctance even by those states who expected advantages from it the crisis however at length arrived when it was judged necessary for the salvation of this country to make certain cessions to spain whether wisely or otherwise is not for me to say but the fact was that instructions were sent to our representative at the court of spain to empower him to enter into negotiations for that purpose—how it terminated is well known this fact shews the extremities to which nations will go in cases of imminent danger and     demonstrates the necessity of making ourselves more respectable the necessity of making dangerous cessions and of applying to foreign aid ought to be excluded the honorable member then told us that there are heartburnings in the adopting states and that virginia may if she does not come into the measure continue in amicable confederacy with the adopting states i wish as seldom as possible to contradict the assertions of gentlemen but i can venture to affirm without danger of being in an error that there is the most satisfactory evidence that the satisfaction of those states is increasing every day and that in that state where it was adopted only by a majority of nineteen there is not onefifth of the people dissatisfied there are some reasons which induce us to conclude that the grounds of proselytism extend every where its principles begin to be better understood and the inflammatory violence wherewith it was opposed by designing illiberal and unthinking minds begins to subside i will not enumerate the causes from which in my conception the heartburnings of a majority of its opposers have originated suffice it to say that in all they were founded on a misconception of its nature and tendency had it been candidly examined and fairly discussed i believe sir that but a very inconsiderable minority of the people of the united states would have opposed it with respect to the swiss which the honorable gentleman has proposed for our example as far as historical authority may be relied on we shall find their government quite unworthy of our imitation i am sure if the honorable gentleman had adverted to their history and government he never would have quoted their example here he would have found that instead of respecting the rights of mankind their government at least of several of their cantons is one of the vilest aristocracies that ever was instituted the peasants of some of their cantons are more oppressed and degraded than the subjects of any monarch in europe may almost as much so as those of any eastern despot it is a novelty in politics that from the worst of     systems the happiest consequences should ensue their aristocratical rigor and the peculiarity of their situation have so long supported their union without the closest alliance and amity dismemberment might follow their powerful and ambitious neighbors would immediately avail themselves of their least jarrings as we are not circumstanced like them no conclusive precedent can be drawn from their situation i trust the gentleman does not carry his idea so far as to recommend a separation from the adopting states this government may secure our happiness this is at least as probable as that it shall be oppressive if eight states have from a persuasion of its policy and utility adopted it shall virginia shrink from it without a full conviction of its danger and inutility i hope she will never shrink from any duty i trust she will not determine without the most serious reflection and deliberation i confess to you sir were uniformity of religion to be introduced by this system it would in my opinion be ineligible but i have no reason to conclude that uniformity of government will produce that of religion this subject is for the honor of america perfectly free and unshackled the government has no jurisdiction over it—the least reflection will convince us there is no danger to be feared on this ground but we are flattered with the probability of obtaining previous amendments this calls for the most serious attention of this house if amendments are to be proposed by one state other states have the same right and will also propose alterations these cannot but be dissimilar and opposite in their nature i beg leave to remark that the governments of the different states are in many respects dissimilar in their structure their legislative bodies are not similar—their executive are more different in several of the states the first magistrate is elected by the people at large—in others by joint ballot of the members of both branches of the legislature—and in others in other different manners this dissimilarity has occasioned a diversity of opinion on the theory of government     which will without many reciprocal concessions render a concurrence impossible although the appointment of an executive magistrate has not been thought destructive to the principles of democracy in many of the states yet in the course of the debate we find objections made to the federal executive it is urged that the president will degenerate into a tyrant i intended in compliance with the call of the honorable member to explain the reasons of proposing this constitution and develop its principles but i shall postpone my remarks till we hear the supplement which he has informed us he intends to add to what he has already said give me leave to say something of the nature of the government and to show that it is safe and just to vest it with the power of taxation there are a number of opinions but the principal question is whether it be a federal or consolidated government in order to judge properly of the question before us we must consider it minutely in its principal parts i conceive myself that it is of a mixed nature it is in a manner unprecedented we cannot find one express example in the experience of the world it stands by itself in some respects it is a government of a federal nature in others it is of a consolidated nature even if we attend to the manner in which the constitution is investigated ratified and made the act of the people of america i can say notwithstanding what the honorable gentleman has alleged that this government is not completely consolidated nor is it entirely federal who are parties to it the people—but not the people as composing one great body but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties were it as the gentleman asserts a consolidated government the assent of a majority of the people would be sufficient for its establishment and as a majority have adopted it already the remaining states would be bound by the act of the majority even if they unanimously reprobated it were it such a government as it is suggested it would be now binding on the people of this state without having had the privilege of deliberating upon it but sir no state is     bound by it as it is without its own consent should all the states adopt it it will be then a government established by the thirteen states of america not through the intervention of the legislatures but by the people at large in this particular respect the distinction between the existing and proposed governments is very material the existing system has been derived from the dependent derivative authority of the legislatures of the states whereas this is derived from the superior power of the people if we look at the manner in which alterations are to be made in it the same idea is in some degree attended to by the new system a majority of the states cannot introduce amendments nor are all the states required for that purpose threefourths of them must concur in alterations in this there is a departure from the federal idea the members to the national house of representatives are to be chosen by the people at large in proportion to the numbers in the respective districts when we come to the senate its members are elected by the states in their equal and political capacity but had the government been completely consolidated the senate would have been chosen by the people in their individual capacity in the same manner as the members of the other house thus it is of a complicated nature and this complication i trust will be found to exclude the evils of absolute consolidation as well as of a mere confederacy if virginia was separated from all the states her power and authority would extend to all cases in like manner were all powers vested in the general government it would be a consolidated government but the powers of the federal government are enumerated it can only operate in certain cases it has legislative powers on defined and limited objects beyond which it cannot extend its jurisdiction but the honorable member has satirised with peculiar acrimony the powers given to the general government by this constitution i conceive that the first question on this subject is whether these powers be necessary if they be we are reduced to the dilemma of either submitting to the inconvenience     or losing the union let us consider the most important of these reprobated powers that of direct taxation is most generally obejcted to with respect to the exigencies of government there is no question but the most easy mode of providing for them will be adopted when therefore direct taxes are not necessary they will not be recurred to it can be of little advantage to those in power to raise money in a manner oppressive to the people to consult the conveniences of the people will cost them nothing and in many respects will be advantageous to them direct taxes will only be recurred to for great purposes what has brought on other nations those immense debts under the pressure of which many of them labor not the expenses of their governments but war if this country should be engaged in war and i conceive we ought to provide for the possibility of such a case how would it be carried on by the usual means provided from year to year as our imports will be necessary for the expenses of government and other common exigencies how are we to carry on the means of defence how is it possible a war could be supported without money or credit and would it be possible for a government to have credit without having the power of raising money no it would be impossible for any government in such a case to defend itself then i say sir that it is necessary to establish funds for extraordinary exigencies and give this power to the general government—for the utter inutility of previous requisitions on the states is too well known would it be possible for those countries whose finances and revenues are carried to the highest perfection to carry on the operations of government on great emergencies such as the maintenance of a war without an uncontrolled power of raising money has it not been necessary for great britain notwithstanding the facility of the collection of her taxes to have recourse very often to this and other extraordinary methods of procuring money would not her public credit have been ruined if it was known that her power to raise money was limited has not france     been obliged on great occasions to use unusual means to raise funds it has been the case in many countries and no government can exist unless its powers extend to make provisions for every contingency if we were actually attacked by a powerful nation and our general government had not the power of raising money but depended solely on requisitions our condition would be truly deplorable—if the revenue of this commonwealth were to depend on twenty distinct authorities it would be impossible for it to carry on its operations this must be obvious to every member here i think therefore that it is necessary for the preservation of the union that this power shall be given to the general government but it is urged that its consolidated nature joined to the power of direct taxation will give it a tendency to destroy all subordinate authority that its increasing influence will speedily enable it to absorb the state governments i cannot think this will be the case if the general government were wholly independent of the governments of the particular states then indeed usurpation might be expected to the fullest extent but sir on whom does this general government depend it derives its authority from these governments and from the same sources from which their authority is derived the members of the federal government are taken from the same men from whom those of the state legislatures are taken if we consider the mode in which the federal representatives will be chosen we shall be convinced that the general will never destroy the individual governments and this convicion must be strengthened by an attention to the construction of the senate the representatives will be chosen probably under the influence of the members of the state legislatures but there is not the least probability that the election of the latter will be influenced by the former one hundred and sixty members represent this commonwealth in one branch of the legislature are drawn from the people at large and must ever possess more influence than the few men who will be elected to the general legislature     the reasons offered on this subject by a gentleman on the same side mr nicholas were unanswerable and have been so full that i shall add but little more on the subject those who wish to become federal representatives must depend on their credit with that class of men who will be the most popular in their counties who generally represent the people in the state governments they can therefore never succeed in any measure contrary to the wishes of those on whom they depend it is almost certain therefore that the deliberations of the members of the federal house of representatives will be directed to the interest of the people of america as to the other branch the senators will be appointed by the legislatures and though elected for six years i do not conceive they will so soon forget the source from whence they derive their political existence this election of one branch of the federal by the state legislatures secures an absolute dependence of the former on the latter the biennial exclusion of one third will lessen the facility of a combination and may put a stop to intrigues i appeal to our past experience whether they will attend to the interests of their constituent states have not those gentlemen who have been honored with seats in congress often signalized themselves by their attachment to their seats i wish this government may answer the expectation of its friends and foil the apprehension of its enemies i hope the patriotism of the people will continue and be a sufficient guard to their liberties i believe its tendency will be that the state governments will counteract the general interest and ultimately prevail the number of the representatives is yet sufficient for our safety and will gradually increase—and if we consider their different sources of information the number will not appear too small june  —power to lay taxes mr madison—mr chairman in considering this great subject i trust we shall find that part which gives the general     government the power of laying and collecting taxes indispensable and essential to the existence of any efficient or well organized system of government if we consult reason and be ruled by its dictates we shall find its justification there if we review the experience we have had or contemplate the history of nations here we find ample reasons to prove its expediency there is little reason to depend for necessary supplies on a body which is fully possessed of the power of withholding them if a government depends on other governments for its revenues if it must depend on the voluntary contributions of its members its existence must be precarious a government which relies on thirteen independent sovereignties for the means of its existence is a solecism in theory and a mere nullity in practice is it consistent with reason that such a government can promote the happiness of any people it is subversive of every principle of sound policy to trust the safety of a community with a government totally destitute of the means of protecting itself or its members can congress after the repeated unequivocal proofs it has experienced of the utter inutility and inefficacy of requisitions reasonably expect that they would be hereafter effectual or productive will not the same local interests and other causes militate against a compliance whoever hopes the contrary must ever be disappointed the effect sir cannot be changed without a removal of the cause let each county in this commonwealth be supposed free and independent let your revenues depend on requisitions of proportionate quotas from them let application be made to them repeatedly is it to be presumed that they would comply or that an adequate collection could be made from partial compliances it is now difficult to collect the taxes from them how much would that difficulty be enhanced were you to depend solely on their generosity i appeal to reason or every gentleman here whether he is not persuaded that the present confederation is as feeble as the government of virginia would be in that case to the same reason i appeal whether it be incompatible     with prudence to continue a government of such manifest and palpable debility if we recur to history and review the annals of mankind i undertake to say that no instance can be produced by the most learned man of any confederate government that will justify a continuation of the present system or that will not demonstrate the necessity of this change and of substituting to the present pernicious and fatal plan the system now under consideration or one equally energetic the uniform conclusion drawn from a review of ancient and modern confederacies is that instead of promoting the public happiness or securing public tranquility they have in every instance been productive of anarchy and confusion ineffectual for the preservation of harmony and a prey to their own dissentions and foreign invasions the amphyctionic league resembled our confederation in its nominal powers it was possessed of rather more power the component states retained their sovereignty and enjoyed an equality of suffrage in the federal council but though its powers were more considerable in many respects than those of our present system yet it had the same radical defect its powers were exercised over its individual members in their political capacities to this capital defect it owed its disorders and final destruction it was compelled to recur to the sanguinary coercion of war to enforce its decrees—the struggles consequent on a refusal to obey a decree and an attempt to enforce it produced the necessity of applying to foreign assistance by complying with such an application together with his intrigues philip of macedon acquired sufficient influence to become a member of the league this artful and insidious prince soon after became master of their liberties the achean league though better constructed than the amphyctionic in material respects was continually agitated with domestic dissentions and driven to the necessity of calling in foreign aid this also eventuated in the demolition   0 of their confederacy had they been more closely united their people would have been happier and their united wisdom and strength would not only have rendered unnecessary all sovereign interpositions in their affairs but would have enabled them to repel the attack of an enemy if we descend to more modern examples we shall find the same evils resulting from the same sources the germanic system is neither adequate to the external defence nor internal felicity of the people the doctrine of quotas and requisitions flourishes here without energy—without stability—the empire is a nerveless body the most furious conflicts and the most implacable animosities between its members strikingly distinguish its history concert and cooperation are incompatible with such an injudiciously constructed system the republic of the swiss is sometimes instanced for its stability but even there dissentions and wars of a bloody nature have been frequently seen between the cantons a peculiar coincidence of circumstances contributes to the continuance of their political connection their feeble association owes its existence to their singular situation there is a schism this moment in their confederacy which without the necessity of uniting for their external defence would immediately produce its dissolution the confederate government of holland is a further confirmation of the characteristic imbecility of such governments from the history of this government we might derive lessons of the most important utility here mr madison quoted sundry passages from de witt respecting the people of holland and the war which they had so long supported against the spanish monarch shewing the impolitic and injudicious structure of their confederacy that it was entirely destitute of energy because their revenues depended chiefly on requisitions that during that long war the provinces of guelderland and overyssel had not paid their respective quotas but had evaded altogether their payments     in consequence of which two sevenths of the resources of the community had never been brought into action nor contributed in the least toward the prosecution of the war that the fear of pressing danger stimulated holland and the other provinces to pay all the charges of the war that those two provinces had continued their delinquences that the province of holland alone paid more than all the rest still those provinces who paid up their proportional shares claimed from the failing states the amounts of their arrearages that the most fatal consequences had nearly resulted from the difficulty of adjusting those claims and from the extreme aversion of the delinquent states to discharge even their most solemn engagements that there are existing controversies between the provinces on this account at present and to add to the evils consequent upon requisitions that unanimity and the revision and sanction of their constituents were necessary to give validity to the decisions of the states general mr madison then added—that these radical defects in their confederacy must have dissolved their association long ago were it not for their peculiar position—circumscribed in a narrow territory surrounded by the most powerful nations in the world possessing peculiar advantages from their situation an extensive navigation and a powerful navy—advantages which it was clearly the interest of those nations to diminish or deprive them of and that their late unhappy dissentions were manifestly produced by the vices of their system he then continued—we may derive much benefit from the experience of that unhappy country governments destitute of energy will ever produce anarchy these facts are worthy the most serious consideration of every gentleman here does not the history of these confederacies coincide with the lesson drawn from our own experience i most earnestly pray that america may have sufficient wisdom to avail herself of the instructive information she may derive from a contemplation of the sources of their misfortunes and that she may escape a similar fate by avoiding the causes from which their infelicity     sprung if the general government is to depend on the voluntary contribution of the states for its support dismemberment of the united states may be the consequence in cases of eminent danger the states more immediately exposed to it would only exert themselves—those remote from it would be too supine to interest themselves warmly in the fate of those whose distresses they did not immediately perceive the general government ought therefore to be empowered to defend the whole union must we not suppose that those parts of america which are most exposed will first be the scenes of war those nations whose interest is incompatible with an extension of our power and who are jealous of our resources to become powerful and wealthy must naturally be inclined to exert every means to prevent our becoming formidable will they not be impelled to attack the most exposed parts of the union will not their knowledge of the weakness of our government stimulate them the more readily to such an attack those parts to which relief can be afforded with most difficulty are the extremities of the country and will be the first objects of our enemies the general government having no resources beyond what are adequate to its existing necessities will not be able to afford any effectual succor to those parts which may be invaded america in such a case would palpably perceive the danger and folly of withholding from the union a power sufficient to protect the whole territory of the united states such an attack is far from improbable and if it be actually made it is difficult to conceive a possibility of escaping the catastrophe of a dismemberment on this subject we may receive an estimable and instructive lesson from an american confederacy from an example which has happened in our country and which applies to us with peculiar force being most analogous to our situation i mean that species of association or union which subsisted in new england the colonies of massachusetts bristol connecticut and new hampshire were confederated together     the object of that confederacy was primarily to defend themselves against the inroads and depredations of the indians they had a common council consisting of deputies from each party with an equality of suffrage in their deliberations the general expenditures and charges were to be adequately defrayed its powers were very similar to those of the confederation its history proves clearly that a government founded on such principles must ever disappoint the hopes of those who expect its operation to be conducive to the public happiness there are facts on record to prove that instead of answering the end of its institution or the expectation of its framers it was violated with impunity and only regarded when it coincided perfectly with the views and immediate interests of their respective parties the strongest member of the union availed itself of its circumstances to infringe their confederacy massachusetts refused to pay its quotas in the war between england and holland it was found particularly necessary to make exertions for the protection of that country massachusetts being then more powerful and less exposed than the other colonies refused its contributions to the general defence in consequence of this the common council remonstrated against the council of massachusetts this altercation terminated in the dissolution of their union from this brief account of a system perfectly resembling our present one we may easily divine the inevitable consequences of a longer adherence to the latter mr madison then recapitulated many instances of the prevalent persuasion of the wisest patriots of the states that the safety of all america depended on union and that the government of the u states must be possessed of an adequate degree of energy or that otherwise their connection could not be justly denominated an union he likewise enumerated the expedients that had been attempted by the people of america to form an intimate association from the meeting at new york     in the year      downwards that their sentiments on this subject had been uniform both in their colonial and independent conditions and that a variety of courses had hitherto prevented the adoption of an adequate system he then continued thus—if we take experience for our guide we shall find still more instructive direction on this subject the weakness of the existing articles of the union shewed itself during the war it has manifested itself since the peace to such a degree as admits of no doubt to a rational intelligent and unbiassed mind of the necessity of alteration—nay this necessity is obvious to all america—it has forced itself on the minds of the people the committee has been informed that the confederation was not completed till the year      when a great portion of the war was ended consequently no part of the merit of the antecedent operations of the war could justly be attributed to that system its debility was perceived almost as soon as it was put in operation a recapitulation of the proofs which have been experienced of its inefficacy is necessary it is most notorious that feebleness universally marked its character shall we be safe in another war in the same situation that instrument required the voluntary contributions of the states and thereby sacrificed some of our best privileges the most intolerable and unwarrantable oppressions were committed on the people during the late war the gross enormity of those oppressions might have produced the most serious consequences were it not for the spirit of liberty which preponderated against every consideration a scene of injustice partiality and oppression may bring heavenly vengeance on any people we are now by our suffering expiating the crimes of the otherwise glorious revolution is it not known to every member of this committee that the great principles of a free government were reversed through the whole progress of that scene was not every state harrassed was not every individual oppressed and subjected to repeated distresses was this right was it a     proper form of government that warranted authorized or overlooked the most wanton deprivation of property had the government been vested with complete power to procure a regular and adequate supply of revenue those oppressive measures would have been unnecessary but sir can it be supposed that a repetition of such measures would ever be acquiesced in can a government that stands in need of such measures secure the liberty or promote the happiness or glory of any country if we do not change this system consequences must ensue that gentlemen do not now apprehend if other testimony were necessary i might appeal to that which i am sure is very weighty but which i mention with reluctance at the conclusion of the war the man who had the most extensive acquaintance with the nature of the country who well understood its interests and who had given the most unequivocal and most brilliant proofs of his attachment to its welfare—when he laid down his arms wherewith he had so nobly and successfully defended his country publicly testified his disapprobation of the present system and suggested that some alteration was necessary to render it adequate to the security of our happiness i did not introduce that great name to bias any gentleman here much as i admire and revere the man i consider these members as not to be actuated by the influence of any man but i introduced him as a respectable witness to prove that the articles of the confederation were inadequate and that we must resort to something else his modesty did not point out what ought to be done but said that some great change was necessary but sir testimony if wished for may be found in abundance and numerous conclusive reasons urged for this change experience was daily producing such irresistible proofs of the defects of this system this commonwealth was induced to exert her influence to meliorate it she began that noble work in which i hope she will persist she proposed to revise it—her proposition met with that concurrence which that of a respectable party will always meet i am sure if demonstration     were necessary on the part of this commonwealth reasons have been abundantly heard in the course of this debate manifold and cogent enough not only to operate conviction but to disgust an attentive hearer recollect the resolution of the year      it was then found that the whole burthen of the union was sustained by a few states this state was likely to be saddled with a very disproportionate share that expedient was proposed to obviate this inconvenience which has been placed in its true light it has been painted in sufficient horrors by the honorable gentleman who spoke last i agree with the honorable gentleman mr henry that national splendour and glory are not our objects—but does he distinguish between what will render us secure and happy at home and what will render us respectable abroad if we be free and happy at home we shall be respectable abroad the confederation is so notoriously feeble that foreign nations are unwilling to form any treaties with us—they are apprised that our general government cannot perform any of its engagements but that they may be violated at pleasure by any of the states our violation of treaties already entered into proves this truth unequivocally no nation will therefore make any stipulations with congress conceding any advantages of importance to us they will be the more averse to entering into engagements with us as the imbecility of our government enables them to derive many advantages from our trade without granting us any return but were this country united by proper bands in addition to other great advantages we could form very beneficial treaties with foreign states but this can never happen without a change in our system were we not laughed at by the minister of that nation from which we may be able yet to extort some of the most salutary measures for this country were we not told that it was necessary to temporize till our government acquired consistency will any nation relinquish national advantages to us you will be greatly disappointed if you     expect any such good effects from this contemptible system let us recollect our conduct to that country from which we have received the most friendly aid how have we dealt with that benevolent ally have we complied with our most sacred obligations to that nation have we paid the interest punctually from year to year is not the interest accumulating while not a shilling is discharged of the principal the magnanimity and forbearance of that ally are so great that she has not called upon us for her claims even in her own distress and necessity this sir is an additional motive to increase our exertions at this moment of time a very considerable amount is due from us to that country and others here mr madison mentioned the amount of the debts due to different foreign nations we have been obliged to borrow money even to pay the interest of our debts this is a ruinous and most disgraceful expedient is this a situation on which america can rely for security and happiness how are we to extricate ourselves the honorable member told us we might rely on the punctuality and friendship of the states and that they will discharge their quotas for the future the contributions of the states have been found inadequate from the beginning and are diminishing instead of increasing from the month of june      till june      they have only paid        dollars into the federal treasury for the purposes of supporting the national government and discharging the interest of the national debts a sum so very insufficient that it must greatly alarm the friends of their country suggestions and strong assertions dissipate before these facts i shall no longer fatigue the committee at this time but will resume the subject as early as i can     june   —power to lay taxes  mr madison— mr chairman it was my purpose to resume before now what i had left unfinished concerning the necessity of a radical change of our system the intermission which has taken place discontinued the progress of the argument and has given opportunity to others to advance arguments on different parts of the plan i hope we shall steer our course in a different manner from what we have hitherto done i presume that vague discourses and mere sports of fancy not relative to the subject at all are very improper on this interesting occasion i hope these will be no longer attempted but that we shall come to the point i trust we shall not go out of order but confine ourselves to the clause under consideration i beg gentlemen would observe this rule i shall endeavor not to depart from it myself the subject of direct taxation is perhaps one of the most     important that can possibly engage our attention or that can be involved in the discussion of this question if it be to be judged by the comments made upon it by the opposers and favorers of the proposed system it requires a most clear and critical investigation the objections against the exercise of this power by the general government as far as i am able to comprehend them are founded upon the supposition of its being unnecessary impracticable unsafe and accumulative of expense i shall therefore consider  st how far it may be necessary  d how far it may be practicable  dly how far it may be safe as well with respect to the public liberty at large as to the state legislatures and  thly with respect to economy first then is it necessary i must acknowledge that i concur in opinion with those gentlemen who told you that this branch of revenue was essential to the salvation of the union it appears to me necessary in order to secure that punctuality which is necessary in revenue matters without punctuality individuals will give it no confidence without which it cannot get resources i beg gentlemen to consider the situation of this country if unhappily the government were to be deprived of this power let us suppose for a   0 moment that one of those powers which may be unfriendly to us should take advantage of our weakness which they will be more ready to do when they know the want of this resource in our government suppose it should attack us what forces could we oppose to it could we find safety in such forces as we could call out could we call forth a sufficient number either by draughts or any other way to repel a powerful enemy the inability of the government to raise and support regular troops would compel us to depend on militia it would be then necessary to give this power to the government or run the risk of national annihilation it is my firm belief that if a hostile attack were made this moment on the united states it would flash conviction on the minds of the citizens of the united states of the necessity of vesting the government with this power which alone can enable it to protect the community i do not wish to frighten the members into a concession of this power but to bring to their minds those considerations which demonstrate its necessity if we were secured from the possibility or probability of danger it might be unnecessary i shall not review that concourse of dangers which may probably arise at remote periods of futurity nor all those which we have immediately to apprehend for this would lead me beyond the bounds which i prescribed myself but i will mention one single consideration drawn from fact itself i hope to have your attention by the treaty between the united states and his most christian majesty among other things it is stipulated that the great principle on which the armed neutrality in europe was founded should prevail in case of future wars the principle is this that free ships shall make free goods and that vessels and goods shall be both free from condemnation great britain did not recognize it while all europe was against her she held out without acting to it it has been considered for sometime past that the flames of war already kindled would spread and that france and england were likely to draw those swords which were so recently put up     this is judged probable we should not be surprised in a short time to consider ourselves as a neuteral nation—france on one side and great britain on the other what is the situation of america she is remote from europe and ought not to engage in her politics or wars the american vessels if they can do it with advantage may carry on the commerce of the contending nations it is a source of wealth which we ought not to deny to our citizens but sir is there not infinite danger that in despite of all our caution we shall be drawn into the war if american vessels have french property on board great britain will seize them by this means we shall be obliged to relinquish the advantage of a neutral nation or be engaged in a war a neutral nation ought to be respectable or else it will be insulted and attacked america in her present impotent situation would run the risk of being drawn in as a party in the war and lose the advantage of being neutral should it happen that the british fleet should be superior have we not reason to conclude from the spirit displayed by that nation to us and to all the world that we should be insulted in our own ports and our vessels seized but if we be in a respectable situation—if it be known that our government can command the whole resources of the union we shall be suffered to enjoy the great advantages of carrying on the commerce of the nations at war for none of them would be willing to add us to the number of their enemies i shall say no more on this point there being others which merit your consideration the expedient proposed by the gentlemen opposed to this clause is that requisitions shall be made and if not complied with in a certain time that then taxation shall be recurred to i am clearly convinced that whenever requisitions shall be made they will disappoint those who put their trust in them one reason to prevent the concurrent exertions of all the states will arise from the suspicion in some states of delinquency in others states will be governed by the motives that actuate individuals     when a tax is in operation in a particular state every citizen if he knows of the energy of the laws to enforce payment and that every other citizen is performing his duty will cheerfully discharge his duty but were it known that the citizens of one district were not performing their duty and that it was left to the policy of the government to make them come up with it the other districts would be very supine and careless in making provisions for payment our own experience makes the illustration more natural if requisitions be made on thirteen different states when one deliberates on the subject she will know that all the rest will deliberate upon it also this sir has been a principal cause of the inefficacy of requisitions heretofore and will hereafter produce the same evil if the legislatures are to deliberate on this subject and the honorable gentleman opposed to this clause thinks their deliberation necessary is it not presumable that they will consider peculiar local circumstances in the general council on the contrary the sense of all america would be drawn to a single point the collective interest of the union at large will be known and pursued no local views will be permitted to operate against the general welfare but when propositions would come before a particular state there is every reason to believe that qualifications of the requisitions would be proposed—compliance might be promised and some instant remittances might be made this will cause delays which in the first instance will produce disappointment this also will make failures every where else this i hope will be considered with the attention it deserves the public creditors will be disappointed and more pressing requisitions will be made for purposes equally pervading all america but the exertions to make compliances will probably be not uniform in the states if requisitions be made for future occasions for putting the states in a state of military defence or to repel an invasion will the exertions be uniform and equal in all the states some parts of the united states are more exposed than others will the least exposed states exert     themselves equally we know that the most exposed will be more immediately interested and will make less sacrifices in making exertions i beg gentlemen to consider that this argument will apply with most effect to the states which are most defenceless and exposed the southern states are most exposed whether we consider their situation or the smallness of their population and there are other circumstances which render them still more vulnerable which do not apply to the northern states they are therefore more interested in giving the government a power to command the whole strength of the union in cases of emergency do not gentlemen conceive this mode of obtaining supplies from the states will keep alive animosities between the general government and particular states where the chances of failures are so numerous as thirteen by the thirteen states disappointment in the first place and consequent animosity must inevitably take place let us consider the alternatives proposed by gentlemen instead of the power of laying direct taxes after the states shall have refused to comply weigh the consequences of the exercise of this power by congress when it comes in the form of a punishment great clamours will be raised among the people against the government hatred will be excited against it it will be considered as an ignominious stigma on the state it will be considered at least in this light by the state where the failure is made and these sentiments will no doubt be diffused through the other states now let us consider the effect if collectors are sent where the state governments refuse to comply with requisitions it is too much the disposition of mankind not to stop at one violation of duty i conceive that every requisition that will be made on my part of america will kindle a contention between the delinquent member and the general government is there no reason to suppose divisions in the government for seldom does any thing pass with unanimity on the subject of requisitions the parts least exposed will oppose those measures which may be adopted for the defence of the weakest parts is there no reason to     presume that the representatives from the delinquent state will be more likely to foster disobedience to the requisitions of the government than study to recommend them to the public there is in my opinion another point of view in which this alternative will produce great evil i will suppose what is very probable that partial compliances will be made a difficulty here arises which fully demonstrates its impolicy if a part be paid and the rest withheld how is the general government to proceed they are to impose a tax but how shall it be done in this case are they to impose it by way of punishment on those who have paid as well as those who have not all these considerations taken into view for they are not visionary or fanciful speculations will perhaps produce this consequence the general government to avoid those disappointments which i first described and to avoid the contentions and embarrassments which i last described will in all probability throw the public burdens on those branches of revenue which will be more in their power they will be continually necessitated to augment the imposts if we throw a disproportion of the burdens on that side shall we not discourage commerce and suffer many political evils shall we not increase that disproportion on the southern states which for sometime will operate against us the southern states from having fewer manufactures will import and consume more they will therefore pay more of the imposts the more commerce is burdened the more the disproportion will operate against them if direct taxation be mixed with other taxes it will be in the power of the general government to lessen that inequality but this inequality will be increased to the utmost extent if the general government have not this power there is another point of view in which this subject affords us instruction the imports will decrease in time of war the honorable gentleman who spoke yesterday said that the imposts would be so productive that there would be no occasion of laying taxes i will submit two observations to     him and the committee first in time of war the imposts will be less and as i hope we are considering a government for a perpetual duration we ought to provide for every future contingency at present our importations bear a full proportion to the full amount of our sales and to the number of our inhabitants but when we have inhabitants enough our imposts will decrease and as the national demands will increase with our population our resources will increase as our wants increase the other consideration which i will submit on this part of the subject is this—i believe that it will be found in practice that those who fix the public burdens will feel a greater degree of responsibility when they are to impose them on the citizens immediately than if they were to say what sum should be paid by the states if they exceed the limits of propriety universal discontent and clamour will arise let us suppose they were to collect the taxes from the citizens of america—would they not consider their circumstances would they not attentively consider what could be done by the citizens at large were they to exceed in their demands what were reasonable burdens the people would impute it to the right source and look on the imposers as odious when i consider the nature of the various objections brought against this clause i should be led to think that the difficulties were such that gentlemen would not be able to get over them and that the power as defined in the plan of the convention was impracticable i shall trouble them with a few observations on that point it has been said that ten men deputed from this state and others in proportion from other states will not be able to adjust direct taxes so as to accommodate the various citizens in thirteen states i confess i do not see the force of this observation could not ten intelligent men chosen from ten districts from this state lay direct taxes on a few objects in the most judicious manner it is to be conceived that they would be acquainted with the situation of different citizens of this country can any one     divide this state into ten districts so as not to contain men of sufficient information could not one man of knowledge be found in a district when thus selected will they not be able to carry their knowledge into the general council i may say with great propriety that the experience of our own legislature demonstrates the competency of congress to lay taxes wisely our assembly consists of considerably more than a hundred yet from the nature of the business it devolves on a much smaller number it is through their sanction approved of by all the others it will be found that there are seldom more than ten men who rise to high information on this subject our federal representatives as has been said by the gentleman mr marshall who entered into the subject with a great deal of ability will get information from the state governments they will be perfectly well informed of the circumstances of the people of the different states and the mode of taxation that would be most convenient for them from the laws of the states in laying taxes they may even refer to the state system of taxation let it not be forgotten that there is a probability that that ignorance which is complained of in some parts of america will be continually diminishing let us compare the degree of knowledge which the people had in time past to their present information does not our own experience teach us that the people are better informed than they were a few years ago the citizen of georgia knows more now of the affairs of new hampshire than he did before the revolution of those of south carolina when the representatives from the different states are collected together to consider this subject they will interchange their knowledge with one another and will have the laws of each state on the table besides this the intercourse of the states will be continually increasing it is now much greater than before the revolution my honorable friend over the way mr monroe yesterday seemed to conceive as an insuperable objection that if land were made the particular object of taxation it would be unjust as it would exonerate     the commercial part of the community—that if it were laid on trade it would be unjust in discharging the landholders and that any exclusive selection would be unequal and unfair if the general government were tied down to one object i confess the objection would have some force in it but if this be not the case it can have no weight if it should have a general power of taxation they could select the most proper objects and distribute the taxes in such a manner as that they should fall in a due degree on every member of the community they will be limited to fix the proportion of each state and they must raise it in the most convenient and satisfactory manner to the public the honorable member considered it as another insuperable objection that uniform laws could not be made for thirteen states and that dissonance would produce inconvenience and oppression perhaps it may not be found on due enquiry to be so impracticable as he supposes but were it so where is the evil of different states to raise money for the general government where is the evil of such laws there are instances in other countries of different laws operating in different parts of the country without producing any kind of opposition the revenue laws are different in england and scotland in several respects their laws relating to customs excises and trade are similar but those respecting direct taxation are dissimilar there is a land tax in england and a land tax in scotland but the laws concerning them are not the same it is much heavier in proportion in the former than in the latter the mode of collection is different—yet this is not productive of any national inconvenience were we to conclude from the objections against the proposed plan this dissimilarity in that point alone would have involved those kingdoms in difficulties in england itself there is a variety of different laws operating differently in different places i will make another observation on the objection of my honorable friend he seemed to conclude that concurrent collections under different authorities were not reducible     to practice i agree that were they independent of the people the argument would be good but they must serve one common master they must act in concert or the defaulting party must bring on itself the resentment of the people if the general government be so constructed that it will not dare to impose such burdens as will distress the people where is the evil of its having a power of taxation concurrent with the states the people would not support it were it to impose oppressive burdens let me make one more comparison of the state governments to this plan do not the states impose taxes for local purposes does the concurrent collection of taxes imposed by the legislatures for general purposes and of levies laid by the counties for parochial and county purposes produce any inconvenience or oppression the collection of these taxes is perfectly practicable and consistent with the views of both parties the people at large are the common superior of the state governments and the general government it is reasonable to conclude that they will avoid interferences for two causes—to avoid public oppression and to render the collections more productive i conceive they will be more likely to produce disputes in rendering it convenient for the people than run into interfering regulations in the third place i shall consider whether the power of taxation to be given the general government be safe and first whether it be safe as to the public liberty in general it would be sufficient to remark that they are because i conceive the point has been clearly established by more than one gentleman who has spoken on the same side of the question in the decision of this question it is of importance to examine whether elections of representatives by great districts of freeholders be favorable to fidelity in representatives the greatest degree of treachery in representatives is to be apprehended where they are chosen by the least number of electors because there is a greater facility of using undue influence and because the electors must be less independent this position     is verified in the most unanswerable manner in that country to which appeals are so often made and sometimes instructively who are the most corrupt members in parliament are they not the inhabitants of small towns and districts the supporters of liberty are from the great counties have we not seen that the representatives of the city of london who are chosen by such thousands of voters have continually studied and supported the liberties of the people and opposed the corruption of the crown we have seen continually that most of the members in the ministerial majority are drawn from small circumscribed districts we may therefore conclude that our representatives being chosen by such extensive districts will be upright and independent in proportion as we have security against corruption in representatives we have security against corruption from every other quarter whatsoever i shall take a view of certain subjects which will lead to some reflections to quiet the minds of those gentlemen who think that the individual governments will be swallowed up by the general government in order to effect this it is proper to compare the state governments to the general government with respect to reciprocal dependence and with respect to the means they have of supporting themselves or of encroaching on one another at the first comparison we must be struck with these remarkable facts the general government has not the appointment of a single branch of the individual governments or of any officers within the states to execute their laws are not the states integral parts of the general government is not the president chosen under the influence of the state legislatures may we not suppose that he will be complaisant to those from whom he has his appointment and from whom he must have his reappointment the senators are appointed altogether by the legislatures my honorable friend apprehended a coalition between the president senate and house of representatives against the   0 states this could be supposed only from a similarity of the component parts a coalition is not likely to take place because its component parts are heterogeneous in their nature the house of representatives is not chosen by the state governments but under the influence of those who compose the state legislature let us suppose ten men appointed to carry the government into effect there is every degree of certainty that they would be indebted for their reelection to the members of the legislatures if they derive their appointment from them will they not execute their duty to them besides this will not the people whose predominant interest will ultimately prevail feel great attachment to the state legislatures they have the care of all local interests—those familiar domestic objects for which men have the strongest predilection the general government on the contrary has the preservation of the aggregate interest of the union—objects which being less familiar and more remote from mens notice have a less powerful influence on their minds do we not see great and natural attachments arising from local considerations this will be the case in a much stronger degree in the state governments than in the general government the people will be attached to their state legislatures from a thousand causes and into whatever scale the people at large will throw themselves that scale will preponderate did we not perceive in the early stages of the war when congress was the idol of america and when in pursuit of the object most dear to america that they were attached to their states afterwards the whole current of their affection was to the states and would be still the case were it not for the alarming situation of america at one period of the congressional history they had the power to trample on the states when they had that fund of paper money in their hands and could carry on all their measures without any dependence on the states was there any disposition to debase the state governments all that     municipal authority which was necessary to carry on the administration of the government they still retained unimpaired there was no attempt to diminish it i am led by what fell from my honorable friend yesterday to take this supposed combination in another view is it supposed that the influence of the general government will facilitate a combination between the members is it supposed that it will preponderate against that of the state governments the means of influence consist in having the disposal of gifts and emoluments and in the number of persons employed by and dependent upon a government will any gentleman compare the number of persons which will be employed in the general government with the number of those which will be in the state governments the number of dependants upon the state governments will be infinitely greater than those on the general government i may say with truth that there never was a more economical government in any age or country nor which will require fewer hands or give less influence let us compare the members composing the legislative executive and judicial powers in the general government with these in the states and let us take into view the vast number of persons employed in the states from the chief officers to the lowest we will find the scale preponderating so much in favor of the states that while so many persons are attached to them it will be impossible to turn the balance against them there will be an irresistible bias towards the state governments consider the number of militia officers the number of justices of the peace the number of the members of the legislatures and all the various officers for districts towns and corporations all intermixing with and residing among the people at large while this part of the community retains their affection to the state governments i conceive that the fact will be that the state governments and not the general government will preponderate it cannot be contradicted that they have     more extensive means of influence i have my fears as well as the honorable gentleman—but my fears are on the other side experience i think will prove though there be no infallible proof of it here that the powerful and prevailing influence of the states will produce such attention to local considerations as will be inconsistent with the advancement of the interest of the union but i choose rather to indulge my hopes than fears because i flatter myself if inconveniences should result from it that the clause which provides amendments will remedy them the combination of powers vested in those persons would seem conclusive in favor of the states the powers of the general government relate to external objects and are but few but the powers in the states relate to those great objects which immediately concern the prosperity of the people let us observe also that the powers in the general government are those which will be exercised mostly in time of war while those of the state governments will be exercised in time of peace but i hope the time of war will be little compared to that of peace i should not complete the view which ought to be taken of this subject without making this additional remark that the powers vested in the proposed government are not so much an augmentation of powers in the general government as a change rendered necessary for the purpose of giving efficacy to those which were vested in it before it cannot escape any gentleman that this power in theory exists in the confederation as fully as in this constitution the only difference is this that now they tax states and by this plan they will tax individuals there is no theoretic difference between the two but in practice there will be an infinite difference between them the one is an ineffectual power the other is adequate to the purpose for which it is given this change was necessary for the public safety let us suppose for a moment that the acts of congress requiring money from the states had been as effectual as the     paper on the table—suppose all the laws of congress had complete compliance will any gentleman say that as far as we can judge from past experience the state governments would have been debased and all consolidated and incorporated in one system my imagination cannot reach it i conceive that had those acts that effect which all laws ought to have the states would have retained their sovereignty it seems to be supposed that it will introduce new expenses and burdens on the people i believe it is not necessary here to make a comparison between the expenses of the present and of the proposed government all agree that the general government ought to have power for the regulation of commerce i will venture to say that very great improvements and very economical regulations will be made it will be a principal object to guard against smuggling and such other attacks on the revenue as other nations are subject to we are now obliged to defend against those lawless attempts but from the interfering regulations of different states with little success there are regulations in different states which are unfavorable to the inhabitants of other states and which militate against the revenue new york levies money from new jersey by her imposts in new jersey instead of cooperating with new york the legislature favors violations on her regulations this will not be the case when uniform regulations will be made requisitions though ineffectual are unfriendly to economy when requisitions are submitted to the states there are near   00 or  000 persons deliberating on the mode of payment all these during their deliberation receive public pay a great proportion of every session in every state is employed to consider whether they will pay at all and in what mode let us suppose   00 persons are deliberating on this subject let any one make a calculation—it will be found that a very few days of their deliberation will consume more of the public money than one year of that general legislature this is not all mr chairman when general powers will be vested in     the general government there will be less of that mutability which is seen in the legislation of the states the eonsequence will be a great saving of expense and time there is another great advantage which i will but barely mention the greatest calamity to which the united states can be subject is a vicissitude of laws and continual shifting and changing from one object to another which must expose the people to various inconveniences this has a certain effect of which sagacious men always have and always will make an advantage from whom is advantage made from the industrious farmers and tradesmen who are ignorant of the means of making such advantages the people will not be exposed to these inconveniences under an uniform and steady course of legislation but they have been so heretofore the history of taxation of this country is so fully and well known to every member of this committee that i shall say no more of it we have hitherto discussed the subject very irregularly i dare not dictate to any gentleman but i hope we shall pursue that mode of going through the business which the house resolved with respect to a great variety of arguments made use of i mean to take notice of them when we come to those parts of the constitution to which they apply if we exchange this mode for the regular way of proceeding we can finish it better in one week than one month june   —power to lay taxes mr madison— mr chairman finding sir that the clause more immediately under consideration still meets with the disapprobation of the honorable gentleman over the way mr grayson and finding that the reasons of the opposition as farther developed are not satisfactory to myself and others who are in favor of the clause i wish that it may meet with the most thorough and complete investigation i beg the attention of the committee in order to obviate what fell from the honorable gentleman he set forth that by giving up the     power of taxation we should give up everything and still insist on requisitions being made on the states and then if they be not complied with congress shall lay direct taxes by way of penalty let us consider the dilemma which arises from this doctrine either requisitions will be efficacious or they will not if they will be efficacious then i say sir we gave up every thing as much as by direct taxation the same amount will be paid by the people as by direct taxes if they be not efficacious where is the advantage of this plan in what respect will it relieve us from the inconveniences which we have experienced from requisitions the power of laying direct taxes by the general government is supposed by the honorable gentleman to be chimerical and impracticable what is the consequence of the alternative he proposes we are to rely upon this power to be ultimately used as a penalty to compel the states to comply if it be chimerical and impracticable in the first instance it will be equally so when it will be exercised as a penalty a reference was made to concurrent executions as an instance of the possibility of interference between the two governments here mr madison spoke so low that he could not be distinctly heard this has been experienced under the state governments without involving any inconvenience but it may be answered that under the state governments concurrent executions cannot produce the inconvenience here dreaded because they are executed by the same officer it is not in the power of the general government to employ the state officers is nothing to be left to future legislation or must every thing be immutably fixed in the constitution where exclusive power is given to the union there can be no interference where the general and state legislatures have concurrent power such regulations will be made as shall be found necessary to exclude interferences and other inconveniences it will be their interest to make regulations it has been said that there is no similarity between petty     corporations and independent states i admit that in many points of view there is a great dissimilarity but in others there is a striking similarity between them which illustrates what is before us have we not seen in our own country as has been already suggested in the course of the debates concurrent collections of taxes going on at once without producing any inconvenience we have seen three distinct collections of taxes for three distinct purposes has it not been possible for collections of taxes for parochial county and state purposes to go on at the same time every gentleman must know that this is now the case and though there be a subordination in these cases which will not be in the general government yet in practice it has been found that these different collections have been concurrently carried on with convenience to the people without clashing with one another and without deriving their harmony from the circumstance of being subordinate to one legislative body the taxes will be laid for different purposes the members of the one government as well as of the other are the agents of and subordinate to the people i conceive that the collections of the taxes of the one will not impede those of the other and that there can be no interference this concurrent collection appears to me neither chimerical nor impracticable he compares resistance of the people to collectors to refusal of requisitions this goes against all government it is as much as to urge that there should be no legislature the gentlemen who favored us with their observations on this subject seemed to have reasoned on a supposition that the general government was confined by the paper on your table to lay general uniform taxes is it necessary that there should be a tax on any given article throughout the united states it is represented to be oppressive that the states who have slaves and make tobacco should pay taxes on these for federal wants when other states who have them not would escape but does the constitution on the table admit of this on the contrary there is a proportion to be laid on each state     according to its population the most proper articles will be selected in each state if one article in any state should be deficient it will be laid on another article our state is secured on this foundation its proportion will be commensurate to its population this is a constitutional scale which is an insuperable bar against disproportion and ought to satisfy all reasonable minds if the taxes be not uniform and the representatives of some states contribute to lay a tax of which they bear no proportion is not this principle reciprocal does not the same principle hold in our state government in some degree it has been found inconvenient to fix on uniform objects of taxation in this state as the back parts are not circumstanced like the lower parts of the country in both cases the reciprocity of the principle will prevent a disposition in one part to oppress the other my honorable friend seems to suppose that congress by the possession of this ultimate power as a penalty will have as much credit and will be as able to procure any sums on any emergency as if they were possessed of it in the first instance and that the votes of congress will be as competent to procure loans as the votes of the british commons would the votes of the british house of commons have that credit which they now have if they were liable to be retarded on their operation and perhaps rendered ultimately nugatory as those of congress must be by the proposed alternative when their vote passes it usually receives the concurrence of the other branch and it is known that there is sufficient energy in the government to carry it into effect but here the votes of congress are in the first place dependent on the compliance of thirteen different bodies and after noncompliance are liable to be opposed and defeated by the jealousy of the states against the exercise of this power and by the opposition of the people which may be expected if this power be exercised by congress after partial compliances these circumstances being known congress could not command one shilling my honorable friend seems to think that     we ought to spare the present generation and throw our burdens upon posterity i will not contest the equity of this reasoning but i must say that good policy as well as views of economy strongly urge us even to distress ourselves to comply with our most solemn engagements we must make effectual provision for the payment of the interest of our public debts in order to do justice to our creditors and support our credit and reputation we must lodge power some where or other for this purpose as yet the united states have not been able by any energy contained in the old system to accomplish this end our creditors have a right to demand the principal but would be satisfied with a punctual payment of the interest if we have been unable to pay the interest much less shall we be able to discharge the principal it appears to me that the whole reasoning used on this occasion shews that we ought to adopt this system to enable us to throw our burdens on posterity the honorable member spoke of the decemviri at rome as having some similitude to the ten representatives who are to be appointed by this state i can see no point of similitude here to enable us to draw any conclusion for what purpose were the decemviri appointed they were invested with a plenipotentiary commission to make a code of laws by whom were they appointed by the people at large my memory is not infallible but it tells me they were appointed by the senate i believe in the name of the people if they were appointed by the senate and composed of the most influential characters among the nobles can any thing be inferred from that against our federal representatives who made a discrimination between the nobles and the people the senate those men totally perverted the powers which were given them for the purpose above specified to the subversion of the public liberty can we suppose that a similar usurpation might be made by men appointed in a totally different manner as their circumstances were totally dissimilar i conceive that     no arguments drawn from that source can apply to this government i do not thoroughly comprehend the reasoning of my honorable friend when he tells us that the federal government will predominate and that the state interest will be lost when at the same time he tells us that it will be a faction of seven states if seven states will prevail as states i conceive that state influence will prevail if state influence under the present feeble government has prevailed i think that a remedy ought to be introduced by giving the general government power to suppress it he supposed that my argument with respect to a future war between great britain and france was fallacious the other nations of europe have acceded to that neutrality while great britain opposed it we need not expect in case of such a war that we should be suffered to participate in the profitable emoluments of the carrying trade unless we were in a respectable situation recollect the last war was there ever a war in which the british nation stood opposed to so many nations all the belligerent nations in europe with nearly one half of the british empire were united against it yet that nation though defeated and humbled beyond any previous example stood out against this from her firmness and spirit in such desperate circumstances we may divine what her future conduct may be i did not contend that it was necessary for the united states to establish a navy for that sole purpose but instanced it as one reason out of several for rendering ourselves respectable i am no friend to naval or land armaments in time of peace but if they be necessary the calamity must be submitted to weakness will invite insults a respectable government will not only entitle us to a participation of the advantages which are enjoyed by other nations but will be a security against attacks and insults it is to avoid the calamity of being obliged to have large armaments that we should establish this government the best way to avoid danger is to be in a capacity to withstand it   0 the impost we are told will not diminish because the emigrations to the westward will prevent the increase of population he has reasoned on this subject justly to a certain degree i admit that the imposts will increase till population becomes so great as to compel us to recur to manufactures the period cannot be very far distant when the unsettled parts of america will be inhabited at the expiration of twentyfive years hence i conceive that in every part of the united states there will be as great a population as there is now in the settled parts we see already that in the most populous parts of the union and where there is but a medium manufactures are beginning to be established where this is the case the amount of importation will begin to diminish although the impost may even increase during the term of twentyfive years yet when we are preparing a government for perpetuity we ought to found it on permanent principles and not on those of a temporary nature holland is a favorite quotation with honorable members on the other side of the question had not their sentiments been discovered by other circumstances i should have concluded from their reasonings on this occasion that they were friends of the constitution i should suppose that they had forgotten which side of the question they were on holland has been called a republic and a government friendly to liberty though it may be greatly superior to some other governments in europe still it is not a republic or a democracy their legislature consists in some degree of men who legislate for life their councils consist of men who hold their offices for life who fill up offices and appoint their salaries themselves the people have no agency mediate or immediate in the government if we look at their history we shall find that every mischief which has befallen them has resulted from the existing confederacy if the stadtholder has been productive of mischiefs—if we ought to guard against such a magistrate more than any evil let me beseech the honorable gentleman to take notice of what produced that and those troubles     which have interrupted their tranquillity from time to time the weakness of their confederacy produced both when the french arms were ready to overpower their republic and were feeble in the means of defence which was principally owing to the violence of parties they then appointed a stadtholder who sustained them if we look at more recent events we shall have a more pointed demonstration that their political infelicity arises from the imbecility of their government in the late disorders the states were almost equally divided three provinces on one side three on the other and the other divided one party inclined to the prussians and the other to the french the situation of france did not admit of their interposing immediately in their disputes by an army that of the prussians did a powerful and large army marched into holland and compelled the other party to surrender we know the distressing consequences to the people what produced those disputes and the necessity of foreign interference but the debility of their confederacy we may be warned by their example and shun their fate by removing the causes which produced their misfortunes my honorable friend has referred to the transaction of the federal council with respect to the navigation of the mississippi i wish it was consistent with delicacy and prudence to lay a complete view of the whole matter before this committee the history of it is singular and curious and perhaps its origin ought to be taken into consideration i will touch on some circumstances and introduce nearly the substance of most of the facts relative to it that i may not seem to shrink from explanation it was soon perceived sir after the commencement of the war with britain that among the various objects that would affect the happiness of the people of america the navigation of the mississippi was one throughout the whole history of foreign negotiation great stress was laid on its preservation in the time of our greatest distresses and particularly when the southern states were the scene of war the southern states cast their     eyes around to be relieved from their misfortunes it was supposed that assistance might be obtained for the relinquishment of that navigation it was thought that for so substantial a consideration spain might be induced to afford decisive succour it was opposed by the northern and eastern states they were sensible that it might be dangerous to surrender this important right particularly to the inhabitants of the western country but so it was that the southern states were for it and the eastern states opposed to it since obtaining that happy peace which secures to us all our claims this subject has been taken again into consideration and deliberated upon in the federal government a temporary relinquishment has been agitated several members from the different states but particularly from the northern were for a temporary surrender because it would terminate disputes and at the end of the short period for which it was to be given the right would revert of course to those who had given it up and for this temporary surrender some commercial advantages were offered for my part i consider this measure though founded on considerations plausible and honorable was yet not justifiable but on grounds of inevitable necessity i must declare in justice to many characters who were in congress that they declared that they never would enter into the measure unless the situation of the united states was such as could not prevent it i suppose that the adoption of this government will be favorable to the preservation of the right to that navigation emigration will be made from those parts of the united states which are settled to those parts which are unsettled if we afford protection to the western country we will see it rapidly peopled emigrations from some of the northern states have been lately increased we may conclude as has been said by a gentleman on the same side mr nicholas that those who emigrate to that country will leave behind them all their friends and connections as advocates for this right     what was the cause of those states being the champions of this right when the southern states were disposed to surrender it the preservation of this right will be for the general interest of the union the western country will be settled from the north as well as the south and its prosperity will add to the strength and security of the union i am not able to recollect all those circumstances which would be necessary to give gentlemen a full view of the subject i can only add that i conceive that the establishment of the new government will be the best possible means of securing our rights as well in the western parts as elsewhere i will not sit down till i make one more observation on what fell from my honorable friend he says that the true difference between the states lies in this circumstance—that some are carrying states and others productive and that the operation of the new government will be that there will be a plurality of the former to combine against the interest of the latter and that consequently it will be dangerous to put it in their power to do so i would join with him in sentiments if this were the case were this within the bounds of probability i should be equally alarmed but i think that those states which are contradistinguished as carrying states from the nonimporting states will be but few i suppose the southern states will be considered by all as under the latter description some other states have been mentioned by an honorable member on the same side which are not considered as carrying states new jersey and connecticut can by no means be enumerated among the carrying states they receive their supplies through new york here then is a plurality of nonimporting states i could add another if necessary delaware though situated upon the water is upon the list of noncarrying states i might say that a great part of new hampshire is so i believe a majority of the people of that state receive their supplies from massachusetts rhode island and connecticut might i not add all those states which will be admitted hereafter into the union these will be noncarrying     states and will support virginia in case the carrying states will attempt to combine against the rest this objection must therefore fall to the ground my honorable friend has made several other remarks but i will defer saying any more till we come to those parts to which his objections refer june   —power to lay taxes—jeffersons views—religious freedom—treatymaking power mr madison— mr chairman pardon me for making a few remarks on what fell from the honorable gentleman last up henry i am sorry to follow the example of gentlemen in deviating from the rule of the house—but as they have taken the utmost latitude in their objections it is necessary that those who favor the government should answer them but i wish as soon as possible to take up the subject regularly i will therefore take the liberty to answer some observations which have been irregularly made though they might be more properly answered when we come to discuss those parts of the constitution to which they respectively refer i will however postpone answering some others till then if there be that terror in direct taxation that the states would comply with requisitions to guard against the federal legislature and if as gentlemen say this state will always have it in her power to make her collections speedily and fully the people will be compelled to pay the same amount as quickly and punctually as if raised by the general government it has been amply proved that the general government can lay taxes as conveniently to the people as the state governments by imitating the state systems of taxation if the general government have not the power of collecting its own revenues in the first instance it will be still dependent on the state governments in some measure and the exercise of this power after refusal will be inevitably productive of injustice and confusion if partial compliances be made before it is     driven to assume it thus sir without relieving the people in the smallest degree the alternative proposed will impair the efficacy of the government and will perpetually endanger the tranquillity of the union the honorable members objection with respect to requisitions of troops will be fully obviated at another time let it suffice now to say that it is altogether unwarrantable and founded upon a misconception of the paper before you but the honorable member in order to influence our decision has mentioned the opinion of a citizen jefferson who is an ornament to this state when the name of this distinguished character was introduced i was much surprised is it come to this then that we are not to follow our own reason is it proper to introduce the opinions of respectable men not within these walls if the opinion of an important character were to weigh on this occasion could we not adduce a character equally great on our side are we who in the honorable gentlemans opinion are not to be governed by an erring world now to submit to the opinion of a citizen beyond the atlantic i believe that were that gentleman now on this floor he would be for the adoption of this constitution i wish his name had never been mentioned i wish every thing spoken here relative to his opinion may be suppressed if our debates should be published i know that the delicacy of his feelings will be wounded when he will see in print what has and may be said concerning him on this occasion i am in some measure acquainted with his sentiments on this subject it is not right for me to unfold what he has informed me but i will venture to assert that the clause now discussed is not objected to by mr jefferson he approves of it because it enables the government to carry on its operations—he admires several parts of it which have been reprobated with vehemence in this house he is captivated with the equality of suffrage in the senate which the honorable gentleman mr henry calls the rotten part of this constitution but whatever be the opinion of that illustrious citizen     considerations of personal delicacy should dissuade us from introducing it here the honorable member has introduced the subject of religion religion is not guarded—there is no bill of rights declaring that religion should be secure is a bill of rights a security for religion would the bill of rights in this state exempt the people from paying for the support of one particular sect if such sect were exclusively established by law if there were a majority of one sect a bill of rights would be a poor protection for liberty happily for the states they enjoy the utmost freedom of religion this freedom arises from that multiplicity of sects which pervades america and which is the best and only security for religious liberty in any society for where there is such a variety of sects there cannot be a majority of any one sect to oppress and persecute the rest fortunately for this commonwealth a majority of the people are decidedly against any exclusive establishment—i believe it to be so in the other states there is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation i can appeal to my uniform conduct on this subject that i have warmly supported religious freedom it is better that this security should be depended upon from the general legislature than from one particular state a particular state might concur in one religious project but the united states abound in such a variety of sects that it is a strong security against religious persecution and it is sufficient to authorise a conclusion that no one sect will ever be able to outnumber or depress the rest i will not travel over that extensive tract which the honorable member has traversed i shall not now take notice of all his desultory objections as occasions arise i shall answer them it is worthy of observation on this occasion that the honorable gentleman himself seldom fails to counteract the arguments of gentlemen on that side of the question for     example he strongly complains that the federal government from the number of its members will make an addition to the public expense too formidable to be borne and yet he and other gentlemen on the same side object that the number of representatives is too small though ten men are more than we are entitled to under the existing system how can these contradictions be reconciled if we are to adopt any efficient government at all how can we discover or establish such a system if it be thus attacked will it be possible to form a rational conclusion upon contradictory principles if arguments of a contradictory nature were to be brought against the wisest and most admirable system to the formation of which human intelligence is competent it never could stand them he has acrimoniously inveighed against the government because such transactions as congress think require secrecy may be concealed and particularly those which relate to treaties he admits that when a treaty is forming secrecy is proper but urges that when actually made the public ought to be made acquainted with every circumstance relative to it the policy of not divulging the most important transactions and negociations of nations such as those which relate to warlike arrangements and treaties is universally admitted the congressional proceedings are to be occasionally published including all receipts and expenditures of public money of which no part can be used but in consequence of appropriations made by law this is a security which we do not enjoy under the existing system that part which authorises the government to withhold from the public knowledge what in their judgement may require secrecy is imitated from the confederation that very system which the gentleman advocates no treaty has been formed and i will undertake to say that none will be formed under the old system which will secure to us the actual enjoyment of the navigation of the mississippi our weakness precludes us from it we are     entitled to it but it is not under an inefficient government that we shall be able to avail ourselves fully of that right i most conscientiously believe that it will be far better secured under the new government than the old as we will be more able to enforce our right the people of kentucky will have an additional safeguard from the change of system the strength and respectability of the union will secure them in the enjoyment of that right till that country becomes sufficiently populous when this happens they will be able to retain it in spite of every opposition i can never admit that seven states are disposed to surrender that navigation indeed it never was the case some of their most distinguished characters are decidedly opposed to its relinquishment when its cession was proposed by the southern states the northern states opposed it they still oppose it new jersey directed her delegates to oppose it and is strenuously against it the same sentiments pervade pennsylvania at least i am warranted to say so from the best information which i have those states added to the southern states would be a majority against it the honorable gentleman to obviate the force of my observations with respect to concurrent collection of taxes under different authorities said that there was no interference between the concurrent collections of parochial county and state taxes because they all irradiated from the same centre but that this was not the case with the general government to make use of the gentlemans own terms the concurrent collections under the authorities of the general government and state governments all irradiate from the people at large the people is their common superior the sense of the people at large is to be the predominating spring of their actions this is a sufficient security against interference our attention was called to our commercial interest and at the same time the landed interest was said to be in danger if those ten men who were to be chosen be elected by landed men and have land themselves can the electors have any     thing to apprehend if the commercial interests be in danger why are we alarmed about the carrying trade why is it said that the carrying states will preponderate if commerce be in danger with respect to speculation i will remark that stockjobbing has prevailed more or less in all countries and ever will in some degree notwithstanding any exertions to prevent it if you judge from what has happened under the existing system any change would render a melioration probable june   —mississippi negotiations  mr madison— mr chariman it is extremely disagreeable to me to enter into this discussion as it is foreign to the   0 object of our deliberations here and may in the opinion of some lead to sully the reputation of our public councils as far as my memory will enable me i will develope the subject we will not differ with one another with respect to facts perhaps we may differ with respect to principles i will take the liberty to observe that i was led before to make some observations which had no relation to the subject under consideration as relative to the western country to obviate suggestions of gentlemen which seemed to me to be groundless i stated that there was a period when the southern states were advocates for the alienation or suspension of the right to the mississippi i will not say which and the eastern states were against both i mention this to shew that there was no disposition in that part to surrender that right or dispose of that country i do suppose that the fishery had its influence on those states no doubt it was the case for that and other reasons they still continue against the alienation for it might lessen the security of retaining the fishery from the best information it never was the sense of the people at large or the prevailing characters of the eastern states to approve of the measure if interest sir should continue to operate on them i humbly conceive that they will derive more advantage from holding the mississippi than even the southern states for if the carrying business be their natural province how can it be so much extended and advanced as by giving the encouragement to agriculture in the western country and having the emolument of carrying their produce to market the carrying trade must depend on agriculture for its support in a great measure in what place is agriculture so capable of improvement and great extension as in the western country but whatever considerations may prevail in that quarter or any other respecting their interest i think we may fairly suppose that the consideration which the honorable member mentioned and which has been repeated i mean the emigrations which are going on to the     westward must produce the same effect as to them which it may produce with respect to us emigrations are now going on from that quarter as well as from this state i readily confess that neither the old confederation nor the new constitution involves a right to give the navigation of the mississippi it is repugnant to the law of nations i have always thought and said so although the right be denied there may be emergencies which will make it necessary to make a sacrifice but there is a material difference between emergencies of safety in time of war and those which may relate in mere commercial regulations you might on solid grounds deny in peace what you give up in war i do not conceive however that there is that extreme aversion in the minds of the people of the eastern states to emigrate to the westward which was insinuated by my honorable friend particular citizens it cannot be doubted may be averse to it but it is the sense of the people at large which will direct the public measures we find from late arrangements made between massachusetts and new york that a very considerable country to the westward of new york was disposed of to massachusetts and by massachusetts to some individuals to conduct emigrants to that country there were seven states who thought it right to give up the navigation of the mississippi for twentyfive years for several reasons which have been mentioned as far as i can recollect it was nearly as my honorable friend said but they had no idea of absolutely alienating it i think one material consideration which governed them was that there were grounds of serious negotiation between great britain and spain which might bring on a coalition between those nations which might enable them to bind us on different sides permanently withhold that navigation from us and injure us in other respects materially the temporary cession it was supposed would fix the permanent right in our favor and prevent that dangerous coalition it is but justice to myself to say that however plausible the reasons urged for its temporary cession     may have been they never convinced me of its utility i have uniformly disapproved of it and do now with respect to the secretary of foreign affairs jay i am intimately connected with him i shall say nothing of his abilities and attachment to his country his character is established in both respects he has given a train of reasoning which governed him in his project if he was mistaken his integrity and probity more than compensate for the error i am led to think there is no settled disposition in seven states to give up that object because new jersey on a further consideration of the subject actually gave instructions to her delegates to oppose it and what was the ground of this i do not know the extent and particular reasons of her instructions but i recollect that a material consideration was that the cession of that river would diminish the value of the western country which was a common fund for the united states and would consequently tend to impoverish their public treasury these sir were rational grounds give me leave sir as i am upon this subject and as the honorable gentleman has raised a question whether it be not more secure under the old than the new constitution—to differ from him i shall enter into the reasoning which in my mind renders it more secure under the new system two thirds of the senators present which will be nine states if all attend to their duty and the president must concur in every treaty which can be made here are two distinct and independent branches which must agree to every treaty under the existing system two thirds of the states must concur to form a treaty but it is but one body gentlemen may reason and conclude differently on this subject i own that as far as i have any rights which are but trivial i would rather trust them to the new than the old government besides let me observe that the house of representatives will have a material influence on the government and will be additional security in this respect but there is one thing which he mentioned which merits attention if commercial     policy be a source of great danger it will have less influence in the new system than in the old for in the house of representatives it will have little or no influence they are drawn from the landed interest taken from the states at large and many of them from the western country whereas the present members of congress have been taken from the atlantic side of the continent when we calculate the dangers that may arise in any case we judge from the rules of proportion and chances of numbers the people at large choose those who elect the president the weight of population will be to the southward if we include the western country there will then be a majority of the people in favor of this right as the president must be influenced by the sense and interest of his electors as far as it depends on him and his agency in making treaties is equal to that of the senate he will oppose the cession of that navigation as far as the influence of the representative goes it will also operate in favor of this right—the power of treaties is not lodged in the senators of particular states every state has an equal weight if ten senators can make a treaty ten senators can prevent one from being made it is from a supposition that all the southern delegates will be absent that ten senators or two thirds of a majority can give up this river the possibility of absence operates equally as much against the northern states if one fifth of the members present think the measure erroneous the votes of the states are to be taken upon it and entered on the journals every gentlemen here ought to recollect that this is some security as the people will thereby know those who advocate iniquitous measures if we consider the number of changes in the members of the government we will find it another security but after all sir what will this policy signify which tends to surrender the navigation of the mississippi resolutions of congress to retain it may be repeated and reechoed from every part of united states it is not resolutions of this sort which the people of this country wish for they want an actual     possession of the right and protection in its enjoyment similar resolutions have been taken under the existing system on many occasions but they have been heretofore and will be hereafter in my opinion nugatory and fruitless unless a change takes place which will give energy to the acts of the government i will take the liberty to touch once more on the several considerations which produced the question because perhaps the committee may not yet thoroughly comprehend it in justice to those gentlemen who concluded in favor of the temporary cession i mention their reasons although i think the measure wrong the reasons for so doing under the old system will be done away by the new system we could not without national dishonor assert our right to the mississippi and suffer any other nation to deprive us of it this consideration with others before mentioned influenced them i admit it was wrong but it is sufficient to prove that they acted on principles of integrity will they not be bound by honor and conscience when we are able to enjoy and retain our right not to give it up or suffer it to be interrupted a weak system produced this project a strong system will remove the inducement for may we not suppose it will be reversed by a change of system i was called up to say what was its present situation there are some circumstances within my knowledge which i am not at liberty to communicate to this house i will not go farther than to answer the objections of gentlemen i wish to conceal no circumstance which i can relate consistently with my duty as to matters of fact i have advanced nothing which i presume will be contradicted on matters of opinion we may differ were i at liberty i could develope some circumstances which would convince this house that this project will never be revived in congress and that therefore no danger is to be apprehended     june   —election of senators and representatives mr madison— mr chairman the reason of the exception was that if congress could fix the place of choosing the senators it might compel the state legislatures to elect them in a different place from that of their usual sessions which would produce some inconvenience and was not necessary for the object of regulating the elections but it was necessary to give the general government a control over the time and manner of choosing the senators to prevent its own dissolution with respect to the other point it was thought that the regulation of time place and manner of electing the representatives should be uniform throughout the continent some states might regulate the elections on the principles of equality and others might regulate them otherwise this diversity would be obviously unjust elections are regulated now unequally in some states particularly south carolina with respect to charleston which is represented by thirty members should the people of any state by any means be deprived of the right of suffrage it was judged proper that it should be remedied by the general government it was found impossible to fix the time place and manner of the election of representatives in the constitution it was found necessary to leave the regulation of these in the first place to the state governments as being best acquainted with the situation of the people subject to the control of the general government in order to enable it to produce uniformity and prevent its own dissolution and considering the state governments and general governments as distinct bodies acting in different and independent capacities for the people it was thought the particular regulations should be submitted to the former and the general regulations to the latter were they exclusively under the control of the state governments the general government might easily be dissolved but if they be regulated properly by the state legislatures the congressional control will very probably never be exercised the power appears to     me satisfactory and as unlikely to be abused as any part of the constitution mr monroe wished to hear an explanation of the clause which prohibits either house during the session of congress from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other mr madison wondered that this clause should meet with a shadow of objection it was possible he observed that the two branches might not agree concerning the time of adjournment and that this possibility suggested the power given the president of adjourning both houses to such time as he should think proper in case of their disagreement that it would be very exceptionable to allow the senators or even the representatives to adjourn without the consent of the other house at any season whatsoever without any regard to the situation of public exigencies that it was possible in the nature of things that some inconvenience might result from it but that it was as well secured as possible june   —compensation of congress mr madison— mr chairman i most sincerely wish to give a proper explanation on this subject in such a manner as may be to the satisfaction of every one i shall suggest such considerations as led the convention to approve of this clause with respect to the right of ascertaining their own pay i will acknowledge that their compensations if practicable should be fixed in the constitution itself so as not to be dependent on congress itself or on the state legislatures the various vicissitudes or rather the gradual diminution of the value of all coins and circulating medium is one reason against ascertaining them immutably as what may be now an adequate compensation might by the progressive reduction of the value of our circulating medium be extremely inadequate at a period not far distant     it was thought improper to leave it to the state legislatures because it is improper that one government should be dependent on another and the great inconveniences experienced under the old confederation show the states would be operated upon by local considerations as contradistinguished from general and national interests experience shows us that they have been governed by such heretofore and reason instructs us that they would be influenced by them again this theoretic inconvenience of leaving to congress the fixing their compensations is more than counterbalanced by this in the confederation—that the state legislatures had a right to determine the pay of the members of congress which enabled the states to destroy the general government there is no instance where this power has been abused in america legislative bodies have reduced their own wages lower rather than augmented them this is a power which cannot be abused without rousing universal attention and indignation what would be the consequence of the virginia legislature raising their pay to four or five pounds each per day the universal indignation of the people should the general congress annex wages disproportionate to their services or repugnant to the sense of the community they would be universally execrated the certainty of incurring the general detestation of the people will prevent abuse it was conceived that the great danger was in creating new offices which would increase the burdens of the people and not in a uniform admission of all meritorious characters to serve their country in the old offices there is no instance of any state constitution which goes as far as this it was thought to be a mean between two extremes it guards against abuse by taking away the inducement to create new offices or increase the emolument of old offices and it gives them an opportunity of enjoying in common with other citizens any of the existing offices which they may be capable of executing to have precluded them from this would have     been to exclude them from a common privilege to which every citizen is entitled and to prevent those who had served their country with the greatest fidelity and ability from being on a par with their fellowcitizens i think it as well guarded as reason requires more so than the constitution of any other nation june   —compensation of congress mr madison— mr chairman let me ask those who oppose this part of the system whether any alteration would not make it equally or more liable to objections would it be better to fix their compensations would not this produce inconveniences what authorises us to conclude that the value of coins will continue always the same would it be prudent to make them dependent on the state governments for their salaries—on those who watch them with jealous eyes and who consider them as encroaching not on the people but on themselves but the worthy member supposes that congress will fix their wages so low that only the rich can fill the offices of senators and representatives who are to appoint them the rich no sir the people are to choose them if the members of the general government were to reduce their compensations to a trifle before the evil suggested could happen the people could elect other members in their stead who would alter that regulation the people do not choose them for their wealth if the state legislatures choose such men as senators it does not influence the people at large in their election of representatives—they can choose those who have the most merit and least wealth if congress reduce their wages to a trifle what shall prevent the states from giving a man of merit so much as will be an adequate compensation i think the evil very remote and if it were now to happen the remedy is in our own hands and may by ourselves be applied another gentleman seems to apprehend infinite mischief     from a possibility that any member of congress may be appointed to an office although he ceases to be a member the moment he accepts it what will be the consequence of precluding them from being so appointed if you have in your country one man whom you could in time of danger trust above all others with an office of high importance he cannot undertake it till two years expire if he be a representative or till the six years elapse if a senator suppose america was engaged in war and the man of the greatest military talents and approved fidelity was a member of either house—would it be right that this man who could lead us to conquer and who could save his country from destruction could not be made general till the term of his election expired before that time we might be conquered by our enemies this will apply to civil as well as military officers it is impolitic to exclude from the service of his country in any office the man who may be most capable of discharging its duties when they are most wanting the honorable gentleman said that those who go to congress will look forward to offices as a compensation for their services rather than salaries does he recollect that they shall not fill offices created by themselves when they go to congress the old offices will be filled—they cannot make any probable calculation that the men in office will die or forfeit their offices as they cannot get any new offices one of those contingencies must happen before they can get any office at all the chance of getting an office is therefore so remote and so very distant that it cannot be considered as a sufficient reason to operate on their minds to deviate from their duty let any man calculate in his own mind the improbability of a member of the general government getting into an office when he cannot fill any office newly created and when he finds all the old offices filled at the time he enters into congress let him view the danger and impolicy of precluding a member of congress from holding existing offices and the danger of   0 making one government dependent on another and he will find that both clauses deserve applause the observations made by several honorable members illustrate my opinion that it is impossible to devise any system agreeable to all—when objections so contradictory are brought against it how shall we decide some gentlemen object to it because they may make their wages too high—others object to it because they may make them too low if it is to be perpetually attacked by principles so repugnant we may cease to discuss for what is the object of our discussion truth sir to draw a true and just conclusion can this be done without rational premises and syllogistic reasoning as to the british parliament it is nearly as he says but how does it apply to this case suppose their compensations had been appointed by the state governments or fixed in the constitution—would it be a safe government for the union if its members depended on receiving their salaries from other political bodies at a distance and fully competent to withhold them its existence would at best be but precarious if they were fixed in the constitution they might become extremely inadequate and produce the very evil which gentlemen seem to fear—for then a man of the highest merit could not act unless he were wealthy this is the most delicate part in the organization of a republican government it is the most difficult to establish on unexceptionable grounds it appears to me most eligible as it is the constitution has taken a medium between the two extremes and perhaps with more wisdom than either the british or the state governments with respect to their eligibility to offices they can fill no new offices created by themselves nor old ones of which they increased the salaries if they were excluded altogether it is possible that other disadvantages might accrue from it besides the impolicy and injustice of depriving them of a common privilege they will not relinquish their legislative in order to accept other offices they will more probably confer     them on their friends and connections if this be an inconvenience it is incident to all governments after having heard a variety of principles developed i thought that on which it is established the least exceptionable and it appears to me sufficiently well guarded june   —originating of money bills mr madison mr chairman the criticism made by the honorable member is that there is an ambiguity in the words and that it is not clearly ascertained where the origination of money bills may take place i suppose the first part of the clause is sufficiently expressed to exclude all doubts the gentlemen who composed the convention divided in opinion concerning the utility of confining this to any particular branch whatever it be in great britain there is a sufficient difference between us and them to render it inapplicable to this country it has always appeared to me to be a matter of no great consequence whether the senate had a right of originating or proposing amendments to money bills or not to withhold it from them would create disagreeable disputes some american constitutions make no difference virginia and south carolina are i think the only states where this power is restrained in massachusetts and other states the power of proposing amendments is vested unquestionably in their senates no inconvenience has resulted from it on the contrary with respect to south carolina this clause is continually a source of disputes when a bill comes from the other house the senate entirely rejects it and this causes contentions when you send a bill to the senate without the power of making any alteration you force them to reject the bill altogether when it would be necessary and advantageous that it should pass the power of proposing alterations removes this inconvenience and does not appear to me at all objectionable i     should have no objection to their having a right of originating such bills people would see what was done and it would add the intelligence of one house to that of the other it would be still in the power of the other house to obstruct any injudicious measure proposed by them there is no land mark or constitutional provision in great britain which prohibits the house of lords from intermeddling with money bills but the house of commons have established this rule yet the lords insist on their having a right to originate them as they possess great property as well as the commons and are taxed like them the house of commons object to their claim lest they should too lavishly make grants to the crown and increase the taxes the honorable member says that there is no difference between the right of originating bills and proposing amendments there is some difference though not considerable if any grievances should happen in consequence of unwise regulations in revenue matters the odium would be divided which will now be thrown on the house of representatives but you may safely lodge this power of amending with the senate when a bill is sent with proposed amendments to the house of representatives if they find the alterations defective they are not conclusive the house of representatives are the judges of their propriety and the recommendation of the senate is nothing the experience of this state justifies this clause the house of delegates has employed weeks in forming a money bill and because the senate had no power of proposing amendments the bill was lost altogether and a new bill obliged to be again introduced when the insertion of one line by the senate would have done those gentlemen who oppose this clause will not object to it when they recollect that the senators are appointed by the states as the present members of congress are appointed for as they will guard the political interests of the states in other respects they will attend to them very probably in their amendments to money bills i think this power for these considerations is useful and necessary     june   —power over the militia mr madison— mr chairman i most cordially agree with the honorable member last up mason that a standing army is one of the greatest mischiefs that can possibly happen it is a great recommendation for this system that it provides against this evil more than any other system known to us and particularly more than the old system of confederation the most effectual way to guard against a standing army is to render it unnecessary the most effectual way to render it unnecessary is to give the general government full power to call forth the militia and exert the whole natural strength of the union when necessary thus you will furnish the people with sure and certain protection without recurring to this evil and the certainty of this protection from the whole will be a strong inducement to individual exertion does the organization of the government warrant a belief that this power will be abused can we believe that a government of a federal nature consisting of many coequal sovereignties and particularly having one branch chosen from the people would drag the militia unnecessarily to an immense distance this sir would be unworthy the most arbitrary despot they have no temptation whatever to abuse this power such abuse could only answer the purpose of exciting the universal indignation of the people and drawing on themselves the general hatred and detestation of their country i cannot help thinking that the honorable gentleman has not considered in all its consequences the amendment he has proposed would this be an equal protection sir or would it not be a most partial provision some states have three or four states in contact were this state invaded as it is bounded by several states the militia of three or four states would by this proposition be obliged to come to our aid and those from some of the states would come a far greater distance than those of others there are other states which if invaded could be assisted by the militia of one state only there being several states which border but on one state     georgia and newhampshire would be infinitely less safe than those of the other states were we to adopt this amendment we should set up those states as butts for invasions invite foreign enemies to attack them and expose them to peculiar hardships and dangers were the militia confined to any limited distance from their respective places of abode it would produce equal nay more inconveniences the principles of equality and reciprocal aid would be destroyed in either case i cannot conceive that this constitution by giving the general government the power of arming the militia takes it away from the state governments the power is concurrent and not exclusive have we not found from experience that while the power of arming and governing of the militia has been solely vested in the state legislatures they were neglected and rendered unfit for immediate service every state neglected too much this most essential object but the general government can do it more effectually have we not also found that the militia of one state were almost always insufficient to succour its harrassed neighbor did all the states furnish their quotas of militia with sufficient promptitude the assistance of one state will be of little avail to repel invasion but the general head of the whole union can do it with effect if it be vested with power to use the aggregate strength of the union if the regulation of the militia were to be committed to the executive authority alone there might be reason for providing restrictions but sir it is the legislative authority that has this power they must make a law for the purpose the honorable member is under another mistake he wishes martial law to be exercised only in time of war under an idea that congress can establish it in time of peace the states are to have the authority of training the militia according to the congressional discipline and of governing them at all times when not in the service of the union—congress is to govern such part of them as may be employed in the actual     service of the united states and such part only can be subject to martial law the gentlemen in opposition have drawn a most tremendous picture of the constitution in this respect without considering that the power was absolutely indispensible they have alarmed us with the possible abuse of it but have shewn no inducement or motive to tempt them to such abuse would the legislature of the state drag the militia of the eastern shore to the western frontiers or those of the western frontiers to the eastern shore if the local militia were sufficient to effect the intended purpose there is something so preposterous and so full of mischief in the idea of dragging the militia unnecessarily from one end of the continent to the other that i think there can be no ground of apprehension if you limit their power over the militia you give them a pretext for substituting a standing army if you put it in the power of the state governments to refuse the militia by requiring their consent you destroy the general government and sacrifice particular states the same principles and motives which produce disobedience to requisitions will produce refusal in this case the restrictions which the honorable gentleman mentioned to be in the british constitution are all provisions against the power of the executive magistrate but the house of commons may if they be so disposed sacrifice the interest of their constituents in all those cases they may prolong the duration of mutiny bills and grant supplies to the king to carry on an impolitic war but they have no motives to do so for they have strong motives to do their duty we have more ample security than the people of great britain the powers of the government are more limited and guarded and our representatives are more responsible than the members of the british house of commons june   —power over purse and sword mr madison— mr chairman the honorable gentleman has laid much stress on the maxim that the purse and sword     ought not to be put in the same hands with a view of pointing out the impropriety of vesting this power in the general government but it is totally inapplicable to this question what is the meaning of this maxim does it mean that the sword and purse ought not to be trusted in the hands of the same government this cannot be the meaning for there never was and i can say there never will be an efficient government in which both are not vested the only rational meaning is that the sword and purse are not to be given to the same member apply it to the british government which has been mentioned the sword is in the hands of the british king the purse in the hands of the parliament it is so in america as far as any analogy can exist would the honorable member say that the sword ought to be put in the hands of the representatives of the people or in other hands independent of the government altogether if he says so it will violate the meaning of that maxim this would be a novelty hitherto unprecedented the purse is in the hands of the representatives of the people they have the appropriation of all monies they have the direction and regulation of land and naval forces they are to provide for calling for the militia—and the president is to have the command and in conjunction with the senate to appoint the officers the means ought to be commensurate to the end the end is general protection this cannot be effected without a general power to use the strength of the union we are told that both sides are distinguished by these great traits confidence and distrust perhaps there may be a less or greater tincture of suspicion on one side than the other but give me leave to say that where power can be safely lodged if it be necessary reason commands its cession in such case it is imprudent and unsafe to withhold it it is universally admitted that it must be lodged in some hands or other the question then is in what part of the government it ought to be placed and not whether any other political body independent of the government should have it or not     i profess myself to have had an uniform zeal for a republican government if the honorable member or any other person conceives that my attachment to this system arises from a different source he is greatly mistaken from the first moment that my mind was capable of contemplating political subjects i never till this moment ceased wishing success to a well regulated republican government the establishment of such in america was my most ardent desire i have considered attentively and my consideration has been aided by experience the tendency of a relaxation of laws and a licentiousness of manners if we review the history of all republics we are justified by the supposition that if the bands of the government be relaxed confusion will ensue anarchy ever has and i fear ever will produce despotism what was the state of things that preceded the wars and revolutions in germany faction and confusion what produced the disorders and commotions of holland the like causes in this commonwealth and every state in the union the relaxed operation of the government has been sufficient to alarm the friends of their country the rapid increase of population in every state is an additional reason to check dissipation and licentiousness does it not strongly call for the friends of republican government to endeavor to establish a republican organization a change is absolutely necessary i can see no danger in submitting to practice an experiment which seems to be founded on the best theoretic principles but the honorable member tells us there is not an equal responsibility delineated on that paper to that which is in the english government calculations have been made here that when you strike off those entirely elected by the influence of the crown the other part does not bear a greater proportion to the number of their people than the number fixed in that paper bears to the number of inhabitants in the united states if it were otherwise there is still more responsibility in this government our representatives are chosen for two     years in great britain they are chosen for seven years any citizen may be elected here in great britain no one can be elected to represent a county without having an estate of the value of £ 00 sterling a year nor to represent a corporation without an annual estate of £ 00 yet we are told there is no sympathy or fellowfeeling between the people here and their representatives but that in england they have both—a just comparison will show that if confidence be due to the government there it is due ten fold here mr madison made many other observations but spoke so very low that he could not be distinctly heard june   —power over elections mr madison— mr chairman i cannot think that the explanation of the gentleman last up is founded in reason it does not say that the militia shall be called out in all cases but in certain cases there are cases in which the execution of the laws may require the operation of militia which cannot be said to be an invasion or insurrection there may be a resistance to the laws which cannot be termed an insurrection my honorable friend over the way has opened a new source of argument he has introduced the assertions of gentlemen out of doors if we thus depart from regularity we will never be able to come to a decision if there be any gentleman who is a friend to the government and says that the elections may or ought to be held in one place he is an enemy to it on that ground with respect to the time place and manner of elections i cannot think notwithstanding the apprehensions of the honorable gentleman that there is any danger or if abuse should take place that there is not sufficient security if all the people of the united states should be directed to go to elect in one place the members of the government would be execrated for the infamous regulation many would go to trample them under foot for their conduct—and they would be succeeded by men     who would remove it they would not dare to meet the universal hatred and detestation of the people and run the risk of the certain dreadful consequences we must keep within the compass of human probability if a possibility be the cause of objection we must object to every government in america but the honorable gentleman may say that better guards may be provided let us consider the objection the power of regulating the time place and manner of elections must be vested some where it could not be fixed in the constitution without involving great inconveniences they could then have no authority to adjust the regulation to the changes of circumstances the question then is whether it ought to be fixed unalterably in the state governments or subject to the control of the general government is it not obvious that the general government would be destroyed without this control it has already been demonstrated that it will produce many conveniences have we not sufficient security against abuse consider fully the principles of the government the sum of the powers given up by the people of virginia is divided into two classes one to the federal and the other to the state government each is subdivided into three branches these may be kept independent of each other in the one as well as the other in this system they are as distinct as is consistent with good policy this in my opinion instead of diminishing increases the security of liberty more than any government that ever was for the powers of government which in every other country are given to one body are here given to two and are favorable to public liberty with respect to secrecy if every thing in which it is necessary could be enumerated i would have no objection to mention them all the state legislatures can keep secret what they think ought to be concealed the british house of commons can do it they are in this respect under much less restraint than congress there never was any legislative assembly without a discretionary power of concealing important transactions the publication of which might be  00 detrimental to the community there can be no real danger as long as the government is constructed on such principles he objects also to the clause respecting adjournment that neither house shall without the consent of the other adjourn for more than three days it was before remarked that if a difference should take place between the houses about the time of adjournment the president could still determine it from which no danger could arise as he is chosen in a secondary degree by the people and would consequently fix no time which would be repugnant to the sense of the representatives of the people another and more satisfactory answer is this suppose the senate wished to chain down the house of representatives what is to hinder them from going home how bring them back again it would be contrary to the spirit of the constitution to impede the operations of the government perhaps at a critical period i cannot conceive that such difference will often happen were the senate to attempt to prevent an adjournment it would but serve to irritate the representatives without having the intended effect as the president could adjourn them there will not be occasion for the continual residence of the senators at the seat of government what business have they more than the house of representatives the appointment of officers and treaties with respect to the appointment of officers a law may be made to grant it to the president alone it must be supposed there will be but few and subordinate officers to be appointed as the principal offices will be filled it is observed that the president when vacancies happen during the recess of the senate may fill them till it meets with respect to treaties the occasions of forming them will not be many and will mean but a small proportion of the time of session june   —power over the militia mr madison— mr chairman i will endeavor to follow the rule of the house but must pay due attention to the observations  0  which fell from the gentleman i should conclude from abstracted reasoning that they were ill founded i should think that if there were any object which the general government ought to command it would be the direction of the national forces and as the force which lies in militia is most safe the direction of that part ought to be submitted to in order to render another force unnecessary the power objected to is necessary because it is to be employed for national purposes it is necessary to be given to every government this is not opinion but fact the highest authority may be given that the want of such authority in the government protracted the late war and prolonged its calamities he says that one ground of complaint at the beginning of the revolution was that a standing army was quartered upon us this was not the whole complaint we complained because it was done without the local authority of this country—without the consent of the people of america as to the exclusion of standing armies in the bill of rights of the states we shall find that though in one or two of them there is something like a prohibition yet in most of them it is only provided that no armies shall be kept without the legislative authority that is without the consent of the community itself where is the impropriety of saying that we shall have an army if necessary does not the notoriety of this constitute security if inimical nations were to fall upon us when defenceless what would be the consequence would it be wise to say that we should have no defence give me leave to say that the only possible way to provide for standing armies is to make them unnecessary the way to do this is to organize and discipline our militia so as to render them capable of defending the country against external invasions and internal insurrections but it is urged that abuses may happen how is it possible to answer objections against possibility of abuses it must strike every logical reasoner that these cannot be entirely provided  0  against i really thought that the objection in the militia was at an end was there ever a constitution in which if authority was vested it must not have been executed by force if resisted was it not in the contemplation of this state when contemptuous proceedings were expected to recur to something of this kind how is it possible to have a more proper resource than this that the laws of every country ought to be executed cannot be denied that force must be used if necessary cannot be denied can any government be established that will answer any purpose whatever unless force be provided for executing its laws the constitution does not say that a standing army shall be called out to execute the laws is not this a more proper way the militia ought to be called forth to suppress smugglers will this be denied the case actually happened at alexandria there were a number of smugglers who were too formidable for the civil power to overcome the military quelled the sailors who otherwise would have perpetrated their intentions should a number of smugglers have a number of ships the militia ought to be called forth to quell them we do not know but what there may be combinations of smugglers in virginia hereafter we all know the use made of the isle of man it was a general depository of contraband goods the parliament found the evil so great as to render it necessary to wrest it out of the hands of its possessor the honorable gentleman says that it is a government of force if he means military force the clause under consideration proves the contrary there never was a government without force what is the meaning of government an institution to make people do their duty a government leaving it to a man to do his duty or not as he pleases would be a new species of government or rather no government at all the ingenuity of the gentleman is remarkable in introducing the riot act of great britain that act has no connection or analogy to any regulation of the militia nor is there any thing in the constitution to warrant the general  0  government to make such an act it never was a complaint in great britain that the militia could be called forth if riots should happen the militia are proper to quell it to prevent a resort to another mode as to the infliction of ignominious punishments we have no ground of alarm if we consider the circumstances of the people at large there will be no punishments so ignominious as have been inflicted already the militia law of every state to the north of maryland is less rigorous than the particular law of this state if a change be necessary to be made by the general government it will be in our favor i think that the people of those states would not agree to be subjected to a more harsh punishment than their own militia laws inflict an observation fell from a gentleman on the same side with myself which deserves to be attended to if we be dissatisfied with the national government if we should choose to renounce it this is an additional safeguard to our defence i conceive that we are peculiarly interested in giving the general government as extensive means as possible to protect us if there be a particular discrimination between places in america the southern states are from their situation and circumstances most interested in giving the national government the power of protecting its members here mr madison made some other observations but spoke so very low that his meaning could not be comprehended an act passed a few years ago in this state to enable the government to call forth the militia to enforce the laws when a powerful combination should take place to oppose them this is the same power which the constitution is to have there is a great deal of difference between calling forth the militia when a combination is formed to prevent the execution of the laws and the sheriff or constable carrying with him a body of militia to execute them in the first instance which is a construction not warranted by the clause there is an act also in this state empowering the officers of the customs to summon any persons to assist them when they meet with  0  obstruction in executing their duty this shews the necessity of giving the government power to call forth the militia when the laws are resisted it is a power vested in every legislature in the union and which is necessary to every government he then moved that the clerk should read those acts—which were accordingly read june   —power over the militia mr madison— mr chairman let me ask this committee and the honorable member last up henry what we are to understand from this reasoning the power must be vested in congress or in the state governments or there must be a division or concurrence he is against division—it is a political monster he will not give it to congress for fear of oppression is it to be vested in the state governments if so where is the provision for general defence if ever america should be attacked the states would fall successively it will prevent them from giving aid to their sister states for as each state will expect to be attacked and wish to guard against it each will retain its own militia for its own defence where is this power to be deposited then unless in the general government if it be dangerous to the public safety to give it exclusively to the states if it must be divided let him shew a better manner of doing it than that which is in the constitution i cannot agree with the other honorable gentleman that there is no check there is a powerful check in that paper the state governments are to govern the militia when not called forth for general national purposes and congress is to govern such part only as may be in the actual service of the union nothing can be more certain and positive than this it expressly empowers congress to govern them when in the service of the united states it is then clear that the states govern them when they are not with respect to suppressing insurrections i say that those clauses which were mentioned by the honorable gentleman are compatible  0  with a concurrence of the power by the first congress is to call them forth to suppress insurrections and repel invasions of foreign powers a concurrence in the former case is necessary because a whole state may be in insurrection against the union what has passed may perhaps justify this apprehension the safety of the union and particular states requires that the general government should have power to repel foreign invasions the fourth section of the fourth article is perfectly consistent with the exercise of the power by the states the words are the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against domestic violence the word invasion here after power had been given in the former clause to repel invasions may be thought tautologous but it has a different meaning from the other this clause speaks of a particular state it means that it shall be protected from invasion by other states a republican government is to be guaranteed to each state and they are to be protected from invasion from other states as well as from foreign powers and on application by the legislature or executive as the case may be the militia of the other states are to be called to suppress domestic insurrections does this bar the states from calling forth their own militia no but it gives them a supplementary security to suppress insurrection and domestic violence the other clause runs in these words no state shall without the consent of congress lay any duty on tonnage keep troops or ships of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay they are restrained from making war unless invaded or in imminent danger when in such danger they are not restrained i can perceive no competition in these clauses they cannot be  0  said to be repugnant to a concurrence of the power if we object to the constitution in this manner and consume our time in verbal criticism we shall never put an end to the business june   —power over seat of government mr madison— mr chairman i did conceive sir that the clause under consideration was one of those parts which would speak its own praise it is hardly necessary to say any thing concerning it strike it out of the system and let me ask whether there would not be much larger scope for those dangers i cannot comprehend that the power of legislating over a small district which cannot exceed ten miles square and may not be more than one mile will involve the dangers which he apprehends if there be any knowledge in my mind of the nature of man i should think it would be the last thing that would enter into the mind of any man to grant exclusive advantages in a very circumscribed district to the prejudice of the community at large we make suppositions and afterwards deduce conclusions from them as if they were established axioms but after all bring home this question to ourselves is it probable that the members from georgia new hampshire c will concur to sacrifice the privileges of their friends i believe that whatever state may become the seat of the general government it will become the object of jealousy and of the envy of the other states let me remark if not already remarked that there must be a cession by particular states of the district to congress and that the states may settle the terms of the cession the states may make what stipulation they please in it and if they apprehend any danger they may refuse it altogether how could the general government be guarded from the undue influence of particular states or from insults without such exclusive power if it were at the pleasure of a particular state to control the cession and deliberations of congress would they be secure from  0  insults or the influence of such state if this commonwealth depended for the freedom of deliberation or the laws of any state where it might be necessary to sit would it not be liable to attacks of that nature and with more indignity which have been already offered to congress with respect to the government of holland i believe the states general have no jurisdiction over the hague but i have heard that mentioned as a circumstance which gave undue influence to holland over the rest we must limit our apprehensions to certain degrees of probability the evils which they urge must result from this clause are extremely improbable nay almost impossible june   —power over seat of government mr madison— mr chairman i am astonished that the honorable member should launch out into such strong descriptions without any occasion was there ever a legislature in existence that held their sessions at a place where they had not jurisdiction i do not mean such a legislature as they have in holland for it deserves not the name—their powers are such as congress have now which we find not reducible to practice if you be satisfied with the shadow and form instead of the substance you will render them dependent on the local authority suppose the legislature of this country should sit in richmond while the exclusive jurisdiction of the place was in some particular country would this country think it safe that the general good should be subject to the paramount authority of a part of the community the honorable member asks why ask for this power and if the subsequent clause be not fully competent for the same purpose if so what new terrors can arise from this particular clause it is only a superfluity if that latitude of construction which he contends for were to take place with respect to the sweeping clause there would be room for those horrors but it gives no supplementary power it only  0  enables them to execute the delegated powers if the delegation of their powers be safe no possible inconvenience can arise from this clause it is at most but explanatory for when any power is given its delegation necessarily involves authority to make laws to execute it were it possible to delineate on paper all those particular cases and circumstances in which legislation by the general legislature would be necessary and leave to the states all the other powers i imagine no gentleman would object to it but this is not within the limits of human capacity the particular powers which are found necessary to be given are therefore delegated generally and particular and minute specification is left to the legislature here mr madison spoke of the distinction between regulation of police and legislation but so low he could not be heard when the honorable member objects to giving the general government jurisdiction over the place of their session does he mean that it should be under the control of any particular state that might at a critical moment seize it i should have thought that this clause would have met with the most cordial approbation as the consent of the state in which it may be must be obtained and as it may stipulate the terms of the grant should they violate the particular stipulations it would be an usurpation so that if the members of congress were to be guided by the laws of their country none of those dangers could arise mr madison made several other remarks which could not be heard june   —importation of slaves mr madison— mr chairman i should conceive this clause permitting importation of slaves to be impolitic if it were one of those things which could be excluded without encountering greater evils the southern states would not have entered into the union of america without the temporary permission of that trade and if they were excluded from  0  the union the consequences might be dreadful to them and to us we are not in a worse situation than before that traffic is prohibited by our laws and we may continue the prohibition the union in general is not in a worse situation under the articles of confederation it might be continued forever but by this clause an end may be put to it after twenty years there is therefore an amelioration of our circumstances a tax may be laid in the meantime but it is limited otherwise congress might lay such a tax as would amount to a prohibition from the mode of representation and taxation congress cannot lay such a tax on slaves as will amount to manumission another clause secures us that property which we now possess at present if any slave elopes to any of those states where slaves are free he becomes emancipated by their laws for the laws of the states are uncharitable to one another in this respect but in this constitution no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due this clause was expressly inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them this is a better security than any that now exists no power is given to the general government to interpose with respect to the property in slaves now held by the states the taxation of this state being equal only to its representation such a tax cannot be laid as he supposes they cannot prevent the importation of slaves for twenty years but after that period they can the gentlemen from south carolina and georgia argued in this manner we have now liberty to import this species of property and much of the property now possessed had been purchased or otherwise acquired in contemplation of improving it by the assistance of imported slaves what would be the consequence of hindering us from it the slaves of virginia would rise in value and we would be   0 obliged to go to your markets i need not expatiate on this subject great as the evil is a dismemberment of the union would be worse if those states should disunite from the other states for not indulging them in the temporary continuance of this traffic they might solicit and obtain aid from foreign powers june   —importation of slaves mr madison replied that even the southern states who were most affected were perfectly satisfied with this provision and dreaded no danger to the property they now hold it appeared to him that the general government would not intermeddle with that property for twenty years but to lay a tax on every slave imported not exceeding ten dollars and that after the expiration of that period they might prohibit the traffic altogether the census in the constitution was intended to introduce equality in the burdens to be laid on the community no gentleman objected to laying duties imposts and excises uniformly but uniformity of taxes would be subversive to the principles of equality for that it was not possible to select any article which would be easy for one state but what would be heavy for another that the proportion of each state being ascertained it would be raised by the general government in the most convenient manner for the people and not by the selection of any one particular object that there must be some degree of confidence put in agents or else we must reject a state of civil society altogether another great security to this property which he mentioned was that five states were greatly interested in that species of property and there were other states which had some slaves and had made no attempt or taken any step to take them from the people there were a few slaves in new york new jersey and connecticut these states would probably oppose any attempts to annihilate this species of property he concluded by observing that he would be glad to leave the decision of this to the committee     june   —the vice presidency mr madison— mr chairman i think there are some peculiar advantages incident to this office the vice presidency which recommend it to us there is in the first place a great probability this officer will be taken from one of the largest states and if so the circumstance of his having an eventual vote will be so far favorable the consideration which recommends it to me is that he will be the choice of the people at large—there are to be ninetyone electors each of whom has two votes if he have one fourth of the whole number of votes he is elected vicepresident there is much more propriety in giving this office to a person chosen by the people at large than to one of the senate who is only the choice of the legislature of one state—his eventual vote is an advantage too obvious to comment upon i differ from the honorable member in the case which enables congress to make a temporary appointment when the president and vicepresident die the election of another president will immediately take place and suppose it would not all that congress could do would be to make an appointment between the expiration of the four years and the last election and to continue only to such expiration this can rarely happen this power continues the government in motion and is well guarded june   —election of president  mr madison— mr chairman i will take the liberty of making a few observations which may place this in such a light as     may obviate objections it is observed that none of the honorable members objecting to this have pointed out the right mode of election it was found difficult in the convention and will be found so by any gentleman who will take the liberty of delineating a mode of electing the president that would exclude those inconveniences which they apprehend i would not contend against some of the principles laid down by some gentlemen if the interests of some states only were to be consulted but there is a great diversity of interests the choice of the people ought to be attended to i have found no better way of selecting the man in whom they place the highest confidence than that delineated in the plan of the convention—nor has the gentleman told us perhaps it will be found impracticable to elect him by the immediate suffrages of the people difficulties would arise from the extent and population of the states instead of this the people chose the electors this can be done with ease and convenience and will render the choice more judicious as to the eventual voting by states it has my approbation the lesser states and some large states will be generally pleased by that mode the deputies from the small states argued and there is some force in their reasoning that when the people voted the large states evidently had the advantage over the rest and without varying the mode the interest of the little states might be neglected or sacrificed here is a compromise—for in the eventual election the small states will have the advantage in so extensive a country it is probable that many persons will be voted for and the lowest of the five highest on the list     may not be so inconsiderable as he supposes with respect to the possibility that a small number of votes may decide his election i do not know how nor do i think that a bare calculation of possibility ought to govern us—one honorable gentleman has said that the eastern states may in the eventual election choose him but in the extravagant calculation he has made he has been obliged to associate north carolina and georgia with the five smallest northern states there can be no union of interest or sentiments between states so differently situated the honorable member last up has committed a mistake in saying there must be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed a majority of votes equal to a majority of the electors appointed will be sufficient fortysix is a majority of ninety one and will suffice to elect the president june   —treatymaking power mr madison— mr chairman i am persuaded that when this power comes to be thoroughly and candidly viewed it will be found right and proper as to its extent perhaps it will be satisfactory to the committee that the power is precisely in the new constitution as it is in the confederation in the existing confederacy congress are authorized indefinitely to make treaties many of the states have recognised the treaties of congress to be the supreme law of the land acts have passed within a year declaring this to be the case i have seen many of them does it follow because this power is given to congress that it is absolute and unlimited i do not conceive that power is given to the president and senate to dismember the empire or to alienate any great essential right i do not think the whole legislative authority have this power the exercise of the power must be consistent with the object of the delegation one objection against the amendment proposed is this     that by implication it would give power to the legislative authority to dismember the empire—a power that ought not to be given but by the necessity that would force assent from every man i think it rests on the safest foundation as it is the object of treaties is the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations and is external i do not think it possible to enumerate all the cases in which such external regulations would be necessary would it be right to define all the cases in which congress could exercise this authority the definition might and probably would be defective they might be restrained by such a definition from exercising the authority where it would be essential to the interest and safety of the community it is most safe therefore to leave it to be exercised as contingencies may arise it is to be presumed that in transactions with foreign countries those who regulate them will feel the whole force of national attachment to their country the contrast being between their own nation and a foreign nation is it not presumable they will as far as possible advance the interest of their own country would it not be considered as a dangerous principle in the british government were the king to have the same power in internal regulations as he has in the external business of treaties yet as among other reasons it is natural to suppose he will prefer the interest of his own to that of another country it is thought proper to give him this external power of making treaties this distinction is well worthy the consideration of gentlemen i think the argument of the gentleman who restrained the supremacy of these to the laws of particular states and not to congress is rational here the supremacy of a treaty is contrasted with the supremacy of the laws of the states it cannot be otherwise supreme if it does not supersede their existing laws as far as they contravene its operation it cannot be of any effect to counteract it by the supremacy of the state laws would bring on the union the just charge of national perfidy and involve us in war     suppose the king of great britain should make a treaty with france where he had a constitutional right if the treaty should require an internal regulation and the parliament should make a law to that effect that law would be binding on the one though not on the other nation suppose there should be a violation of right by the exercise of this power by the president and senate if there was apparent merit in it it would be binding on the people for where there is a power for any particular purpose it must supersede what may oppose it or else it can be no power for instance where there is a power of declaring war that power as to declaring war supersedes every thing this would be an unfortunate case should it happen but should it happen there is a remedy and there being a remedy they will be restrained against abuses but let us compare the responsibility in this government to that of the british government if there be an abuse of this royal prerogative the minister who advises him is liable to impeachment this is the only restraint on the sovereign now sir is not the minister of the united states under restraint who is the minister—the president himself who is liable to impeachment he is responsible in person but for the abuse of the power of the king the responsibility is in his advisers suppose the constitution had said that this minister alone could make treaties and when he violated the interest of the nation he would be impeached by the senate then the comparison would hold good between the two governments but is there not an additional security by adding to him the representatives and guardians of the political interest of the states if he should seduce a part of the senate to a participation in his crimes those who were not seduced would pronounce sentence against him and there is this supplementary security that he may be convicted and punished afterwards when other members come in the senate onethird being excluded every second year so that there is a twofold security the security of impeachment and conviction by     those senators that they may be innocent should no more than onethird be engaged with the president in the plot and should there be more of them engaged in it he may be tried and convicted by the succeeding senators and the upright senators who were in the senate before as to the case of the russian ambassador i shall say nothing it is as inapplicable as many other quotations made by the gentleman i conceive that as far as the bills of rights in the states do not express any thing foreign to the nature of such things and express fundamental principles essential to liberty and those privileges which are declared necessary to all free people these rights are not encroached on by this government mr madison added other remarks which could not be heard june  0—power of judiciary  mr madison— mr chairman permit me to make a few observations which may place this part in a more favorable light than the gentleman placed it in yesterday it may be proper to remark that the organization of the general government     for the united states was in all its parts very difficult there was a peculiar difficulty in that of the executive every thing incident to it must have participated of that difficulty that mode which was judged most expedient was adopted till experience should point out one more eligible this part was also attended with difficulties it claims the indulgence of a fair and liberal interpretation i will not deny that according to my view of the subject a more accurate attention might place it in terms which would exclude some of the objections now made to it but if we take liberal construction i think we shall find nothing dangerous or inadmissible in it in compositions of this kind it is difficult to avoid technical terms which have the same meaning an intention to this may satisfy gentlemen that precision was not so easily obtained as may be imagined i will illustrate this by one thing in the constitution there is a general power to provide courts to try felonies and piracies committed on the high seas piracy is a word which may be considered as a term of the law of nations felony is a word unknown to the law of nations and is to be found in the british laws and from thence adopted in the law of these states it was thought dishonorable to have recourse to that standard a technical term of the law of nations is therefore used that we should find ourselves authorised to introduce it into the laws of the united states the first question which i shall consider is whether the subjects of its cognizance be proper subjects of a federal jurisdiction the second will be whether the provisions respecting it be consistent with safety and impropriety will answer the purposes intended and suit local circumstances the first class of cases to which its jurisdiction extends are those which may arise under the constitution and this is to extend to equity as well as law it may be a misfortune that in organizing any government the explication of its authority should be left to any of its coordinate branches there is no example in any country where it is otherwise there is a     new policy in submitting it to the judiciary of the united states that causes of a federal nature will arise will be obvious to every gentleman who will recollect that the states are laid under restrictions and that the rights of the union are secured by these restrictions they may involve equitable as well as legal controversies with respect to the laws of the union it is so necessary and expedient that the judicial power should correspond with the legislative that it has not been objected to with respect to treaties there is a peculiar propriety in the judiciary expounding them these may involve us in controversies with foreign nations it is necessary therefore that they should be determined in the courts of the general government there are strong reasons why there should be a supreme court to decide such disputes if in any case uniformity be necessary it must be in the exposition of treaties the establishment of one revisionary superintending power can alone secure such uniformity the same principles hold with respect to cases affecting ambassadors and foreign ministers to the same principles may also be referred their cognizance in admiralty and maritime cases as our intercourse with foreign nations will be affected by decisions of this kind they ought to be uniform this can only be done by giving the federal judiciary exclusive jurisdiction controversies affecting the interest of the united states ought to be determined by their own judiciary and not be left to partial local tribunals the next case where two or more states are the parties is not objected to provision is made for this by the existing articles of confederation and there can be no impropriety in referring such disputes to this tribunal its jurisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state is much objected to and perhaps without reason it is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court the only operation it can have is that if a state should wish to bring suit against a citizen it must be brought before the federal court this will give satisfaction to individuals     as it will prevent citizens on whom a state may have a claim being dissatisfied with the state courts it is a case which cannot often happen and if it should be found improper it will be altered but it may be attended with good effects this may be illustrated by other cases it is provided that cases of citizens of different states may be carried to the federal courts but this will not go beyond the cases where they may be parties a femme covert may be a citizen of another state but cannot be a party in this court a subject of a foreign power having a dispute with a citizen of this state may carry it to the federal court but an alien enemy cannot bring suit at all it appears to me that this can have no operation but this—to give a citizen a right to be heard in the federal courts and if a state should condescend to be a party this court may take cognizance of it as to its cognizance of disputes between citizens of different states i will not say it is a matter of such importance perhaps it might be left to the state courts but i sincerely believe this provision will be rather salutary than otherwise it may happen that a strong prejudice may arise in some states against the citizens of others who may have claims against them we know what tardy and even defective administration of justice has happened in some states a citizen of another state might not chance to get justice in a state court and at all events he might think himself injured to the next clause there is no objection the next case provides for disputes between a foreign state and one of our states should such a case ever arise and between a citizen and a foreign citizen or subject i do not conceive that any controversy can ever be decided in these courts between an american state and a foreign state without the consent of the parties if they consent provision is here made the disputes ought to be tried by the national tribunal this is consonant to the law of nations could there be a more favorable or eligible provision to avoid controversies   0 with foreign powers ought it to be put in the power of a member of the union to drag the whole community into war as the national tribunal is to decide justice will be done it appears to me from this review that though on some of the subjects of this jurisdiction it may seldom or never operate and though others be of inferior consideration yet they are mostly of great importance and indispensably necessary the second question which i proposed to consider was whether such organization be made as would be safe and convenient for the states and the people at large let us suppose that the subjects of its jurisdiction had only been enumerated and power given to the general legislature to establish such courts as might be judged necessary and expedient do not think that in that case any rational objection could be made to it any more than would be made to a general power of legislation in certain enumerated cases if that would be safe this appears to me better and more restrictive so far as it may be abused by extension of power the most material part is the discrimination of superior and inferior jurisdiction and the arrangement of its powers as where it shall have original and where appellate cognizance where it speaks of appellate jurisdiction it expressly provides that such regulations will be made as will accommodate every citizen so far as practicable in any government the principal criticism which has been made was against the appellate cognizance as well of fact as law i am happy that the honorable member who presides and who is familiarly acquainted with the subject does not think it involves any thing unnecessarily dangerous i think that the distinction of fact as well as law may be satisfied by the discrimination of the civil and common law but if gentlemen should contend that appeals as to fact can be extended to jury cases i contend that by the word regulations it is in the power of congress to prevent it or prescribe such a mode as will secure the privilege of jury trial they may make a regulation     to prevent such appeals entirely or they may remand the fact or send it to an inferior contiguous court to be tried or otherwise preserve that ancient and important trial let me observe that so far as the judicial power may extend to controversies between citizens of different states and so far as it gives them power to correct by another trial a verdict obtained by local prejudices it is favorable to those states who carry on commerce there are a number of commercial states who carry on trade for other states—should the states in debt to them make unjust regulations the justice that would be obtained by the creditors might be merely imaginary and nominal it might be either entirely denied or partially granted this is no imaginary evil before the war new york was to a great amount a creditor of connecticut while it depended on the laws and regulations of connecticut she might withhold payment if i be not misinformed there were reasons to complain these illiberal regulations and causes of complaint obstruct commerce so far as this power may be exercised virginia will be benefitted by it it appears to me from the most correct view that by the word regulations authority is given them to provide against the inconveniences and so far as it is exceptionable they can remedy it this they will do if they be worthy of the trust we put in them i think them worthy of that confidence which that paper puts in them were i to select a power which might be given with confidence it would be judicial power this power cannot be abused without raising the indignation of all the people of the states i cannot conceive that they would encounter this odium leaving behind them their character and friends and carrying with them local prejudices i cannot think they would run such a risk that men should be brought from all parts of the union to the seat of government on trivial occasions cannot reasonably be supposed it is a species of possibility but there is every degree of probability against it i would as soon believe that by virtue of the power of collecting taxes or customs they would     compel every man to go and pay the money for his taxes with his own hands to the federal treasurer as i would believe this if they would not do the one they would not the other i am of opinion and my reasoning and conclusions are drawn from facts that as far as the power of congress can extend the judicial power will be accommodated to every part of america under this conviction i conclude that the legislation instead of making the supreme federal court absolutely stationary will fix it in different parts of the continent to render it more convenient i think this idea perfectly warrantable there is an example within our knowledge which illustrates it by the confederation congress have an exclusive right of establishing rules for deciding in all cases what captures should be legal and establishing courts for determining such cases finally a court was established for that purpose which was at first stationary—experience and the desire of accommodating the decision of this court to the convenience of the citizens of the different parts of america had this effect—it soon became a regulation that this court should be held in different parts of america and was held accordingly if such a regulation was made when only the interest of the small number of people who are concerned with captures was affected will not the public convenience be consulted when that of a very considerable proportion of the people of america will be concerned it will be also in the power of congress to vest this power in the state courts both inferior and superior this they will do when they find the tribunals of the states established on a good footing another example will illustrate this subject further by the confederation congress are authorized to establish courts for trying piracies and felonies committed on the high seas did they multiply courts unnecessarily in this case no sir they invested the admiralty courts of each state with this jurisdiction now sir if there will be as much sympathy between congress and the people as now we may fairly conclude that the federal cognizance will be vested in the local tribunals     i have observed that gentlemen suppose that the general legislature will do every mischief they possibly can and that they will omit to do every thing good which they are authorized to do if this were a reasonable supposition their objections would be good i consider it reasonable to conclude that they will as readily do their duty as deviate from it nor do i go on the grounds mentioned by gentlemen on the other side—that we are to place unlimited confidence in them and expect nothing but the most exalted integrity and sublime virtue but i go on this great republican principle that the people will have virtue and intelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom is there no virtue among us if there be not we are in a wretched situation no theoretical checks—no form of government can render us secure to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea if there be sufficient virtue and intelligence in the community it will be exercised in the selection of these men so that we do not depend on their virtue or put confidence in our rulers but in the people who are to choose them having taken this general view on the subject i will now advert to what has fallen from the honorable gentleman who presides his criticism is that the judiciary has not been guarded from an increase of the salary of the judges i wished myself to insert a restraint on the augmentation as well as diminution of their compensation and supported it in the convention but i was overruled i must state the reasons which were urged they had great weight the business must increase if there was no power to increase their pay according to the increase of business during the life of the judges it might happen that there would be such an accumulation of business as would reduce the pay to a most trivial consideration this reason does not hold as to the president for in the short period which he presides this cannot happen his salary ought not therefore to be increased it was objected yesterday that there was no provision for a jury     from the vicinage if it could have been done with safety it would not have been opposed it might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the country suppose a rebellion in a whole district would it not be impossible to get a jury the trial by jury is held as sacred in england as in america—there are deviations of it in england yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence than have taken place there for a long time though it be left to the legislative discretion it is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from yet in some cases it is necessary it must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances this is a complete and satisfactory answer it was objected that this jurisdiction would extend to all cases and annihilate the state courts at this moment of time it might happen that there are many disputes between citizens of different states but in the ordinary state of things i believe that any gentlemen will think that the far greater number of causes—ninetynine out of an hundred will remain with the state judiciaries all controversies directly between citizen and citizen will still remain with the local courts the number of cases within the jurisdiction of these courts are very small when compared to those in which the local tribunals will have cognizance no accurate calculation can be made but i think that any gentleman who will contemplate the subject at all must be struck with this truth here mr madison spoke too low to be understood as to vexatious appeals they can be remedied by congress it would seldom happen that mere wantonness would produce such an appeal or induce a man to sue unjustly if the courts were on a good footing in the states what can induce them to take so much trouble i have frequently in the discussion of this subject been struck with one remark it has been urged that this would be oppressive to those who by imprudence or otherwise are under the denomination of debtors i know not how this can be conceived i will     venture one observation if this system should have the effect of establishing universal justice and accelerating it throughout america it will be one of the most fortunate circumstances that could happen for those men with respect to that class of citizens compassion is their due to those however who are involved in such incumbrances relief cannot be granted industry and economy are the only resources—it is vain to wait for money or temporise the great desiderata are public and private confidence no country in the world can do without them let the influx of money be ever so great if there be no confidence property will sink in value and there will be no inducements or emulation to industry the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money compare the situations of nations in europe where the justice is administered with celerity to that of those where it is refused or administered tardily confidence produces the best effects in the former the establishment of confidence will raise the value of property and relieve those who are so unhappy as to be involved in debts if this be maturely considered i think it will be found that as far as it will establish uniformity of justice it will be of real advantage to such persons i will not enter into those considerations which the honorable gentleman added i hope some other gentleman will undertake to answer june   —necessity for ratification  mr madison— mr chairman nothing has excited more admiration in the world than the manner in which free governments have been established in america for it was the     first instance from the creation of the world to the american revolution that free inhabitants have been seen deliberating on a form of government and selecting such of their citizens as possessed their confidence to determine upon and give effect to it but why has this excited so much wonder and applause because it is of so much magnitude and because it is liable to be frustrated by so many accidents if it has excited so much wonder that the united states have in the middle of war and confusion formed free systems of government how much more astonishment and admiration will be excited should they be able peaceably freely and satisfactorily to establish one general government when there is such a diversity of opinions and interests when not cemented or stimulated by any common danger how vast must be the difficulty of concentrating in one government the interests and conciliating the opinions of so many different heterogeneous bodies     how have the confederacies of ancient and modern times been formed as far as ancient history describes the former to us they were brought about by the wisdom of some eminent sage how was the imperfect union of the swiss cantons formed by danger how was the confederacy of the united netherlands formed by the same they are surrounded by dangers by these and one influential character they were stimulated to unite how was the germanic system formed by danger in some degree but principally by the overruling influence of individuals when we consider this government we ought to make great allowances we must calculate the impossibility that every state should be gratified in its wishes and much less that every individual should receive this gratification it has     never been denied by the friends of the paper on the table that it has effects but they do not think that it contains any real danger they conceive that they will in all probability be removed when experience will shew it to be necessary i beg that gentlemen in deliberating on this subject would consider the alternative either nine states shall have ratified it or they will not if nine states will adopt it can it be reasonably presumed or required that nine states having freely and fully considered the subject and come to an affirmative decision will upon the demand of a single state agree that they acted wrong and could not see its defect—tread back the steps which they have taken and come forward and reduce it to uncertainty whether a general system shall be adopted or not virginia has always heretofore spoken the language of respect to the other states and she has always been attended to will it be that language to call on a great majority of the states to acknowledge that they have done wrong is it the language of confidence to say that we do not believe that amendments for the preservation of the common liberty and general interests of the state will be consented to by them this is neither the language of confidence nor respect virginia when she speaks respectfully will be as much attended to as she has hitherto been when speaking this language it is a most awful thing that depends on our decision—no less than whether the thirteen states shall unite freely peaceably and unanimously for security of their common happiness and liberty or whether every thing is to be put in confusion and disorder are we to embark in this dangerous enterprise uniting various opinions to contrary interests with the vain hope of coming to an amicable concurrence it is worthy of our consideration that those who prepared the paper on the table found difficulties not to be described in its formation—mutual deference and concession were absolutely necessary had they been inflexibly tenacious of their individual opinions they would never have concurred     under what circumstances was it formed when no party was formed or particular proposition made and mens minds were calm and dispassionate yet under these circumstances it was difficult extremely difficult to agree to any general system suppose eight states only should ratify and virginia should propose certain alterations as the previous condition of her accession if they should be disposed to accede to her proposition which is the most favorable conclusion the difficulty attending it will be immense every state which has decided it must take up the subject again they must not only have the mortification of acknowledging that they had done wrong but the difficulty of having a reconsideration of it among the people and appointing new conventions to deliberate upon it they must attend to all the amendments which may be dictated by as great a diversity of political opinions as there are local attachments when brought together in one assembly they must go through and accede to every one of the amendments the gentlemen who within this house have thought proper to propose previous amendments have brought no less than forty amendments—a bill of rights which contains twenty amendments and twenty other alterations some of which are improper and inadmissible will not every state think herself equally entitled to propose as many amendments and suppose them to be contradictory i leave it to this convention whether it be probable that they can agree or agree to any thing but the plan on the table or whether greater difficulties will not be encountered than were experienced in the progress of the formation of the constitution i have said that there was a great contrariety of opinions among the gentlemen in the opposition it has been heard in every stage of their opposition i can see from their amendments that very great sacrifices have been made by some of them some gentlemen think that it contains too much state influence others that it is a complete consolidation   0 and a variety of other things some of them think that the equality in the senate is not a defect others that it is the bane of all good governments i might if there were time show a variety of other cases where their opinions are contradictory if there be this contrariety of opinions in this house what contrariety may not be expected when we take into view thirteen conventions equally or more numerous besides it is notorious from the debates which have been published that there is no sort of uniformity in the grounds of the opposition the state of new york has been adduced many in that state are opposed to it from local views the two who opposed it in the general convention from that state are in the state convention every step of this system was opposed by those two gentlemen they were unwilling to part with the old confederation can it be presumed then sir that gentlemen in this state who admit the necessity of changing should ever be able to unite in sentiments with those who are totally averse to any change i have revolved this question in my mind with as much serious attention and called to my aid as much information as i could yet i can see no reason for the apprehensions of gentlemen but i think that if virginia will agree to ratify this system i shall look upon it as one of the most fortunate events that ever happened for human nature i cannot therefore without the most excruciating apprehensions see a possibility of losing its blessings it gives me infinite pain to reflect that all the earnest endeavors of the warmest friends of their country to introduce a system promotive of our happiness may be blasted by a rejection for which i think with my honorable friend that previous amendments are but another name the gentlemen in opposition seem to insist on those amendments as if they were all necessary for the liberty and happiness of the people were i to hazard an opinion on the subject i would declare it infinitely more safe in its present form than it would be after introducing     into it that long train of alterations which they call amendments with respect to the proposition of the honorable gentleman to my left mr wythe gentlemen apprehend that by enumerating three rights it implied there were no more the observations made by a gentleman lately up on that subject correspond precisely with my opinion that resolution declares that the powers granted by the proposed constitution are the gift of the people and may be resumed by them when perverted to their oppression and every power not granted thereby remains with the people and at their will it adds likewise that no right of any denomination can be cancelled abridged restrained or modified by the general government or any of its officers except in those instances in which power is given by the constitution for these purposes there cannot be a more positive and unequivocal declaration of the principles of the adoption that every thing not granted is reserved this is obviously and selfevidently the case without the declaration—can the general government exercise any power not delegated if an enumeration be made of our rights will it not be implied that every thing omitted is given to the general government has not the honorable gentleman himself admitted that an imperfect enumeration is dangerous does the constitution say that they shall not alter the law of descents or do those things which would subvert the whole system of the state laws if he did what was not excepted would be granted does it follow from the omission of such restrictions that they can exercise powers not delegated the reverse of the proposition holds the delegation alone warrants the exercise of any power with respect to the amendments proposed by the honorable gentleman it ought to be considered how far they are good as far as they are palpably and insuperably objectionable they ought to be opposed one amendment he proposes is that any army which shall be necessary shall be raised by the consent of twothirds of the states i most devoutly wish     that there may never be an occasion for having a single regiment there can be no harm in declaring that standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty and ought to be avoided as far as it may be consistent with the protection of the community but when we come to say that the national security shall depend not on a majority of the people of america but that it may be frustrated by less than onethird of the people of america i ask if this be a safe or proper mode what part of the united states are most likely to stand in need of this protection the weak parts which are the southern states will it be safe to leave the united states at the mercy of onethird of the states a number which may comprise a very small proportion of the american people they may all be in that part of america which is least exposed to danger as far as a remote situation from danger would render exertions for public defence less active so far the southern states would be endangered the regulation of commerce he further proposed should depend on twothirds of both houses i wish i could recollect the history of this matter but i cannot call it to mind with sufficient exactness but i recollect the reasoning of some gentlemen on that subject it was said and i believe with truth that every part of america does not stand in equal need of security it was observed that the northern states were most competent to their own safety was it reasonable asked they that they should bind themselves to the defence of the southern states and still be left at the mercy of the minority for commercial advantages should it be in the power of the minority to deprive them of this and other advantages when they were bound to defend the whole union it might be a disadvantage for them to confederate these were his arguments this policy of guarding against political inconveniences by enabling a small part of the community to oppose the government and subjecting the majority to a small minority is fallacious in some cases it may be good in others it may be fatal in all cases it puts     it in the power of the minority to decide a question which concerns the majority i was struck with surprise when i head him express himself alarmed with respect to the emancipation of slaves let me ask if they should even attempt it if it will not be an usurpation of power there is no power to warrant it in that paper if there be i know it not but why should it be done says the honorable gentleman for the general welfare—it will infuse strength into our system can any member of this committee suppose that it will increase our strength can any one believe that the american councils will come into a measure which will strip them of their property discourage and alienate the affections of fivethirteenths of the union why was nothing of this sort aimed at before i believe such an idea never entered into any american breast nor do i believe it ever will enter into the heads of those gentlemen who substitute unsupported suspicions for reasons i am persuaded that the gentlemen who contend for previous amendments are not aware of the dangers which must result virginia after having made opposition will be obliged to recede from it might not the nine states say with a great deal of propriety—it is not proper decent or right in you to demand that we should reverse what we have done do as we have done—place confidence in us as we have done in one another—and then we shall freely fairly and dispassionately consider and investigate your propositions and endeavour to gratify your wishes but if you do not do this it is more reasonable that you should yield to us than we to you you cannot exist without us—you must be a member of the union the case of maryland instanced by the gentleman does not hold she would not agree to confederate because the other states would not assent to her claims of the western lands was she gratified no—she put herself like the rest nor has she since been gratified the lands are in the common stock of the union     as far as his amendments are not objectionable or unsafe so far they may be subsequently recommended not because they are necessary but because they can produce no possible danger and may gratify some gentlemens wishes but i never

the convention came to a final adjournment today the inclosed is a copy of their act of ratification with the yeas  nays a variety of amendments have been since recommended several of them highly objectionable but which could not be parried the minority are to sign an address this evening which is announced to be of a peacemaking complexion having not seen it i can give no opinion of my own i wish it may not have a further object mr h—y declared previous to the final question that altho he should submit as a quiet citizen he should seize the first moment that offered for shaking off the yoke in a constitutional way i suspect the plan will be to engage ⅔ of the legislatures in the task of undoing the work or to get a congress appointed in the first instance that will commit suicide on their own authority yrs most affecty  respectfy     james madison july  d      new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  n york july  d      my dear friend some of the letters herewith enclosed have been here for some time without my knowing it the others came to hand yesterday i have also in hand for you the marquis condorcets essai on the probability of decisions resulting from plurality of voices  which i understand from mazzei is a gift from the author i shall forward it by the first conveyance there are public letters just arrived from jefferson the contents are not yet known his private letters to me  others refer to his public political views i find that he is becoming more and more a friend to the new constitution his objections being gradually dispelled by his own further reflections on the subject he particularly renounces his opinion concerning the expediency of a ratification by    a refusal by   states considering the mode pursued by massts as the only rational one but disapproving some of the alterations recommended by that state he will see still more room for disapprobation in the reconsideration of other states the defects of the constitution which he continues to criticize are the omission of a bill of right and of the principle of rotation at least in the ex departmt congress have been some days on the question where the first meeting of the new congs shall be     placed philada failed by a single voice from delaware which ultimately aimed at that place but wished to bring wilmington into view in that vote n hampshire  connecticut both concurred n york is now in nomination and if those states accede which i think probable and rhode island which has as yet refused to sit in the question can be prevailed on to vote which i also think probable the point will be carried in this event a great handle i fear will be given to those who have opposed the new govt on account of the eastern preponderancy in the federal system yrs affely i enclose a copy of the ratification as proposed of n york what think you of some of the expository articles james madison july         new york edmund

there will be some of the most sanguine calculate on a ratification the best informed apprehend some clog that will amount to a condition the question is made peculiarly interesting in this place by its connexion with the question relative to the place to be recommended for the meeting of the first congress under the new government     thirteen states are at present represented a plan for setting this new machine in motion has been reported some days but will not be hurried to a conclusion having been but a little time here i am not yet fully in the politics of congress i had on the road several returns of a bilious lax which made my journey more tedious and less agreeable than it would otherwise have been—at present i am pretty well again hoping this will find you and yours more completely so i remain c james madison july         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  n york july         dear sir i have deferred writing since my arrival here in the hourly hope of being enabled to communicate the final news from poughkepsie by a letter from hamilton dated the day before yesterday i find that it is equally uncertain when the business will be closed and what will be its definitive form  the inclosed gazette states the form which the depending proposition bears it is not a little strange that the antifederal party should be reduced to such an expedient and yet be able to keep their numbers together in the opposition nor is it less strange that the other party as appears to be the case     should hesitate in deciding that the expedient as effectually keeps the state for ye present out of the new union as the most unqualified rejection could do the intelligent citizens see clearly that this would be its operation and are agitated by the double motives of federalism and a zeal to give this city a fair chance for the first meeting of the new government congress have deliberated in part on the arrangements for putting the new machine into operation but have concluded on nothing but the times for choosing electors c those who wish to make n york the place of meeting studiously promote delay others who are not swayed by this consideration do not urge dispatch they think it would be well to let as many states as possible have an opportunity of deciding on the constitution and what is of more consequence they wish to give opportunities where they can take place for as many elections of state legislatures as can precede a reasonable time for making the appointments and arrangements referred to them if there be too great an interval between the acts of congress on this subject and the next election or next meeting of a state legislature it may afford a pretext for an intermediate summoning of the existing members who are every where less federal than their successors hereafter to be elected will probably be this is particularly the case in maryland where the antifederal temper of the executive would render an intermediate and extraordinary meeting of the assembly of that state the     more likely to be called on my way thro maryland i found such an event to be much feared by the friends and wished by the adversaries of the constitution we have no late news from europe nor anything from n carolina with every sentiment of esteem  attachment i remain dr sir your obedt  affect servt james madison july         new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york july         dear sir the enclosed papers will give you a view of the business in the convention at poughkeepsie it is not as yet certain that the ratification will take any final shape that can make new york immediately a member of the new union the opponents cannot come to that point without yielding a complete victory to the federalists which must be a severe sacrifice of their pride it is supposed too that some of them would not be displeased at seeing a bar to the pretensions of this city to the first meeting of the new government on the other side the zeal for an unconditional ratification is not a little increased by contrary wishes there have been no late arrivals from europe nor any news from any quarter

dear sir your two last unacknowledged favors were of decr  0 and feby   they were received in virginia and no opportunity till the present precarious one by the way of holland has enabled me to thank you for them i returned here about ten days ago from richmond which i left a day or two after the dissolution of the convention the final question on the new government was put on the   th of june it was twofold   whether previous amendments should be made a condition of ratification   directly on the constitution in the form it bore on the first the decision was in the negative    being no  0 only ay on the second  definitive question the ratification was affirmed by    ays agst    noes a number of alterations were then recommended to be considered in the mode pointed out in the constitution itself the meeting was remarkably full two members only being absent and those known to be on the opposite sides of the question the debates also were conducted on the whole with a very laudable moderation and decorum and continued until both sides declared themselves ready for the question and it may be safely concluded that no irregular opposition to the system will follow in that state at least with the countenance of the leaders on that side what local eruptions may be occasioned by illtimed or rigorous executions of the treaty of     peace against british debtors i will not pretend to say but altho the leaders particularly h—y  m—s—n will give no countenance to popular violences it is not to be inferred that they are reconciled to the event or will give it a positive support on the contrary both of them declared they could not go that length and an attempt was made under their auspices to induce the minority to sign an address to the people which if it had not been defeated by the general moderation of the party would probably have done mischief among a variety of expedients employed by the opponents to gain proselytes mr  henry first and after him colo mason introduced the opinions expressed in a letter from a correspondent master donald or skipwith i believe and endeavored to turn the influence of your name even against parts of which i knew you approved in this situation i thought it due to truth as well as that it would be most agreeable to yourself and accordingly took the liberty to state some of your opinions on the favorable side i am informed that copies or extracts of a letter from you were handed about at the maryld convention with a like view of impeding the ratification n hampshire ratified the constitution on the  0th ult  and made the ninth state the votes stood    for and    agst the measure s carolina had previously ratified by a very great majority  the convention of n carolina is now sitting at one moment the sense of that state was considered     as strongly opposed to the system it is now said that the time has been for some time turning which with the example of other states and particularly of virginia prognosticates a ratification there also  the convention of new york has been in session ever since the   th ult without having yet arrived at any final vote two thirds of the members assembled with a determination to reject the constitution and are still opposed to it in their hearts the local situation of n york the number of ratifying states and the hope of retaining the federal government in this city afford however powerful arguments to such men as jay hamilton the chancellor  duane and several others and it is not improbable that some form of ratification will yet be devised by which the dislike of the opposition may be gratified and the state notwithstanding made a member of the new union at fredericksburg on my way hither i found the box with cork acorns sulla  peas addressed to me i immediately had it forwarded to orange from whence the contents will be disposed of according to your order i fear the advanced season will defeat the experiments the few seeds taken out here by the president at my request  sown in his garden have not come up i left directions in virginia for obtaining acorns of the willow oak this fall which shall be sent you as soon as possible col carrington tells me your request as to the philosophical     transactions was complied with in part only the  st volume being not to be had i have enquired of a delegate here from rhode island for further information concerning w s brown but can learn nothing precise i shall continue my enquiries and let you know hereafter the result july   —we just hear that the convention of this state have determined by a small majority to exclude from the ratification anything involving a condition  to content themselves with recommending the alterations wished for  as this will go by way of holland i

knowledge to thank you for your several favors and particularly for the pedometer answers to the letters must be put off for the next opportunity my last went off just as a vote was taken in the convention of this state which foretold the ratification of the new government the latter act soon followed and is inclosed the form of it is remarkable i inclose also a circular address to the other states on the subject of amendments from which mischiefs are apprehended the great danger in the present crisis is that if another convention should be soon assembled it would terminate in discord or in alterations of the federal system which would throw back essential powers into the state legislatures the delay of a few years will assuage the jealousies which have been artificially created by designing men and will at the same time point out the faults which really call for amendment at present the public mind is neither sufficiently cool nor sufficiently informed for so delicate an operation the convention of north carolina met on the   st ult not a word has yet been heard from its deliberations rhode island has not resumed the subject since it was referred to  rejected by the people in their several towns congress have been employed for several weeks on     the arrangement of times  place for bringing the new government into agency  the first has been agreed on though not definitively  make it pretty certain that the first meeting will be held in the third week in march the place has been a subject of much discussion and continues to be uncertain philada as least eccentric of any place capable of affording due accommodations and a respectable outset to the government was the first proposed the affirmative votes were n hampshire connecticut pena maryd virga and n carolina delaware was present  in favor of that place but one of its delegates wishing to have a question on wilmington previous to a final determination divided that state and negatived the motion n york came next in view to which was opposed first lancaster which failed and then baltimore which to the surprise of every body was carried by seven states s carolina which had preferred n york to the two other more southern positions unexpectedly concurring in this the vote however was soon rescinded the state of s carolina receding the eastern states remonstrating against and few seriously urging the eligibility of baltimore at present the question lies as it was originally supposed to do between n york  philada and nothing can be more uncertain than the event of it rhode island which alone was disposed     to give the casting vote to n york has refused to give any final vote for arranging  carrying into effect a system to which that state is opposed and both the delegates have returned home col carrington tells me he has sent you the first volume of the federalist and adds the  d by this conveyance i believe i never have yet mentioned  to you that publication it was undertaken last fall by jay hamilton and myself the proposal came from the two former the execution was thrown by the sickness of jay mostly on the two others though carried on in concert the writers are not mutually answerable for all the ideas of each other there being seldom time for even a perusal of the pieces by any but the writer before they were wanted at the press and sometimes hardly by the writer himself i have not a moment for a line to mazzei tell him i have recd his books  shall attempt to get them disposed of i fear his calculations will not be fulfilled by the demand for them here in the french language his affair with dorhman stands as it did of his affair with foster webb i can say nothing i suspect it will turn out badly yrs affecly james madison august         new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york august         dear sir the length of the interval since my last has proceeded from a daily expectation of being able to     communicate the arrangements for introducing the new government the times necessary to be fixed by congress have been many days agreed on the place of meeting has undergone many vicissitudes and is still as uncertain as ever philadelphia was first named by a member from connecticut and was negatived by the voice of one from delaware who wished to make an experiment for wilmington new york came next into view lancaster was opposed to it and failed baltimore was next tried and to the surprize of every one had seven votes south carolina joining the southern states and pennsylvania in the question it was not difficult to foresee that such a vote could not stand accordingly the next day new york carried it on a second trial and at present fills the blank its success however was owing to rhode island whose delegates have refused to vote on the final question and have actually gone home there are not at present seven states for any place and the result must depend unless rhode island should return with instructions as is given out on the comparative flexibility of the northern and southern delegations in ordinary cases this would not augur well to the latter in the existing one something may be hoped from the palpable unreasonableness of the pretensions of n york which has    reps    senators on one side agst    reps     senators on the other which is not more than three hundred miles from the eastern extreme metropolis and not less than   times that distance from the southern and which     has no reference at all to the accommodation of the western country i am persuaded also that if the first position be taken here the second will not be taken on the potowmac  that this consideration is among the motives of those who advocate n york indeed i know the latter to be one of the motives james madison augst         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york augst          dear sir i have been duly favored with yours of the  d instant the length of the interval since my last has proceeded from a daily expectation of being able to communicate the final arrangement for introducing the new government the place of meeting has undergone much discussion as you conjectured and still remains to be fixed philada was first named  negatived by a voice from delaware n york came forward next lancaster was opposed to it  failed baltimore was next tried and to the surprise of every one had seven votes it was easy to see that that ground had it been free from objection was not maintainable accordingly the next day n york was inserted in the place of it with the aid of the vote of rhode island rhode island has refused to give a final vote in the business and has actually retired from congress the question will now be resumed between n york  philada it was much to be     wished that a fit place for a respectable outset to the govt could be found more central than either the former is inadmissible if any regard is to be had to the southern or western country it is so with me for another reason that it tends to stop the final  permanent seat short of the potowmac certainly and probably in the state of n jersey i know this to be one of the views of the advocates for n york the only chance the potowmac has is to get things in such a train that a coalition may take place between the southern  eastern states on the subject and still more than the final seat may be undecided for two or three years within which period the western  s western population will enter more into the estimate wherever congress may be the choice if speedily made will not be sufficiently by that consideration in this point of view i am of opinion baltimore would have been unfriendly to the true object it would have retained congress but a moment so many states being north of it and dissatisfied with it and would have produced a coalition among those states  a precipitate election of the permanent seat  an intermediate removal to a more northern position you will have seen the circular letter from the convention of this state it has a most pestilent tendency if an early general convention cannot be parried it is seriously to be feared that the system which has resisted so many direct attacks may be at last successfully undermined by its enemies it is now perhaps to be wished that rho island may not   0 accede till this new crisis of danger be over  some think it would have been better if even n york had held out till the operation of the government could have dissipated the fears which artifice had created and the attempts resulting from those fears  artifices we hear nothing yet from n carolina more than comes by way of petersburg with highest respect  attachment i remain dr sir your affecte servt aug       new york james madison to james

bringing it before congress if that should be proper mr r morris i am told will be here soon and i shall endeavor then to supply the omitted circumstances in the mean time mr triplet may either make out a fuller statement  forward it or wait till he hears from me on the subject i have had no opportunity of doing any thing as to anthony since my last john continues to decline i think he is in a consumption and will not stand it very long no late news of consequence has come from europe the war appears to be going on between the two imperial courts  the turks and the affairs     of france portend a serious struggle between the royal authority  the spirit of liberty we just learn the fate of the constitution in n carolina rho island is however her only associate in the opposition and it will be hard indeed if those two states should endanger a system which has been ratified by the eleven others congress have not yet finally settled the arrangements for putting the new government in operation the place for its first meeting excites the difficulty the eastern states with n york contend for this city illegible of the other states unite on a more central position tell my brother

the   th the effect of clintons circular letter in virga does not surprise me  it is a signal of concord and hope to the     enemies of the constitution every where and will i fear prove extremely dangerous notwithstanding your remarks on the subject i cannot but think that an early convention will be an unavoided measure it will evidently be the offspring of party  passion and will probably for that reason alone be the parent of error and public injury it is pretty clear that a majority of the people of the union are in favor of the constitution as it stands or at least are not dissatisfied with it in pt form or if this be not the case it is at least clear that a greater proportion unite in that system than are likely to unite in any other theory should radical alterations take place therefore they will not result from the deliberate sense of the people but will be obtained by management or extorted by menaces and will be a real sacrifice of the public will as well as of the public good to the views of individuals  perhaps the ambition of the state legislature congress have come to no final decision as to the place for convening the new governt it is unfortunate because a question now between n  south and notwithstanding the palpable unreasonableness of the thing an adherence to n york in preference to any more central position seems to grow stronger  stronger and upon grounds which tend to keep congress here till a permanent seat be established in this point of view i own the business has a serious aspect considering the injustice  oppression to the s western and western parts of the union yr afect     james madison augst         new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mad mss  new york augst         dear sir my last went via england in the hands of a swiss gentleman who had married an american lady and was returning with her to his own country he proposed to take paris in his way by that opportunity i inclosed copies of the proceedings of this state on the subject of the constitution north carolina was then in convention and it was generally expected would in some form or other have fallen into the general stream the event has disappointed us it appears that a large majority has decided against the constitution as it stands and according to the information here received has made the alterations proposed by virginia the conditions on which alone that state will unite with the others whether this be the precise state of the case i cannot say it seems at least certain that she has either rejected the constitution or annexed conditions precedent to her ratification it cannot be doubted that this bold step is to be ascribed in part to the influence of the minority in virginia which lies mostly in the southern part of the state and to the management of its leader it is in part ascribed also by some to assurances transmitted from leading individuals here that new york would set the example of rejection the event whatever may have been its cause with the tendency of the circular letter from the convention of n york has somewhat changed the aspect of things and has given     fresh hopes and exertions to those who opposed the constitution the object with them now will be to effect an early convention composed of men who will essentially mutilate the system particularly in the article of taxation without which in my opinion the system cannot answer the purposes for which it was intended an early convention is in every view to be dreaded in the present temper of america a very short period of delay would produce the double advantage of diminishing the heat and increasing the light of all parties a trial for one year will probably suggest more real amendments than all the antecedent speculations of our most sagacious politicians congress have not yet decided on the arrangements for inaugurating the new government the place of its first meeting continues to divide the northern and southern members though with a few exceptions to these general descriptions of the parties the departure of rho island and the refusal of n carolina in consequence of the late event there to vote in the question threatens a disagreeable issue to the business there being now an apparent impossibility of obtaining seven states for any one place the three eastern states  n york reinforced by s carolina and as yet by n jersey give a plurality of votes in favor of this city the advocates for a more central position however though less numerous seemed very determined not to yield to what they call a shameful partiality to one extremity of the continent it will be certainly of     far more importance under the proposed than the present system that regard should be had to centrality whether we consider the number of members belonging to the government the diffusive manner in which they will be appointed or the increased resort of individuals having business with the legislative executive  judiciary departments if the western country be taken into view as it certainly ought the reasoning is still further corroborated there is good ground to believe that a very jealous  eye will be kept in that quarter on inattention to it and particularly when involving a seeming advantage to the eastern states which have been rendered extremely suspicious and obnoxious by the mississippi project there is even good ground to believe that spain is taking advantage of this disgust in kentucky and is actually endeavoring to seduce them from the union holding out a darling object which will never be obtained by them as part of the union this is a fact as certain as it is important but which i hint in strict confidence and with a request that no suspicion may be excited of its being known particularly thro the channel of me i have this moment notice that i must send off my letter instantly or lose the conveyance i must consequently defer further communications till another opportunity along with this you will receive a copy of the report you desired from mr thomson and a copy of the federalist a publication mentioned in my last     james madison augst         new york george washington to george washington wash mss  new york augst         dear sir— i was yesterday favored with yours of the   th   th under the same cover with the papers from mr pleasants the circular letter from this state is certainly a matter of as much regret as the unanimity with which it passed is matter of surprize i find it is every where and particularly in virginia laid hold of as the signal for united exertions in pursuit of early amendments in pennsylva the antifederal leaders are i understand soon to have a meeting at harrisburg in order to concert proper arrangements on the part of that state i begin now to accede to the opinion which has been avowed for some time by many that the circumstances involved in the ratification of new york will prove more injurious than a rejection would have done the latter wd have rather alarmed the well meaning antifederalists elsewhere would have had no ill effect on the other party would have excited the indignation of the neighbouring states and would have been necessarily followed by a speedy reconsideration of the subject i am not able to account for the concurrence of the federal part of the convention in the circular address on any other principle than the determination to purchase an immediate ratification in any form or at any price rather than disappoint this city of a chance for the new congress this solution is sufficiently justified by the eagerness displayed on this point and the evident disposition to risk and sacrifice everything to it unfortunately the disagreeable question continues to be undecided and is now in a state more perplexing than ever by the last vote taken the whole arrangement was thrown out and the departure of rho island  the refusal of n carolina to participate further in the business has left eleven states only to take it up anew in this number there are not seven states for any place and the disposition to relax as usually happens decreases with the progress of the contest what and when the issue is to be is really more than i can foresee it is truly mortifying that the outset of     the new government should be immediately preceded by such a display of locality as portends the continuance of the evil which has dishonored the old and gives countenance to some of the most popular arguments which have been inculcated by the southern antifederalists new york has appeared to me extremely objectionable on the following grounds it violates too palpably the simple and obvious principle that the seat of public business should be made as equally convenient to every part of the public as the requisite accommodations for executing the business will permit this consideration has the more weight as well on account of the catholic spirit professed by the constitution as of the increased resort which it will require from every quarter of the continent it seems to be particularly essential that an eye should be had in all our public arrangements to the accommodation of the western country which perhaps cannot be sufficiently gratified at any rate but which might be furnished with new fuel to its jealousy by being summoned to the sea shore  almost at one end of the continent there are reasons but of too confidential a nature for any other than verbal communication which make it of critical importance that neither cause nor pretext should be given for distrusts in that quarter of the policy towards it in this i have apprehended also that a preference so favorable to the eastern states would be represented in the southern as a decisive proof of the preponderance of that scale and a justification of all the antifederal arguments drawn from that danger adding to all this the recollection that the first year or two will produce all the great arrangements under the new system and which may fix its tone for a long time to come it seems of real importance that the temporary residence of the new congress apart from its relation to the final residence should not be thrown too much towards one extremity of the union it may perhaps be the more necessary to guard agst suspicions of partiality in this case as the early measures of the new government including a navigation act will of course be most favorable to this extremity     but i own that i am much influenced by a view to the final residence which i conceive to be more likely to be properly chosen in philada than in new york the extreme excentricity of the latter will certainly in my opinion bring on a premature and consequently an improper choice this policy is avowed by some of the sticklers for this place and is known to prevail with the bulk of them people from the interior parts of georgia s c n c  va  kentucky will never patiently repeat their trips to this remote situation especially as the legislative sessions will be held in the winter season should no other consequence take place than a frequent or early agitation of this contentious subject it would form a strong objection agst n york were there reason to fear a repugnance to the establishment of a final seat or a choice of a commercial city for the purpose i should be strongly tempted to shun philad at all events but my only fear on the first head is of a precipitancy in carrying that part of the federal constitution into effect and on the second the public sentiment as well as other considerations is so fixedly opposed as to banish the danger from my apprehensions judging from my own experience on this subject i conclude that from motives of one sort or another ten states at least that is   from each end of the union to say nothing of the western states will at any proper time be ready to remove from philada the only difficulty that can arise will be that of agreeing on the place to be finally removed to and it is from that difficulty alone and the delay incident to it that i derive my hope in favor of the banks of the potowmac there are some other combinations on the subject into which the discussion of it has led me but i have already troubled you with more i fear than may deserve your attention the newspapers herewith inclosed contain the european intelligence brought by the last packets from england with every sentiment of esteem  attachment i remain dear sir your obedt  affecte servt     sepr        new york james madison to james madison mad

last the current intelligence you will find in the inclosed gazettes the antifederalists are everywhere exerting themselves for an early convention the circular letter from this state and the rejection of n carolina give them great spirits virginia i suppose from the temper of the present legislature will cooperate in the plan congress have not yet settled the place for the meeting of the new govt it is most probable that the advocates for n york who form at present the greater number will prevail in that case altho i think it a very unreasonable thing for the southn  western parts of the union the best face must be put on it i have not yet been able to determine whether anthony is still in philada i am inclined to believe he is not indeed some circumstances wd almost tempt me to think he never has been there on this supposition john must have practiced a gross deception on us he could have no motive for this unless it were a spite to billey which i fancy he entertained but the deception could hardly promise a gratification that would prompt it he is still very sick and his recovery not very probable i find on enquiry that the loan office certificates   0 which i told you i had only mislaid not lost must go to n carolina for settlement if an oppy offers i shall accordingly send them thither unless otherwise directed by you—i have not yet seen mr morris  have

for the new govt which i wished to give you the earliest notice of this subject has long employed congs and has in its progress assumed a variety of shapes some of them not a little perplexing the times as finally settled are jany for the choice of electors feby for the choice of a president and march for the meeting of the congress the place the present seat of the fedl govt the last point was carried by the yielding of the smaller to the inflexibility of the greater number i have myself been ready for bringing it to this issue for some time perceiving that further delay could only discredit congs and injure the object in view those who had opposed n york along with me could not overcome their repugnance so soon maryland went away before the question was decided in     a temper which i believe would never have yielded delaware was equally inflexible previous to our final assent a motion was made which tendered a blank for any place the majority would choose between the north river and the potowmac this being rejected the alternative remaining was to agree to n york or to strangle the govt in its birth the former as the lesser evil was of course preferred and must now be made the best of i acknowledge at the same time that i anticipate serious inconveniences from it it will i fear be regarded as at once a proof of a preponderancy in the eastern scale and of a disposition to profit of that advantage it is but just however to remark that the event is in great degree to be charged on the southn states which went into that scale it will certainly entail the discussion on the new governt which ought if possible to be exempt from such an additional cause of ferment in its councils n york will never be patiently suffered to remain even the temporary seat of govt by those who will be obliged to resort to it from the western  southn parts of the union this temporary period must continue for several years perhaps seven or eight and within that period all the great business of the union will be settled i take it for granted that the first session will not pass without a renewal of the question and that it will be attended with all the unpleasing circumstances which have just been experienced in the last place i consider the decision in favor of n york as in a manner fatal to the just pretensions of the potowmac to the permanent seat of     the govt this is unquestionably the light in which many of the advocates for n york view the matter the legislature of n jersey which lately met approved of the part taken by her delegates on the principle that the first meeting of the govt at n york would give the best possible chance for an early choice of the permanent seat as this would do for a preference of trenton as the case now stands the susquehanna is probably the most that can be hoped for with no small danger of being stopped on the delaware had any place south of the delaware been obtained the susquehannah at least would have been secured with a favorable chance for the potowmac the result of the meeting at harrisburg is i am told in the press  will of course be soon before the public i am not acquainted with the particulars or indeed with the general complexion of it it has been said here that the meeting was so thin as to disappoint much the patrons of the scheme i am glad to hear that mazzeis book is likely to be vendible the copies allotted for this and several other markets will not i fear be so fortunate yrs affecly james madison septr         new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mad mss  new york septr         dear sir being informed of a circuitous opportunity to france i make use of it to forward the inclosures by one of them you will find that congress have     been at length brought into the true policy which is demanded by the situation of the western country an additional resolution on the secret  journal puts an end to all negociation with spain referring the subject of a treaty after this assertion of right to the mississippi to the new government  the communication in my last will have shewn you the crisis of things in that quarter a crisis however not particularly known to congress and will be a key to some of the kentucky toasts in the virga gazette the circular letter from the new york convention has rekindled an ardor among the opponents of     the federal constitution for an immediate revision of it by another general convention you will find in one of the papers inclosed the result of the consultations in pennsylvania on that subject mr henry and his friends in virginia enter with great zeal into the scheme governor randolph also espouses it but with a wish to prevent if possible danger to the article which extends the power of the government to internal as well as external taxation it is observable that the views of the pennsylva meeting do not rhyme very well with those of the southern advocates for a convention the objects most eagerly pursued by the latter being unnoticed in the harrisburg proceedings the effect of the circular letter on other states is less known i conclude that it will be the same everywhere among those who opposed the constitution or contended for a conditional ratification of it whether an early convention will be the result of this united effort is more than can at this moment be foretold the measure will certainly be industriously opposed in some parts of the union not only by those who wish for no alterations but by others who would prefer the other mode provided in the constitution as most expedient at present for introducing those supplemental safeguards to liberty agst which no objections can be raised and who would moreover approve of a convention for amending the frame of the government itself as soon as time shall have somewhat corrected the feverish state of the public mind and trial have pointed its attention to the true defects of the system     you will find also by one of the papers inclosed that the arrangements have been compleated for bringing the new government into action the dispute concerning the place of its meeting was the principal cause of delay the eastern states with n jersey  s carolina being attached to n york and the others strenuous for a more central position philadelphia wilmington lancaster  baltimore were successively tendered without effect by the latter before they finally yielded to the superiority of members in favor of this city i am afraid the decision will give a great handle to the southern antifederalists who have inculcated a jealousy of this end of the continent it is to be regretted also as entailing this pernicious question on the new congs who will have enough to do in adjusting the other delicate matters submitted to them another consideration of great weight with me is that the temporary residence here will probably end in a permanent one at trenton or at the farthest on the susquehannah a removal in the first instance beyond the delaware would have removed the alternative to the susquehannah and the potowmac the best chance of the latter depends on a delay of the permanent establishment for a few years untill the western and south western population comes more into view this delay cannot take place if so excentric a place as n york is to be the intermediate seat of business to the other papers is added a little pamphlet on the mohegan language the observations deserve     the more attention as they are made by a man of known learning and character and may aid researches into the primitive structure of language as well as those on foot for comparing the american tribes with those on the eastern frontier of the other continent in consequence of your letter to mr jay on the subject of outfit c i had a conference with him and he agreed to suggest the matter to congress this was done and his letter referred back to be reported on the idea between us was that the reference should be to  a committee his letter coming in at a moment when i happened to be out it was as in course referred to his department his answer suggested that as he might be thought eventually concerned in the question it was most proper for the consideration of a committee i had discovered that he was not struck with the peculiarities of your case even when insinuated to him how far the committee will be so is more than i can yet say in general i have no doubt that both it and congress are well disposed but it is probable that the idea of a precedent will beget much caution and what is worse there is little probability of again having a quorum of states for the business i learn from virginia that our crops both of corn  tobacco except in the lower country where a storm has been hurtful are likely to be very good the latter has suffered in some degree from superflous     rains but the former has been proportionally benefited accept my most fervent wishes for your happiness yrs affecty james madison octr  th      new york philip mazzei to philip mazzei  new york octr  th      dear sir i have been favored with several letters from you since the date of my last but some of them having been recd in virginia i am not able now to acknowledge all of them by their respective dates the date of the last was in may you ask me why i agreed to the constitution proposed by the convention of philada i answer because i thought it safe to the liberties of the people and the best that could be obtained from the jarring interests of states and the miscellaneous opinions of politicians and because experience has proved that the real danger to america  to liberty lies in the defect of energy  stability in the present establishments of the united states—had you been a member of that assembly and been impressed with the truths which our situation discloses you would have concurred in the necessity which was felt by the other members in your closet at paris and with     the evils resulting from too much government all over europe fully in your view it is natural for you to run into criticisms dictated by an extreme on that side perhaps in your situation i should think and feel as you do in mine i am sure you would think and feel as i do to the paragraph in your letter of the  th of may on the subject of a mission to holland or italy i can say nothing more than that it is a business which belongs now to the new govt or if i were to say more my friendship would guard you agst any reliance on such an event in the first place nothing can be more uncertain than the nature of the system which will be adopted with regard to foreign affairs and in the next place activity is a sort of merit which prejudice rates too high to be outweighed by any other sort of merit the americans are an enlightened and liberal people compared with other nations but they are not all philosophers i have recd the copies of your book and have taken the measures proper for disposing of them the number allowed to virginia are selling there i am told very well i am afraid the other portions will not be equally successful the french language is the greater obstacle as many who can read it expect the work will be translated into a language they can read still better derliman tells he means to remit you forthwith via london about £ 00 sterling if he does and i flatter myself he will not fail it will pass thro the hands of mr jefferson his affairs here do not produce     ready means but i hope you will be ultimately secured agst loss are we ever to see you again in america here or elsewhere god bless you james madison ocr         new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mad mss  new york ocr         dear sir— i have written a number of letters to you since my return here and shall add this by another casual opportunity just notified to me by mr st john your favor of july    came to hand the day before yesterday the pamphlets of the marquis condorcet  mr dupont referred to in it have also been received your other letters inclosed to the delegation have been and will be disposed of as you wish particularly those to mr eppes  col lewis nothing has been done on the subject of the outfit there not having been a congress of nine states for some time nor even of seven for the last week it is pretty certain that there will not again be a quorum of either number within the present year and by no means certain that there will be one at all under the old confederation the committee finding that nothing could be done have neglected to make a report as yet i have spoken with a member of it in order to get one made that the case may fall of course and in a favorable shape within the attention of the new government the fear of a precedent will probably lead to an allowance for a limited time of the salary  as enjoyed originally by foreign ministers in preference to a separate allowance for outfit one of the members of the treasury board who ought if certain facts have not escaped his memory to witness the reasonableness of your calculations takes occasion i find to impress a contrary idea   0 fortunately his influence will not be a very formidable obstacle to right the states which have adopted the new constitution are all proceeding to the arrangements for putting it into action in march next pennsylva alone has as yet actually appointed deputies  that only for the senate my last mention that these were mr r morris  a mr mcclay how the other elections there  elsewhere will run is matter of uncertainty the presidency alone unites the conjectures of the public the vice president is not at all marked out by the general voice as the president will be from a southern state it falls almost of course for the other part of the continent to supply the next in rank south carolina may however think of mr rutledge unless it should be previously discovered that votes will be wasted on him the only candidates in the northern states brought forward with their known consent are handcock  and adams and between these it seems probable the question will lie both of them are objectionable  would i think be postponed by the general suffrage to several others if they would accept the place handcock is weak ambitious a courtier of popularity given to low intrigue and lately reunited by a factious friendship with s adams j adams has made himself obnoxious to many particularly in the southern states by the political principles avowed in his book others recollecting his cabal during the war against general washington knowing his extravagant selfimportance and considering his preference of an unprofitable dignity to some place of emolument better adapted to private fortune as a proof of his having an eye to the presidency conclude that he would not be a very cordial second to the general and that an impatient ambition might even intrigue for a premature advancement the danger would be the greater if particular factious characters as may be the case should get into the public councils adams it appears is not unaware of some of the obstacles to his wish and thro a letter     to smith has thrown out popular sentiments as to the proposed president the little pamphlet herewith inclosed will give you a collective view of the alterations which have been proposed for the new constitution various and numerous as they appear they certainly omit many of the true grounds of opposition the articles relating to treaties to paper money and to contracts created more enemies than all the errors in the system positive  negative put together it is true nevertheless that not a few particularly in virginia have contended for the proposed alterations from the most honorable  patriotic motives and that among the advocates for the constitution there are some who wish for further guards to public liberty  individual rights as far as these may consist of a constitutional declaration of the most essential rights it is probable they will be added though there are many who think such addition unnecessary and not a few who think it misplaced in such a constitution there is scarce any point on which the party in opposition is so much divided as to its importance and its propriety my own opinion has always been in favor of a bill of rights provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration at the same time i have never thought the omission a material defect nor been anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment for any other reason than that it is anxiously desired by others i have favored it because i supposed it might be of use and if properly executed could not be of disservice i have not viewed it in an important light—  because i conceive that in a certain degree though not in the extent argued by mr wilson the rights in question are reserved by the manner in which the federal powers are granted   because there is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude i am sure that the rights of conscience in particular if submitted to public definition would be narrowed much more than they are likely ever to     be by an assumed power one of the objections in new england was that the constitution by prohibiting religious tests opened a door for jews turks  infidels   because the limited powers of the federal government and the jealousy of the subordinate governments afford a security which has not existed in the case of the state governments and exists in no other   because experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights on those occasions when its controul is most needed repeated violations of these parchment barriers have been committed by overbearing majorities in every state in virginia i have seen the bill of rights violated in every instance where it has been opposed to a popular current notwithstanding the explicit provision contained in that instrument for the rights of conscience it is well known that a religious establishment wd have taken place in that state if the legislative majority had found as they expected a majority of the people in favor of the measure and i am persuaded that if a majority of the people were now of one sect the measure would still take place and on narrower ground than was then proposed notwithstanding the additional obstacle which the law has since created wherever the real power in a government lies there is the danger of oppression in our governments the real power lies in the majority of the community and the invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended not from acts of government contrary to the sense of its constituents but from acts in which the government is the mere instrument of the major number of the constituents this is a truth of great importance but not yet sufficiently attended to and is probably more strongly impressed on my mind by facts and reflections suggested by them than on yours which has contemplated abuses of power issuing from a very different quarter whereever there is an interest and power to do wrong wrong will generally be done and not less readily by a powerful  interested party than by a powerful and interested prince the difference so far as it relates to the superiority of republics     over monarchies lies in the less degree of probability that interest may prompt more abuses of power in the former than in the latter and in the security in the former agst an oppression of more than the smaller part of the society whereas in the former latter it may be extended in a manner to the whole the difference so far as it relates to the point in question—the efficacy of a bill of rights in controuling abuses of power—lies in this that in a monarchy the latent force of the nation is superior to that of the sovereign and a solemn charter of popular rights must have a great effect as a standard for trying the validity of public acts and a signal for rousing  uniting the superior force of the community whereas in a popular government the political and physical power may be considered as vested in the same hands that is in a majority of the people and consequently the tyrannical will of the sovereign is not to be controuled by the dread of an appeal to any other force within the community what use then it may be asked can a bill of rights serve in popular governments i answer the two following which though less essential than in other governments sufficiently recommend the precaution   the political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free government and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment counteract the impulses of interest and passion   altho it be generally true as above stated that the danger of oppression lies in the interested majorities of the people rather than in usurped acts of the government yet there may be occasions on which the evil may spring from the latter source and on such a bill of rights will be a good ground for an appeal to the sense of the community perhaps too there may be a certain degree of danger that a succession of artful and ambitious rulers may by gradual  well timed advances finally erect an independent government on the subversion of liberty should this danger exist at all it is prudent to guard agst it especially when the precaution can do no injury at the same time i     must own that i see no tendency in our governments to danger on that side it has been remarked that there is a tendency in all governments to an augmentation of power at the expence of liberty but the remark as usually understood does not appear to me well founded power when it has attained a certain degree of energy and independence goes on generally to further degrees but when below that degree the direct tendency is to further degrees of relaxation until the abuses of liberty beget a sudden transition to an undue degree of power with this explanation the remark may be true and in the latter sense only is it in my opinion applicable to the governments in america it is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally exposed to danger whether the government have too much or too little power and that the line which divides these extremes should be so inaccurately defined by experience supposing a bill of rights to be proper the articles which ought to compose it admit of much discussion i am inclined to think that absolute restrictions in cases that are doubtful or where emergencies may overrule them ought to be avoided the restrictions however strongly marked on paper will never be regarded when opposed to the decided sense of the public and after repeated violations in extraordinary cases they will lose even their ordinary efficacy should a rebellion or insurrection alarm the people as well as the government and a suspension of the hab corp be dictated by the alarm no written prohibitions on earth would prevent the measure should an army in time of peace be gradually established in our neighborhood by britn or spain declarations on paper would have as little effect in preventing a standing force for the public safety the best security agst these evils is to remove the pretext for them with regard to monopolies they are justly classed among the greatest nuisances in government but is it clear that as encouragements to literary works and ingenious discoveries they are not too valuable to be wholly renounced would it not suffice to reserve in all     cases a right to the public to abolish the privilege at a price to be specified in the grant of it is there not also infinitely less danger of this abuse in our governments than in most others monopolies are sacrifices of the many to the few where the power is in the few it is natural for them to sacrifice the many to their own partialities and corruptions where the power as with us is in the many not in the few the danger cannot be very great that the few will be thus favored it is much more to be dreaded that the few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many i inclose a paper containing the late proceedings in kentucky i wish the ensuing convention may take no step injurious to the character of the district and favorable to the views of those who wish ill to the u states one of my late letters communicated some circumstances which will not fail to occur on perusing the objects of the proposed convention in next month perhaps however there may be less connection between the two cases than at first one is ready to conjecture i am dr sir with the sincerest esteem  affectn yours james madison october         new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  new york october         dear sir i have a letter from mazzei  one from mr jefferson which you will be good enough to dispose of i have one from the former in which he begs me to add my importunities to you and mr blair for speedy succour if possible i have one from the latter but it contains nothing of much consequence his public letters to which it refers have not yet been communicated from the office of foreign affairs through other authentic channels i learn that the states     general will pretty certainly be convened in may next the efficacy of that cure for the public maladies will depend materially on the mode in which the deputies may be selected which appears to be not yet settled there is good reason also to presume that as the spirit which at present agitates the nation has been in a great measure caught from the american revolution so the result of the struggle there will be not a little affected by the character which liberty may receive from the experiment now on foot here the tranquil and successful establishment of a great reform by the reason of the community must give as much force to the doctrines urged on one side as a contrary event would do to the policy maintained on the other as col carrington will be with you before this gets to hand i leave it with him to detail all matters of a date previous to his departure of a subsequent date i recollect nothing worth adding i requested him also to confer with you in full confidence on the appointments to the senate and house of representatives so far as my friends may consider me in relation to either he is fully possessed of my real sentiments and will explain them more conveniently than can be done on paper i mean not to decline an agency in launching the new government if such should be assigned me in one of the houses and i prefer the house of representatives chiefly because if i can render any service there it can only be to the public and not even in imputation to myself at the same time my preference i     own is somewhat founded on the supposition that the arrangements for the popular elections may secure me against any competition which would require on my part any step that would speak a solicitude which i do not feel or have the appearance of a spirit of electioneering which i despise i am led not only by a want of matter but by a cut i

suggest though the wounds given to some  the pretexts given to others by the proceedings which rendered them necessary will not i fear be radically removed the light in which the temporary seat of the new government is viewed  represented by those who were governed by antecedent jealousies of this end of the union is a natural one and the apprehension of it was among the most persuasive reasons with me for contending with some earnestness for a less eccentric position a certain degree of impartiality or the appearance of it is necessary in the most despotic governments in republics this may be considered as the vital principle of the administration and in a federal republic     founded on local distinctions involving local jealousies it ought to be attended to with a still more scrupulous exactness i am glad to find you concurring in the requisite expedients for preventing anti federal elections and a premature convention the circular letter from this state has united and animated the efforts on the adverse side with respect to both these points an early convention threatens discord and mischief it will be composed of the most heterogeneous characters—will be actuated by the party spirit reigning among their constituents—will comprehend men having insidious designs agst the union—and can scarcely therefore terminate in harmony or the public good let the enemies to the system wait until some experience shall have taken place and the business will be conducted with more light as well as with less heat in the mean time the other mode of amendments may safely be employed to quiet the fears of many by supplying those further guards for private rights which can do no harm to the system in the judgment even of its most partial friends and will even be approved by others who have steadily supported it it appears from late foreign intelligence that war is likely to spread its flames still farther among the unfortunate inhabitants of the old world france is certainly enough occupied already with her internal fermentations at present the struggle is merely between the aristocracy and the monarchy the only chance in favor of the people lies in the mutual     attempts of the competitors to make their side of the question the popular one the late measures of the court have that tendency the nobility and clergy who wish to accelerate the states general wish at the same time to have it formed on the antient model established on the feudal idea which excluded the people almost altogether the court has at length agreed to convene this assembly in may but is endeavouring to counteract the aristocratic policy by admitting the people to a greater share of representation in both the parties there are some real friends to liberty who will probably take advantage of circumstances to promote their object of this description on the anti court side is our friend the marquis it is not true i believe that he is in the bastile but true that he is in

eastern equity  impartiality whether much noise will be made will depend on the policy which mr henry may find it convenient to adopt as n york is at the head of his party he may be induced by that circumstance not to make irritating reflections though the fact is that the     party in this state which is with him is supposed to be indifferent  even secretly averse to the residence of congress

a precise answer to this question many of the best informed not having been led to communicate their opinions and others having been directly or indirectly interested on one side or the other it seems to have been rather the prevailing opinion that the contract was more hurtful to the price of tobacco than a supply of the farmer genl by purchases made in the english or other foreign markets this opinion must be founded on a supposition that the mercantile sellers in europe could more easily combine and counteract the monopoly than the planters of america it does not appear that those who dislike ye contract have particularly turned yr thoughts to a system proper to be substituted the general idea seems to have been that some arrangement in france disarming the monopoly     there of

the local bias is to impress on the minds of the senators an attention to the interest of the whole society by making them the choice of the whole society each citizen voting for every senator the objection here is that the fittest characters would not be sufficiently known to the people at large but in free governments merit and notoriety of character are rarely separated and such a regulation would connect them more and more together should this mode of election be on the whole not approved that established in maryland presents a valuable alternative the latter affords perhaps a greater security for the selection of merit the inconveniences     chargeable on it are two first that the council of electors favors cabal against this the shortness of its existence is a good antidote secondly that in a large state the meeting of the electors must be expensive if they be paid or badly attended if the service is onerous to this it may be answered that in a case of such vast importance the expence which could not be great ought to be disregarded whichever of these modes may be preferred it cannot be amiss so far to admit the plan of districts as to restrain the choice to persons residing in different parts of the state such a regulation will produce a diffusive confidence in the body which is not less necessary than the other means of rendering it useful in a state having large towns which can easily unite their votes the precaution would be essential to an immediate choice by the people at large in maryland no regard is paid to residence and what is remarkable vacancies are filled by the senate itself this last is an obnoxious expedient and cannot in any point of view have much effect it was probably meant to obviate the trouble of occasional meetings of the electors but the purpose might have been otherwise answered by allowing the unsuccessful candidates to supply vacancies according to the order of their standing on the list of votes or by requiring provisional appointments to be made along with the positive ones if an election by districts be unavoidable and the ideas here suggested be sound the evil will be diminished in proportion to the extent given to the districts taking two or more senators from each district electors the first question arising here is how far property ought to be made a qualification there is a middle way to be taken which corresponds at once with the theory of free government and the lessons of experience a freehold or equivalent of a certain value may be annexed to ye right of voting for senators  ye right left more at large in ye election of the other house examples of this distinction may be found in the constitutions of several states particularly if i mistake not of north carolina  n     york this middle mode reconciles and secures the two cardinal objects of government the rights of persons and the rights of property the former will be sufficiently guarded by one branch the latter more particularly by the other give all power to property and ye indigent will be oppressed give it to the latter and the effect may be transposed give a defensive share to each and each will be secure the necessity of thus guarding the rights of property was for obvious reasons unattended to in the commencement of the revolution in all the governments which were considered as beacons to republican patriots  lawgivers the rights of persons were subjected to those of property the poor were sacrificed to the rich in the existing state of american population  american property the two classes of rights were so little discriminated that a provision for the rights of persons was supposed to include of itself those of property and it was natural to infer from the tendency of republican laws that these different interests would be more and more identified experience and investigation have however produced more correct ideas on this subject it is now observed that in all populous countries the smaller part only can be interested in preserving the rights of property it must be foreseen that america and kentucky itself will by degrees arrive at this stage of society that in some parts of y union a very great advance is already made towards it it is well understood that interest leads to injustice as well where the opportunity is presented to bodies of men as to individuals to an interested majority in a republic as to the interested minority in any other form of government the time to guard agst this danger is at the first forming of the constitution and in the present state of population when the bulk of the people have a sufficient interest in possession or in prospect to be attached to the rights of property without being insufficiently attached to the rights of persons liberty not less than justice pleads for the policy here recommended if all power be suffered to slide into hands not interested in the rights of     property which must be the case whenever a majority fall under that description one of two things cannot fail to happen either they will unite against the other description and become the dupes  instruments of ambition or their poverty  dependence will render them the mercenary instruments of wealth in either case liberty will be subverted in the first by a despotism growing out of anarchy in the second by an oligarchy founded on corruption the second question under this head is whether the ballot be not a better mode than that of voting viva voce the comparative experience of the states pursuing the different modes is in favor of the first it is found less difficult to guard against fraud in that than against bribery in the other exclusions does not the exclusion of ministers of the gospel as such violate a fundamental principle of liberty by punishing a religious profession with the privation of a civil right does it not violate another article of the plan itself which exempts religion from the cognizance of civil power does it not violate justice by at once taking away a right and prohibiting a compensation for it does it not in fine violate impartiality by shutting the door agst the ministers of one religion and leaving it open for those of every other the reeligibility of members after accepting offices of profit is so much opposed to the present way of thinking in america that any discussion of the subject would probably be a waste of time limits of power it is at least questionable whether death ought to be confined to treason and murder it would not therefore be prudent to tie the hands of government in the manner here proposed the prohibition of pardon however specious in theory would have practical consequences which render it inadmissible a single instance is a sufficient proof the crime of treason is generally shared by a number and often a very great number it would be politically if not morally wrong to take away the lives of all     even if every individual were equally guilty what name would be given to a severity which made no distinction between the legal  the moral offence—between the deluded multitude and their wicked leaders a second trial would not avoid the difficulty because the oaths of the jury would not permit them to hearken to any voice but the inexorable voice of the law the power of the legislature to appoint any other than their own officers departs too far from the theory which requires a separation of the great depts of government one of the best securities against the creation of unnecessary offices or tyrannical powers is an exclusion of the authors from all share in filling the one or influence in the execution of the other the proper mode of appointing to offices will fall under another head executive governour an election by the legislature is liable to insuperable objections it not only tends to faction intrigue and corruption but leaves the executive under the influence of an improper obligation to that department an election by the people at large as in this   several other states—or by electors as in the appointment of the senate in maryland or indeed by the people through any other channel than their legislative representatives seems to be far preferable the ineligibility a second time though not perhaps without advantages is also liable to a variety of strong objections it takes away one powerful motive to a faithful  useful administration the desire of acquiring that title to a reappointment by rendering a periodical change of men necessary it discourages beneficial undertakings which require perseverance and system or as frequently happened in the roman consulate either precipitates or prevents the execution of them it may inspire desperate enterprises for the attainment of what is not attainable by legitimate means it fetters the judgment and inclination   0 of the community and in critical moments would either produce a violation of the constitution or exclude a choice which might be essential to the public safety add to the whole that by putting the executive magistrate in the situation of the tenant of an unrenewable lease it would tempt him to neglect the constitutional rights of his department and to connive at usurpations by the legislative department with which he may connect his future ambition or interest the clause restraining the first magistrate from the immediate command of the military force would be made better by excepting cases in which he should receive the sanction of the two branches of the legislature council of state the following variations are suggested   the election to be made by the people immediately or thro some other medium than the legislature   a distributive choice should perhaps be secured as in the case of the senate   instead of an ineligibility a second time a rotation in the federal senate with an abridgmt of the term to be substituted the appointment to offices is of all the functions of republican  perhaps every other form of government the most difficult to guard against abuse give it to a numerous body and you at once destroy all responsibility and create a perpetual source of faction and corruption give it to the executive wholly and it may be made an engine of improper influence and favoritism suppose the power were divided thus let the executive alone make all the subordinate appointments and the govr and senate as in the fedl constn those of the superior order it seems particularly fit that the judges who are to form a distinct department should owe their offices partly to each of the other departments rather than wholly to either judiciary much detail ought to be avoided in the constitutional regulation of this department that there may be room for changes which may     be demanded by the progressive changes in the state of our population it is at least doubtful whether the number of courts the number of judges or even ye boundaries of jurisdiction ought to be made unalterable but by a revisal of the constitution the precaution seems no otherwise necessary than as it may prevent sudden modifications of the establishment or addition of obsequious judges for ye purpose of evading the checks of the constn  givg effect to some sinister policy of the legisre but might not the same object be otherwise attained by prohibiting for example any innovations in those particulars without the consent of that department or without the annual sanction of two or three successive assemblies over  above the other prerequisites to the passage of a law the model here proposed for a court of appeals is not recommended by experience it is found as might well be presumed that the members are always warped in their appellate decisions by an attachment to the principles and jurisdiction of their respective courts  still more so by the previous decision on ye case removed by appeal the only efficient cure for the evil is to form a court of appeals of distinct and select judges the expence ought not to be admitted as an objection   because the proper administration of justice is of too essential a nature to be sacrificed to that consideration   the number of inferior judges might in that case be lessened   the whole department may be made to support itself by a judicious tax on law proceedings the excuse for nonattendance would be a more proper subject of enquiry somewhere else than in the court to which the party belonged delicacy mutual convenience c would soon reduce the regulation to mere form or if not it might become a disagreeable source of little irritations among ye members a certificate from the local court or some other local authority where the party might reside or happen to be detained from his duty expressing the cause of absence as well as that it was judged to be satisfactory might be safely     substituted few judges would improperly claim their wages if such a formality stood in the way these observations are applicable to the council of state a court of impeachments is among the most puzzling articles of a republican constitution and it is far more easy to point out defects in any plan than to supply a cure for them the diversified expedients adopted in the constitutions of the several states prove how much the compilers were embarrassed on this subject the plan here proposed varies from all of them and is perhaps not less than any a proof of the difficulties which pressed the ingenuity of its author the remarks arising on it are   that it seems not to square with reason that the right to impeach should be united to that of trying the impeachment  consequently in a proportional degree to that of sharing in the appointment of or influence on the tribunal to which the trial may belong   as the executive  judiciary would form a majority of the court and either have a right to impeach too much might depend on a combination of these departments this objection would be still stronger if the members of the assembly were capable as proposed of holding offices and were amenable in that capacity to the court   the h of delegates and either of those departments could appt a majority of ye court here is another danger of combination and the more to be apprehended as that branch of ye legisl wd also have the right to impeach a right in their hands of itself sufficiently weighty and as the power of the court wd extend to the head of the ex by whose independence the constitl rights of that department are to be secured agst legislative usurpations   the dangers in the two last cases would be still more formidable as the power extends not only to deprivation but to future incapacity of office in the case of all officers of sufficient importance to be objects of factious persecution the latter branch of power is in every view of a delicate nature in that of the chief magistrate it seems inadmissible if he be chosen by the legislature and much more so if immediately     by the people themselves a temporary incapacitation is ye most that cd be properly authorised the   great desiderata in a court of impeachts are   impartiality   respectability—the first in order to a right the second in order to a satisfactory decision these characteristics are aimed at in the following modification let the senate be denied the right to impeach let ⅓ of the members be struck out by alternate nominations of the prosecutors  party impeached the remaining ⅔ to be the stamen of the court when the h of del impeach let the judges or a certain proportion of them—and the council of state be associated in the trial when the govr or council impeaches let the judges only be associated when the judges impeach let the council only be associated but if the party impeached by the h of dels be a member of the ex or judicy let that of which he is a member not be associated if the party impeached belong to one  be impeached by the other of these branches let neither of them be associated the decision being in this case left with the senate alone or if that be thought exceptionable a few members might be added by ye h of ds ⅔ of the court should in all cases be necessary to a conviction  the chief magistrate at least should be exempt from a sentence of perpetual if not of temporary incapacity it is extremely probable that a critical discussion of this outline may discover objections which do not occur some do occur but appear not to be greater than are incident to any different modification of the tribunal the establishment of trials by jury  viva voce testimony in all cases and in all courts is to say the least a delicate experiment and would most probably be either violated or be found inconvenient council of revision a revisionary power is meant as a check to precipitate to unjust and to unconstitutional laws these important ends would it is conceded be more effectually secured without disarming the legislature of its requisite authority by requiring bills to be     separately communicated to the exec  judicy depts if either of these object let ⅔ if both ¾ of each house be necessary to overrule the objection and if either or both protest agst a bill as violating the constitution let it moreover be suspended notwithstanding the overruling proportion of the assembly until there shall have been a subsequent election of the h of ds and a repassage of the bill by ⅔ or ¾ of both houses as the case may be it sd not be allowed the judges or ye executive to pronounce a law thus enacted unconstitul  invalid in the state constitutions  indeed in the fedl one also no provision is made for the case of a disagreement in expounding them and as the courts are generally the last in making ye decision it results to them by refusing or not refusing to execute a law to stamp it with its final character this makes the judiciary dept paramount in fact to the legislature which was never intended and can never be proper the extension of the habs corps to the cases in which it has been usually suspended merits consideration at least if there be emergencies which call for such a suspension it can have no effect to prohibit it because the prohibition will assuredly give way to the impulse of the moment or rather it will have the bad effect of facilitating other violations that may be less necessary the exemption of the press from liability in every case for true facts is also an innovation and as such ought to be well considered this essential branch of liberty is perhaps in more danger of being interrupted by local tumults or the silent awe of a predominant party than by any direct attacks of power james madison novr        new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph chic hist soc mss  n york novr        my dear friend i recd yesterday your favor of the   d ult the first countenance of the assembly corresponds with     the picture which my imagination had formed of it the views of the greater part of the opposition to the federal government and particularly of its principal leader have ever since the convention been regarded by me as permanently hostile and likely to produce every effort that might endanger or embarrass it  the defects which drew forth objections from many quarters were evidently of little consequence in the eye of mr h—ry his own arguments proved it his enmity was levelled as he did not scruple to insinuate agst the whole system and the destruction of the whole system i take to be still the secret wish of his heart and the real object of his pursuit if temperate and rational alterations only were his plan is it conceivable that his coalition and patronage would be extended to men whose particular ideas on the subject must differ more from his own than of others who share most liberally in his hatred my last letter with col carringtons communications to which it referred will have sufficiently explained my sentiments with regard to the legislative service under the new constitution my first wish is to see the government put into quiet and successful     operation and to afford any service that may be acceptable from me for that purpose my second wish if that were to be consulted would prefer for reasons formerly hinted an opportunity of contributing that service in the house of reps rather than in the senate provided the opportunity be attainable from the spontaneous suffrage of the constituents should the real friends to the constitution think this preference inconsistent with any primary object as col carrington tells me is the case with some who are entitled to peculiar respect and view my renouncing it as of any material consequence i shall not hesitate to comply—you will not infer from the freedom with which these observations are made that i am in the least unaware of the probability that whatever my inclinations or those of my friends may be they are likely to be of little avail in the present case i take it for certain that a clear majority of the assembly are enimies to the govt and i have no reason to suppose that i can be less obnoxious than others on the opposite side an election into the senate therefore can hardly come into question i know also that a good deal will depend on the arrangements for the election of the other branch and that much may depend moreover on the steps to be taken by the candidates which will not be taken by me here again therefore there must be great uncertainty if not improbability of my election with these circumstances in view it is impossible that i can be the dupe of false calculations even if i were in other cases disposed to     indulge them i trust it is equally impossible for the result whatever it may be to rob me of any reflections which enter into the internal fund of comfort and happiness popular favor or disfavor is no criterion of the character maintained with those whose esteem an honorable ambition must court much less can it be a criterion of that maintained with oneself and when the spirit of party directs the public voice it must be a little mind indeed that can suffer in its own estimation or apprehend danger of suffering in that of others the sepr british packet arrived yesterday but i do not find that she makes any addition to the stock of european intelligence the change in the

     dear sir your favor of the  0th ult not having got into my hands in time to be acknowledged by the last mail i have now the additional pleasure of acknowledging     along with it your favor of the    which i recd yesterday you wish to know my sentiments on the project of another general convention as suggested by new york i shall give them to you with great frankness though i am aware they may not coincide with those in fashion at richmond or even with your own i am not of the number if there be any such who think the constitution lately adopted a faultless work on the contrary there are amendments wch i wished it to have received before it issued from the place in which it was formed these amendments i still think ought to be made according to the apparent sense of america and some of them at least i presume will be made there are others concerning which doubts are entertained by many and which have both advocates and opponents on each side of the main question these i think ought to receive the light of actual experiment before it would be prudent to admit them into the constitution with respect to the first class the only question is which of the two modes provided be most eligible for the discussion and adoption of them the objections agst a convention which give a preference to the other mode in my judgment are the following   it will add to the difference among the states on the merits another and an unnecessary difference concerning the mode there are amendments which in themselves will probably be agreed to by all the states and pretty certainly by the requisite proportion of them if they be contended     for in the mode of a convention there are unquestionably a number of states who will be so averse and apprehensive as to the mode that they will reject the merits rather than agree to the mode a convention therefore does not appear to be the most convenient or probable channel for getting to the object   a convention cannot be called without the unanimous consent of the parties who are to be bound by it if first principles are to be recurred to or without the previous application of ⅔ of the state legislatures if the forms of the constitution are to be pursued the difficulties in either of these cases must evidently be much greater than will attend the origination of amendments in congress which may be done at the instance of a single state legislature or even without a single instruction on the subject   if a general convention were to take place for the avowed and sole purpose of revising the constitution it would naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the congress appointed to administer and support as well as to amend the system it would consequently give greater agitation to the public mind an election into it would be courted by the most violent partizans on both sides it wd probably consist of the most heterogeneous characters would be the very focus of that flame which has already too much heated men of all parties would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views who under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some parts but inadmissible in other parts of the union might have a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very  00 foundations of the fabric under all these circumstances it seems scarcely to be presumable that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony or terminate in the general good having witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first convention which assembled under every propitious circumstance i should tremble for the result of a second meeting in the present temper of america and under all the disadvantages i have mentioned   it is not unworthy of consideration that the prospect of a second convention would be viewed by all europe as a dark and threatening cloud hanging over the constitution just established and perhaps over the union itself and wd therefore suspend at least the advantages this great event has promised us on that side it is a wellknown fact that this event has filled that quarter of the globe with equal wonder and veneration that its influence is already secretly but powerfully working in favor of liberty in france and it is fairly to be inferred that the final event there may be materially affected by the prospect of things here we are not sufficiently sensible of the importance of the example which this country may give to the world nor sufficiently attentive to the advantages we may reap from the late reform if we avoid bringing it into danger the last loan in holland and that alone saved the u s from bankruptcy in europe and that loan was obtained from a belief that the constitution then depending wd be certainly speedily

zealous patronage of whatever he deems useful to much esteem and regard you will therefore oblige me by putting it in my power to afford him the little gratification he asks i have another request to trouble you with which concerns myself col h lee tells me that he has purchased the tract of land thro which the canal at the great falls is to run and on which the basin will be for £ 000 the tract contains  00 acres only and is under the incumbrance of a rent of £  0 sterlg per annum but on the other hand derives from its situation as he supposes a certain prospect of becoming immensely valuable he paints it in short as the seat of an early town the lots of which will be immediately productive and possessing other peculiar advantages which make the bargain inestimable in addition to many instances of his friendship he tenders me a part in it and urges my acceptance on grounds of advantage to myself alone i am thoroughly persuaded that i am indebted for the proposal to the most disinterested and affectionate motives but knowing that the  0  fervor with which he pursues his objects sometimes affects the estimate he forms of them and being in no condition to make hazardous experiments it is advisable for me to have the sanction of other judgments to his opinions you are well acquainted with the situation and can at once decide whether it presents the material and certain advantages on which col lee calculates a general intimation therefore of the light in which the matter strikes you will lay me under a very particular obligation i am by no means sure that in any result it will be in my power to profit by col lees friendship but it may be of some consequence whether the opportunity be worth attending to or not my information from richmond is very unpropitious to federal policy yours is no doubt more full and more recent a decided and malignant majority may do many things of a disagreeable nature but i trust the constitution is too firmly established to be now materially vulnerable the elections for the legislature of penna n jersey  maryland ensure measures of a contrary complexion in those states indeed virginia is the only instance among the ratifying states in which the politics of the legislature are at variance with the sense of the people expressed by their representatives in convention we hear nothing from massachuts or n hampshire since the meeting of their general courts it is understood that both the appointments  arrangements for the government will be calculated to support and as far as possible to dignify it the public conversation  0  seems to be not yet settled on the vice president mr hancock  mr adams have been most talked of the former it is said rejects the idea of any secondary station and the latter

pretensions it seems not improbable that the question will lie between the gentlemen above named mr jay  genl knox have been mentioned but it is supposed that neither of them will exchange his present situation for an unprofitable dignity i shall leave this in a day or two and am not yet finally determined how far my journey may be continued southward a few lines on the subject above mentioned will

present temper and disproportionate  0  number of the anti federal part of the assembly my name should have been honored with so great a vote as it received  when this circumstance is combined with that of the characters which i have reason to believe concurred in it i should be justly chargeable with a very mistaken ambition if i did not consider the event in the light which you anticipated i shall not be surprised if the attempt should be equally successful to shut the door of the other house agst me which was the real object of my preference as well for the reason formerly suggested to you as for the additional one that it will less require a stile of life with which my circumstances do not square  for which an inadequate provision only will probably be made by the public being not yet acquainted with the allottment of orange in the districts i can form no estimate of the reception that will be given to an offer of my services the district in which i am told it is likely to be thrown for the choice of an elector is a very monitory sample of what may  probably will be done in that way my present situation embarrasses me somewhat when i left n york i not only expected that the choice for the senate would be as it is but was apprehensive yt the spirit of party might chuse to add the supposed mortification of dropping my name from the deputation to congress for the fraction of a year remaining i accordingly left that  0  place under arrangements which did not require my return at the same time i had it in view if left entirely to my option to pass the winter or part of it there being desirous of employing some of the time in matters which need access to the papers of congress  supposing moreover that i should be there master more of my time yn in virginia the opportunity of executing my plan is given me i find by one of the votes of the assembly on the other hand i am now pressed by some of my friends to repair to virginia as a requisite expedient for counteracting the machinations agst my election into the h of reps to this again i am extremely disinclined for reasons additional to the one above mentioned it will have an electioneering appearance which i always despised and wish to shun and as i should shew myself in orange only where there will probably be little difficulty my presence could have no very favorable effect whilst it is very possible that such a mark of solicitude strengthened by my not declining a reappointment to congress and now declining to serve in it might by a dexterous misinterpretation be made to operate on the other side these considerations are strong inducements to join my colleagues at n york and leave things to their own course in virginia if orange should fall into a federal district it is probable i shall not be opposed if otherwise a successful opposition seems unavoidable my decision however is not finally taken mr dawson arrived here this morning he took  0  anapolis in his way where he tells

not sooner acknowledged your first favor because it intimated that the subject of it admitted of delay and i did not wish to precipitate a determination on it—although i did not foresee any addition of lights to guide me—the truth is i am fully satisfied that your calculations of advantage in the purchase are in substance at least well founded—i cannot be less so that the proposition to me is the genuine offspring of a friendship which demands the warmest returns and acknowledgements—an opportunity of bettering my private  0  circumstances cannot be prudently disregarded by me—and i need not add that one more acceptable could not be found than that in which every instance of profit to myself would be a pleasing proof of concurrent profit to you to these considerations nothing is opposed but an inability to make the contributions which would be due  necessary on my part—and a fixt aversion to becoming a burden in the contract and to stand in the way perhaps of other friends who have an equal title to gratification with the requisite means of giving effect to the plan—i do not know that within    months i could command more than one or two hundred pounds unless i could dispose of property which is not at present practicable you will see from the above explanation that notwithstanding my inclination i dare not avail myself of your friendship on this occasion—any further than arrangements can be engrafted in the bargain which will make the bargain contribute itself the means of fulfilling its obligations and its objects so far i shall be happy in partaking its benefits in such proportion as you may think fit—not exceeding the reparation in your own behalf—how far the means can be extracted out of the bargain you alone can determine i apprehend that one at least of the gentlemen on whom you have cast an eye is in no condition at present to enter into such a speculation wadsworth is probablyable—but i cannot even guess his dispositions on the subject—of the other i know nothing—the measures pursued at richmond are as  0  impolitic as they are otherwise exceptionable—if alterations of a reasonable sort are really in view they are much more attainable from congress than from attempts to bring about another convention it is already decided that the latter mode is a hopeless pursuit—n h—mass—con n j pena  delaware having appointed senators known to be bona fide friends to the constitution—from the  st state will be langdon  bartlett—from the  d bowdoin  strong—from n jersey patterson  elmer—the others you know—maryland s carolina  georgia will make appointments of the like complexions the elections of reps for pena is over but the result is not yet known from all the counties little doubt is entertained on one side that it will prove favorable though the other side do not renounce its hopes in the city the majority was nearly as five to one—in lancaster county still greater i am told and in one or two others the proportion not less—the antifederal counties however are farthest off and have not yet been heard from—in berks where unanimity almost prevailed on that side the badness of the day and the height of the waters reduced the number of voters to about  00—although the county must contain several more—in general a small proportion of the people seemed to have voted—how far this is to be charged on the weather or an indifference to the occasion i am not able to say i am not yet entirely recovered from the complaint which was reproduced by the journey from  0  n york hither—nor am i yet absolutely decided whether i shall go back in consequence of the reappointment to cong—or proceed forthwith to virga—i mean to be a member of the h of reps if elected to that service—and to take the proper steps for offering my services those of a contrary character i shall certainly decline even the electioneering appearance of a trip to virga at this crisis is not a little grating to me present me in the best manner to mrs

department mr adams who is pledged to support him will probably be the vice president the enemies to the government at the head  the most inveterate of whom is mr henry are laying a train for the election of governor clinton but it cannot succeed unless the federal votes be more dispersed than can well happen of the seven states which have appointed their senators virginia alone will have antifederal members in that branch those of n hampshire are president langdon  judge bartlett—of massachusetts mr strong and mr dalton—of connecticut docr johnson and mr elseworth—of n jersey mr patterson and mr elmer—of penna mr r morris and mr mcclay—of delaware mr geo reed and mr bassett—of virgina mr r h lee and col grayson here is already a majority of the ratifying states on the side of the constitution and it is not doubted that it will be reinforced by the appointments of maryland s carolina and georgia as one branch of the legislature of n york is attached to the constitution it is not improbable that one of the senators from that state also will be added to the majority in the house of representatives the proportion of anti federal members will of course be greater but cannot if present appearances are to be trusted amount to a majority or even a very formidable minority     the election for this branch has taken place as yet no where except in penna and here the returns are not yet come in from all the counties it is certain however that seven out of the eight and probable that the whole eight representatives will bear the federal stamp even in virginia where the enemies to the government form ⅔ of the legislature it is computed that more than half the number of representatives who will be elected by the people formed into districts for the purpose will be of the same stamp by some it is computed that   out of the  0 allotted to that state will be opposed to the politics of the present legislature the questions which divide the public at present relate   to the extent of the amendments that ought to be made to the constitution   to the mode in which they ought to be made the friends of the constitution some from an approbation of particular amendments others from a spirit of conciliation are generally agreed that the system should be revised but they wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty without abridging the sum of power transferred from the states to the general government or altering previous to trial the particular structure of the latter and are fixed in opposition to the risk of another convention whilst the purpose can be as well answered by the other mode provided for introducing amendments those who have opposed the constitution are on the other hand zealous for a second convention and for a revisal which may     either not be restrained at all or extend at least as far as alterations have been proposed by any state some of this class are no doubt friends to an effective government and even to the substance of the particular government in question it is equally certain that there are others who urge a second convention with the insidious hope of throwing all things into confusion and of subverting the fabric just established if not the union itself if the first congress embrace the policy which circumstances mark out they will not fail to propose of themselves every desirable safeguard for popular rights and by thus separating the well meaning from the designing opponents fix on the latter their true character and give to the government its due popularity and stability  moustier  proves a most unlucky appointment he is unsocial proud and niggardly and betrays a sort of fastidiousness towards this country    at boston he imprudently suffered etiquette to prevent even an interview with governor handcock the inhabitants taking part with the governor neither visited nor invited the count they were then less apprehensive of a misinterpretation of the neglect as the most cordial intercourse had just preceeded between the town and the french squadron both the count and the marchioness are particularly unpopular among their countrymen here such of them as are not under     restraint make very free remarks and are anxious for a new diplomatic arrangement it is but right to add to these particulars that there is reason to believe that unlucky impressions were made on the count at his first probably by de la forest the consul a cunning disciple i take it of marbois politics and by something in his communication with jay which he considered as the effect of coldness and sourness toward france i am a stranger to the errand on which g morris goes to europe it relates i presume to the affairs of r morris which are still much deranged i have received and paid the draught in favor of docr ramsay i had before paid the order in favor of mr thompson immediately on the receipt of your letter about   0 dollars of the balance due on the last state of our account were left in virginia for the use of your nephews there are a few lesser sums which stand on my side of the account which i shall take credit for when you can find leisure to forward another statement of your friendly advances for me i shall leave this place in a day or two for virga where my friends who wish me to cooperate in putting our political machine into activity as a member of the house of representatives press me to attend they made me a candidate for the senate for which i had not allotted my pretensions the attempt was defeated by mr henry who is omnipotent in the present legislature and who added to the expedients common on such occasions a public philippic agst my federal principles he has taken equal pains in forming the counties into districts for the election of     reps to associate with orange such as are most devoted to his politics and most likely to be swayed by the prejudices excited agst me  from the best information i have of the prevailing temper of the district i conclude that my going to virga will answer no other purpose than to satisfy the opinions and entreaties of my friends the trip is in itself very disagreeable both on account of its electioneering appearance and the sacrifice of the winter for which i had assigned a task which the intermission of congressional business would have made convenient at new york with the sincerest affection  the highest esteem i am dear sir yours the letter herewith inclosed for mr gordon is from mr cyrus griffin the other from mr mccarty an american citizen settled in france but at present here on business he appears to be a very worthy man  i have promised to recommend his letter to your care as a certain channel of conveyance james madison  0 december      philadelphia philip mazzei to philip mazzei  philadelphia  0 december      your book as i prophesied sells nowhere but in virginia a very few copies only have been called for either in new york or in this city the language     in which it is written will account for it in order to attract notice i translated the panegyric in the french mercure and had it made part of the advertisement i did not translate the comment on the federal constitution as you wished because i could not spare the time as well as because i did not approve the tendency of it some of your remarks prove that horaces cœlum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt does not hold without exception in europe the abuses of power continually before your eyes have given a bias to your political reflections which you did not feel in equal degree when you left america and which you would feel less of if you had remained in america philosophers on the old continent in their zeal against tyranny would rush into anarchy as the horrors of superstition drive them into atheism here perhaps the inconveniences of relaxed government have reconciled too many to the opposite extreme if your plan of a single legislature as in pennsylvania c were adopted i sincerely believe that it would prove the most deadly blow ever given to republicanism were i an enemy to that form i would preach the very doctrines which are preached by the enemies to the government proposed for the united states many of our best citizens are disgusted with the injustice instability and folly which characterize the american administrations the number has for some time been rapidly increasing were the evils to be much longer protracted the disgust would seize citizens of every description     it is of infinite importance to the cause of liberty to ascertain the degree of it which will consist with the purposes of society an error on one side may be as fatal as on the other hitherto the error in the united states has lain in the excess all the states except north carolina and rhode island have ratified the proposed constitution seven of them have appointed their senators of whom those of virginia r h lee and col grayson alone are among the opponents of the system the appointments of maryland south carolina and georgia will pretty certainly be of the same stamp with the majority the house of representatives is yet to be chosen everywhere except in pennsylvania from the partial returns received the election will wear a federal aspect unless the event in one or two particular counties should contradict every calculation if the eight members from this state be on the side of the constitution it will in a manner secure the majority in that branch of the congress also the object of the antifederalists is to bring about another general convention which would either agree on nothing as would be agreeable to some and throw everything into confusion or expunge from the constitution parts which are held by its friends to be essential to it the latter party are willing to gratify their opponents with every supplemental provision for general rights but insist that this can be better done in the mode provided for amendments i remain with great sincerity your friend and servant     decr   th      alexandria james madison to james madison mad mss  alexandria decr   th      i arrived here this morning on my way home i did not write you my intentions sooner because they are rather of recent date and i wished to be able at the same time to let you know the day on which i should get to fredg this i have not till now been able to fix i now find that i shall get there on friday week and shall accordingly then stand in need of your assistance for the completion of my journey it will be necessary for me to have the use of the chair as well on account of my baggage which consists of a portmanteau trunk and a portmanteau as on acct of some remains of the piles which for some weeks past have been very troublesome whoever brings the chair must bring a saddle proper for the portmanteau no horse need be brought for a servant john having been left in n york given over as incurable and another having been engaged i wish the chair to be in town certainly on that day and shall request the favor of mr ramsy to send this by a hired messenger if no other conveyance can be secured—i shall remain in this neighbourhood till thursday next when i shall fall into the stage at colchester  proceed on friday from dumfries for fredg—i could reach fredg on no day so well as on that above mentioned an earlier day would be too soon for the carriage to meet me and a later one would leave me on the road on sunday or oblige me to postpone my resuming my journey till the tuesday following     i have nothing to add on the subject of news but what may be better communicated verbally on my arrival in the mean time with my affectn regards to all the family i conclude your dutiful son james madison jany   th      orange george washington to george washington wash mss  orange jany   th      dear sir your favor of the  d instant with the letters attending it never came to hand till last evening i have good reason to believe that the delay happened between alexanda  fredg rather than at or from the latter place mr f maury pays particular attention to all letters which arrive there for me and forwards them to orange by opportunities which are frequent  safe i apprehend there will be no impropriety in committing a confidential letter to that channel as an additional precaution i will desire him to be particularly attentive to any letter which may have your name on it i have heard from two only of the returns from the electoral districts  the one in favor of mr gilchrist—the     other of general stephens he succeeded agst col cabel by a majority of    votes he owes his success to the coalition between the two parties in spotsylva my situation is unfavorable for intelligence from the state at large and therefore i can say little of the prospects as to the feby election i fear from the vague accounts which circulate that the federal candidates are likely to stand in the way of one another this is not the case however in my district the field is left entirely to monroe  myself the event of our competition will probably depend on the part to be taken by two or three descriptions of people whose decision is not known if not yet to be ultimately formed i have pursued my pretensions much further than i had premeditated having not only made great use of epistolary means but actually visited two counties culpeper  louisa and publicly contradicted the erroneous reports propagated agst me it has been very industriously inculcated that i am dogmatically attached to the constitution in every clause syllable  letter and therefore not a single amendment will be promoted by my vote either from conviction or a spirit of accommodation  this is the report most likely   0 to affect the election and most difficult to be combated with success within the limited period there are a number of others however which are auxiliaries     to it—with my respectful compliments to mrs washington  the others of your family i remain dear sir your most obedt  affecte servt james madison jany      henry lee to henry lee mad mss  copy of remarks on situation of great falls of potowmack sent to col h lee at whose request drawn up  jany      the importance of the spott at the great falls of the potowmack and the value of the property including it appear from the following considerations— first the singular fitness of the situation for every species of water works merchants mills forges slitting  plating sic mills sawmills c c may be erected here with greater advantages from nature than at any place perhaps within the     whole compass of the united states the spot was long ago marked out by a very sagacious undertaker for these purposes and has been left unimproved from no other cause than the want of funds the addition made to the natural advantages of the place by the opening of the navigation above requires no explanation wheat timber c can by that means be collected from an extent of country which is capable of supplying them in the most ample quantities that can be desired iron ore also  mineral coal are distributed along the main river  its branches in great abundance and can be brought to the works on the best terms secondly the importance of the situation as a resting place for an extensive commerce—that the commerce through this channel will be extensive will be best shewn if all proof be not superfluous by a few plain  known facts the main river is already navigable miles above the falls a boat of tons burden came down last fall from with a load of and the navigation of that part of the river will be ready for general use as soon as the spring season comes on or at farthest before the ensuing summer is over the shanandoah branch may and probably will be very soon made navigable for   0 miles from its mouth which is miles above the falls the south branch is equally capable of the same improvement for  00 miles from its mouth which is miles above the falls there are a number of smaller streams running into the potowmac above the falls which are either already navigable or may easily be made so not only on the virginia but also on the maryland sides by means of the latter no small part of the produce now transported by land to baltimore from the upper parts of maryland  the skirts of penna will be drawn into the navigation of the potowmack the great region of country embracd by these several waters is in general extremely fertile particularly in the parts through which they immediately flow is already settled and cultivated and is found excellently adapted to almost every article which has been raised within this state but     the commerce of the potomack will not be limited to this region extensive as it is another prospect presents itself on the western side of the alleghany mountains the communication between the atlantic and the western country can be more easily established through the potomac than through any other channel the source of this river lies nearest to the sources of those which run westerly its course forms the most direct line with the course of the latter and having such of its natural obstructions as require locks all at one spot it has commanded advantages over other channels for attracting the produce  supplying the consumption of great part of the fertile country on the ohio and its upper branches if not on the lakes also and the streams running into them—that the scite in question will be one of the resting places for this extensive commerce results from several circumstances   wheat the staple article to be exported through this channel will be here most conveniently turned into flour for the purpose it will therefore be here purchased by the merchants or rather agents of the merchants residing at the seaport towns who will of course keep at the same place mechandize in order the more easily to pay for the produce one side of commerce necessarily attracts the other the place of buying will always become the place of selling also there may be other articles which will undergo some manufacturing process before exportation and to which the same remark may be applied but the arrangements established for a principal article will extend themselves to others which would otherwise require or produce them   the navigation above being open two weeks earlier than below the falls and the town of alexandria to which a good road may be made being not more than    miles distant there will be a farther inducement to make the falls a place of exchange for exports and imports   the navigation above being already fitted for use  that below being not likely to be open for some time and on account of its peculiar difficulties perhaps a long time the falls will if proper measures be accelerated have     the habit of commerce in its favour  might be continued as the entrepôt from causes not otherwise entirely equal to the effect thirdly the convenience of the place for a manufacturing town this advantage is evident from the remarks already made in no place can materials or provisions be more cheaply or plentifully assembled every branch of manufacture with iron or other water works must be particularly favoured at this spot and as such are numerous and have mutual relations again with many other branches a better seat for manufactories can scarcely be fancied the place is moreover healthy is surrounded by a fertile and well wooded country and admits of an easy supply of every foreign implement  article which manufactures may stand in need of george washington feby       mount vernon james madison to james madison mad mss  mount vernon feby        hond sir the obstructions to my journey from the snow the river at fredericksberg and the unparallelled badness of the roads prevented my arrival here sooner than the evening before last harry will be able to give the particulars of the journey i detained him yesterday in order to give both him  the horses a little rest after their fatigue and shall leave it in some measure to himself to return either by way of fredg or normans ford according to the state of the weather  the information he may receive concerning the latter route—i am not yet decided as to the day on which i shall go forward from     this place being now convinced from the state of the weather  the rivers that i could not possibly reach new york by the day fixed for the meeting of congs and if i could that there will not be a sufficient number of members for business i shall think myself more at liberty to consult my own conveniency by waiting a few days i promise myself also the company of some of my colleagues particularly mr page who will i think be sure to call on the general mr r b lee is the only member who has yet set out according to my information he has gone on to alexandr but will wait i presume for company at least untill the weather shall invite him to proceed i meet here with no news worth communicating the inclosed papers i recd at fredericksbg and may be read as a continuation of the intelligence from new york i find myself perfectly well

randolph mad mss  alexandria march  st      my dear friend this is the first convenient opportunity i have had for dropping you a line since i last came into the state your sanction to my remaining in n york during the crisis of the elections conveyed through col carrington never came to hand till i had arrived in orange it coincided so fully with my     inclination and indeed with my judgment that had it been received in due time i do not know but i should have disregarded all the pressing exhortations which stood opposed to your opinion i am persuaded however that my appearance in the district was more necessary to my election than you then calculated in truth it has been evinced by the experiment that my absence would have left a room for the calumnies of antifederal partizans which would have defeated much better pretensions than mine in culpeper which was the critical county a continued attention was necessary to repel the multiplied fasehoods which circulated whether i ought to be satisfied or displeased with my success i shall hereafter be more able to judge my present anticipations are not flattering i see on the lists of representatives a very scanty proportion who will share in the drudgery of business and i foresee contentions first between federal and antifederal parties and then between northern  southern parties which give additional disagreeableness to the prospect should the state elections give an antifederal colour to the legislatures which from causes not antifederal in the people may well happen difficulties will again start up in this quarter which may have a still more serious aspect on the congressional proceedings in my last or one of my last letters was inclosed a quere from mr st john the french consul at new york relating to the law here which regulates the recording of deeds c as i shall on my return be     applied to for an answer i will thank you for the proper one as soon as your leisure will allow i shall go on from this

representatives and   senators had assembled it is not certain when the deficiencies will be made up the most favorable conjectures postpone it to monday sennight the members attending are chiefly from the eastward i do not learn that a single member except mr white is from a state south of pennsylva unless indeed dr tucker is to be included in the exception the n jersey reps are not yet announced mr clarke it is supposed will be one mr cadwallader mr boudinot and mr skureman are talked of as the others i find that the communication made you from kentucky corresponds with an official letter to congs from govr st clair which speaks of the same emissary and the same errand notice has been transmitted     of the affair to the executive of virga in order that regular steps may be taken if sufficient ground be afforded for apprehending the incendiary the project of g m  for establishing a colony beyond the mississippi is also going on it is the opinion of mr brown as explained to mr griffin that emigrations to the spanish territory will be enticed from kentucky as rapidly as the allurements of the latter place have obtained them from the atlantic states all these circumstances point out the conduct which the new govt ought to pursue with regard to the western country  spain i dropped you a few lines from baltimore mentioning the unanimity of the electoral

myself raised it to    and mr s griffin and mr moore have been since added the number of attending senators continues at   when a quorum will be made up in either house rests on vague conjecture rather than on any precise information it is   0 not improbable i think that the present week will supply the deficiency in one if not in both of them the states most convenient are among the defaulters it will not be known i am told in this state who the representatives are till some time next month the federal party calculate on an equal division of the six mr lawrence for the city district mr floyd for the long island district and mr benson for a third in new jersey the election has been conducted in a very singular manner the law having fixed no time expressly for closing the polls they have been kept open three or four weeks in some of the counties by a rival jealousy between the eastern  western divisions of the state and it seems uncertain when they would have been closed if the governor had not interposed by fixing on a day for receiving the returns and proclaiming the successful candidates the day is passed but i have not heard the result the western ticket in favor of skureman boudinot cadwallader  sennickson if this be the name is supposed to have prevailed but an impeachment of the election by the unsuccessful competitors has been talked of two of the representatives from massachusetts are also unknown to us in one of the districts it is supposed that a disaffected man has prevailed an english packet has been long expected and is not yet arrived the state of foreign news remains of consequence little altered the accounts of latest date through other channels shew that the progress in france towards a constitutional establishment is     unchecked and that a coalition between the king and the commons agst the nobility  clergy will direct the innovations with respectful compliments to mrs washington  the rest of the family i am dear

instrument     referred to as retained in morgans hands in order to be signed by the adventurers would still further explain the transaction no quorum is yet formed in either house the senate want two members the house of repg four it is probable that the members from n jersey who are at length proclaimed two remaining members from penna and col coles who halted in philada will come in this evening and supply the deficiency in one branch the senate have no precise prospect of the small addition required to their numbers with unfeigned attachment i am dear sir respectfully your obedt hble servt james madison march   th      new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  new york march   th      dear sir— my last was committed in december to mr gouverneur morris i was then on my way to virginia the elections for the new government commenced shortly after my arrival the first was of electors to ballot for a president and vice president the successful candidates were general wood mr zachy johnson genl edward stephens doctor david stuart mr w fitzhugh of chatham mr warner lewis of gloucester mr jno harvey mr walk of or near norfolk mr kello of southampton these nine were federalists the remaining three mr patrick henry mr roane of king     and queen and mr pride of amelia were of the adverse party two of the former party did not attend the votes were unanimous with respect to general washington as appears to have been the case in each of the states the secondary votes were given among the federal members chiefly to mr j adams one or two being thrown away in order to prevent a possible competition for the presidency governor clinton was the secondary choice of the antifederal members in the succeeding election of representatives federalism was also proved to be the prevailing sentiment of the people the successful candidates on this list are mr moore late of the executive council from rockingham mr alexander white mr richard bland lee mr john page rosewell mr samuel griffin mr brown member of the old congress from kentucky j madison col parker late nav officer at norfolk col isaac coles of halifax and col bland of these the seven first have been on the side of the constitution the three last in the opposition col parker appears to be very temperate and it is not probable that both the others will be very inveterate it was my misfortune to be thrown into a contest with our friend col monroe the occasion produced considerable efforts among our respective friends between ourselves i have no reason to doubt that the distinction was duly kept in mind between political and personal views and that it has saved our friendship from the smallest diminution on one side i am sure it is the case     notwithstanding the lapse of time since the birthday of the new government the  th of march i am under the necessity of informing you that a quorum is not yet formed either in the senate or house of representatives the season of the year the peculiar badness of the weather and the short interval between the epoch of election and that of meeting form a better apology for the delay than will probably occur on your side of the atlantic the deficiency at present in the house of representatives requires two members only for a quorum and in the senate one only a few days will therefore fit the body for the first step to wit opening the ballots for the president and vice president i have already said that general washington will be the first by a unanimous suffrage it is held to be certain that mr adams though refused a great many votes from different motives will have the second appointment a considerable delay will be unavoidable after the ballots are counted before the president can be on the spot and consequently before any legislative act can take place such a protraction of the inactivity of the government is to be regretted on many accounts but most on account of the loss of revenue a prospect of the spring importations led to the appointment of the first meeting at a time which in other respects was unseasonable it is not yet possible to ascertain precisely the complexion of the new congress a little time will be necessary to unveil it and a little will probably     suffice with regard to the constitution it is pretty well decided that the disaffected party in the senate amounts to two or three members only and that in the other house it does not exceed a very small minority some of which will also be restrained by the federalism of the states from which they come notwithstanding this character of the body i hope and expect that some conciliatory sacrifices will be made in order to extinguish opposition to the system or at least break the force of it by detaching the deluded opponents from their designing leaders with regard to the system of policy to which the government is capable of rising and by which its genius will be appreciated i wait for some experimental instruction were i to advance a conjecture it would be that the predictions of an antidemocratic operation will be confronted with at least a sufficient number of the features which have marked the state governments since my arrival here i have received your favor of november   th it had been sent on to virginia but not reaching fredericksburg before i passed that place it followed me back hither i am much concerned that your scheme of passing the ensuing summer in your native country has been defeated mr jay with whom i have conversed on the subject tells me that his answer to your public letter has explained the impossibility of giving effect to your wishes no congress having been formed under the old confederation since the receipt of your letter or indeed since the expiration of the last federal year     the most that can now be done will be to obtain from the new authority as early as possible some act which may leave the matter to your own discretion perhaps it may be neither more inconvenient to your private nor to the public affairs to make your visit in the fall instead of the spring and to pass the winter instead of the summer in america the same cause on which you are to charge your disappointment in this instance prevented a decision on the question of outfit stated in one of your former communications with some printed papers containing interesting articles i inclose a manuscript copy of col morgans invitation to persons disposed to seek their fortunes on the spanish side of the mississippi there is no doubt that the project has the sanction of gardoqui it is a silly one on the part of spain and will probably end like the settlements on the roman side of the danube with the concurrence of the declining empire but it clearly betrays the plan suggested to you in a former letter of making the mississippi the bait for a defection of the western people some of the leaders in kentucky are known to favor the idea of connection with spain the people are as yet inimical to it their future disposition will depend on the measures of the new government i omitted to mention that a dispute between the senate of this state which was federal and the other branch which was otherwise concerning the manner of appointing senators for the congress was so inflexibly persisted in that no appointment was     made during the late session and must be delayed for a considerable time longer even if the dispute should on a second trial be accommodated it is supposed by some that the superintending power of congress will be rendered necessary by the temper of the parties the provision for the choice of electors was also delayed until the opportunity was lost and that for the election of representatives so long delayed that the result will not be decided till tuesday next it is supposed that at least three out of the six will be of the federal party in new jersey the inaccuracy of the law providing for the choice of representatives has produced an almost equal delay and left room for contests which if brought by the disappointed candidates into the house will add a disagreeable article to the list of its business i am much obliged for the two estimates on the subject of our foreign debt and shall turn your ideas to the account which they deserve james madison aprilmarch  th      new york george washington to george washington

what has been suggested by the gentlemen that have spoken on the subject before us i am led to apprehend we shall be under the necessity of travelling further into an investigation of principles than what i supposed would be necessary or had in contemplation when i offered the propositions before you it was my view to restrain the first essay on this subject principally to the object of revenue and make this rather a temporary expedient than any thing permanent  i see   0 however that there are strong exceptions against deciding immediately on a part of the plan which i had the honor to bring forward as well as against an application to the resources mentioned in the list of articles just proposed by the gentleman from pennsylvania mr hartley i presume that however much we may be disposed to promote domestic manufactures we ought to pay some regard to the present policy of obtaining revenue it may be remarked also that by fixing on a temporary expedient for this purpose we may gain more than we shall lose by suspending the consideration of the other subject until we obtain fuller information of the state of our manufactures we have at this time the strongest motives for turning our attention to the point i have mentioned every gentleman sees that the prospect of our harvest from the spring importations is daily vanishing and if the committee delay levying and collecting an impost until a system of protecting duties     shall be perfected there will be no importations of any consequence on which the law is to operate because by that time all the spring vessels will have arrived therefore from a pursuit of this policy we shall suffer a loss equal to the surplus which might be expected from a system of higher duties i am sensible that there is great weight in the observation that fell from the honorable gentleman from south carolina mr tucker that it will be necessary on the one hand to weigh and regard the sentiments of the gentlemen from the different parts of the united states but on the other hand we must limit our consideration on this head and notwithstanding all the deference and respect we pay to those sentiments we must consider the general interest of the union for this is as much every gentlemans duty to consider as is the local or state interest—and any system of impost that this committee may adopt must be founded on the principles of mutual concession gentlemen will be pleased to recollect that those parts of the union which contribute more under one system than the other are also those parts more thinly planted and consequently stand most in need of national protection therefore they will have less reason to complain of unequal burdens there is another consideration the states that are most advanced in population and ripe for manufactures ought to have their particular interests attended to in some degree while these states retained the power of making regulations of trade they had the power to protect and cherish such institutions by adopting the present constitution they have thrown the exercise of this power into other hands they must have done this with an expectation that those interests would not be neglected here i am afraid sir on the one hand that if we go fully into a discussion of the subject we shall consume more time than prudence would dictate to spare on the other hand if we do not develope it and see the principles on which we mutually     act we shall subject ourselves to great difficulties i beg leave therefore to state the grounds on which my opinion with respect to the matter under consideration is founded namely whether our present system should be a temporary or a permanent one in the first place i own myself the friend to a very free system of commerce and hold it as a truth that commercial shackles are generally unjust oppressive and impolitic it is also a truth that if industry and labor are left to take their own course they will generally be directed to those objects which are the most productive and this in a more certain and direct manner than the wisdom of the most enlightened legislature could point out nor do i think that the national interest is more promoted by such restrictions than that the interest of individuals would be promoted by legislative interference directing the particular application of its industry for example we should find no advantage in saying that every man should be obliged to furnish himself by his own labor with those accommodations which depend on the mechanic arts instead of employing his neighbor who could do it for him on better terms it would be of no advantage to the shoemaker to make his own clothes to save the expense of the tailors bill nor of the tailor to make his own shoes to save the expense of procuring them from the shoemaker it would be better policy to suffer each of them to employ his talents in his own way the case is the same between the exercise of the arts and agriculture—between the city and the country—and between city and town each capable of making particular articles in abundance to supply the other thus all are benefited by exchange and the less this exchange is cramped by government the greater are the proportions of benefit to each the same argument holds good between nation and nation and between parts of the same nation in my opinion it would be proper also for gentlemen to consider the means of encouraging the great staple of america i mean agriculture which i think may justly be styled     the staple of the united states from the spontaneous productions which nature furnishes and the manifest advantage it has over every other object of emolument in this country if we compare the cheapness of our land with that of other nations we see so decided an advantage in that cheapness as to have full confidence of being unrivalled with respect to the object of manufactures other countries may and do rival us but we may be said to have a monopoly in agriculture the possession of the soil and the lowness of its price give us as much a monopoly in this case as any nation or other parts of the world have in the monopoly of any article whatever but with this advantage to us that it cannot be shared nor injured by rivalship if my general principle is a good one that commerce ought to be free and labor and industry left at large to find its proper object the only thing which remains will be to discover the exceptions that do not come within the rule i have laid down i agree with the gentleman from pennsylvania that there are exceptions important in themselves and which claim the particular attention of the committee although the freedom of commerce would be advantageous to the world yet in some particulars one nation might suffer to benefit others and this ought to be for the general good of society if america was to leave her ports perfectly free and make no discrimination between vessels owned by her citizens and those owned by foreigners while other nations make this discrimination it is obvious that such policy would go to exclude american shipping altogether from foreign ports and she would be materially affected in one of her most important interests to this we may add another consideration that by encouraging the means of transporting our productions with facility we encourage the raising them and this object i apprehend is likely to be kept in view by the general government duties laid on imported articles may have an effect which     comes within the idea of national prudence it may happen that materials for manufactures may grow up without any encouragement for this purpose it has been the case in some of the states but in others regulations have been provided and have succeeded in producing some establishments which ought not to be allowed to perish from the alteration which has taken place it would be cruel to neglect them and divert their industry to other channels for it is not possible for the hand of man to shift from one employment to another without being injured by the change there may be some manufactures which being once formed can advance towards perfection without any adventitious aid while others for want of the fostering hand of government will be unable to go on at all legislative attention will therefore be necessary to collect the proper objects for this purpose and this will form another exception to my general principle i observe that a sumptuary prohibition is within the view of some of the proposed articles and forms another exception i acknowledge that i do not in general think any great national advantage arises from restrictions passed on this head because as long as a distinction in point of value subsists sumptuary duties in some form or other will prevail and take effect another exception is embargoes in time of war these may necessarily occur and shackle the freedom of commerce but the reasons for this are so obvious that it renders any remark unnecessary the next exception that occurs is one on which great stress is laid by some well informed men and this with great plausibility that each nation should have within itself the means of defence independent of foreign supplies that in whatever relates to the operations of war no state ought to depend upon a precarious supply from any part of the world there may be some truth in this remark and therefore it is proper for legislative attention i am though well persuaded that the reasoning on this subject has been carried too far the     difficulties we experienced a few years ago of obtaining military supplies ought not furnish too much in favor of an establishment which would be difficult and expensive because our national character is now established and recognised throughout the world and the laws of war favor national exertion more than intestine commotion so that there is good reason to believe that when it becomes necessary we may obtain supplies from abroad as readily as any other nation whatsoever i have mentioned this because i think i see something among the enumerated articles that seems to favor such a policy the impost laid on trade for the purpose of obtaining revenue may likewise be considered as an exception so far therefore as revenue can be more conveniently and certainly raised by this than any other method without injury to the community and its operation will be in due proportion to the consumption which consumption is generally proportioned to the circumstances of individuals i think sound policy dictates to use this means but it will be necessary to confine our attention at this time peculiarly to the object of revenue because the other subject involves some intricate questions to unravel which we perhaps are not prepared i have no objection to the committees accepting the propositions offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania because so far as we can enumerate the proper objects and apply specific duties to them we conform to the practice prevalent in many of the states and adopt the most laudable method of collecting revenue at least preferable to laying a general tax whether therefore we consult ease and convenience in collection or pursuing habits already adopted and approved specific duties as far as the articles can be properly enumerated is the most eligible mode of obtaining the end in contemplation upon the whole as i think some of the propositions may be productive of revenue and some may protect our domestic manufactures though the latter subject ought not to be too confusedly blended with the former     i hope the committee will receive them and let them lie over in order that we may have time to consider how far they are consistent with justice and policy  april    duties on imports some gentlemen have seemed to call in question the policy of discriminating between nations in commercial alliance with the united states and those with whom no treaties exist for my own part i am well satisfied that there are good and substantial reasons for making it in the first place it may not be unworthy of consideration that the public sentiments of america will be favorable to such discrimination i am sure with respect to that part from which i come it will not be a pleasing ingredient in your laws if they find foreigners of     every nation put on a footing with those in alliance with us there is another reason which perhaps is more applicable to some parts of the union than others one of the few nations with which america has formed commercial connexions has relaxed considerably in that rigid policy it before pursued—not so far to be sure as america could wish with respect to opening her ports to our trade but she has permitted our ready built ships a sale and entitles them to the same advantage when owned by her own citizens as if they had been built in france subjecting the sale to a duty of five per cent the british market receives none the disabilities of our ships to trade with their colonies continue even if they are purchased by the subjects of great britain of consequence they cannot be sold without a considerable loss nay so cautious are they to prevent the advantages we naturally possess that they will not suffer a british ship to be repaired in america beyond a certain proportion of her value they even will not permit our vessels to be repaired in their ports another consideration has some weight with me in deciding the question of discrimination the policy of our ally from the views of the minister employed has frequently been adverse to the interest of this country the person who has had the charge of our affairs at that court has long been soliciting a relaxation in our favor and although it cannot be declared that he has succeeded yet there is reason to believe he has made some impressions which our conduct ought to avoid effacing they are such as merit national attention and might justify a discrimination at this time although it may be proper to hold ourselves at liberty to pursue that policy which a change may make necessary there are also other considerations which ought to be taken into view from artificial or adventitious causes the commerce between america and great britain exceeds what may be considered its natural boundary i find from an examination of the accounts of tonnage for the three large states of     massachusetts virginia and south carolina that the tonnage of nations in alliance with us holds no proportion with that of great britain or of the united states this is a proof that a very small direct commerce takes place between those countries and this that there is less of direct intercourse than there would naturally be if those extraneous and adventitious causes did not prevent it such as the long possession of our trade their commercial regulations calculated to retain it their similarity of language and manners their conformity of laws and other circumstances—all these concurring have made their commerce with us more extensive than their natural situation would require it to be i would wish therefore to give such political advantages to those nations as might enable them to gain their proportion of our direct trade from the nation who has acquired more than it is naturally her due from this view of the subject i am led to believe it would be good policy to make the proposed discrimination between them is it not also of some importance that we should enable nations in treaty with us to draw some advantage from our alliance and thereby impress those powers that have hitherto neglected to treat with us with the idea that advantages are to be gained by a reciprocity of friendship if we give every thing equally to those who have or have not formed treaties surely we do not furnish to them any motive for courting our connexion it has been objected that the price of our produce at foreign markets would not bear this additional burden and that the freight must be paid by the planters it will be unnecessary after what was said by the gentleman from pennsylvania mr fitzsimons to take up the time of the committee in observing that foreigners must receive our tobacco rice c in american shipping if they cannot be otherwise got there may be a discrimination made in other respects besides in tonnage so that a very high impost on this article need not be insisted upon but will any gentleman say british vessels ought to enjoy in american ports greater     advantages than are enjoyed by americans in british ports yet were the duties laid equal in both cases the british merchant would have a very great superiority in the first place some of the most valuable ports which she possesses and most conducive to our interest are absolutely closed while every port in the united states is open to her without restriction or limitation again even in those which it is permitted america to enter her vessels she must bring nothing but the produce of her own soil whilst the british ship makes circuitous voyages and brings with her the produce of every quarter of the globe these are material advantages and take the whole of these observations together i think they furnish substantial reasons for making the proposed discrimination april    duties on imports i am a friend to free commerce and at the same time a friend to such regulations as are calculated to promote our own interest and this on national principles the great principle of interest is a leading one with me and yet my combination of ideas on this head leads me to a very different conclusion from that made by the gentleman from new york mr lawrence i wish we were under less necessity than i find we are to shackle our commerce with duties restrictions and preferences but there are cases in which it is impossible to avoid following the example of other nations in the great diversity of our trade some reasons for this were mentioned on a former occasion they have been frequently illustrated in the progress of this business and the decision of the committee has proved them to be necessary i beg leave to remark in answer to a train of ideas which the gentleman last up has brought into view that although interest will in general operate effectually to produce political good yet there are causes in which certain factitious circumstances may divert it from its natural channel or throw   0 or retain it in an artificial one have we not been exercised on this topic for a long time past or why has it been necessary to give encouragement to particular species of industry but to turn the stream in favor of an interest that would not otherwise succeed but laying aside the illustration of these causes so well known to all nations where cities companies or opulent individuals engross the business from others by having had an uninterrupted possession of it or by the extent of their capitals being able to destroy a competition let us proceed to examine what ought to be our conduct on this principle upon the present occasion suppose two commercial cities one possessed of enormous capitals and long habits of business whilst the other is possessed of superior natural advantages but without that course of business and chain of connexions which the other has is it possible in the nature of things that the latter city should carry on a successful competition with the former thus it is with nations and when we consider the vast quantities of our produce sent to the different parts of europe and the great importations from the same places that almost all of this commerce is transacted through the medium of british ships and british merchants i cannot help conceiving that from the force of habit and other conspiring causes that nation is in possession of a much greater proportion of our trade than she is naturally entitled to trade then being restrained to an artificial channel is not so advantageous to america as a direct intercourse would be it becomes therefore the duty of those to whose care the public interest and welfare are committed to turn the tide to a more favorable direction in the trade of south carolina is employed annually about       tons of shipping the proportion of french and dutch is about   00 tons while that of great britain is about   000 in massachusetts the quantity is about       tons it is stated that there are belonging to the state       the remainder is foreign and mostly british in virginia we have       tons    0  british and only      of the     french and dutch i cannot from this view of the subject be persuaded to believe that every part of our trade flows in those channels which would be most natural and profitable to us or those which reason would dictate to us if we were unincumbered of old habits and other accidental circumstances that hurry us along it has been asked by the gentleman from new york mr lawrence what evidence we had that the public sentiments of america were in favor of discrimination perhaps it would be improper on this occasion to adduce any other proof of the fact than from the transactions of public bodies and here i think is abundant proof to be found the state of virginia if i am not mistaken lays a double duty on tonnage french and dutch vessels pay half a dollar per ton while the vessels of great britain are subjected to one dollar there are other distinctions in our revenue laws manifesting the same principle some of them establish a preference to french wines and brandy in maryland a similar policy has prevailed i believe the difference there is about onethird in favor of our allies if i err the gentlemen from that state can set me right in pennsylvania there is a discrimination of about a fourth i do not certainly recollect but i believe the like policy exists in other states but i have not had an opportunity of searching their laws on this point but what i have enumerated are facts affording substantial proof that the public sentiment does favor the discrimination may   duties on imports the right understanding of this subject is of great importance the discussion has been drawn out to a very considerable length on former occasions the chain of ideas on which the subject is suspended is not very long nor consists of many links the present constitution was framed to supply the defects of the one that has preceded it the great and material defects of it are well known to have arisen from     its inability to provide for the demands of justice and security of the union to supply those defects we are bound to fulfil the public engagements expectation is anxiously waiting the result of our deliberations it cannot be satisfied without a sufficient revenue to accomplish its purposes we cannot obtain the money any other way but by taxation among the various objects of this nature an impost on merchandise imported is preferable to all others and among the long list of articles included in the bill there is not one more proper for the purpose than the article under consideration the public sentiment has strongly pointed it out as an object of revenue i conceive therefore that it will be our duty to draw from this source all the money that it is capable of yielding i am sure that it will not exceed our wants nor extend to the injury of our commerce how far the powers of government are capable of going on this occasion is matter of opinion we have had no direct experiment of what can be done under the energy and popularity of the new system we must recur to other sources for information and then unless the circumstances are alike the comparison may not be true we have been referred to the experience of other nations if that is to guide us on this subject i am sure we shall find precedents for going much further than is now proposed if i do not mistake the calculations that i have seen of duties on importation they amount to more on an average than fifteen per cent the duty on ardent spirits in all nations exceeds what is in contemplation to be laid in the united states i am sensible that the means which are used by those nations to ensure the collection would be odious and improper in this country but i believe the means which this country is capable of using without exciting complaint or incurring too much expense would be as adequate to secure a duty of fifteen per cent as the powers of any other nation could be to obtain ninety or one hundred per cent if we consult the experience of the united states it does not admonish us that we are proceeding too far there are duties     now under collection in some states that amount nearly to the same as those we have in contemplation a duty collected under the feeble operation of the state governments cannot be supposed beyond our powers when those duties have been collected by them with feeble powers but under a competition not to say opposition of the neighboring states i am led from a knowledge of these circumstances to believe that when we have established some general rule and have the cooperation of all the members of the union we shall be able to do what is proposed by this bill better than any one state could execute it with its separate strength if we consult the opinion of the merchants we shall not find them a very sure guide merchants do not pretend to infallibility but if they did they have given a proof to the contrary by their difference of opinion on this subject gentlemen of that profession both within these walls and out of doors have been as much divided on this point as any other description of men i believe them to be the best informed as to the probable effects of an impost system but they are not exempt from the infirmities of human nature we know there is an essential difference between the interest of merchants and the interest of commerce we know there may be distinctions also between the interest of commerce and of revenue and that in some cases we must sacrifice the one to the other i am not sure that we are not under the necessity of doing both in the business before us it is barely matter of opinion what revenue the general government will be able to draw from the system now proposed this being the case i have endeavored to make up mine from the best materials in my power i pay great respect to the opinions of mercantile gentlemen and am willing to concede much to them so far as their opinions are regulated by experience but if i am to be guided by this information it will not lead me to agree to the reduction of the duties in the manner contended for it is said that if we reduce at all we must go through the whole now i doubt whether the duty on the     article of rum exceeds that proportion which pervades the long list before us it does not amount to more than thirty per cent while some other articles stand at forty some articles again that are not enumerated but which fall within the general mass at five per cent are more likely to be introduced clandestinely than this article if it stood at fifty per cent i am sure if we reduce the whole system in the manner now proposed all the duty we shall be able to collect will be very incompetent to what the public necessities demand we must turn our eyes then to some other source that will fill up the deficiency there are but two objects to which in this dilemma we can have recourse—direct taxation and excises direct taxation is not contemplated by any gentleman on this floor nor are our constituents prepared for such a system of revenue they expect it will not be applied to until it is found that sufficient funds cannot be obtained in any other way excises would give particular disgust in some states therefore gentlemen will not make up the deficiency from that quarter i think upon the whole it is better to try what will be produced by a plan which is favored by the public sentiment this will give a support to our laws equal to the greatest energy of a strong execution the citizens of america know that their individual interest is connected with the public we shall then have the strong motive of interest acting in favor of the government in a peculiar manner but i am not inclined to trust too much to this security i would take in the aid of the best regulations in our power to provide these acting in concert would give a moral certainty to the faithful collection of the revenue but if gentlemen notwithstanding will persist in contending against such a system and cannot offer us a substitute we must fail of the primary object for which the government was created if upon experience we find that the duties cannot be safely collected it may be proper to reduce them but if we set them too low in the first instance and they do not yield a sufficiency to answer the just demands of the public     creditors and the expenses of government the public reputation must suffer i need not inform gentlemen we are surrounded with difficulties they are seen on every side but they appear as few and as surmountable on the side of the bill as they do in any other part of the prospect if we give way on this article we are to do so upon all others it is not for any reason peculiar to jamaica spirits that the reduction is moved for hence i conceive if gentlemen meet with success in opposing this duty we shall be reduced to a system inadequate to our wants and thereby defeat the chief object of our appointment  may    titles i may be well disposed to concur in opinion with gentlemen that we ought not to recede from our former vote on this subject yet at the same time i may wish to proceed with due respect to the senate and give dignity and weight to our own opinion so far as it contradicts theirs by the deliberate and decent manner in which we decide for my     part mr speaker i do not conceive titles to be so pregnant with danger as some gentlemen apprehend i believe a president of the united states clothed with all the powers given in the constitution would not be a dangerous person to the liberties of america if you were to load him with all the titles of europe or asia we have seen superb and august titles given without conferring power and influence or without even obtaining respect one of the most impotent sovereigns in europe has assumed a title as high as human invention can devise for example what words can imply a greater magnitude of power and strength than that of high mightiness this title seems to border almost upon impiety it is assuming the preeminence and omnipotence of the deity yet this title and many others cast in the same mould have obtained a long time in europe but have they conferred power does experience sanction such an opinion look at the republic i have alluded to and say if their present state warrants the idea i am not afraid of titles because i fear the danger of any power they could confer but i am against them because they are not very reconcilable with the nature of our government or the genius of the people even if they were proper in themselves they are not so at this juncture of time but my strongest objection is founded in principle instead of increasing they diminish the true dignity and importance of a republic and would in particular on this occasion diminish the true dignity of the first magistrate himself if we give titles we must either borrow or invent them if we have recourse to the fertile fields of luxuriant fancy and deck out an airy being of our own creation it is a great chance but its fantastic properties would render the empty phantom ridiculous and absurd if we borrow the servile imitation will be odious not to say ridiculous also we must copy from the pompous sovereigns of the east or follow the inferior potentates of europe in either case the splendid tinsel or grogeous robe would disgrace the manly shoulders of our     chief the more truly honorable shall we be by showing a total neglect and disregard to things of this nature the more simple the more republican we are in our manners the more rational dignity we shall acquire therefore i am better pleased with the report adopted by the house than i should have been with any other whatsoever the senate no doubt entertain different sentiments on this subject i would wish therefore to treat their opinion with respect and attention i would desire to justify the reasonable and republican decision of this house to the other branch of congress in order to prevent a misunderstanding but that the motion of my worthy colleague mr parker has possession of the house i would move a more temperate proposition and i think it deserves some pains to bring about that good will and urbanity which for the despatch of public business ought to be kept up between the two houses i do not think it would be a sacrifice of dignity to appoint a committee of conference but imagine it would tend to cement that harmony which has hitherto been preserved between the senate and this house therefore while i concur with the gentlemen who express in such decided terms their disapprobation of bestowing titles i concur also with those who are for the appointment of a committee of conference not apprehending they will depart from the principles adopted and acted upon by the house may    duties on imports mr madison said his mind was incapable of discovering any plan that would answer the purpose the committee have in view and not produce greater evils than the one under consideration he thought an excise very objectionable but as no actual proposition for entering into such a system was before the committee he forebore to say any thing further about it he admitted an excise would obviate in part some of the difficulties but he did not think the answer given to     his argument altogether satisfactory yet there was another argument he urged on a former occasion remaining unanswered—it was that at this moment the fisheries distilleries and all their connexions were laboring under heavier duties than what is now proposed true the duty is collected in a different mode but it affects the consumer in the same manner the gentlemen have said to be sure that the duty is evaded but if half is collected it will amount to more than six cents per gallon it is said that a tax on molasses will be unpopular but not more so than a tax on salt can gentlemen state more serious apprehensions in the former than the latter case yet the committee did not forego a productive fund because the article was a necessary of life and in general consumption if there is the disposition that is represented for people to complain of the oppression of government have not the citizens of the southern states more just ground of complaint than others the system can only be acceptable to them because it is essentially necessary to be adopted for the public good gentlemen argue that a tax on molasses is unpopular and prove it by experience under the british government if this is to be adduced as a proof of the popularity of the measure what are we to say with respect to a tax on tea gentlemen remembered no doubt how odious this kind of tax was thought to be throughout america yet the house had without hesitation laid a considerable duty upon it he did not imagine that a duty on either of those articles was in itself objectionable it was the principle upon which the tax was laid that made them unpopular under the british government it is said that this tax is unjust now he had not a single idea of justice that did not contradict the position if it be considered as it relates to rum he was certain the consumers of foreign rum paid a larger proportion of revenue into the treasury than the consumers of country rum they paid more than equal distributive justice required if it was considered     as it respected molasses there would appear no injustice molasses was consumed in other states but if it was not sugar was used in its stead and subjected to a duty full as high as that on molasses but dismissing both these considerations and even admitting the whole weight to fall on the northern states it would not be disproportioned because in the long list of enumerated articles subject to a high duty they imported few or none indeed the articles were pretty generally taxed for the benefit of the manufacturing part of the northern community see loaf sugar candles cheese soap c he hoped gentlemen would not infer from this observation that he thought the encouragement held out by the bill to manufactures improper far from it he was glad to see their growing consequence and was disposed to give them every aid in his power from this view of the subject he was inclined to adhere to the bill and not make any reduction may    duties on imports when he offered this amendment to the bill he thought its propriety was so obvious and striking that it would meet no opposition to pass a bill  not limited in duration which was to draw revenue from the pockets of the people appeared to be dangerous in the administration of any government he hoped therefore the house would not be less cautious in this particular than other nations are who profess to act upon sound principles he imagined it might be considered by their constituents as incompatible with the spirit of the constitution and dangerous to republican principles to pass such a law unlimited in its duration he hoped it would not be understood by gentlemen who opposed his motion that he supposed them to be actuated with a desire to do injury to either of those principles he believed them to be moved only by an ardent desire to promote the general welfare by the reestablishment of public   0 credit he would heartily join his labors with theirs to effect this object but wished to do it in a way that while they served their country they might secure the liberties of the people and do honor to themselves besides the restoration of public credit he thought the act had in view the encouragement of a particular description of people which might lead them into enterprises of a peculiar nature for the protection of which the public faith seemed to be pledged but would gentlemen infer from hence that no alteration ought to take place if the manufactures were well established the subject appeared to him in a twofold point of view first to provide for the exigencies of government and second for the establishment of public credit but he thought both these objects could be obtained without making the bill perpetual if the government showed a proper attention to the punctual performance of its engagements it would obtain the latter the other would be secured by making provision as the occasion demanded if the bill was to be made perpetual it would be continued after the purpose for which it was adopted had ceased the error would in this case be irremediable whereas if its limitation was determined it would always be in the power of the government to make it commensurate with what the public debts and contingencies required the constitution as had already been observed places the power in the house of originating money bills the principal reason why the constitution had made this distinction was because they were chosen by the people and supposed to be best acquainted with their interests and ability in order to make them more particularly acquainted with these objects the democratic branch of the legislature consisted of a greater number and were chosen for a shorter period so that they might revert more frequently to the mass of the people now if a revenue law was made perpetual however unequal its operation might be it would be out of the power of this house to effect an alteration for if the president     chose to object to the measure it would require twothirds of both houses to carry it even if the house of representatives were unanimous in their opinion that the law ought to be repealed they would not be able to carry it unless a great majority appeared in the senate also he observed that an honorable gentleman had thought that no appropriation of the public money could be made for a longer term than two years this was true as it related to the support of armies but the question here did not appear to be respecting an appropriation it was the revenue itself which without any appropriation might continue flowing into the public treasury independent of the will of the people and might thereby become a convenience in the hands of some other department of the government for the purpose of oppression experience might also forcibly suggest the necessity and importance of alterations in the law yet without this clause it might never be in the power of the house to make them  may    power of removal from office mr madison did not concur with the gentleman in his interpretation of the constitution  what said he would     be the consequence of such construction it would in effect establish every officer of the government on the firm tenure of good behaviour not the heads of departments only but all the inferior officers of those departments would hold their offices during good behaviour and that to be judged of by one branch of the legislature only on the impeachment of the other if the constitution means this by its declarations to be the case we must submit but i should lament it as a fatal error interwoven in the system and one that would ultimately prove its destruction i think the inference would not arise from a fair construction of the words of that instrument it is very possible that an officer who may not incur the displeasure of the president may be guilty of actions that ought to forfeit his place the power of this house may reach him by the means of an impeachment and he may be removed even against the will of the president so that the declaration in the constitution was intended as a supplemental security for the good behaviour of the public officers it is possible the case i have stated may happen indeed it may perhaps on some occasion be found necessary to impeach the president himself surely therefore it may happen to a subordinate officer whose bad actions may be connived at or overlooked by the president hence the people have an additional security in this constitutional provision i think it absolutely necessary that the president should have the power of removing from office it will make him in a peculiar manner responsible for their conduct and subject him to impeachment himself if he suffers them to perpetrate with impunity high crimes or misdemeanors against the united states or neglects to superintend their conduct so as to check their excesses on the constitutionality of the declaration i have no manner of doubt     i look upon every constitutional question whatever its nature may be as of great importance i look upon the present to be doubly so because its nature is of the highest moment to the wellbeing of the government i have listened with attention to the objections which have been stated and to the replies that have been made and i think the investigation of the meaning of the constitution has supported the doctrine i brought forward if you consult the expediency it will be greatly against the doctrine advanced by gentlemen on the other side of the question see to what inconsistency gentlemen drive themselves by their construction of the constitution the gentleman from south carolina mr smith in order to bring to conviction and punishment an offender in any of the principal offices must have recourse to a breach of the common law and yet he may there be found guilty and maintain his office because he is fixed by the constitution it has been said we may guard against the inconveniency of that construction by limiting the duration of the office to a term of years but during that term there is no way of getting rid of a bad officer but by impeachment during the time this is depending the person may continue to commit those crimes for which he is impeached because if his construction of the constitution is right the president can have no more power to suspend than he has to remove what fell from one of my colleagues mr bland appears to have more weight than any thing hitherto suggested the constitution at the first view may seem to favor his opinion but that must be the case only at the first view for if we examine it we shall find his construction incompatible with the spirit and principles contained in that instrument it is said that it comports with the nature of things that those who appoint should have the power of removal but i cannot conceive that this sentiment is warranted by the constitution i believe it would be found very inconvenient in practice it is one of the most prominent features of the     constitution a principle that pervades the whole system that there should be the highest possible degree of responsibility in all the executive officers thereof any thing therefore which tends to lessen this responsibility is contrary to its spirit and intention and unless it is saddled upon us expressly by the letter of that work i shall oppose the admission of it into any act of the legislature now if the heads of the executive departments are subjected to removal by the president alone we have in him security for the good behaviour of the officer if he does not conform to the judgment of the president in doing the executive duties of his office he can be displaced this makes him responsible to the great executive power and makes the president responsible to the public for the conduct of the person he has nominated and appointed to aid him in the administration of his department but if the president shall join in a collusion with this officer and continue a bad man in office the case of impeachment will reach the culprit and drag him forth to punishment but if you take the other construction and say he shall not be displaced but by and with the advice and consent of the senate the president is no longer answerable for the conduct of the officer all will depend upon the senate you here destroy a real responsibility without obtaining even the shadow for no gentleman will pretend to say the responsibility of the senate can be of such a nature as to afford substantial security but why it may be asked was the senate joined with the president in appointing to office if they have no responsibility i answer merely for the sake of advising being supposed from their nature better acquainted with the character of the candidates than an individual yet even here the president is held to the responsibility—he nominates and with their consent appoints no person can be forced upon him as an assistant by any other branch of the government there is another objection to this construction which i consider of some weight and shall therefore mention to the     committee perhaps there was no argument urged with more success or more plausibly grounded against the constitution under which we are now deliberating than that founded on the mingling of the executive and legislative branches of the government in one body it has been objected that the senate have too much of the executive power even by having a control over the president in the appointment to office now shall we extend this connexion between the legislative and executive departments which will strengthen the objection and diminish the responsibility we have in the head of the executive i cannot but believe if gentlemen weigh well these considerations they will think it safe and expedient to adopt the clause may    citizenship of the united states i think the merit of the question is now to be decided whether the gentleman is eligible to a seat in this house or not but it will depend on the decision of a previous question whether he has been seven years a citizen of the united states or not from an attention to the facts which have been adduced and from a consideration of the principles established by the revolution the conclusion i have drawn is that mr smith was on the declaration of independence a citizen of the united states and unless it appears that he has forfeited his right by some neglect or overt act he had continued a citizen until the day of his election to a seat in this house i take it to be a clear point that we are to be guided in our decision by the laws and constitution of south carolina so far as they can guide us and where the laws do not expressly guide us we must be guided by principles of a general nature so far as they are applicable to the present case it were to be wished that we had some law adduced more precisely defining the qualities of a citizen or an alien particular laws of this kind have obtained in some of the states     if such a law existed in south carolina it might have prevented this question from ever coming before us but since this has not been the case let us settle some general principle before we proceed to the presumptive proof arising from public measures under the law which tend to give support to the inference drawn from such principles it is an established maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance birth however derives its force sometimes from place and sometimes from parentage but in general place is the most certain criterion it is what applies in the united states it will therefore be unnecessary to investigate any other mr smith founds his claim upon his birthright his ancestors were among the first settlers of that colony it is well known to many gentlemen on this floor as well as to the public that the petitioner  is a man of talents one who would not lightly hazard his reputation in support of visionary principles yet i cannot but think he has erred in one of the principles upon which he grounds his charge he supposes when this country separated from great britain the tie of allegiance subsisted between the inhabitants of america and the king of that nation unless by some adventitious circumstance the allegiance was transferred to one of the united states i think there is a distinction which will invalidate his doctrine in this particular a distinction between that primary allegiance which we owe to that particular society of which we are members and the secondary allegiance we     owe to the sovereign established by that society this distinction will be illustrated by the doctrine established by the laws of great britain which were the laws of this country before the revolution the sovereign cannot make a citizen by any act of his own he can confer denizenship but this does not make a man either a citizen or subject in order to make a citizen or subject it is established that allegiance shall first be due to the whole nation it is necessary that a national act should pass to admit an individual member in order to become a member of the british empire where birth has not endowed the person with that privilege he must be naturalized by an act of parliament what was the situation of the people of america when the dissolution of their allegiance took place by the declaration of independence i conceive that every person who owed this primary allegiance to the particular community in which he was born retained his right of birth as a member of a new community that he was consequently absolved from the secondary allegiance he had owed to the british sovereign if he were not a minor he became bound by his own act as a member of the society who separated with him from a submission to a foreign country if he were a minor his consent was involved in the decision of that society to which he belonged by the ties of nature what was the allegiance as a citizen of south carolina he owed to the king of great britain he owed his allegiance to him as a king of that society to which as a society he owed his primary allegiance when that society separated from great britain he was bound by that act and his allegiance transferred to that society or the sovereign which that society should set up because it was through his membership of the society of south carolina that he owed allegiance to great britain this reasoning will hold good unless it is supposed that the separation which took place between these states and great britain not only dissolved the union between those countries but dissolved the union among the citizens themselves that     the original compact which made them altogether one society being dissolved they could not fall into pieces each part making an independent society but must individually revert into a state of nature but i do not conceive that this was of necessity to be the case i believe such a revolution did not absolutely take place but in supposing that this was the case lies the error of the memorialist i conceive the colonies remained as a political society detached from their former connexion with another society without dissolving into a state of nature but capable of substituting a new form of government in the place of the old one which they had for special considerations abolished suppose the state of south carolina should think proper to revise her constitution abolish that which now exists and establish another form of government surely this would not dissolve the social compact it would not throw them back into a state of nature it would not dissolve the union between the individual members of that society it would leave them in perfect society changing only the mode of action which they are always at liberty to arrange mr smith being then at the declaration of independence a minor but being a member of that particular society he became in my opinion bound by the decision of the society with respect to the question of independence and change of government and if afterwards he had taken part with the enemies of his country he would have been guilty of treason against that government to which he owed allegiance and would have been liable to be prosecuted as a traitor if it be said that very inconvenient circumstances would result from this principle that it would constitute all those persons who are natives of america but who took part against the revolution citizens of the united states i would beg leave to observe that we are deciding a question of right unmixed with the question of expediency and must therefore pay a proper attention to this principle but i think it can hardly be expected by gentlemen that the principle will     operate dangerously those who left their country to take part with britain were of two descriptions—minors or persons of mature age with respect to the latter nothing can be inferred with respect to them from the decision of the present case because they had the power of making an option between the contending parties whether this was a matter of right or not is a question which need not be agitated in order to settle the case before us then with respect to those natives who were minors at the revolution and whose case is analogous to mr smiths if we are bound by the precedent of such a decision as we are about to make and it is declared that they owe a primary allegiance to this country i still think we are not likely to be inundated with such characters so far as any of them took part against us they violated their allegiance and opposed our laws so then there can be only a few characters such as were minors at the revolution and who have never violated their allegiance by a foreign connexion who can be affected by the decision of the present question the number i admit is large who might be acknowledged citizens on my principles but there will very few be found daring enough to face the laws of the country they have violated and against which they have committed high treason so far as we can judge by the laws of carolina and the practice and decision of that state the principles i have adduced are supported and i must own that i feel myself at liberty to decide that mr smith was a citizen at the declaration of independence a citizen at the time of his election and consequently entitled to a seat in this legislature    0 june   amendments to the constitution i am sorry to be accessary to the loss of a single moment of time by the house if i had been indulged in my motion and we had gone into a committee of the whole i think we might have rose and resumed the consideration of other business before this time that is so far as it depended upon what i proposed to bring forward as that mode seems not to give satisfaction i will withdraw the motion and move you sir that a select committee be appointed to consider and report such amendments as are proper for congress to propose to the legislatures of the several states conformably to the fifth article of the constitution     i will state my reasons why i think it proper to propose amendments and state the amendments themselves so far as i think they ought to be proposed if i thought i could fulfil the duty which i owe to myself and my constituents to let the subject pass over in silence i most certainly should not trespass upon the indulgence of this house but i cannot do this and am therefore compelled to beg a patient hearing     to what i have to lay before you and i do most sincerely believe that if congress will devote but one day to this subject so far as to satisfy the public that we do not disregard their wishes it will have a salutary influence on the public councils and prepare the way for a favorable reception of our future measures it appears to me that this house is bound     by every motive of prudence not to let the first session pass over without proposing to the state legislatures some things to be incorporated into the constitution that will render it as acceptable to the whole people of the united states as it has been found acceptable to a majority of them i wish among other reasons why something should be done that     those who had been friendly to the adoption of this constitution may have the opportunity of proving to those who were opposed to it that they were as sincerely devoted to liberty and a republican government as those who charged them with wishing the adoption of this constitution in order to lay the foundation of an aristocracy or despotism it will be a desirable thing to extinguish from the bosom of every member of the community any apprehensions that there are those among his countrymen who wish to deprive them of the liberty for which they valiantly fought and honorably bled and if there are amendments desired of such a nature as will not injure the constitution and they can be ingrafted so as to give satisfaction to the doubting part of our fellowcitizens the friends of the federal government will evince that spirit of deference and concession for which they have hitherto been distinguished it cannot be a secret to the gentlemen in this house that notwithstanding the ratification of this system of government by eleven of the thirteen united states in some cases unanimously in others by large majorities yet still there is a great number of our constituents who are dissatisfied with it among whom are many respectable for their talents and patriotism and respectable for the jealousy they have for their liberty which though mistaken in its object is laudable in its motive there is a great body of the people falling under this description who at present feel much inclined to join their support to the cause of federalism if they were satisfied on this one point we ought not to disregard their inclination but on principles of amity and moderation conform to their wishes and expressly declare the great rights of mankind secured under this constitution the acquiescence which our fellowcitizens show under the government calls upon us for a like return of moderation but perhaps there is a stronger motive than this for our going into a consideration of the subject it is to provide those securities for liberty which are required by a part of the community i allude     in a particular manner to those two states that have not thought fit to throw themselves into the bosom of the confederacy it is a desirable thing on our part as well as theirs that a reunion should take place as soon as possible i have no doubt if we proceed to take those steps which would be prudent and requisite at this juncture that in a short time we should see that disposition prevailing in those states which have not come in that we have seen prevailing in those states which have embraced the constitution but i will candidly acknowledge that over and above all these considerations i do conceive that the constitution may be amended that is to say if all power is subject to abuse that then it is possible the abuse of the powers of the general government may be guarded against in a more secure manner than is now done while no one advantage arising from the exercise of that power shall be damaged or endangered by it we have in this way something to gain and if we proceed with caution nothing to lose and in this case it is necessary to proceed with caution for while we feel all these inducements to go into a revisal of the constitution we must feel for the constitution itself and make that revisal a moderate one i should be unwilling to see a door opened for a reconsideration of the whole structure the government—for a reconsideration of the principles and the substance of the powers given because i doubt if such a door were opened we should be very likely to stop at that point which would be safe to the government itself but i do wish to see a door opened to consider so far as to incorporate those provisions for the security of rights against which i believe no serious objection has been made by any class of our constituents such as would be likely to meet with the concurrence of twothirds of both houses and the approbation of threefourths of the state legislatures i will not propose a single alteration which i do not wish to see take place as intrinsically proper in itself or proper because it is wished for by a respectable number of my fellowcitizens and therefore i shall not propose     a single alteration but is likely to meet the concurrence required by the constitution there have been objections of various kinds made against the constitution some were levelled against its structure because the president was without a council because the senate which is a legislative body had judicial powers in trials on impeachments and because the powers of that body were compounded in other respects in a manner that did not correspond with a particular theory because it grants more power than is supposed to be necessary for every good purpose and controls the ordinary powers of the state governments i know some respectable characters who opposed this government on these grounds but i believe that the great mass of the people who opposed it disliked it because it did not contain effectual provisions against the encroachments on particular rights and those safeguards which they have been long accustomed to have interposed between them and the magistrate who exercises the sovereign power nor ought we to consider them safe while a great number of our fellowcitizens think these securities necessary it is a fortunate thing that the objection to the government has been made on the ground i stated because it will be practicable on that ground to obviate the objection so far as to satisfy the public mind that their liberties will be perpetual and this without endangering any part of the constitution which is considered as essential to the existence of the government by those who promoted its adoption the amendments which have occurred to me proper to be recommended by congress to the state legislatures are these first that there be prefixed to the constitution a declaration that all power is originally vested in and consequently derived from the people that government is instituted and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people which consists in the enjoyment of life and liberty with the right of acquiring and using property and generally of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety     that the people have an indubitable unalienable and indefeasible right to reform or change their government whenever it be found adverse or inadequate to the purposes of its institution secondly that in article  st section   clause   these words be struck out to wit the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state shall have at least one representative and until such enumeration shall be made and that in place thereof be inserted these words to wit after the first actual enumeration there shall be one representative for every thirty thousand until the number amounts to — after which the proportion shall be so regulated by congress that the number shall never be less than — nor more than — but each state shall after the first enumeration have at least two representatives and prior thereto thirdly that in article  st section   clause   there be added to the end of the first sentence these words to wit but no law varying the compensation last ascertained shall operate before the next ensuing election of representatives fourthly that in article  st section   between clauses   and   be inserted these clauses to wit the civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship nor shall any national religion be established nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner or on any pretext infringed the people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak to write or to publish their sentiments and the freedom of the press as one of the great bulwarks of liberty shall be inviolable the people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good nor from applying to the legislature by petitions or remonstrances for redress of their grievances the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well armed and well regulated militia being the     best security of a free country but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person no soldiers shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner nor at any time but in a manner warranted by law no person shall be subject except in cases of impeachment to more than one punishment or one trial for the same offence nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor be obliged to relinquish his property where it may be necessary for public use without a just compensation excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted the rights of the people to be secured in their persons their houses their papers and their other property from all unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated by warrants issued without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation or not particularly describing the places to be searched or the persons or things to be seized in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial to be informed of the cause and nature of the accusation to be confronted with his accusers and the witnesses against him to have a compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence the exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution made in favor of particular rights shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution but either as actual limitations of such powers or as inserted merely for greater caution fifthly that in article  st section  0 between clauses   and   be inserted this clause to wit no state shall violate the equal rights of conscience or the freedom of the press or the trial by jury in criminal cases     sixthly that in article  d section   be annexed to the end of clause  d these words to wit but no appeal to such court shall be allowed where the value in controversy shall not amount to — dollars nor shall any fact triable by jury according to the course of common law be otherwise reexaminable than may consist with the principles of common law seventhly that in article  d section   the third clause be struck out and in its place be inserted the clauses following to wit the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachments and cases arising in the land or naval forces or the militia when on actual service in time of war or public danger shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage with the requisite of unanimity for conviction of the right of challenge and other accustomed requisites and in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy or in which a general insurrection may prevail the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state as near as may be to the seat of the offence in cases of crimes committed not within any county the trial may by law be in such county as the laws shall have prescribed in suits at common law between man and man the trial by jury as one of the best securities to the rights of the people ought to remain inviolate eighthly that immediately after article  th be inserted as article  th the clauses following to wit the powers delegated by this constitution are appropriated to the departments to which they are respectively distributed so that the legislative department shall never exercise the powers vested in the executive or judicial nor the executive exercise the powers vested in the legislative or judicial nor the judicial exercise the powers vested in the legislative or executive departments   0 the powers not delegated by this constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively ninthly that article  th be numbered as article  th the first of these amendments relates to what may be called a bill of rights i will own that i never considered this provision so essential to the federal constitution as to make it improper to ratify it until such an amendment was added at the same time i always conceived that in a certain form and to a certain extent such a provision was neither improper nor altogether useless i am aware that a great number of the most respectable friends to the government and champions for republican liberty have thought such a provision not only unnecessary but even improper nay i believe some have gone so far as to think it even dangerous some policy has been made use of perhaps by gentlemen on both sides of the question i acknowledge the ingenuity of those arguments which were drawn against the constitution by a comparison with the policy of great britain in establishing a declaration of rights but there is too great a difference in the case to warrant the comparison therefore the arguments drawn from that source were in a great measure inapplicable in the declaration of rights which that country has established the truth is they have gone no farther than to raise a barrier against the power of the crown the power of the legislature is left altogether indefinite although i know whenever the great rights the trial by jury freedom of the press or liberty of conscience come in question in that body the invasion of them is resisted by able advocates yet their magna charta does not contain any one provision for the security of those rights respecting which the people of america are most alarmed the freedom of the press and rights of conscience those choicest privileges of the people are unguarded in the british constitution but although the case may be widely different and it may not be thought necessary to provide limits for the legislative power in that country yet a different opinion prevails in the     united states the people of many states have thought it necessary to raise barriers against power in all forms and departments of government and i am inclined to believe if once bills of rights are established in all the states as well as the federal constitution we shall find that although some of them are rather unimportant yet upon the whole they will have a salutary tendency it may be said in some instances they do no more than state the perfect equality of mankind this to be sure is an absolute truth yet it is not absolutely necessary to be inserted at the head of a constitution in some instances they assert those rights which are exercised by the people in forming and establishing a plan of government in other instances they specify those rights which are retained when particular powers are given up to be exercised by the legislature in other instances they specify positive rights which may seem to result from the nature of the compact trial by jury cannot be considered as a natural right but a right resulting from a social compact which regulates the action of the community but is as essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of the preexistent rights of nature in other instances they lay down dogmatic maxims with respect to the construction of the government declaring that the legislative executive and judicial branches shall be kept separate and distinct perhaps the best way of securing this in practice is to provide such checks as will prevent the encroachment of the one upon the other but whatever may be the form which the several states have adopted in making declarations in favor of particular rights the great object in view is to limit and qualify the powers of government by excepting out of the grant of power those cases in which the government ought not to act or to act only in a particular mode they point these exceptions sometimes against the abuse of the executive power sometimes against the legislative and in some cases against the community itself or in other words against the majority in favor of the minority     in our government it is perhaps less necessary to guard against the abuse in the executive department than any other because it is not the stronger branch of the system but the weaker it therefore must be levelled against the legislative for it is the most powerful and most likely to be abused because it is under the least control hence so far as a declaration of rights can tend to prevent the exercise of undue power it cannot be doubted but such declaration is proper but i confess that i do conceive that in a government modified like this of the united states the great danger lies rather in the abuse of the community than in the legislative body the prescriptions in favor of liberty ought to be levelled against that quarter where the greatest danger lies namely that which possesses the highest prerogative of power but this is not found in either the executive or legislative departments of government but in the body of the people operating by the majority against the minority it may be thought that all paper barriers against the power of the community are too weak to be worthy of attention i am sensible they are not so strong as to satisfy gentlemen of every description who have seen and examined thoroughly the texture of such a defence yet as they have a tendency to impress some degree of respect for them to establish the public opinion in their favor and rouse the attention of the whole community it may be one means to control the majority from those acts to which they might be otherwise inclined it has been said by way of objection to a bill of rights by many respectable gentlemen out of doors and i find opposition on the same principles likely to be made by gentlemen on this floor that they are unnecessary articles of a republican government upon the presumption that the people have those rights in their own hands and that is the proper place for them to rest it would be a sufficient answer to say that this objection lies against such provisions under the state governments as well as under the general government and there are i believe but few gentlemen who are inclined to     push their theory so far as to say that a declaration of rights in those cases is either ineffectual or improper it has been said that in the federal government they are unnecessary because the powers are enumerated and it follows that all that are not granted by the constitution are retained that the constitution is a bill of powers the great residuum being the rights of the people and therefore a bill of rights cannot be so necessary as if the residuum was thrown into the hands of the government i admit that these arguments are not entirely without foundation but they are not conclusive to the extent which has been supposed it is true the powers of the general government are circumscribed they are directed to particular objects but even if government keeps within those limits it has certain discretionary powers with respect to the means which may admit of abuse to a certain extent in the same manner as the powers of the state governments under their constitutions may to an indefinite extent because in the constitution of the united states there is a clause granting to congress the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all the powers vested in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof this enables them to fulfil every purpose for which the government was established now may not laws be considered necessary and proper by congress for it is for them to judge of the necessity and propriety to accomplish those special purposes which they may have in contemplation which laws in themselves are neither necessary nor proper as well as improper laws could be enacted by the state legislatures for fulfilling the more extended objects of those governments i will state an instance which i think in point and proves that this might be the case the general government has a right to pass all laws which shall be necessary to collect its revenue the means for enforcing the collection are within the direction of the legislature may not general warrants be considered necessary for this purpose as well as for some purposes which     it was supposed at the framing of their constitutions the state governments had in view if there was reason for restraining the state governments from exercising this power there is like reason for restraining the federal government it may be said indeed it has been said that a bill of rights is not necessary because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions that those rights of the people which had been established by the most solemn act could not be annihilated by a subsequent act of that people who meant and declared at the head of the instrument that they ordained and established a new system for the express purpose of securing to themselves and posterity the liberties they had gained by an arduous conflict i admit the force of this observation but i do not look upon it to be conclusive in the first place it is too uncertain ground to leave this provision upon if a provision is at all necessary to secure rights so important as many of those i have mentioned are conceived to be by the public in general as well as those in particular who opposed the adoption of this constitution besides some states have no bills of rights there are others provided with very defective ones and there are others whose bills of rights are not only defective but absolutely improper instead of securing some in the full extent which republican principles would require they limit them too much to agree with the common ideas of liberty it has been objected also against a bill of rights that by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration and it might follow by implication that those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government and were consequently insecure this is one of the most plausible arguments i have ever heard urged against the admission of a bill of rights into this system but i conceive that it may     be guarded against i have attempted it as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution it has been said that it is unnecessary to load the constitution with this provision because it was not found effectual in the constitution of the particular states it is true there are a few particular states in which some of the most valuable articles have not at one time or other been violated but it does not follow but they may have to a certain degree a salutary effect against the abuse of power if they are incorporated into the constitution independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the constitution by the declaration of rights besides this security there is a great probability that such a declaration in the federal system would be enforced because the state legislatures will jealously and closely watch the operations of this government and be able to resist with more effect every assumption of power than any other power on earth can do and the greatest opponents to a federal government admit the state legislatures to be sure guardians of the peoples liberty i conclude from this view of the subject that it will be proper in itself and highly politic for the tranquillity of the public mind and the stability of the government that we should offer something in the form i have proposed to be incorporated in the system of government as a declaration of the rights of the people in the next place i wish to see that part of the constitution revised which declares that the number of representatives shall not exceed the proportion of one for every thirty thousand persons and allows one representative to every state which rates below that proportion if we attend to the discussion of this subject which has taken place in the state conventions and even in the opinion of the friends to the     constitution an alteration here is proper it is the sense of the people of america that the number of representatives ought to be increased but particularly that it should not be left in the discretion of the government to diminish them below that proportion which certainly is in the power of the legislature as the constitution now stands and they may as the population of the country increases increase the house of representatives to a very unwieldy degree i confess i always thought this part of the constitution defective though not dangerous and that it ought to be particularly attended to whenever congress should go into the consideration of amendments there are several minor cases enumerated in my proposition in which i wish also to see some alteration take place that article which leaves it in the power of the legislature to ascertain its own emolument is one to which i allude i do not believe this is a power which in the ordinary course of government is likely to be abused perhaps of all the powers granted it is least likely to abuse but there is a seeming impropriety in leaving any set of men without control to put their hand into the public coffers to take out money to put in their pockets there is a seeming indecorum in such power which leads me to propose a change we have a guide to this alteration in several of the amendments which the different conventions have proposed i have gone therefore so far as to fix it that no law varying the compensation shall operate until there is a change in the legislature in which case it cannot be for the particular benefit of those who are concerned in determining the value of the service i wish also in revising the constitution we may throw into that section which interdicts the abuse of certain powers in the state legislatures some other provisions of equal if not greater importance than those already made the words no state shall pass any bill of attainder ex post facto law c were wise and proper restrictions in the constitution i think there is more danger of those powers being     abused by the state governments than by the government of the united states the same may be said of other powers which they possess if not controlled by the general principle that laws are unconstitutional which infringe the rights of the community i should therefore wish to extend this interdiction and add as i have stated in the  th resolution that no state shall violate the equal right of conscience freedom of the press or trial by jury in criminal cases because it is proper that every government should be disarmed of powers which trench upon those particular rights i know in some of the state constitutions the power of the government is controlled by such a declaration but others are not i cannot see any reason against obtaining even a double security on those points and nothing can give a more sincere proof of the attachment of those who opposed this constitution to these great and important rights than to see them join in obtaining the security i have now proposed because it must be admitted on all hands that the state governments are as liable to attack these invaluable privileges as the general government is and therefore ought to be as cautiously guarded against i think it will be proper with respect to the judiciary powers to satisfy the public mind on those points which i have mentioned great inconvenience has been apprehended to suitors from the distance they would be dragged to obtain justice in the supreme court of the united states upon an appeal on an action for a small debt to remedy this declare that no appeal shall be made unless the matter in controversy amounts to a particular sum this with the regulations respecting jury trials in criminal cases and suits at common law it is to be hoped will quiet and reconcile the minds of the people to that part of the constitution i find from looking into the amendments proposed by the state conventions that several are particularly anxious that it should be declared in the constitution that the powers not therein delegated should be reserved to the several states     perhaps other words may define this more precisely than the whole of the instrument now does i admit they may be deemed unnecessary but there can be no harm in making such a declaration if gentlemen will allow that the fact is as stated i am sure i understand it so and do therefore propose it these are the points on which i wish to see a revision of the constitution take place how far they will accord with the sense of this body i cannot take upon me absolutely to determine but i believe every gentleman will readily admit that nothing is in contemplation so far as i have mentioned that can endanger the beauty of the government in any one important feature even in the eyes of its most sanguine admirers i have proposed nothing that does not appear to me as proper in itself or eligible as patronised by a respectable number of our fellowcitizens and if we can make the constitution better in the opinion of those who are opposed to it without weakening its frame or abridging its usefulness in the judgment of those who are attached to it we act the part of wise and liberal men to make such alterations as shall produce that effect having done what i conceived was my duty in bringing before this house the subject of amendments and also stated such as i wish for and approve and offered the reasons which occurred to me in their support i shall content myself for the present with moving that a committee be appointed to consider of and report such amendments as ought to be proposed by congress to the legislatures of the states to become if ratified by threefourths thereof part of the constitution of the united states by agreeing to this motion the subject may be going on in the committee while other important business is proceeding to a conclusion in the house i should advocate greater despatch in the business of amendments if i were not convinced of the absolute necessity there is of pursuing the organization of the government because i think we should obtain the confidence of our fellowcitizens     in proportion as we fortify the rights of the people against the encroachments of the government    0 june    power of removal from office if the construction of the constitution is to be left to its natural course with respect to the executive powers of this government i own that the insertion of this sentiment  in     law may not be of material importance though if it is nothing more than a mere declaration of a clear grant made by the constitution it can do no harm but if it relates to a doubtful part of the constitution i suppose an exposition of the constitution may come with as much propriety from the legislature as any other department of the government if the power naturally belongs to the government and the constitution is undecided as to the body which is to exercise it it is likely that it is submitted to the discretion of the legislature and the question will depend upon its own merits i am clearly of opinion with the gentleman from south carolina mr smith that we ought in this and every other case to adhere to the constitution so far as it will serve as a guide to us and that we ought not to be swayed in our decisions by the splendor of the character of the present chief magistrate but to consider it with respect to the merit of men who in the ordinary course of things may be supposed to fill the chair i believe the power here declared is a high one and in some respects a dangerous one but in order to come to a right decision on this point we must consider both sides of the question the possible abuses which may spring from the single will of the first magistrate and the abuse which may spring from the combined will of the executive and senatorial disqualification when we consider that the first magistrate is to be appointed at present by the suffrages of three millions of people and in all human probability in a few years time by double that number it is not to be presumed that a vicious or bad character will be selected if the government of any country on the face of the earth was ever effectually guarded against the election of ambitious or designing characters to the first office of the state i think it may with truth be said to be the case under the constitution of the united states with all the infirmities incident to a popular election corrected by the particular mode of conducting it as directed under the     present system i think we may fairly calculate that the instances will be very rare in which an unworthy man will receive that mark of the public confidence which is required to designate the president of the united states where the people are disposed to give so great an elevation to one of their fellowcitizens i own that i am not afraid to place my confidence in him especially when i know he is impeachable for any crime or misdemeanor before the senate at all times and that at all events he is impeachable before the community at large every four years and liable to be displaced if his conduct shall have given umbrage during the time he has been in office under these circumstances although the trust is a high one and in some degree perhaps a dangerous one i am not sure but it will be safer here than placed where some gentlemen suppose it ought to be it is evidently the intention of the constitution that the first magistrate should be responsible for the executive department so far therefore as we do not make the officers who are to aid him in the duties of that department responsible to him he is not responsible to his country again is there no danger that an officer when he is appointed by the concurrence of the senate and has friends in that body may choose rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch than rest it upon the discharge of his duties to the satisfaction of the executive branch which is constitutionally authorized to inspect and control his conduct and if it should happen that the officers connect themselves with the senate they may mutually support each other and for want of efficacy reduce the power of the president to a mere vapor in which case his responsibility would be annihilated and the expectation of it unjust the high executive officers joined in cabal with the senate would lay the foundation of discord and end in an assumption of the executive power only to be removed by a revolution in the government i believe no principle is more clearly laid down in the constitution than that of responsibility after premising this i will proceed     to an investigation of the merits of the question upon constitutional ground i have since the subject was last before the house examined the constitution with attention and i acknowledge that it does not perfectly correspond with the ideas i entertained of it from the first glance i am inclined to think that a free and systematic interpretation of the plan of government will leave us less at liberty to abate the responsibility than gentlemen imagine i have already acknowledged that the powers of the government must remain as apportioned by the constitution but it may be contended that where the constitution is silent it becomes a subject of legislative discretion perhaps in the opinion of some an argument in favor of the clause may be successfully brought forward on this ground i however leave it for the present untouched by a strict examination of the constitution on what appears to be its true principles and considering the great departments of the government in the relation they have to each other i have my doubts whether we are not absolutely tied down to the construction declared in the bill in the first section of the first article it is said that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states in the second article it is affirmed that the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america in the third article it is declared that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish i suppose it will be readily admitted that so far as the constitution has separated the powers of these great departments it would be improper to combine them together and so far as it has left any particular department in the entire possession of the powers incident to that department i conceive we ought not to qualify them further than they are qualified by the constitution the legislative powers are vested in congress and are to be exercised by them uncontrolled by any other     department except the constitution has qualified it otherwise the constitution has qualified the legislative power by authorizing the president to object to any act it may pass requiring in this case twothirds of both houses to concur in making a law but still the absolute legislative power is vested in the congress with this qualification alone the constitution affirms that the executive power shall be vested in the president are there exceptions to this proposition yes there are the constitution says that in appointing to office the senate shall be associated with the president unless in the case of inferior officers when the law shall otherwise direct have we a right to extend this exception i believe not if the constitution has invested all executive power in the president i venture to assert that the legislature has no right to diminish or modify his executive authority the question now resolves itself into this is the power of displacing an executive power i conceive that if any power whatsoever is in its nature executive it is the power of appointing overseeing and controlling those who execute the laws if the constitution had not qualified the power of the president in appointing to office by associating the senate with him in that business would it not be clear that he would have the right by virtue of his executive power to make such appointment should we be authorized in defiance of that clause in the constitution—the executive power shall be vested in a president to unite the senate with the president in the appointment to office i conceive not if it is admitted that we should not be authorized to do this i think it may be disputed whether we have a right to associate them in removing persons from office the one power being as much of an executive nature as the other and the first only is authorized by being excepted out of the general rule established by the constitution in these words the executive power shall be vested in the president the judicial power is vested in a supreme court but will     gentlemen say the judicial power can be placed elsewhere unless the constitution has made an exception the constitution justifies the senate in exercising a judiciary power in determining on impeachments but can the judicial power be further blended with the powers of that body they cannot i therefore say it is incontrovertible if neither the legislative nor judicial powers are subjected to qualifications other than those demanded in the constitution that the executive powers are equally unabateable as either of the others and inasmuch as the power of removal is of an executive nature and not affected by any constitutional exception it is beyond the reach of the legislative body if this is the true construction of this instrument the clause in the bill is nothing more than explanatory of the meaning of the constitution and therefore not liable to any particular objection on that account if the constitution is silent and it is a power the legislature have a right to confer it will appear to the world if we strike out the clause as if we doubted the propriety of vesting it in the president of the united states i therefore think it best to retain it in the bill june    power of removal from office however various the opinions which exist upon the point now before us it seems agreed on all sides that it demands a careful investigation and full discussion i feel the importance of the question and know that our decision will involve the decision of all similar cases the decision that is at this time made will become the permanent exposition of the constitution and on a permanent exposition of the constitution will depend the genius and character of the whole government it will depend perhaps on this decision whether the government shall retain that equilibrium which the constitution intended or take a direction towards aristocracy or anarchy among the members of the government hence how careful ought we to be to give a true direction to a power     so critically circumstanced it is incumbent on us to weigh with particular attention the arguments which have been advanced in support of the various opinions with cautious deliberation i own to you mr chairman that i feel great anxiety upon this question i feel an anxiety because i am called upon to give a decision in a case that may affect the fundamental principles of the government under which we act and liberty itself but all that i can do on such an occasion is to weigh well every thing advanced on both sides with the purest desire to find out the true meaning of the constitution and to be guided by that and an attachment to the true spirit of liberty whose influence i believe strongly predominates here several constructions have been put upon the constitution relative to the point in question the gentleman from connecticut mr sherman has advanced a doctrine which was not touched upon before he seems to think if i understood him rightly that the power of displacing from office is subject to legislative discretion because it having a right to create it may limit or modify as it thinks proper i shall not say but at first view this doctrine may seem to have some plausibility but when i consider that the constitution clearly intended to maintain a marked distinction between the legislative executive and judicial powers of government and when i consider that if the legislature has a power such as is contended for they may subject and transfer at discretion powers from one department of our government to another they may on that principle exclude the president altogether from exercising any authority in the removal of officers they may give it to the senate alone or the president and senate combined they may vest it in the whole congress or they may reserve it to be exercised by this house when i consider the consequences of this doctrine and compare them with the true principles of the constitution i own that i cannot subscribe to it another doctrine which has found very respectable friends     has been particularly advocated by the gentleman from south carolina mr smith it is this when an officer is appointed by the president and senate he can only be displaced for malfeasance in his office by impeachment i think this would give a stability to the executive department so far as it may be described by the heads of departments which is more incompatible with the genius of republican governments in general and this constitution in particular than any doctrine which has yet been proposed the danger to liberty the danger of maladministration has not yet been found to lie so much in the facility of introducing improper persons into office as in the difficulty of displacing those who are unworthy of the public trust if it is said that an officer once appointed shall not be displaced without the formality required by impeachment i shall be glad to know what security we have for the faithful administration of the government every individual in the long chain which extends from the highest to the lowest link of the executive magistracy would find a security in his situation which would relax his fidelity and promptitude in the discharge of his duty the doctrine however which seems to stand most in opposition to the principles i contend for is that the power to annual an appointment is in the nature of things incidental to the power which makes the appointment i agree that if nothing more was said in the constitution than that the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate should appoint to office there would be a great force in saying that the power of removal resulted by a natural implication from the power of appointing but there is another part of the constitution no less explicit than the one on which the gentlemans doctrine is founded it is that part which declares that the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states the association of the senate with the president in exercising that particular function is an exception to this general rule and exceptions to general rules i conceive are ever to be taken strictly but there is     another part of the constitution which inclines in my judgment to favor the construction i put upon it the president is required to take care that the laws be faithfully executed if the duty to see the laws faithfully executed be required at the hands of the executive magistrate it would seem that it was generally intended he should have that species of power which is necessary to accomplish that end now if the officer when once appointed is not to depend upon the president for his official existence but upon a distinct body for where there are two negatives required either can prevent the removal i confess i do not see how the president can take care that the laws be faithfully executed it is true by a circuitous operation he may obtain an impeachment and even without this it is possible he may obtain the concurrence of the senate for the purpose of displacing an officer but would this give that species of control to the executive magistrate which seems to be required by the constitution i own if my opinion was not contrary to that entertained by what i suppose to be the minority on this question i should be doubtful of being mistaken when i discovered how inconsistent that construction would make the constitution with itself i can hardly bring myself to imagine the wisdom of the convention who framed the constitution contemplated such incongruity there is another maxim which ought to direct us in expounding the constitution and is of great importance it is laid down in most of the constitutions or bills of rights in the republics of america it is to be found in the political writings of the most celebrated civilians and is every where held as essential to the preservation of liberty that the three great departments of government be kept separate and distinct and if in any case they are blended it is in order to admit a partial qualification in order more effectually to guard against an entire consolidation i think therefore when we review the several parts of this constitution when it says that the legislative powers shall be vested in a congress     of the united states under certain exceptions and the executive power vested in the president with certain exceptions we must suppose they were intended to be kept separate in all cases in which they are not blended and ought consequently to expound the constitution so as to blend them as little as possible every thing relative to the merits of the question as distinguished from a constitutional question seems to turn on the danger of such a power vested in the president alone but when i consider the checks under which he lies in the exercise of this power i own to you i feel no apprehensions but what arise from the dangers incidental to the power itself for dangers will be incidental to it vest it where you please i will not reiterate what was said before with respect to the mode of election and the extreme improbability that any citizen will be selected from the mass of citizens who is not highly distinguished by his abilities and worth in this alone we have no small security for the faithful exercise of this power but throwing that out of the question let us consider the restraints he will feel after he is placed in that elevated station it is to be remarked that the power in this case will not consist so much in continuing a bad man in office as in the danger of displacing a good one perhaps the great danger as has been observed of abuse in the executive power lies in the improper continuance of bad men in office but the power we contend for will not enable him to do this for if an unworthy man be continued in office by an unworthy president the house of representatives can at any time impeach him and the senate can remove him whether the president chooses or not the danger then consists merely in this the president can displace from office a man whose merits require that he should be continued in it what will be the motives which the president can feel for such abuse of his power and the restraints that operate to prevent it in the first place he will be impeachable by this house before the senate for such an act of maladministration  00 for i contend that the wanton removal of meritorious officers would subject him to impeachment and removal from his own high trust but what can be his motives for displacing a worthy man it must be that he may fill the place with an unworthy creature of his own can he accomplish this end no he can place no man in the vacancy whom the senate shall not approve and if he could fill the vacancy with the man he might choose i am sure he would have little inducement to make an improper removal let us consider the consequences the injured man will be supported by the popular opinion the community will take side with him against the president it will facilitate those combinations and give success to those exertions which will be pursued to prevent his reelection to displace a man of high merit and who from his station may be supposed a man of extensive influence are considerations in the mind of any man who may fill the presidential chair the friends of those individuals and the public sympathy will be against him if this should not produce his impeachment before the senate it will amount to an impeachment before the community who will have the power of punishment by refusing to reelect him but suppose this persecuted individual cannot obtain revenge in this mode there are other modes in which he could make the situation of the president very inconvenient if you suppose him resolutely bent on executing the dictates of resentment if he had not influence enough to direct the vengeance of the whole community he may probably be able to obtain an appointment in one or the other branch of the legislature and being a man of weight talents and influence in either case he may prove to the president troublesome indeed we have seen examples in the history of other nations which justify the remark i now have made though the prerogatives of the british king are great as his rank and it is unquestionably known that he has a positive influence over both branches of the legislative body yet there have been examples in which the appointment and removal of  0  ministers have been found to be dictated by one or other of those branches now if this be the case with an hereditary monarch possessed of those high prerogatives and furnished with so many means of influence can we suppose a president elected for four years only dependent upon the popular voice impeachable by the legislature little if at all distinguished for wealth personal talents or influence from the head of the department himself i say will he bid defiance to all these considerations and wantonly dismiss a meritorious and virtuous officer such abuse of power exceeds my conception if any thing takes place in the ordinary course of business of this kind my imagination cannot extend to it on any rational principle but let us not consider the question on one side only there are dangers to be contemplated on the other vest this power in the senate jointly with the president and you abolish at once that great principle of unity and responsibility in the executive department which was intended for the security of liberty and the public good if the president should possess alone the power of removal from office those who are employed in the execution of the law will be in their proper situation and the chain of dependence be preserved the lowest officers the middle grade and the highest will depend as they ought on the president and the president on the community the chain of dependence therefore terminates in the supreme body namely in the people who will possess besides in aid of their original power the decisive engine of impeachment take the other supposition that the power should be vested in the senate on the principle that the power to displace is necessarily connected with the power to appoint it is declared by the constitution that we may by law vest the appointment of inferior officers in the heads of departments the power of removal being incidental as stated by some gentlemen where does this terminate if you begin with the subordinate officers they are dependent on their superior he on the next superior and he on—whom on the senate a  0  permanent body a body by its particular mode of election in reality existing forever a body possessing that proportion of aristocratic power which the constitution no doubt thought wise to be established in the system but which some have strongly excepted against and let me ask gentlemen is there equal security in this case as in the other shall we trust the senate responsible to individual legislatures rather than the person who is responsible to the whole community it is true the senate do not hold their offices for life like aristocracies recorded in the historic page yet the fact is they will not possess that responsibility for the exercise of executive powers which would render it safe for us to vest such powers in them but what an aspect will this give to the executive instead of keeping the departments of government distinct you make an executive out of one branch of the legislature you make the executive a twoheaded monster to use the expression of the gentleman from new hampshire mr livermore you destroy the great principle of responsibility and perhaps have the creature divided in its will defeating the very purposes for which a unity in the executive was instituted these objections do not lie against such an arrangement as the bill establishes i conceive that the president is sufficiently accountable to the community and if this power is vested in him it will be vested where its nature requires it should be vested if anything in its nature is executive it must be that power which is employed in superintending and seeing that the laws are faithfully executed the laws cannot be executed but by officers appointed for that purpose therefore those who are over such officers naturally possess the executive power if any other doctrine be admitted what is the consequence you may set the senate at the head of the executive department or you may require that the officers hold their places during the pleasure of this branch of the legislature if you cannot go so far as to say we shall appoint them and by this means you link together two branches of the government  0  which the preservation of liberty requires to be constantly separated another species of argument has been urged against this clause it is said that it is improper or at least unnecessary to come to any decision on this subject it has been said by one gentleman that it would be officious in this branch of the legislature to expound the constitution so far as it relates to the division of power between the president and senate it is incontrovertibly of as much importance to this branch of the government as to any other that the constitution should be preserved entire it is our duty so far as it depends upon us to take care that the powers of the constitution be preserved entire to every department of government the breach of the constitution in one point will facilitate the breach in another a breach in this point may destroy that equilibrium by which the house retains its consequence and share of power therefore we are not chargeable with an officious interference besides the bill before it can have effect must be submitted to both those branches who are particularly interested in it the senate may negative or the president may object if he thinks it unconstitutional but the great objection drawn from the source to which the last arguments would lead us is that the legislature itself has no right to expound the constitution that wherever its meaning is doubtful you must leave it to take its course until the judiciary is called upon to declare its meaning i acknowledge in the ordinary course of government that the exposition of the laws and constitution devolves upon the judiciary but i beg to know upon what principle it can be contended that any one department draws from the constitution greater powers than another in marking out the limits of the powers of the several departments the constitution is the charter of the people to the government it specifies certain great powers as absolutely granted and marks out the departments to exercise them if the  0  constitutional boundary of either be brought into question i do not see that any one of these independent departments has more right than another to declare their sentiments on that point perhaps this is an omitted case there is not one government on the face of the earth so far as i recollect there is not one in the united states in which provision is made for a particular authority to determine the limits of the constitutional division of power between the branches of the government in all systems there are points which must be adjusted by the departments themselves to which no one of them is competent if it cannot be determined in this way there is no resource left but the will of the community to be collected in some mode to be provided by the constitution or one dictated by the necessity of the case it is therefore a fair question whether this great point may not as well be decided at least by the whole legislature as by a part by us as well as by the executive or judiciary as i think it will be equally constitutional i cannot imagine it will be less safe that the exposition should issue from the legislative authority than any other and the more so because it involves in the decision the opinions of both those departments whose powers are supposed to be affected by it besides i do not see in what way this question could come before the judges to obtain a fair and solemn decision but even if it were the case that it could i should suppose at least while the government is not led by passion disturbed by faction or deceived by any discolored medium of sight but while there is a desire in all to see and be guided by the benignant ray of truth that the decision may be made with the most advantage by the legislature itself my conclusion from these reflections is that it will be constitutional to retain the clause that it expresses the meaning of the constitution as must be established by fair construction and a construction which upon the whole not only consists with liberty but is more favorable  0  to it than any one of the interpretations that have been proposed  june    power of removal from office the question now seems to be brought to this whether it is proper or improper to retain these words in the clause provided they are explanatory of the constitution i think this branch of the legislature is as much interested in the establishment of the true meaning of the constitution as either the president or senate and when the constitution submits  0  it to us to establish offices by law we ought to know by what tenure the office should be held and whether it should depend upon the concurrence of the senate with the president or upon the will of the president alone because gentlemen may hesitate in either case whether they will make it for an indefinite or precise time if the officer can be removed at discretion by the president there may be safety in letting it be for an indefinite period if he cannot exert his prerogative there is no security even by the mode of impeachment because the officer may intrench himself behind the authority  0  of the senate and bid defiance to every other department of government in this case the question of duration would take a different turn hence it is highly proper that we and our constituents should know the tenure of the office and have we not as good a right as any branch of the government to declare our sense of the meaning of the constitution nothing has yet been offered to invalidate the doctrine that the meaning of the constitution may as well be ascertained by the legislative as by the judicial authority when the question emerges as it does in this bill and much seems to depend upon it i should conceive it highly proper to make a legislative construction in another point of view it is proper that this interpretation should now take place rather than at a time when the exigency of the case may require the exercise of the power of removal at present the disposition of every gentleman is to seek the truth and abide by its guidance when it is discovered i have reason to believe the same disposition prevails in the senate but will this be the case when some individual officer of high rank draws into question the capacity of the president with the senate to effect his removal if we leave the constitution to take this course it can never be expounded until the president shall think it expedient to exercise the right of removal if he supposes he has it then the senate may be induced to set up their pretensions and will they decide so calmly as at this time when no important officer in any of the great departments is appointed to influence their judgments the imagination of no member here or of the senate or of the president himself is heated or disturbed by faction if ever a proper moment for decision should offer it must be one like the present i do not conceive that this question has been truly stated by some gentlemen in my opinion it is not whether we shall take the power from one branch of the government and give it to another but the question is to which branch has the constitution given it some gentlemen have said that it  0  resides in the people at large and that if it is necessary to the government we must apply to the people for it and obtain it by way of amendment to the constitution some gentlemen contend that although it is given in the constitution as a necessary power to carry into execution the other powers vested by the constitution yet it is vested in the legislature i cannot admit this doctrine either because it is setting the legislature at the head of the executive branch of the government if we take the other construction of the gentleman from south carolina that all officers hold their places by the firm tenure of good behaviour we shall find it still more improper i think gentlemen will see upon reflection that this doctrine is incompatible with the principles of free government if there is no removability but by way of impeachment then all the executive officers of government hold their offices by the firm tenure of good behaviour from the chief justice down to the tide waiter mr smith interrupted mr m and said that he had admitted that inferior officers might be removed because the constitution had left it in the power of the legislature to establish them on what terms they pleased consequently to direct their appointment and removal mr madison had understood the gentleman as he now explained himself but still he contended that the consequences he had drawn would necessarily follow because there was no express authority given to the legislature in the constitution to enable the president the courts of law or heads of the departments to remove an inferior officer all that was said on that head was confined solely to the power of appointing them if the gentleman admits that the legislature may vest the power of removal with respect to inferior officers he must also admit that the constitution vests the president with the power of removal in the case of superior officers because both powers are implied in the same words the president may appoint the one class and the legislature may authorize the courts of law or heads of departments to  0  appoint in the other case if then it is admitted that the power of removal vests in the president or president and senate the arguments which i urged yesterday and those which have been urged by honorable gentlemen on this side of the question for these three days past will fully evince the truth of the construction which we give that the power is in the president alone i will not repeat them because they must have full possession of every gentlemans mind i am willing therefore to rest the decision here and hope that it will be made in such a manner as to perpetuate the blessings which this constitution was intended to embrace    0 june    power of removal from office i am in favor of the motion for striking out but not upon the principles of my worthy colleague  i will briefly state my reasons for voting in the manner i intend first altering the mode of expression tends to give satisfaction to those gentlemen who think it not an object of legislative discretion and second because the amendment already agreed to fully contains the sense of this house upon the doctrine of the constitution and therefore the words are unnecessary as they stand here i will not trouble the house with repeating reasons why the change of expression is best as they are well understood but gentlemen cannot fairly urge against us a change of ground because the point we contended for is fully obtained by the amendment it was truly said by the gentleman from new york mr benson that these words     carry with them an implication that the legislature has the power of granting the power of removal it is needless to assign my reasons why i think the legislature not in possession of this power they were fully explained before i therefore shall only say if there is a principle in our constitution indeed in any free constitution more sacred than another it is that which separates the legislative executive and judicial powers if there is any point in which the separation of the legislative and executive powers ought to be maintained with greater caution it is that which relates to officers and offices the powers relative to offices are partly legislative and partly executive the legislature creates the office defines the powers limits its duration and annexes a compensation this done the legislative power ceases they ought to have nothing to do with designating the man to fill the office that i conceive to be of an executive nature although it be qualified in the constitution i would not extend or strain that qualification beyond the limits precisely fixed for it we ought always to consider the constitution with an eye to the principles upon which it was founded in this point of view we shall readily conclude that if the legislature determines the powers the honors and emoluments of an office we should be insecure if they were to designate the officer also the nature of things restrains and confines the legislative and executive authorities in this respect and hence it is that the constitution stipulates for the independence of each branch of the government let it be understood that the legislature is to have some influence both in appointing and removing officers and i venture to say the people of america will justly fear a system of sinecures what security have they that offices will not be created to accommodate favorites or pensioners subservient to their designs i never did conceive that so far as the constitution gave one branch of the legislature an agency in this business it was by any means one of its most meritorious     parts but so far as it has gone i confess i would be as unwilling to abridge the power of that body as to enlarge it but considering as i do that the constitution fairly vests the president with the power and that the amendment declares this to be the sense of the house i shall concur with the gentlemen in opposition so far as to strike out these words which i now look upon to be useless i have a great respect for the abilities and judgment of my worthy colleague mr page and am convinced he is inspired by the purest motives in his opposition to what he conceives to be an improper measure but i hope he will not think so strange of our difference if he considers the small proportion of the house which concurs with him with respect to impeachment being the only way of removing officers i believe the opinion is held but by one gentleman besides himself if this sentiment were to obtain it would give rise to more objections to the constitution than gentlemen are aware of more than any other construction whatever yet while he professes to be greatly alarmed on one account he possesses a stoic apathy with respect to the other june    duties of the comptroller mr madison observed that the committee had gone through the bill without making any provision respecting the tenure by which the comptroller is to hold his office he thought it was a point worthy of consideration and would therefore submit a few observations upon it it will be necessary said he to consider the nature of this office to enable us to come to a right decision on the subject in analyzing its properties we shall easily discover they are not purely of an executive nature it seems to me that they partake of a judiciary quality as well as executive perhaps the latter obtains in the greatest degree the principal duty seems to be deciding upon the lawfulness and justice of the claims and accounts subsisting between the united states and     particular citizens this partakes strongly of the judicial character and there may be strong reasons why an officer of this kind should not hold his office at the pleasure of the executive branch of the government i am inclined to think that we ought to consider him something in the light of an arbitrator between the public and individuals and that he ought to hold his office by such a tenure as will make him responsible to the public generally then again it may be thought on the other side that some persons ought to be authorized on behalf of the individual with the usual liberty of referring to a third person in case of disagreement which may throw some embarrassment in the way of the first idea whatever mr chairman may be my opinion with respect to the tenure by which an executive officer may hold his office according to the meaning of the constitution i am very well satisfied that a modification by the legislature may take place in such as partake of the judicial qualities and that the legislative power is sufficient to establish this office on such a footing as to answer the purposes for which it is prescribed with this view he would move a proposition to be inserted in the bill it was that the comptroller should hold his office during — years unless sooner removed by the president he will always be dependent upon the legislature by reason of the power of impeachment but he might be made still more so when the house took up the salary bill he would have the person reappointable at the expiration of the term unless he was disqualified by a conviction on an impeachment before the senate by this means the comptroller would be dependent upon the president because he can be removed by him he will be dependent upon the senate because they must consent to his election for every term of years and he will be dependent upon this house through the means of impeachment and the power we shall reserve over his salary by which means we shall effectually secure the dependence of this officer upon the government but     making him thus thoroughly dependent would make it necessary to secure his impartiality with respect to the individual this might be effected by giving any person who conceived himself aggrieved a right to petition the supreme court for redress and they should be empowered to do right therein this will enable the individual to carry his claim before an independent tribunal a provision of this kind exists in two of the united states at this time and is found to answer a very good purpose he mentioned this that gentlemen might not think it altogether novel the committee he hoped would take a little time to examine the idea  august    amendments to the constitution mr madison did not think it was an improper time to proceed in this business the house had already gone through     with subjects of a less interesting nature now if the judiciary bill was of such vast importance its consideration ought not to have been postponed for those purposes     he would remind gentlemen that there were many who conceived amendments of some kind necessary and proper in themselves while others who are not so well satisfied of the necessity and propriety may think they are rendered expedient from some other consideration is it desirable to keep up a division among the people of the united states on a point in which they consider their most essential rights are concerned if this is an object worthy the attention of such a numerous part of our constituents why should we decline taking it into our consideration and thereby promote that spirit of urbanity and unanimity which the government itself stands in need of for its more full support already has the subject been delayed much longer than could have been wished if after having fixed a day for taking it into consideration we should put it off again a spirit of jealousy may be excited and not allayed without great inconvenience form sir is always of less importance than the substance but on this occasion i admit that form is of some consequence and it will be well for the house to pursue that which upon reflection shall appear to be the most eligible now it appears to me that there is a neatness and propriety in incorporating the amendments into the constitution itself in that case the system will remain uniform and entire it will certainly be more simple when the amendments are interwoven into those parts to which they naturally belong than it will if they consist of separate and distinct parts we shall then be able to determine its meaning without references or comparison whereas if they are supplementary its meaning can only be ascertained by a comparison of the two instruments which will be a very considerable embarrassment it will be difficult to ascertain to what parts of the instrument the amendments particularly refer they will create unfavorable comparisons whereas if they are placed upon the footing     here proposed they will stand upon as good foundation as the original work nor is it so uncommon a thing as gentlemen suppose systematic men frequently take up the whole law and with its amendments and alterations reduce it into one act i am not however very solicitous about the form provided the business is but well completed      september   location of the capital mr madison meant to pay due attention to every argument that could be urged on this important question facts had been asserted the impressions of which he wished to be erased if they were not well founded it has been said that the communication with the western territory by the susquehanna     is more convenient than by the potomac i apprehend this is not the case and the propriety of our decision will depend in a great measure on the superior advantages of one of these two streams it is agreed on all hands that we ought to have some regard to the convenience of the atlantic navigation now to embrace this object a position must be taken on some navigable river to favor the communication with the western territory its arms ought likewise   0 to extend themselves towards that region i did not suppose it would have been necessary to bring forward charts and maps as has been done by others to show the committee the comparative situation of those rivers i flattered myself it was sufficiently understood to enable us to decide the question of superiority but i am now inclined to believe that gentlemen have embraced an error and i hope they are not determined to vote under improper impressions i venture to pledge myself for the demonstration that the communication with the western territory by the potomac is more certain and convenient than the other and if the question is as important as it is admitted to be gentlemen will not shut their ears to information they will not precipitate the decision or if they regard the satisfaction of our constituents they will allow them to be informed of all the facts and arguments that lead to the decision of a question in which the general and particular interests of all parts of the union are involved      september    location of the capital mr madison felt himself compelled to move for striking out that part of the bill which provided that the temporary residence of congress should continue at new york as he conceived it irreconcilable with the spirit of the constitution if it was not from viewing it in this light he should have given the bill no further opposition and now he did not mean to enter on the merits of the main question from the constitution it appeared that the concurrence of the two houses of congress was sufficient to enable them to adjourn from one place to another nay the legal consent of the president was in some degree prescribed in the  th section of article  st where it is declared that every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on     a question of adjournment shall be presented to the president of the united states and approved by him before the same shall take effect any attempt therefore to adjourn by law is a violation of that part of the constitution which gives the power exclusively to the two branches of the legislature if gentlemen saw it in the same light he flattered himself they would reject that part of the bill and however little they valued the reflection that this city was not central which had been so often urged they would be guided by arguments springing from a superior source he would proceed to state the reasons which induced him to be of this opinion it is declared in the constitution that neither house during the session of congress shall without the consent of the other adjourn for more than three days nor to any place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting from hence he inferred that the two houses by a concurrence could adjourn for more than three days and to any other place which they thought proper by the other clause he had mentioned the executive power is restrained from any interference with the legislative on this subject hence he concluded it would be dangerous to attempt to give to the president a power which the constitution expressly denied him he did not suppose that the attempt to vest the executive with a power over the adjournment of the legislature would absolutely convey the power but he conceived it wrong to make the experiment he submitted it to those gentlemen who were attached to the success of the bill how far an unconstitutional declaration may impede its passage through the other branch of the legislature it has been supposed by some that the seat of government may be at a place different from that where the congress sits and although the former may be established by law the legislature might remove elsewhere he could not subscribe to this doctrine what is the government of the united states for which a seat is to be provided will not the government necessarily comprehend the congress as a part in     arbitrary governments the residence of the monarch may be styled the seat of government because he is within himself the supreme legislative executive and judicial power the same may be said of the residence of a limited monarchy where the efficiency of the executive operates in a great degree to the exclusion of the legislative authority but in such a government as ours according to the legal and common acceptation of the term government must include the legislative power so the term administration which in other countries is specially appropriated to the executive branch of government is used here for both the executive and legislative branches we in official communications say legislative administration or executive administration according as the one or the other is employed in the exercise of its constitutional powers he mentioned these circumstances to show that they ought not to look for the meaning of terms used in the laws and constitution of the united states into the acceptation of them in other countries whose situation and government were different from that of united america if his reasoning was just he should conclude that the seat of government would be at that place where both the executive and legislative bodies are fixed and this depended upon the vote of the two branches of the legislature there was another clause favorable to this opinion it was that giving congress authority to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states this was the only place where any thing respecting the seat of government was mentioned and would any gentleman contend that congress might have a seat of government over which they are empowered to exercise exclusive legislation and yet reside at the distance of two or  00 miles from it such a construction would contradict the plain and evident meaning of the constitution and as such was inadmissible he hoped these observations would be attended to and     did not doubt but if seen in their true light they would induce the house to reject that part of the bill which he moved to have struck out  september    location of the capital mr madison contended that the amendment proposed by the senate was a departure from every principle adopted by the house but he would not trouble them with a recapitulation of arguments which he feared would be unavailing he wished however that the house would provide against one inconvenience which was to prevent the district in pennsylvania chosen by congress from being deprived for a time of     the benefit of the laws this he apprehended would be the case unless congress made provision for the operation of the laws of pennsylvania in the act by which they accepted of the cession of that state for the state relinquished the right of legislation from the moment that congress accepted of the district the propriety of this proposition was so apparent that he had not a doubt but the house would consent to it he then moved the following proviso and provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect the operation of the laws of pennsylvania within the district ceded and accepted until congress shall otherwise provide by law  james madison novr  0      orange george washington to george washington wash mss  orange novr  0      dear sir— it was my purpose to have dropped you a few lines from philada but i was too much indisposed during     my detention there to avail myself of that pleasure since my arrival here i have till now been without a fit conveyance to the post office you will recollect the contents of a letter shewn you from mr innes to mr brown whilst i was in philada i was informed by the latter who was detained there as well as myself by indisposition that he had recd later accounts though not from the same correspondent that the spaniards have finally put an entire stop to the trade of our citizens down the river the encouragements to such as settle under their own government are continued a day or two after i got to philada i fell in with mr morris he broke the subject of the residence of congs and made observations which betrayed his dislike of the upshot of the business at n york and his desire to keep alive the southern project of an arrangement with pennsylvania i reminded him of the conduct of his state and intimated that the question would probably sleep for some time in consequence of it his answer implied that congress must not continue at new york and that if he should be freed from his engagements with the e states by their refusal to take up the bill and pass it as it went to the senate he should renounce all confidence in that quarter and speak seriously to the s states i told him they must be spoken to very seriously after what had passed if penna expected them to listen to her that indeed there was probably an end to further intercourse on the subject he signified that if he should speak it would be in earnest and he believed     that no one would pretend that his conduct would justify the least distrust of his going through with his undertakings adding however that he was determined  accordingly gave me as he had given others notice that he should call up the postponed bill as soon as congs should be reassembled i observed to him that if it were desirable to have the matter revived we could not wish to have in it a form more likely to defeat itself it was unparliamentary and highly inconvenient and would therefore be opposed by all candid friends to his object as an improper precedent as well as by those who were opposed to the object itself and if he should succeed in the senate the irregularity of the proceeding would justify the other house in withholding the signature of its speaker so that the bill could never go up to the president he acknowledged that the bill could not be got thro unless it had a majority of both houses on its merits why then i asked not take it up anew he said he meant to bring the gentlemen who had postponed the bill to the point acknowledged that he distrusted them but held his engagements binding on him until this final experiment should be made on the respect they meant to pay to theirs i do not think it difficult to augur from this conversation the views which will govern penna at the next session conversations held by grayson both with morris  others in philada and left by him in a letter to me coincide with what i have stated an attempt will first be made to alarm n york and the eastern states into the plan     postponed by holding out the potowmac  philada as the alternative and if the attempt should not succeed the alternative will then be held out to the southern members on the other hand n y  the e states will enforce the policy of delay by threatening the s states as heretofore with german town or trenton or at least susquehannah and will no doubt carry the threat into execution if they can rather yn suffer an arrangement to take place between pena  the s states i hear nothing certain from the assembly it is said that an attempt of mr h to revive the project of commutables has been defeated that the amendments have been taken up and are likely to be put off to the next session the present house having been elected prior to the promulgation of them this reason would have more force if the amendments did not so much correspond as far as they go with the propositions of the state convention which were before the public long before the last election at any rate the assembly might pass a vote of approbation along with the postponement and assign the reason for referring the ratification to their successors it is probable that the scruple has arisen with the disaffected party if it be construed by the public into a latent hope of some contingent opportunity for promoting the war agst the genl government i am of opinion the experiment will recoil on the authors of it as far as i can gather the great bulk of the late opponents are entirely at rest and more likely to censure a further opposition     to the govt as now administered than the government itself one of the principal leaders of the baptists lately sent me word that the amendments had entirely satisfied the disaffected of his sect and that it would appear in their subsequent conduct i ought not to conclude without some apology for so slovenly a letter i put off writing it till an opportunity should present itself not knowing but something from time to time might turn up that would make it less unworthy of your perusal and it has so happened

calculated to keep alive the disaffection to the government and is accordingly applied to that use by violent partizans i understand the letter was written by the first   0 subscriber of it as indeed is pretty evident from the style and strain of it the other it is said subscribed it with reluctance i am less surprised that this should have been the case than that he should have subscribed it at all my last information from richmond is contained in the following extract from a letter of the   th of novr from an intelligent member of the h of delegates the revenue bill which proposes a reduction of the public taxes one fourth below the last years amount is with the senate whilst this business was before the h of delegates a proposition was made to receive tobacco  hemp as commutables which was negatived the house determining still to confine the collection to specie and to specie warrants two or three petitions have been presented which asked a general suspension of executions for twelve months they were read but denied a reference the assembly have passed an act for altering the time for choosing representatives to congress which is now fixed to be on the third monday in september suspending the powers of the representative until the feby after his election this change was made to suit the time of the annual meeting of congress the fate of the amendments proposed by congress to the genl government is still in suspense in a come of the whole house the first ten were acceded to with little opposition for on a question taken on each separately there was scarcely a dissenting voice on the two last a debate of some length took place which ended in rejection     mr e randolph who advocated all the others stood on this contest in the front of opposition his principal objection was pointed agst the word retained in the eleventh proposed amendment and his argument if i understood it was applied in this manner—that as the rights declared in the first ten of the proposed amendments were not all that a free people would require the exercise of and that as there was no criterion by which it could be determined whether any other particular right was retained or not it would be more safe and more consistent with the spirit of the  st    th amendts proposed by virginia that this reservation agst constructive power should operate rather as a provision agst extending the powers of congs by their own authority than a protection to rights reducible to no definite certainty but others among whom i am one see not the force of this distinction for by preventing an extension of power in that body from which danger is apprehended safety will be insured if its powers be not too extensive already  so by protecting the rights of the people  of the states an improper extension of power will be prevented  safety made equally certain if the house should agree to the resolution for rejecting the two last i am of opinion it will bring the whole into hazard again as some who have been decided friends to the ten first think it would be unwise to adopt them without the       th whatever may be the fate of the amendments submitted by congress it is probable that an application for further amendments     will be made by this assembly for the opposition to the federal constitution is in my opinion reduced to a single point the power of direct taxation—those who wish the change are desirous of repeating the application whilst those who wish it not are indifferent on the subject supposing that congs will not propose a change which would take from them a power so necessary for the accomplishment of those objects which are confided to their care messrs joseph jones  spencer roane are appointed judges of the genl court to fill the vacancies occasioned by the death of mr carey  the removal of mr mercer to the court of appeals the difficulty started agst the amendments is really unlucky and the more to be regretted as it springs from a friend to the constitution it is a still greater cause of regret if the distinction be as it appears to me altogether fanciful if a line can be drawn between the powers granted and the rights retained it would seem to be the same thing whether the latter be secured by declaring that they shall not be abridged or that the former shall not be extended if no such line can be drawn a declaration in either form would amount to nothing if the distinction were just it does not seem to be of sufficient importance to justify the risk of losing the amendts of furnishing a handle to the disaffected and of arming n c with a pretext if she be disposed to prolong her exile from the union with every sentiment of respect  attachment i am dr sir yr obedt  hble servt     memorandum december       mad mss  on the supposition that the business can be more properly conducted by a private agent at london than a public minister at a third court the letter and instructions for the former character appear to be well adapted to the purpose if any remark were to be made it would relate merely to the form which it is conceived would be made rather better by transposing the order of the two main subjects the fulfilment of the treaty already made seems to be primary to the inquiries requisite to a subsequent treaty the reasoning assigned to those who opposed a commercial discrimination states the views of a part only of that side of the question a considerable number both in the senate  h of reps objected to the measure as defective in energy rather than as wrong in its principle in the former a committee was appointed who reported a more energetic plan and in the latter leave to bring in a bill was given to a member who explained his views to be similar both of these instances were posterior to the miscarriage of the discrimination first proposed as mr jefferson may be daily expected as it is possible he may bring informations throwing light on the subject under deliberation and as it is probable use may be made of his own ideas with regard to it a quere suggests itself whether the advantage of     consulting with him might not justify such a delay unless there be special reasons for

circumstance which demands that tribute i have supposed that i could not better dispose of the letters to mr eppes as well as that to col lewis than by inclosing them to yourself the business of congs

before the receipt of this have known the ultimate determination of the president on your appointment  all that i am able to say on the subject is that a universal anxiety is expressed for your acceptance and to     repeat my declarations that such an event will be more conducive to the general good and perhaps to the very objects you have in view in europe than your return to your former

first congress—second session    0 february   naturalization of aliens  when we are considering the advantages that may result from an easy mode of naturalization we ought also to consider the cautions necessary to guard against abuses it is     no doubt very desirable that we should hold out as many inducements as possible for the worthy part of mankind to come and settle amongst us and throw their fortunes into a common lot with ours but why is this desirable not merely to swell the catalogue of people no sir it is to increase the wealth and strength of the community and those who acquire the rights of citizenship without adding to the strength or wealth of the community are not the people we are in want of and what is proposed by the amendment is that they shall take nothing more than an oath of fidelity and declare their intention to reside in the united states under such terms it was well observed by my colleague aliens might acquire the right of citizenship and return to the country from which they came and evade the laws intended to encourage the commerce and industry of the real citizens and inhabitants of america enjoying at the same time all the advantages of citizens and aliens i should be exceedingly sorry sir that our rule of naturalization excluded a single person of good fame that really meant to incorporate himself into our society on the other hand i do not wish that any man should acquire the privilege but such as would be a real addition to the wealth or strength of the united states it may be a question of some nicety how far we can make our law to admit an alien to the right of citizenship step by step but there is no doubt we may and ought to require residence as an essential      february    public debt  no gentleman mr chairman has expressed more strongly than i feel the importance and difficulty of the subject before us although i have endeavored to view it under all its aspects and analyze it in all its principles yet have i kept     my mind open and been anxious to aid my own reflections by the reflected light to be expected from gentlemen on this floor who enter into the discussion for this purpose i have chosen hitherto rather to be a hearer than a speaker on   0 the subject and should even at this moment have continued in my seat but that the turn which the business has taken renders it requisite for me now if at all to trouble the committee     with my reflections and the opinion in which they have terminated it has been said by some gentlemen that the debt itself does not exist in the extent and form which is generally supposed i confess sir i differ altogether from the gentlemen who take that ground let us consider first by whom the debt was contracted and then let us consider to whom it is due the debt was contracted by the united states who with respect to that particular transaction were in a national capacity the government was nothing more than the agent or organ by which the whole body of the people acted the change in the government which has taken place has enlarged its national capacity but it has not varied the national obligation with respect to the engagements entered into by that transaction for in like manner the present government is nothing more than the organ or agent of the public the obligation which they are under is precisely the same with that under which the debt was contracted although the     government has been changed the nation remains the same there is no change in our political duty nor in the moral or political obligation the language i now use sir is the language of the constitution itself it declares that all debts shall have the same validity against the united states under the new as under the old form of government the obligation remains the same though i hope experience will prove that the ability has been favorably varied the next question is to what amount the public are at present indebted i conceive the question may be answered in a few words the united states owe the value they received which they acknowledge and which they have promised to pay what is that value it is a certain sum in principal bearing an interest of six per cent no logic no magic in my opinion can diminish the force of the obligation the only point on which we can deliberate is to whom the payment is really due for this purpose it will be proper to take notice of the several descriptions of people who are creditors of the union and lay down some principles respecting them which may lead us to a just and equitable decision as there is a small part of the debt yet unliquidated it may be well to pass it by and come to the great mass of the liquidated debt it may here be proper to notice four classes into which it may be divided first original creditors who have never alienated their securities second original creditors who have alienated third present holders of alienated securities fourth intermediate holders through whose hands securities have circulated the only principles that can govern the decision on their respective pretensions i take to be   public justice   public faith   public credit   public opinion with respect to the first class there can be no difficulty justice is in their favor for they have advanced the value which they claim public faith is in their favor for the written     promise is in their hands respect for public credit is in their favor for if claims so sacred are violated all confidence must be at an end public opinion is in their favor for every honest citizen cannot but be their advocate with respect to the last class the intermediate holders their pretensions if they have any will lead us into a labyrinth for which it is impossible to find a clew this will be the less complained of because this class were perfectly free both in becoming and ceasing to be creditors and because in general they must have gained by their speculations the only rival pretensions then are those of the original creditors who have assigned and of the present holders of the assignments the former may appeal to justice because the value of the money the service or the property advanced by them has never been really paid to them they may appeal to good faith because the value stipulated and expected is not satisfied by the steps taken by the government the certificates put into the hands of the creditors on closing their settlements with the public were of less real value than was acknowledged to be due they may be considered as having been forced in fact on the receivers they cannot therefore be fairly adjudged an extinguishment of the debt they may appeal to the motives for establishing public credit for which justice and faith form the natural foundation they may appeal to the precedent furnished by the compensation allowed to the army during the late war for the depreciation of bills which nominally discharged the debts they may appeal to humanity for the sufferings of the military part of the creditors can never be forgotten while sympathy is an american virtue to say nothing of the singular hardship in so many mouths of requiring those who have lost fourfifths or seveneighths of their due to contribute the remainder in favor of those who have gained in the contrary proportion on the other hand the holders by assignment have claims     which i by no means wish to depreciate they will say that whatever pretensions others may have against the public these cannot effect the validity of theirs that if they gain by the risk taken upon themselves it is but the just reward of that risk that as they hold the public promise they have an undeniable demand on the public faith that the best foundation of public credit is that adherence to literal engagements on which it has been erected by the most flourishing nations that if the new government should swerve from so essential a principle it will be regarded by all the world as inheriting the infirmities of the old such being the interfering claims on the public one of three things must be done either pay both reject wholly one or the other or make a composition between them on some principle of equity to pay both is perhaps beyond the public ability and as it would far exceed the value received by the public it will not be expected by the world nor even by the creditors themselves to reject wholly the claims of either is equally inadmissible such a sacrifice of those who possess the written engagements would be fatal to the proposed establishment of public credit it would moreover punish those who had put their trust in the public promises and resources to make the other class the sole victims is an idea at which human nature recoils a composition then is the only expedient that remains let it be a liberal one in favor of the present holders let them have the highest price which has prevailed in the market and let the residue belong to the original sufferers this will not do perfect justice but it will do more real justice and perform more of the public faith than any other expedient proposed the present holders where they have purchased at the lowest price of the securities will have a profit that cannot reasonably be complained of where they have purchased at a higher price the profit will be considerable and even the few who have purchased at the highest price cannot well be losers with a well funded interest of six per cent     the original sufferers will not be fully indemnified but they will receive from their country a tribute due to their merits which if it does not entirely heal their wounds will assuage the pain of them i am aware that many plausible objections will lie against what i have suggested some of which i foresee and will take some notice of it will be said that the plan is impracticable should this be demonstrated i am ready to renounce it but it does not appear to me in that light i acknowledge that such a scale as has often been a subject of conversation is impracticable the discrimination proposed by me requires nothing more than a knowledge of the present holders which will be shown by the certificates and of the original holders which the office documents will show it may be objected that if the government is to go beyond the literal into the equitable claims against the united states it ought to go back to every case where injustice has been done to this the answer is obvious the case in question is not only different from others in point of magnitude and of practicability but forces itself on the attention of the committee as necessarily involved in the business before them it may be objected that public credit will suffer especially abroad i think this danger will be effectually obviated by the honesty and disinterestedness of the government displayed in the measure by a continuance of the punctual discharge of foreign interest by the full provision to be made for the whole foreign debt and the equal punctuality i hope to see in the future payments on the domestic debts i trust also that all future loans will be founded on a previous establishment of adequate funds and that a situation like the present will be thereby rendered impossible i cannot but regard the present case as so extraordinary in many respects that the ordinary maxims are not strictly applicable to it the fluctuations of stock in europe so often referred to have no comparison with those in the united states the former never exceeded  0  0 or  0 per cent     can it be said that because a government thought this evil insufficient to justify an interference it would view in the same light a fluctuation amounting to seven or eight hundred per cent i am of opinion that were great britain holland or any other country to fund its debts precisely in the same situation as the american debt some equitable interference of the government would take place the south sea scheme in which a change amounting to one thousand per cent happened in the value of stock is well known to have produced an interference and without any injury whatever to the subsequent credit of the nation it is true that in many respects the case differed from that of the united states but in other respects there is a degree of similitude which warrants the conjecture it may be objected that such a provision as i propose will exceed the public ability i do not think the public unable to discharge honorably all its engagements or that it will be unwilling if the appropriations shall be satisfactory i regret as much as any member the unavoidable weight and duration of the burdens to be imposed having never been a proselyte to the doctrine that public debts are public benefits i consider them on the contrary as evils which ought to be removed as fast as honor and justice will permit and shall heartily join in the means necessary for that purpose i conclude with declaring as my opinion that if any case were to happen among individuals bearing an analogy to that of the public a court of equity would interpose for its redress or that if a tribunal existed on earth by which nations could be compelled to do right the united states would be compelled to do something not dissimilar in its principles to what i have contended for february    public debt mr madison said that the opponents of his proposition had imposed on its friends not only a heavy task by the number of their objections but a delicate one by the nature     of some of them it had been arraigned as an embarrassing measure which ought to be facilitated and producing discussions which might end in disagreeable consequences however painful it might be to contradict the wishes of gentlemen whom he respected he could promise nothing more in the present case than his endeavors to disappoint their apprehensions when his judgment could not yield to the propositions of others the right to make and support his own was a right which he could never suffer to be contested in exercising it he should study to maintain that moderation and liberality which were due to the greatness of the subject before the committee he felt pleasure in acknowledging that the like spirit had in general directed the arguments on the other side free discussions thus conducted are not only favorable to a right decision but to a cheerful acquiescence of the mistaken opponents of it they might have the further advantage of recommending the results to the public by fully explaining the grounds of it if the pretensions of a numerous and meritorious class of citizens be not well founded or cannot be complied with let them see that this is the case and be soothed under their disappointment with the proof that they have not been overlooked by their country he would proceed now to review the grounds on which the proposition had been combated which he should do without either following those who had wandered from the field of fair argument or avoiding those who had kept within its limits it could not have escaped the committee that the gentlemen to whom he was opposed had reasoned on this momentous question as on an ordinary case in a court of law that they had equally strained all the maxims that could favor the purchasing or be adverse to the original holder and that they had dwelt with equal pleasure on every circumstance which could brighten the pretensions of the former or discredit those of the latter he had not himself attempted nor     did he mean to undervalue the pretensions of the actual holders in stating them he had even used as strong terms as they themselves could have dictated but beyond a certain point he could not go he must renounce every sentiment which he had hitherto cherished before his complaisance could admit that america ought to erect the monuments of her gratitude not to those who saved her liberties but to those who had enriched themselves in her funds all that he wished was that the claims of the original holders not less than those of the actual holders should be fairly examined and justly decided they had been invalidated by nothing yet urged a debt was fairly contracted according to justice and good faith it ought to have been paid in gold or silver a piece of paper only was substituted was this paper equal in value to gold or silver no it was worth in the market which the argument for the purchasing holders makes the criterion no more than oneeighth or oneseventh of that value was this depreciated paper freely accepted no the government offered that or nothing the relation of the individual to the government and the circumstances of the offer rendered the acceptance a forced not a free one the same degree of constraint would vitiate a transaction between man and man before any court of equity on the face of the earth there are even cases where consent cannot be pretended where the property of the planter or farmer had been taken at the point of the bayonet and a certificate presented in the same manner but why did the creditors part with their acknowledgment of the debt in some instances from necessity in others from a wellfounded distrust of the public whether from the one or the other they had been injured they had suffered loss through the default of the debtor and the debtor cannot in justice or honor take advantage of the default here then was a debt acknowledged to have been once due and which was never discharged because the payment was forced and defective the balance consequently is still     due and is of as sacred a nature as the claims of the purchasing holder can be and if both are not to be paid in the whole is equally entitled to payment in part he begged gentlemen would not yield too readily to the artificial niceties of forensic reasoning that they would consider not the form but the substance—not the letter but the equity—not the bark but the pith of the business it was a great and an extraordinary case it ought to be decided on the great and fundamental principles of justice he had been animadverted upon for appealing to the heart as well as the head he would be bold nevertheless to repeat that in great and unusual questions of morality the heart is the best judge it had been said by a member from massachusetts that the proposition was founded on a new principle in congress if the present congress be meant that is not strange for congress itself is new if the former congress be meant it is not true for the principle is found in an act which had been already cited after the pay of the army had during the war been nominally and legally discharged in depreciated paper the loss was made up to sufferers it had been said by a member from new york that this case was not parallel there being no third party like the present holders of certificates this objection could not be valid the government paid ten dollars worth in fact but only one to the soldier the soldier was then the original holder the soldier assigned it to the citizen the citizen then became the actual holder what was the event the loss of the original holder was repaired after the actual holder had been settled with according to the highest market value of his paper he did not mean however to decide on the whole merits of this last transaction or to contend for a similitude in all respects between the two kinds of paper one material difference was that the bills of credit by more frequent transfers and by dividing the change of value among a greater number of hands rendered the effect of less consequence to   0 individuals and less sensible to the public mind but this difference whatever force it might give to the claims of the purchasing holder of certificates could diminish nothing from the claims of the original holders who assigned them it had been said by another member from massachusetts that the old government did every thing in its power it made requisitions used exhortations and in every respect discharged its duty but it was to be remembered that the debt was not due from the government but the united states an attorney with full powers to form without the means to fulfil engagements could never by his ineffectual though honest efforts exonerate his principal he had been repeatedly reminded of the address of congress in      which rejected a discrimination between original and purchasing holders at that period the certificates to the army and citizens at large had not been issued the transfers were confined to loanoffice certificates were not numerous and had been in great part made with little loss to the original creditor at present the transfers extend to a vast proportion of the whole debt and the loss to the original holders has been immense the injustice which has taken place has been enormous and flagrant and makes redress a great national object this change of circumstances destroys the argument from the act of congress referred to but if implicit regard is to be paid to the doctrines of that act any modification of the interest of the debt will be as inadmissible as a modification of the principal it had been said that if the losses of the original creditors are entitled to reparation congress ought to repair those suffered from paper money—from the ravages of war and from the act of barring claims not produced within a limited time as to the paper money either the case is applicable or it is not if not applicable the argument fails if applicable either the depreciated certificates ought to be liquidated by a like scale as was applied to the depreciated money or the money even if the whole mass of it was still in circulation     ought now to be literally redeemed like the certificates leaving the gentleman to make his own choice of these dilemmas he would only add himself that if there were no other difference between the cases the manifest impossibility of redressing the one and the practicability of redressing the other was a sufficient answer to the objection with respect to the towns burnt and other devastations of war it was taught by the writers on the law of nations that they were to be numbered among the inevitable calamities of mankind still however a government owed them every alleviation which it could conveniently afford but no authority could be found that puts on the same footing with those calamities such as proceed from a failure to fulfil the direct and express obligations of the public the just claims barred by the act of limitation were in his opinion clearly entitled to redress that act was highly objectionable the public which was interested in shortening the term undertook to decide that no claim however just should be admitted if not presented within nine months the act made none of the exceptions usual in such acts not even in favor of the most distant parts of the union in many instances it had been absolutely impossible for the persons injured to know of the regulation some of these instances were within his own knowledge to limit the duration of a law to a period within which it could not possibly be promulgated and then take advantage of the impossibility would be imitating the roman tyrant who posted up his edicts so high that they could not be read and then punished the people for not obeying them it has been said that if the purchased certificates were funded at the rate proposed they would fall in the market and the holders be injured it was pretty certain that the greater part at least would be gainers he believed that the highest market price especially with the arrears of interest incorporated well funded at six per cent would prevent every loss that could justify complaint but foreigners had become purchasers and ought to be     particularly respected foreigners he remarked had themselves made a difference between the value of the foreign and domestic debt they would therefore the less complain of a difference made by government here it was his opinion that the terms stated in the proposition would yield a greater profit to the foreign purchasers than they could have got for their money if advanced by them in any of the funds of europe the proposition had been charged with robbing one set of men to pay another if there were robbery in the case it had been committed on the original creditors but to speak more accurately as well as more moderately the proposition would do no more than withhold a part from each of two creditors where both were not to be paid the whole a member from new york has asked whether an original creditor who had assigned his certificate could in conscience accept a reimbursement in the manner proposed he would not deny that assignments might have been made with such explanations or under such circumstances as would have that effect but in general the assignments have been made with reference merely to the market value and the uncertainty of the steps that might be taken by the government the bulk of the creditors had assigned under circumstances from which no scruple could arise in all cases where a scruple existed the benefit of the provision might be renounced he would in turn ask the gentleman whether there was not more room to apprehend that the present holder who had got his certificate of a distressed and meritorious fellowcitizen for oneeighth or onetenth its ultimate value might not feel some remorse in retaining so unconscionable an advantage similar propositions it was said had been made and rejected in the state legislatures this was not a fact the propositions made in the state legislatures were not intended to do justice to the injured but to seize a profit to the public but no petitions for redress had come from the sufferers     was merit then to be the less regarded because it was modest perhaps however another explanation ought to be given many of the sufferers were poor and uninformed those of another description were so dispersed that their interests and efforts could not be brought forward the case of the purchasing holders was very different the constitutionality of the proposition had been drawn into question he asked whether words could be devised that would place the new government more precisely in the same relation to the real creditors with the old the power was the same the obligation was the same the means only were varied an objection had been drawn from the article prohibiting ex post facto laws but as ex post facto laws relate to criminal not civil cases the constitution itself requires this definition by adding to a like restriction on the states an express one against retrospective laws of a civil nature it had been said that foreigners had been led to purchase by their faith in the article of the constitution relating to the public debts he would answer this objection by a single fact foreigners had shown by the market price in europe that they trusted the nature of foreign debt more under the old government than the nature of the domestic debt under the new government objections to the measure had been drawn from its supposed tendency to impede public credit he thought it on the contrary perfectly consistent with the establishment of public credit it was in vain to say that government ought never to revise measures once decided great caution on this head ought no doubt to be observed but there were situations in which without some legislative interposition the first principles of justice and the very ends of civil society would be frustrated the gentlemen themselves had been compelled to make exceptions to the general doctrine they would probably make more before the business was at an end it had been urged that if government should interpose in     the present case as interposition would be authorized in any case whatever where the stock might fluctuate the principle would apply as well to a fall of sixty or seventy per cent as to a fall of six hundred or seven hundred per cent he could not admit this inference a distinction was essential between an extreme case and a case short of it the line was difficult to be drawn but it was no more incumbent on him than on his opponents to draw it they themselves could not deny that a certain extremity of the evil would have justified the interposition suppose that the distress of the alienating creditors had been ten times as great as it was that instead of two three or four shillings in the pound they had received a farthing only in the pound and that the certificates lay now in the hands of the purchasers in that state or even at a less value was there a member who would rise up and say that the purchasers ought to be paid the entire nominal sum and the original sufferer be entitled to no indemnification whatever gentlemen had triumphed in the want of a precedent to the measure no government it was said had interposed to redress fluctuations in its public paper but where was the government that had funded its debts under the circumstances of the american debt if no government had done so there could be no precedent either for or against the measure because the occasion itself was unprecedented and if no similar occasion had before existed in any country the precedent to be set would at least be harmless because no similar occasion would be likely to happen in this if gentlemen persisted however in demanding precedents he was happy in being able to gratify them with two which though not exactly parallel were on that account of the greater force since the interposition of government had taken place where the emergency could less require them the first was the case of the canada bills during the war which ended in      and which was attended with a revolution of the government in canada the supplies obtained for     the french army in that province were paid for in bills of exchange and certificates this paper depreciated and was bought up chiefly by british merchants the sum and the depreciation were so considerable as to become a subject of negotiation between france and great britain at the peace the negotiations produced a particular article by which it was agreed by france that the paper ought to be redeemed and admitted by great britain that it should be redeemed at a liquidated value in the year      this article was accordingly carried into effect by ministers from the two courts which reduced the paper in the hands of the british holders in some instances as much as seventyfive per cent below its nominal value it was stated indeed by the reporter of the case that the holders of the paper had themselves concurred in the liquidation but it was not probable that the concurrence was voluntary if it was voluntary it shows that they themselves were sensible of the equity of the sacrifice the other case was of still greater weight as it had no relation to war or treaty and took place in the nation which has been held up as a model with respect to public credit in the year      the civil list of great britain had fallen into arrears to the amount of £ 00000 the creditors who had furnished supplies to the government had instead of money received debentures only from the respective officers these had depreciated in that state they were assigned in some instances in others covenanted to be assigned when the parliament appropriated funds for satisfying these arrears they inserted an express provision in the act that the creditors who had been obliged by the default of government to dispose of their paper at a loss might redeem it from the assignees by repaying the actual price with an interest of six per cent and that all agreements and covenants to assign should be absolutely void here then was an interposition on the very principle that a government ought to redress the wrongs sustained by its default and on an occasion trivial when compared to that under consideration yet it does     not appear that the public credit of the nation was injured by it the best source of confidence in government was the apparent honesty of its views the proposition could not possibly be ascribed to any other motive than this because the public was not to gain a farthing by it the next source was an experienced punctuality in the payments due from the government for this support to public credit he relied on what had been experienced by a part of the foreign creditors on the provision to be made for the residue and on the punctuality which he flattered himself would be observed in all future payments of the domestic creditors he was more apprehensive of injury to public credit from such modifications of the interest of the public debt as some gentlemen seemed to have in view in these the public would be the gainer and the plea of inability the more alarming because it was so easy to set up so difficult to be disproved and for which consequently the temptations would be so alluring the impracticability of the measure was the remaining ground on which it had been attacked he did not deny that it would be attended with difficulties and that perfect justice would not be done but these were not the questions it was sufficient that a grievous injustice would be lessened and that the difficulties might be surmounted what he had in view was that for the conveniency of claimants some authority should be provided and properly distributed through the union in order to investigate and ascertain the claims and that for the security of the public the burden of proof should be thrown on the claimants a scrutiny on this plan aided by original settlements in the books of the army department and the state commissioners and other office documents would be a remedy at once for all the difficulties stated with regard to fictitious names certificates issued as money by commissaries and quartermasters due bills c for some particular cases special provisions might be requisite the case of loanoffice certificates alienated at early     periods before they were much depreciated fell under this description legacies might be another he would have no objection to some special regulation as to the payments of debts in certificates to persons within the british lines said to have been authorized by the laws of new york though he presumed few such payments had been made and that of this few the greater part had by this time passed from the creditors into other hands there might be a few other cases equally entitled to some particular attention in the details of the provision as to the merchants who had compounded for their debts in certificates or persons who had exchanged bonds for them it could not be doubted that the transactions had reference to the market value of the paper and therefore had nothing peculiar in them the expense incident to such a plan of investigation ought to form no difficulty it bears no proportion to the expense already incurred by commissioners c for effecting a less proportion of justice rather than justice should not be done the expense might be taken out of the portion to the original sufferers the danger of frauds and perjuries had been worked up into a formidable objection if these had always been equally alarming no provision could ever have been made for the settlement or discharge of public debts he reminded the committee of the frauds and perjuries for which a door had been opened by the final settlements c of the frauds and perjuries inseparable from the collection of imposts and excises yet these were all submitted to as necessary evils because justice could not be done without them the frauds and perjuries incident to this supplementary provision for justice must be very inconsiderable in number and still more so when compared either with the object to be obtained or with the like evils already encountered in pursuit of a like object great ingenuity and information had been exerted by the gentlemen on the other side in raising difficulties he was sure that after an adoption of the proposition the same     exertion would be used in removing them and with such aid the idea of impracticability would vanish february    assumption of state debts mr madison observed on the measure that the principle of it is in favor of the united states so far as it may tend to bring about a final settlement and payment of all the accounts between the united states and the individual states i believe this to be however a work of amazing difficulty though not absolutely impossible if it should be accomplished it must go at least hand in hand with the secretarys plan and if it can be accomplished it will do more honor to the revolution in our government than almost any other measure i acknowledge that i cannot subscribe to all the reasons which some gentlemen urge i am far from thinking that the assumption of the state debts will be the means of keeping the debts dispersed throughout the states the assumption of those debts will give them immediately the character of debts of the united states they will be embarked in the same bottom they will take the same course and of consequence will arrive at the same place where it is acknowledged the domestic debts of the united states by degrees have assembled whether they will remain in this place or flow out of the united states altogether is a question which time will decide i look for such a revolution of the debt as will place the greatest part of it in foreign hands neither do i subscribe to the opinion of the gentleman from maryland mr stone that the united states can raise more revenue by the exercise of a sole authority than by the concurrent operation of the general and state governments there are i conceive objects of taxation of three kinds the first is that which can only be operated upon by the united states the second which can be operated upon by the united states and individual states jointly and in the last place such as can be best operated upon by the individual states only     an impost or excise can be best regulated by the sole authority of the united states some taxes can be collected by the two governments without any interference the land tax generally falls under this description but in some particular cases the local authority alone can make the proper provision i conclude therefore that the authority of the united states and individual states taken together will draw more revenue than either can separately draw from the same sources but if we can accomplish the great object of doing full justice in so complicated a case perhaps it will reward us for all the difficulties and sacrifices we shall be compelled to make but in order to accomplish it we must go much further than the object of the proposition on the table some gentlemen have made the passage of this resolution a condition of providing for the acknowledged debt of the united states i think this a preposterous condition and a language improper to be held after the decision which has taken place in priority of time and obligation we ought to provide for the acknowledged debt before we determine to enter into a new obligation we should see how far we are able to discharge those positively due by us the connexion between these resolutions is not such as to require or justify the condition the plan of the secretary draws a distinction between the two debts if we are to make a common stock of the debts of the states not yet discharged it can only be justified by securing provision for those which are discharged with this view therefore i will now move to add to the resolution these words that effectual provision be at the same time made for liquidating and crediting to the states the whole of their expenditure during the war as the same hath been or may be stated for the purpose and in such liquidation the best evidence shall be received that the nature of the case will permit it may be said that this is a superfluous condition because there is a board in existence charged with the trust but sir   0 their power does not reach the great object contemplated the limitation act has already barred a great number of equitable claims of one state perhaps there are other states in the same predicament i do not know whether the power of the board has a latitude sufficient to receive such evidence as the nature of the case will permit and if adequate provision is not made on this head a great deal more injustice will be done than by a refusal to assum the state debts      i hope i shall be excused for connecting these provisions because i think it impossible to separate them in justice or propriety if by providing for the first we can secure a provision for the last we may do great honor to the councils of america and establish its character for equity and justice if we do not wish to decide precipitately on the question i shall be content to delay it and perhaps gentlemen may be impressed with the propriety of doing so till they take a view of the funds which are in contemplation and see how effective and adequate they are likely to prove end of volume v   edward carrington wrote to madison from new york where he was a delegate in congress from virginia under date september        —the gentlemen who have arrived from the

held forth our southern neighbours might be driven to despair seeing no door open to safety should they disapprove the new constitution—mason on the subject was less candid than ever i knew him to

jeopardize the union—mason may be considered as the head of this set— from such a discordance in opinion i believe if the friends to the govt in the state convention should manage wisely  if nine

improbable the constitution must be adopted—i have seen but few of these gentlemen but have good information as to most of their dispositions upon the subject the governours letter to the public which you doubtless have before this seen marks out this conduct and i think that publication will be of great service mr henry it is said is determined to amend  leave the fate of the measure to depend on all the other states conforming to the will of virginia his language is that the other states cannot do without us and therefore we can dictate to them what terms we please—should they be weak enough to stand out we may alone enter into foreign alliances—the value of our staple is such that any nation will be ready to treat with us separately—i have not heard of any who have shewn a disposition to

constitution appear to be as high as any whatever is of opinion with the governor—he thinks that should nine states have adopted when the convention of virginia meets every idea of amendment ought to be abandoned but that should there be a less number the attempt must be made but with such caution as not to hazard entirely the fate of the measure i am persuaded that this will become the prevailing sentiment amongst the malcontents and in that case there will be tolerable safety because i see no prospect of more than rhode isld n york  north carolina holding out—the latter it is said  i believe

lawyers judges clergymen merchants and men of education are all in favor of the constitution  that for this reason they appear to be able to make the worst appear the better cause—but say they if we had men of this description on our side we should alarm the people with the imperfections of the constitution  be able to refute the defense set up in its favor—notwithstanding the superiority of talents in favor of the constitution yet the same infatuation which prevailed not many months since in several counties of this state and which emboldened them to take arms agt the government seems to have an uncontroulable authority over a numerous part of our convention—their objections are not directed against any part of the constitution but their opposition seems to arise from an opinion that is immoveable that some injury is plotted against them that the system is the production of the rich and ambitious that they discern its operation and that the consequence will be the establishment of two orders in the society one comprehending the opulent  great the other the poor and illiterate— the extraordinary union in favor of the constitution in this state of the wealthy and sensible part of

were before possessed of not alienated in the three modes pointed out but this does not include cases which are the creatures of the new constitution for instance the crime of treason against the united states immediately is a crime known only to the new constitution there was no power in the state constitution to pardon that crime—there will therefore be none under the new c this or something

author be right he must be too much engaged to make a rapid progress in what remains —the court of chancery  a circuit court are now sitting we are told that your election has succeeded with which we

some of them would he feared be unwilling to give the best hand to the constitution unless the conduct of the other states justified it if the maryland and south carolina conventions adjourned until virginia had spoken the influence against favorable action by virginia would be serious would madison therefore impress upon his friends in those states the necessity for favorable action mr pendleton was being urged to favor amendments before ratification but madison was expected to prevent any change in his views the opposition of mason was due to his irritation and to the vain opinion he entertains which has industriously been supported by some particular characters that he has influence enough to dictate a constitution to virginia and through her to the rest of the union mr henry is now almost avowedly an enemy to the union    his real sentiments will be industriously concealed for so long as he talks only of amendments such of the friends to the union as object to particular parts of the constitution will adhere to him which they would not do a moment if they could be convinced of his real design i hope to be possessed of sufficient information by the meeting of the convention to make that matter clear and if i am it shall not be withheld the opposition except from that quarter will be feeble our friend e r andolph talks of a compromise between the friends of the union but i know of but one that can safely take place and that is on the plan of the massachusetts convention it appears to me impossible that another continental convention assembled to deliberate on the whole subject should ever agree on any general plan let the decision of our convention be what it may i think it will be of great consequence that an address to the people at large should go forth from such of the members as are friends to the constitution if this had been done in pennsylvania it would have counteracted much of the poison contained in the dissent of the minority    but if this government is rejected america will be left without one at least only in possession of one which all parties agree is insufficient it will therefore be our duty to state to the people the necessity of a change and place in its true point of view the one now offered nine tenths of the people are strong friends to the union and such of them as are opposed to the proposed government are so upon suppositions not warranted by the thing itself no person in the convention can so well prepare this address as yourself and if it appears as important in your eyes as it does to me i hope that you will undertake it the greater part of the members of the convention will go to the meeting without information on the subject it will be very important to give this as early as may be and if possible before—they go from home publius or the fæderalist if it is published in a pamphlet would do it better than any other work if it is published can i get the favor of you to procure me thirty or forty copies of it that i may distribute them    the only danger i apprehend is from the kentucky members and one consideration only has any weight with them a fear that if the new government

trouble you with this communication of them as a private citizen it could not be my wish that erroneous opinions should be entertained with respect to either of those points particularly with respect to religious liberty but having been induced to offer my services to this district as its representative in the federal legislature considerations of a public nature make it proper that with respect to both my principles and views should be rightly understood i freely own that i have never seen in the constitution as it now stands those serious dangers which have alarmed many respectable citizens accordingly whilst it remained unratified and it was necessary to unite the states in some one plan i opposed all previous alterations as calculated to throw the states into dangerous contentions and to furnish the secret enemies of the union with an opportunity of promoting its dissolution circumstances are now changed the constitution is established on the ratifications of eleven states and a very great majority of the people of america and amendments if pursued with a proper moderation and in a proper mode will be not only safe but may serve the double purpose of satisfying the minds of well meaning opponents and of providing additional guards in favour of liberty under this change of circumstances it is my sincere opinion that the constitution ought to be revised and that the first congress meeting under it ought to prepare and recommend to the states for ratification the most satisfactory provisions for all essential rights particularly the rights of conscience in the fullest latitude the freedom of the press trials by jury security against general warrants c i think it will be proper also to provide expressly in the constitution for the periodical increase of the number of representatives until the amount shall be entirely satisfactory and to put the judiciary department into such a form as will render vexatious appeals impossible there are sundry other alterations which are either eligible in themselves or being at least safe are recommended by the respect due to such as wish for them i have intimated that the amendments ought to be proposed by the first congress i prefer this mode to that of a general convention— st because it is the most expeditious mode a convention must be delayed until ⅔ of the state legislatures shall have applied for one and afterwards the amendments must be submitted to the states whereas if the business be undertaken by congress the amendments may be prepared and submitted in march next  dly because it is the most certain mode there are not a few states who will absolutely reject the proposal of a convention and yet not be averse to amendments in the other mode—lastly it is the safest mode the congress who will be appointed to execute as well as to amend the government will probably be careful not to destroy or endanger it a convention on the other hand meeting in the present ferment of parties and containing perhaps insidious characters from different parts of america would at least spread a general alarm and be but too likely to turn everything into confusion and uncertainty it is to be observed however that the question concerning a general convention will not belong to the federal legislature if ⅔ of the states apply for one congress cannot refuse to call it if not the other mode of amendments must be pursued—mad mss   so endorsed by madison the words at whose request drawn up being in his penmanship when an old man the report is a copy as are all the lee letters   february

addressed with a truly republican simplicity to g w presidt of the u s the latter follows the example with the omission of the personal name but without any other than the constitutional title the proceeding on this point was in the house of reps spontaneous the imitation by the senate was extorted the question became a serious one between the two houses j adams espoused the cause of titles with great earnestness his friend r h lee altho elected as a republican enemy to an aristocratic constitution was a most zealous second the projected title was his highness the presidt of the u s and protector of their liberties had the project succeeded it would have subjected the presidt to a severe dilemma and given a deep wound to our infant government it is with much pleasure i inform you

it the first is also to be under one head though to be branched out in such a manner as will check the administration chancellor livingston wishes this department  but will not succeed it will be given i think to jay or hamilton the latter is perhaps best qualified for that species of business and on that account would be preferred by those who know him personally the former is more known by character throughout the u s i have been asked whether any appointment at home would be agreeable to you being unacquainted with your mind i have not ventured on an answer the bill of rates which passed the house of representatives a few days ago is not yet come down from the senate the duties will it is said be pretty much reduced in a few instances perhaps the reductions may not be improper if they are not generally left as high as will admit of collection the dilemma will be unavoidable of either maintaining our public credit in its birth or resorting to other kinds of taxation for which our constituents are not yet prepared the senate is also abolishing  the discriminations in favor of nations in treaty whereby britain will be quieted in the enjoyment of our trade as she may please to regulate it and france discouraged from her efforts at a competition which it is not less our interest than hers to promote the question was agitated repeatedly in the house of representatives and decided at last almost unanimously in favor of some monitory proof that our government is able and not afraid to encounter the restrictions of britain both the senators from virginia particularly lee go with the majority of the senate in this i suspect the temper of the party which sent them is as little consulted as is the conduct of lee in the affair of titles and his opinion in relation to the western country i have already informed you that madam brehan is every day recovering from the disesteem  neglect into which reports had thrown her and that moustier is also become more and more acceptable or at least less and less otherwise his commercial ideas are probably neither illiberal nor unfriendly to this country the contrary has been supposed when the truth is ascertained  known unfavorable impressions will be still more removed the subject of amendments was to have been introduced on monday last but is postponed in order that more urgent business may not be delayed on monday sevennight it will certainly come forward a bill of rights incorporated perhaps into the constitution will be proposed with a few other alterations most called for by the opponents of the government and least objectionable to its friends as soon as mr brown arrives who is the representative of kentucky the admission of that district to the character of a state and a member of the union will claim attention i foresee no difficulty unless local jealousy should couple the pretensions of vermont with those of kentucky and even then no other delay than what may be necessary to open the way for the former through the forms and perhaps the objections of this state n york which must not be altogether disregarded the proceedings of the new congress are so far marked with great moderation and liberality and will disappoint the wishes and predictions of many who have opposed the government the spirit which characterizes the house of reps in particular is already extinguishing the honest fears which considered the system as dangerous to republicanism for myself i am persuaded that the bias of the federal is on the same side with that of the state gots

spirit of moderation and accommodation which is so far flattering the bill for regulating the quantum of duties is not yet come back from the senate some alterations will be made but none that affect the substance of the plan unless it be the abolition of a small favor to the nations in alliance with us copied from the laws of virginia one of our senators  whose ideas on another point excite animadversions among his constituents seems not to consult their sentiments on this i think myself that it is impolitic in every view that can be taken of the subject to put g britain at once on the footing of a most favored nation the bill for collecting the duties is now before the h of reps and i fear will not be very quickly despatched it has passed thro several hands legal as well as merchantile and notwithstanding is in a crude state it might certainly have been put into a better though in every step the difficulties arising from novelty are severely experienced and are an ample as well as just source of apology scarcely a day passes without some striking evidence of the delays and perplexities springing merely from the want of precedents time will be a full remedy for this evil and will i am persuaded evince a greater facility in legislating uniformly for all the states than has been supposed by some of the best friends of the union among the subjects on the anvil is the arrangements of the subordinate executive departments a unity in each has been resolved on and an amenability to the president alone as well as to the senate by way of impeachment perhaps it would not be very consistent with the constitution to require the concurrence of the senate in removals the executive power seems to be vested in the president alone except so far as it is qualified by an express association of the senate in appointments in like manner as the legislative is vested in congress under the exception in favour of the presidents qualified negative independently of this consideration i think it best to give the senate as little agency as possible in executive matters and to make the president as responsible as possible in them were the heads of departments dependent on the senate a faction in this branch might support them agst the president distract the executive department and obstruct the public business the danger of undue power in the president from such a regulation is not to me formidable i see and politically feel that that will be the weak branch of the government with a full power of removal the president will be more likely to spare unworthy

interesting discussion which consumed great part of the past week the constitution has omitted to declare expressly by what authority removals from office are to be made out of this silence four constructive doctrines have arisen   that the power of removal may be disposed of by the legislative discretion to this it is objected that the legislature might then confer it on themselves or even on the house of reps which could not possibly have been intended by the constitution   that the power of removal can only be exercised in the mode of impeachment to this the objection is that it would make officers of every description hold their places during good behavior which could have still less been intended   that the power of removal is incident to the power of appointment to this the objections are that it would require the constant session of the senate that it extends the mixture of legislative  executive power that it destroys the responsibility of the president by enabling a subordinate executive officer to intrench himself behind a party in the senate and destroys the utility of the senate in their legislative and judicial characters by involving them too much in the heats and cabals inseparable from questions of a personal nature in fine that it transfers the trust in fact from the president who being at all times impeachable as well as every  th year eligible by the people at large may be deemed the most responsible member of the government to the senate who from the nature of that institution is and was meant after the judiciary  in some respects without that exception to be the most irresponsible branch of the government   that the executive power being in general terms vested in the president all power of an executive nature not particularly taken away must belong to that department that the power of appointment only being expressly taken away the power of removal so far as it is of an executive nature must be reserved in support of this construction it is urged that exceptions to general positions are to be taken strictly and that the axiom relating to the separation of the legislative  executive functions ought to be favored to this are objected the principle on which the  d construction is founded  the danger of creating too much influence in the executive magistrate the last opinion has prevailed but is subject to various modifications by the power of the legislature to limit the duration of laws creating offices or the duration of the appointments for filling them and by the power over the salaries and appropriations in truth the legislative power is of such a nature that it scarcely can be restrained either by the constitution or by itself and if the federal government should lose its proper equilibrium within itself i am persuaded that the effect will proceed from the encroachments of the legislative department if the possibility of encroachments on the part of the ex or the senate were to be compared i should pronounce the danger to lie rather in the latter than the former the mixture of legislative executive  judiciary authorities lodged in that body justifies such an inference at the same time i am fully in the opinion that the numerous and immediate representatives of the people composing the other house will decidedly predominate in the government mr page tells me he has forwarded to you a

a copy of a late proposition in congress on the subject of amending the constitution it aims at the twofold object of removing the fears of the discontented and of avoiding all such alterations as would either displease the adverse side or endanger the success of the measure i need not remark to you the hazard of attempting anything of a controvertible nature which is to depend on the concurrence of ⅔ of both houses here and the ratification of ¾ of the state legislatures it will be some time before the proposed amendments will become a subject of discussion in congress the bills relating to revenue and the organization of the judiciary and executive departments being likely to remain for some time on hand this delay proceeds from the intricacy and partly from the novelty of the business at every step difficulties from one or another of these sources arrest our progress after the first essays the work will become every day more easy among other difficulties the exposition of the constitution is frequently a copious source and must continue so untill its meaning on all great points shall have been settled by precedents the greatest part of the week past has been consumed in deciding a question as to the power of removal from offices held during pleasure four constructive doctrines have been maintained   that the power is subject to the disposal of the legislature   that no removal can take place otherwise than by impeachment   that the power is incident to that of appointment and therefore belongs to the president  senate   that the executive power being generally vested in the president every power of an executive nature not expressly excepted is to be referred thither and consequently the power of removal the power of appointment only being

dear sir— i am particularly obliged by your favor of the  d which incloses your remarks on the judiciary bill it came to hand yesterday only and i have not had time to compare your suggestions with the plan of the senate nor do i know the alterations which may have taken place in it since it has been under discussion in many points even supposing the outline a good one which i have always viewed as controvertible defects and inaccuracies were striking it gives me much pleasure to find your approbation given to the decision of the house of reps on the power of removal this appears to be the case with several of our friends in virga of whose sentiments i had formed other conjectures i was apprehensive that the alarms with regard to the danger of monarchy would have diverted their attention from the impropriety of transferring an executive trust from the most to the least responsible member of the government independently of every other consideration the primary objects on which the senate are to be employed seem to require that their executive agency should not be extended beyond the minimum that will suffice as the judiciary tribunal which is to decide on impeachments they ought not to be called on previously for a summary opinion on cases which may come before them in another capacity and both on that account and the necessity of keeping them in a fit temper to controul the capricious  factious counsels of the other legislative branch they ought to be as little as possible involved in those questions of a personal nature which in all governments are the most frequent  violent causes of animosity and party   —mad mss james madison aug        new york james monroe to james monroe n y aug        dear sir—              your ideas on the proposed discrimination between foreign nations coincide i perceive exactly with those which have governed me the senate did not allow that no effort should be made for vindicating our commercial interests but argued that a more effectual mode should be substituted a come was appd in that branch to report such a mode the report made is founded on something like a retort of her restrictions in the w inda channels it is now said that as the measure would involve an imposition of extraordinary duties the senate cannot proceed in it mr gerry alluding to these circumstances moved two days ago for a bill giving further encouragement to trade  navigation and obtained a committee for the purpose what will be the result is uncertain if the attempt added to what has passed should as it probably will be made known abroad it may lead to apprehensions that may be salutary the attention of the h of reps for some days has been confined to the subject of compensations the bill is at length brought into its final shape much discussion took place on the quantum for the members of congs  the question whether it shd be the same for both houses my own opinion was in favor of a difference founded on a reduction of the sum proposed with regard to the h of reps  an augmentation as to the senate as no difference took place the case of the senate and of the members from s c  georga had real weight agst a lesser sum than   dollrs which i own is higher than i had contemplated for the h of reps  which i fear may excite criticisms not to be desired at the present moment yesterday was spent on a message from the president relative to indian affairs  the militia bills are ordered providing for a treaty with the hostile tribes and for regulating the militia the latter is an arduous task  will probably not be compleated at this session — mad mss   madison wrote to archibald stuart august    james madison august    archibald stuart i am just favd with yours of the  0th inst and am glad to find your sentiments so decided as to the power of removal by the presidt every letter to me and as far as i know to others here from virga ratifies the propriety of the decision of congress our last discussions of moment have turned on the compensations the bill as gone to the senate allows six dollars a day to the members of both houses my own idea was that it should have been less for the reps  more for the senate with equal emoluments the ablest men will prefer the h of reps and the senate will degenerate into an unfitness for the great dignity of its institution the rate allowed is unpopular in this quarter of the union but the truth is that   dollars is more necessary for the distant states particularly s c  georgia than it would be to n jersey connecticut c and a defective allowance would put the states at a distance under disadvantages of a very serious nature add to this that a less sum than   dollars for the senate whose case was involved in that of the h of reps after the vote agst a discrimination could not well be thought of on these grounds the measure must rest for its vindication i am afraid it will be disrelished in your part of virga  cannot say i am satisfied with it myself with men of liberal turns and who know the former allowance made to congress by the states and who moreover take into view the situation  voting of the different states an apologetic reasoning on the subject will not be sufficient with those of another cast the case will be different   —va hist soc mss james madison aug       new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph n y aug       my dear friend— for a week past the subject of amendts has exclusively occupied the h of reps its progress has been exceedingly wearisome not only on account of the diversity of opinions that was to be apprehended but of the apparent views of some to defeat by delaying a plan short of their wishes but likely to satisfy a great part of their companions in opposition throughout the union it has been absolutely necessary in order to effect anything to abbreviate debate and exclude every proposition of a doubtful  unimportant nature had it been my wish to have comprehended every amendt recom̃ended by virga i should have acted from prudence the very part to which i have been led by choice two or three contentious additions would even now prostrate the whole project the judiciary bill was put off in favr of the preceding subject it was evident that a longer delay of that wd prevent any decision on it at this session a push was therefore made which did not succeed without strenuous opposition on monday the bill will probably be taken up  be pursued to afinal question as fast as the nature of the case will allow i find on looking over the notes of your introductory discourse in the convention at philada that it is not possible for me to do justice to the substance of it i am anxious for particular reasons to be furnished with the means of preserving this as well as the other arguments in that body and must beg that you will make out  forward me the scope of your reasoning you have your notes i know  from these you can easily deduce the argument on a condensed plan i make this request with an earnestness wch will not permit you either to refuse or delay a compliance—mad mss james madison aug   —     new york alexander white to alexander white n york aug   —     dear sir the week past has been devoted to the subject of amendments all that remains is a formal vote on a fair transcript which will be taken this morning and without debate i hope as each of the propositions has been agreed to by two thirds of the house the substance of the report of the committee of eleven has not been much varied it became an unavoidable sacrifice to a few who knew their concurrence to be necessary to the dispatch if not the success of the business to give up the form by which the amendts when ratified would have fallen into the body of the constitution in favor of the project of adding them by way of appendix to it it is already apparent i think that some ambiguities will be produced by this change as the question will often arise and sometimes be not easily solved how far the original text is or is not necessarily superceded by the supplemental act a middle way will be taken between the two modes of proposing all the amendts as a single act to be adopted or rejected in the gross and of proposing them as independent amendts each of which shall take place or not as it may be individually decided on the several propositions will be classed according to their affinity to each other which will reduce them to the number of   or   in the whole to go forth as so many amendts unconnected with one another on saturday notice was given to the house by mr scott that on thursday in this week he should bring in the subject of the permanent seat of congress illegible  illegible in favr of trenton ensued the like from lancaster c also came forward i suspect that the motion is the result of some illegible of a pretty serious nature a great push will be made for trenton which has i fear more partizans than might be wished it is surmised that a coalition has taken place between pa  the east states i believe it to be the case in some degree tho not fully as far as i can gather the coalition for trenton might be broken by accepting the susquehannah and leaving n y the temporary enjoyment of congs this i believe is the ultimate aim of the n y party and will not do for us i suspect they begin to despair of a long possession of congs and consequently mix the permanent with the temporary considerations having give you these facts your own judgment will best decide how far it may be worth while and incumbent on you to hasten your return—n y pub lib lenox mss alexander white wrote from philadelphia august        saying those people he had seen shew almost a childish anxiety for the removal of congress to this

with yours of the  d instant the judiciary is now under consideration i view it as you do as defective both in its general structure and many of its particular regulations the attachment of the eastern members the difficulty of substituting another plan with the consent of those who agree in disliking the bill the defect of time c will however prevent any radical alterations the most i hope is that some offensive violations of southern jurisprudence may be corrected and that the system may speedily undergo a reconsideration under the auspices of the judges who alone will be able perhaps to set it to rights the senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some alterations which strike in my opinion at the most salutary articles in many of the states juries even in criminal cases are taken from the state at large in others from districts of considerable extent in very few from the county alone hence a torn out like to the restraint with respect to vicinage which has produced a negative on that clause a fear of inconvenience from a constitutional bar to appeals below a certain value and a confidence that such a limitation is not necessary have had the same effect on another article several others have had a similar fate the difficulty of uniting the minds of men accustomed to think and act differently can only be conceived by those who have witnessed it a very important question is depending on the subject of a permanent seat for the fedl govt early in the session secret negociations were set on foot among the northern states from penna inclusively the parties finally disagreeing in their arrangements both made advances to the southern members on the side of n y  n engd we were led to expect the susquehannah within a reasonable time if we wd sit still in n york otherwise we were threatened with trenton these terms were inadmissible to the friends of potowmac on the side of penna who was full of distrust and animosity agst n engd  n york the potowmac was presented as the reward for the temporary advantages if given by the s states some progress was made on this ground and the prospect became flattering when a reunion was produced among the original parties by circumstances which it wd be tedious to explain the susquehannah has in consequence been voted the bill is not yet brought in and many things may yet happen we shall parry any decision if we can tho i see little hope of attaining our own object the eastern states being inflexibly opposed to the potowmac  for some reasons which are more likely to grow stronger than weaker and if we are to be placed on the susquehannah the sooner the better—mad mss   james madison sepr         new york edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton n y sepr         dear sir— the pressure of unfinished business has suspended the adjournment of congs till saturday next among the articles which required it was the plan of amendments on which the two houses so far disagreed as to require conferences it will be impossible i find to prevail on the senate to concur in the limitation on the value of appeals to the supreme court which they say is unnecessary and might be embarrassing in questions of national or constitutional importance in their principle tho of small pecuniary amount they are equally inflexible in opposing a definition of the locality of juries the vicinage they contend is either too vague or too strict a term too vague if depending on limits to be fixed by the pleasure of the law too strict if limited to the county it was proposed to insert after the word juries with the accustomed requisites leaving the definition to be construed according to the judgment of professional men even this could not be obtained the truth is that in most of the states the practice is different and hence the irreconcileable difference of ideas on the subject in some states jurors are drawn from the whole body of the community indiscriminately in others from large districts comprehending a number of counties and in a few only from a single county the senate suppose also that the provision for vicinage in the judiciary bill will sufficiently quiet the fears which called for an amendment on this point on a few other points in the plan the senate refuse to join the house of reps the bill establishing the permanent seat of govt has pasd the h of reps in favr of the susquehannah some of the southern members despaired so much of ever getting anything better that they fell into the majority even some of the virginians leaned that way my own judgment was opposed to any compromise on the supposition that we had nothing worse to fear than the susquehannah and could obtain that at any time either by uniting with the eastern states or pennsylva the bill however is by no means sure of passing the senate in its present form it is even possible that it may fall altogether those who wish to do nothing at this time added to those who disapprove of the susquehannah either as too far south or too far north or not susceptible of early conveniences for the fiscal administration may form a majority who will directly or indirectly frustrate the measure in case of an indirect mode some other place will be substituted for susquehannah as trenton or germantown neither of which can i conceive be effectually established and either of which might get a majority composed of sincere and insidious votes   —mad mss   the passage of this amendment required the bill to go back to the senate and congress adjourned september   th before there was a chance for further action madison thus

jefferson new york feby      0 dear sir— your favor of jany   inclosing one of sepr last did not get to hand till a few days ago the idea which the latter evolves is a great one and suggests many interesting reflections to legislators particularly when contracting and providing for public debts whether it can be received in the extent to which your reasonings carry it is a question which i ought to turn more in my thoughts than i have yet been able to do before i should be justified in making up a full opinion on it my first thoughts lead me to view the doctrine as not in all respects compatible with the course of human affairs i will endeavour to sketch the grounds of my skepticism as the earth belongs to the living not to the dead a living generation can bind itself only in every society the will of the majority binds the whole according to the laws of mortality a majority of those ripe for the exercise of their will do not live beyond the term of    years to this term then is limited the validity of every act of the society nor can any act be continued beyond this term without an express declaration of the public will this i understand to be the outline of the argument the acts of a political society may be divided into three classes   the fundamental constitution of the government   laws involving some stipulation which renders them irrevocable at the will of the legislature   laws involving no such irrevocable quality   however applicable in theory the doctrine may be to a constitution it seems liable in practice to some weighty objections would not a government ceasing of necessity at the end of a given term unless prolonged by some constitutional act previous to its expiration be too subject to the casualty and consequences of an interregnum would not a government so often revised become too mutable  novel to retain that share of prejudice in its favor which is a salutary aid to the most rational government would not such a periodical revision engender pernicious factions that might not otherwise come into existence and agitate the public mind more frequently and more violently than might be expedient   in the second class of acts involving stipulations must not exceptions at least to the doctrine be admitted if the earth be the gift of nature to the living their title can extend to the earth in its natural state only the improvements made by the dead form a debt against the living who take the benefit of them this debt cannot be otherwise discharged than by a proportionate obedience to the will of the authors of the improvements but a case less liable to be controverted may perhaps be stated debts may be incurred with a direct view to the interests of the unborn as well as of the living such are debts for repelling a conquest the evils of which descend through many generations debts may even be incurred principally for the benefit of posterity such perhaps is the debt incurred by the u states in these instances the debts might not be dischargeable within the term of    years there seems then to be some foundation in the nature of things in the relation which one generation bears to another for the descent of obligations from one to another equity may require it mutual good may be promoted by it and all that seems indispensable in stating the account between the dead and the living is to see that the debts against the latter do not exceed the advances made by the former few of the incumbrances entailed on nations by their predecessors would bear a liquidation even on this principle   objections to the doctrine as applied to the third class of acts must be merely practical but in that view alone they appear to be material unless such temporary laws should be kept in force by acts regularly anticipating their expiration all the rights depending on positive laws that is most of the rights of property would become absolutely defunct and the most violent struggles ensue between the parties interested in reviving  those interested in reforming the antecedent state of property nor does it seem improbable that such an event might be suffered to take place the checks  difficulties opposed to the passage of laws which render the power of repeal inferior to an opportunity to reject as a security against oppression would here render the latter an insecure provision against anarchy add to this that the very possibility of an event so hazardous to the rights of property could not but depreciate its value that the approach of the crisis wd increase the effect that the frequent return of periods superseding all the obligations dependent on antecedent laws  usages must by weakening the sense of them cooperate with motives to licenciousness already too powerful and that the general uncertainty  vicissitudes of such a state of things would on one side discourage every useful effort of steady industry pursued under the sanction of existing laws and on the other give an immediate advantage to the more sagacious over the less sagacious part of the society i can find no relief from such embarrassments but in the received doctrine that a tacit assent may be given to established governments  laws and that this assent is to be inferred from the omission of an express revocation it seems more practicable to remedy by wellconstituted governments the pestilent operation of this doctrine in the unlimited sense in which it is at present recd than it is to find a remedy for the evils necessarily springing from an unlimited admission of the contrary doctrine is it not doubtful whether it be possible to exclude wholly the idea of an implied or tacit assent without subverting the very foundation of civil society on what principle is it that the voice of the majority binds the minority it does not result i conceive from a law of nature but from compact founded on utility a greater proportion might be required by the fundamental constitution of society if under any praticular circumstances it were judged eligible prior therefore to the establishment of this principle unanimity was necessary and rigid theory accordingly presupposes the assent of every individual to the rule which subjects the minority to the will of the majority if this assent cannot be given tacitly or be not implied where no positive evidence forbids no person born in society could on attaining ripe age be bound by any acts of the majority and either a unanimous renewal of every law would be necessary as often as a new member should be added to the society or the express consent of every new member be obtained to the rule by which the majority decides for the whole if these observations be not misapplied it follows that a limitation of the validity of all acts to the computed life of the generation establishing them is in some cases not required by theory and in others not consistent with practice they are not meant however to impeach either the utility of the principle as applied to the cases you have particularly in view or the general importance of it in the eye of the philosophical legislator on the contrary it would give me singular pleasure to see it first announced to the world in a law of the u states and always kept in view as a salutary restraint on living generations from unjust  unnecessary burdens on their successors this is a pleasure however which i have no hope of enjoying the spirit of philosophical legislation has not prevailed at all in some parts of america and is by no means the fashion of this part or of the present representative body the evils suffered or feared weakness in government and licenciousness in the people have turned the attention more towards the means of strengthening the powers of the former than of narrowing their extent in the minds of the latter besides this it is so much easier to descry the little difficulties immediately incident to every great plan than to comprehend its general  remote benefits that further light must be added to the councils of our country before many truths which are seen through the medium of philosophy become visible to the naked eye of the ordinary politician—mad mss  see the letter in fords writings of jefferson v       on the same day madison offered the following resolved that adequate funds ought to be provided for paying the
