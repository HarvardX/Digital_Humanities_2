the certain method to know the disease  a lecture addressed to students in physic  medicus si quidem suffecerit ad cognoscendum sufficient etiam ad sanandum  hippocrates de art london printed for j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxlii  to students in physic gentlemen it is universally agreed that among the several other branches of learning necessary to the accomplishment of those who are candidates in the art of healing the judicious instructions of an able practical physician is a qualification of the first moment the reason of the present concession is very evident because the pupil as the result of such an happy institution according to the standing of his professor may in a few years enter upon business with greater advantage than he could possibly do in many without such assistance for myself i own i am too vain not to account it a singular felicity in my life that i have been blessed with an opportunity of attending sir richard manninghams lectures in midwifery and physic  i pay a greater deference to that gentlemans good sense and distinguished modesty than either to affront the one or insult the other by attempting any thing that might carry the appearance of an encomium though religiously confined to his just praise nevertheless as every generous and honest mind would be equally careful neither to offend against the laws of gratitude to an ingenious tutor for the most instructive dictates nor those of justice and zeal due to the public for whose service gentlemen you are preparing i expect it be allowed me on the present occasion as a necessary instance of duty to both that i am at liberty to declare i want no veneration for sir richards whole course  it is composed indeed of two grand branches which are those of midwifery and physic the former of these is by no means destitute of its beauties such as the improvements in the apparatus itself the chastity of the institution and the exclusion of all instruments  for the first the greater machine is the most finished in its way that has as yet ever appeared for conducting the different kinds of deliveries while the glass machine gives ocular proof of the reason and justness of the rules to be observed in operations on the other and consequently in genuine labors  for the next it is not possible by this manner of instruction to give the least offense to the chastest mind the most scrupulous modesty  and with respect to the affair of instruments it is evident to a demonstration from this method of practice that there is so little occasion for the present frequent use of them that excepting in a case or two which but rarely happen the judicious management of the hand is all that is required in the art of midwifery  gentlemen i abhor flattery and ostentation and i cannot but persuade myself you will acquit me of both when i assure you i should at no rate have taken upon me to have been either so particular or positive in the articles above if i were not very well acquainted with the utmost that has been done abroad on the subject of midwifery i studied under two masters the late messieurs gregoire and dusse at paris and came from thence with no small freight of selfsufficiency and confidence nor is it probable to me i should ever have been dispossessed of my personal prejudices and dangerous mistakes especially in the use of instruments had i not fell under sir richards institution and formed myself on his practice  these things notwithstanding as i always thought the matter of deliveries the least branch of the manmidwifes character and was assured that he would ever have most success in operations who was best acquainted with the structure of the human body so i could not help being especially charmed with those lectures in sir richards course which properly belong to the latter branch the head of physic the superior utility of the subject will excuse my passionate regard on this part since it is plain that the science which leads to a general view of the animal machine and to a perfect knowledge of all the diseases to which the whole nature in common is incident must be vastly preferable to all that is partial and confined however exalted and worthy in itself  what was last observed gentlemen you will please to remember is designed not only to account for the extraordinary pains i was at in securing this lecture but is also offered as a reason why you are to believe it tolerably correct for the latter indeed you have this additional assurance that i had not only several opportunities of attending the repetition of it but was moreover allowed the peculiar indulgence of taking it in shorthand as delivered  i confess it would give me no small pain were i the least apprehensive i was taking any freedom that might justly expose me to the resentment of sir richard manningham but i flatter myself with less danger in this point so far as concerns the present publication however since i am only indulging the english reader with his excellent method of investigating diseases in the manner he explained it to us in his first evenings lecture in physic at the same time that it is to be observed he has already communicated the method itself to the learned world in his latin compendium though some of the best judges have acknowledged it is claim to an higher title  there is one circumstance gentlemen of great importance in the present lecture i mean that the whole argument is built on the most venerable antiquity and not on any precarious modern theories i take the liberty of inserting this previous hint not but your own attention in reading would have excused me the trouble because you will from hence immediately argue its intrinsic value and give more boldly into its use  the histories of diseases originally put together by the most accurate observations of hippocrates and established on the authority of his successors the most celebrated ancient physicians is here your standard nature since her various morbid phenomenon were in their manner first reduced to any regular system appears to have suffered no deviation for some thousand years past nor can indeed be capable of any for the future while the animal economy and the laws under which the human species continues to act remain invariable  i wish nothing more ardently than that as the subject on which the lecture before you is raised is of general use in itself and it is hardly possible every students situation should allow him an opportunity of attending on the spot those into whose hands it may now fall may find as much pleasure and advantage in receiving it from the press as the publisher has perpetually retained since he first took it from sir richards own mouth i am  london bowlane feb         gentlemen your most obedient humble servantsayer rudd md and manmidwife  the certain method to know the disease in the course of our lectures in physic we propose chiefly to confine ourselves to the diseases of children from infancy up to ripe age and to the diseases peculiar to the female sex those especially belonging to pregnancy and childbed nevertheless as women are liable to all the distempers incident to men besides the many peculiar to their own sex as they are by nature ordained for the preservation of mankind it will be necessary in a great measure to treat of diseases at large and more particularly of fevers which indeed make up a very great part of the disorders that afflict us and do also associate themselves with every other disease febris maxim communis morbus omnium aliorum morborum praecipue inflammationis comes est hippocrates the truth of which we daily experience and moreover often observe that a fever shall even elude that method of curing a disease which without a fever has been generally found successful an observation well worthy our particular notice  women with child and in childbed are often afflicted with distempers no ways cognate to pregnancy or childbed especially fevers of all kinds whose essence and nature indeed differ nothing from other fevers and require a like method of cure yet by reason of their happening at the times abovementioned are attended with greater difficulties in curing and demand our greatest caution and prudence in the administration of the proper remedies for the fever the physician at this time not being at liberty so freely to make use of bleeding vomiting blistring sweating purging and method of diet and during pregnancy our chief view must always be to prevent a miscarriage or even the bringing on of labor whenever the disease has no affinity to pregnancy for though diseases which are owing to pregnancy either decrease or go off upon delivery yet those which are no ways cognate are for the most part found to increase after the delivery and as hippocrates observes si mulier utero gestans morbum habuerit non cognatum in puerperii purgatione perit  wherefore as in all diseases not cognate to pregnancy our chief view as i observed above must be to prevent abortion and untimely labor so in all diseases happening in childbed our principal aim must then be directed to the due regulation of the lochia many and great difficulties surround us in this dangerous and complicated situation which exact our most diligent care and attention and as it is oftentimes no easy matter to distinguish between the cognate distemper and that which has no relation to pregnancy or childbed and at all times very difficult rightly and safely to conduct affairs in this nice and critical situation i shall therefore in my subsequent lectures endeavor to the best of my judgment and knowledge to inform and direct you in each particular from the repeated observations of the most approved authors in physic both ancient and modern and also from experiences and successes collected from my own adversaria confirming their doctrine besides which i shall illustrate each case by the particular application of the method of investigating the nature of all diseases  it is a maxim universally received among physicians that medicine should begin where philosophy ends and as it is undoubtedly a necessary qualification in a physician to be knowing in philosophy and the animal economy is that part of philosophy which is more especially conducive to the knowledge of the practice of physic i make no doubt but you gentlemen who have in this city the best opportunities of being instructed in this branch of science especially by that most accurate and excellent anatomist and physician dr nicholls who it must be confessed is an ornament of our profession and worthy of singular praise i say i make no doubt but with such advantages you have already obtained a competent knowledge in the animal economy and will therefore be enabled to make the best use of our lectures and method of investigating the nature of diseases  now the human body we all know may be properly considered as a most perfect machine whose parts are extremely well configurated and joined together whose symmetry is most beautiful and whose actions resulting from this admirable compages are reciprocally carried on by solids and fluids of which it is made up and as many of its actions and motions are easily demonstrated to be the necessary consequences of it is structure so its diseases and all their symptoms are only the irregular motions or disorders of this very complicated machine nor is the case the least altered that we have a principle within us not subject in itself to the laws of motion  it is therefore highly incumbent on every one who would attain to the due knowledge of the art of healing that he make himself very well acquainted with this curious machine that knowing well the parts and the natural actions and secretions of the human body he may be enabled to judge when and how these natural actions are perverted all the symptoms of diseases being the necessary consequences of the alteration of the animal economy it is actions therefore being performed by fluids secerned from the blood without the knowledge of secretions we cannot understand the nature of diseases secretion being the spring of all animal functions wherefore the greater our knowledge is of the animal economy the more likely we shall be to discover the seat and nature of its diseases and of course be better enabled to rectify all its disorders  experience is no doubt of great and necessary use in promoting the art of curing diseases if directed by a knowledge in the animal economy forasmuch as it is only by a just reasoning on our experiences that we can come at the knowledge of any phenomenon of nature so that experience or the knowledge of the histories of diseases added to that of the animal economy is what can only make a physician and wherever the history of a disease is exactly known if the right method of curing it cannot be deduced it must be because the animal economy is not sufficiently understood for our skill in curing diseases whose histories are exactly known is for the most part proportional to our knowledge of the animal economy for in order to find out the seat and nature of a distemper and from them to deduce a right method of cure it will be absolutely necessary to reason on those histories which we cannot do as we ought if we are ignorant of the structure of the machine we are about to rectify  descriptions and diagnostic signs of diseases are the proper business of observation and experience but indications of cure arise from our reasoning upon those observations diagnostics are properly a collection of particular symptoms only but indications are those conclusions which our knowledge of the animal economy enables us to make on these observations and descriptions so that the histories of diseases and the knowledge of the animal economy must always go hand in hand in order to the obtaining the due knowledge of the practice of physic he therefore who is sufficiently knowing in philosophy and the animal economy and makes a proper use of this knowledge by reasoning on real facts grounded on repeated experience and observation may justly be said to use his philosophy aright and may then reasonably hope for success in finding out the genuine indications of cure in which the practice of physic chiefly consists and without this caution our reasonings will certainly be to very little purpose  the great hippocrates has this assertion that nature cures diseases the truth of it we of this day may experience if we will carefully keep up to his excellent directions and method it being his only aim to relieve nature when oppressed in the very way and manner he observed her endeavoring to expel diseases and it was by a constant diligence of this kind joined with his wonderful sagacity that he arrived to that great degree of perfection in the knowledge of physic hence he perceived that nature herself judges diseases and indeed does all being properly assisted nay and sometimes without any assistance  hippocrates also informs us and our own experience cannot but confirm it that those people who have fevers and are left to themselves and take no medicines if they do recover get rid of their fevers by sweating a looseness an haemorrhage diabetes or the like from whence hippocrates and the ancient practitioners in physic took their first intimation to provoke sweat and the other evacuations and from their repeated observations and successes they have formed for us a most rational method of cure and if we duly consider and attend to the different ways by which nature extricates herself from diseases when left to herself we shall soon be convinced that they are not the confused and disordered effects of nature ill defending herself but in fact the gradual steady and measured operations of that exquisite mechanism and innate incessant principle of selfpreservation with which providence has been pleased to endow our bodies a very strong confirmation of the necessity of a careful and diligent observance of the tendencies of nature in all her disorders and the method she takes to get rid of diseases when left to herself and also a very good caution to us all not to be over hasty or too busy in the administration of our remedies lest we should be found to ruffle and disturb rather than assist nature with the untimely use or multitude of our medicines and really the ne quid nimis in the practice of physic is a matter of no small consequence he therefore in my opinion is most likely to prove the best most prudent and rational physician who most diligently observes and constantly follows the motions and dictates of nature herself  if an altogether new distemper should at any time arise among us the only way of getting into the nature of such new disease would be to copy hippocratess example i mean his method of observing joined to the rule of finding out the nature of diseases for we must first be led by symptoms to find a disease after that it is nature and from thence the method of cure and here it may be proper to observe that there are several seasons which have diseases peculiar to themselves and may in some measure indeed be called new diseases it will therefore be necessary to know and carefully observe the seasons as hippocrates and our renowned countryman sydenham advise wherein such diseases are wont to appear otherwise we shall be unsuccessful in curing the diseases peculiar to those different seasons it must also be observed that these diseases are generally stated and regular in each constitution and have an affinity to each other he therefore who is able to come at the nature and cure of one epidemical distemper in any constitution has an advantage in the cure of all the other for though they may differ in several respects yet they require something common in their cure as proceeding from a common cause and a few cases diligently enquired into by recollecting and carefully examining their symptoms as directed by our method of discovering the nature of diseases will be sufficient to give us the nature causes and method of cure of the disease of every constitution whatever here we can by no means omit a pertinent observation of celsus quod si jam incidat mali genus aliquod ignotum non ideo tamen fore medico de rebus cogitandum obscuris sed eum protinus visurum cui morbo id proximum sit tentaturumque remedia fimilia illis quae vicino malo saepe succurrerint and per ejus similitudinem opem reperturum  the many accurate and charming descriptions of distempers delivered down to us by hippocrates in his histories of diseases wherein the phenomenon of each distemper even in its minutest circumstances are observed present us with a most exquisite delineation of nature and if duly attended will always be found of the greatest service for advancing our progress in the art of healing because from his diagnostics in particular and others of the ancients and such among the moderns who have closely copied after his manner we readily discover the nature of the disease and as whenever we arrive at the true and exact history of any distemper whether from books or our own careful observations we may at all times by the right and diligent application of the method of investigation most assuredly discover the immediate and conjunct cause so may we likewise on those principles easily come at the nature of the disease when having that given it will be no difficult matter to find out remedies to cure in all curable cases and to administer relief even in those which are incurable  this unwearied diligence in observation and close attendance on nature in that sagacious great man hippocartes and others of the ancients might probably be heightened in them from the scantiness of their materia medica and the exceeding harshness of the then known remedies however much to our benefit since the excellent descriptions of diseases they have given us can not only never be exceeded but will always remain invariably true while human nature continues the same and had those of later ages who have been so happily provided with a more copious and salutary materia medica and who it must be allowed have been greatly improved in the knowledge of the animal economy had these i say constantly persevered in the use of hippocratess great diligence and manner of observing they might doubtless long ago have brought the practice of physic to a considerable degree of perfection though they had not been blessed with his extraordinary sagacity for that indeed is a peculiar happiness and the lot of a very few in which particular i believe we may say of the physician as is commonly done of the poet nascitur non fit  now should we of this age flushed with our superior knowledge in the animal economy and the variety of our materia medica neglect to make use of that prudence and diligence which is necessary in attending the motions and intentions of nature and instead of endeavoring to assist her on these principles when oppressed become too precipitate and officious in the administration of our medicines the consequence will inevitably be that we shall only obscure the disease by multiplying rather than taking off the symptoms and this to our own personal confusion the manifest injury of our patients and the great disrepute of our profession whereas would we consult the true and proper use of the many happy improvements of our own age i think it cannot be done more effectually than by keeping close to our most skilful leader hippocrates together with the ancient practitioners in physic in their manner of observing and in their method of healing founded upon the knowledge of the conjunct causes of distempers from whence alone the curative indications are to be taken agreeable to the method here mentioned and hippocratess manner of observing and by a careful perseverance in these methods i imagine we may reasonably hope for the greatest success and may perhaps in a few ages arrive at the highest perfection in the practice of physic that human nature is capable of attaining  from what i have already advanced you will naturally conclude that it is no easy matter to become a prudent and skilful physician much reading much thought and pains will really be required many things are necessary to be learnt much diligence in inquiry much assiduity in observation is to be used before we can be duly qualified either with peace of mind to ourselves or relief to our patients to undertake a trust in which the lives of our fellow creatures are so nearly concerned  if this be a just state of the case what shall we say of those persons who boldly take upon them the practice of physic without the least previous knowledge of the requisites absolutely necessary for the regular discharge of this important office certainly it can be no other than the greatest folly and the highest presumption for those to expect success or hope for a blessing on their endeavors who are altogether ignorant of the province in which they engage and would such persons but give themselves time to reflect and seriously consider the great consequence of physic in the practical part of it where life itself is so immediately at stake i am persuaded they would not thus rashly venture to administer medicines before they had acquired the proper and necessary qualifications  it is a mighty mistake that has seized some of our young candidates in physic who are not much addicted to study or painstaking to imagine that if they are but well furnished with books of recipes they have every qualification sufficient to commence doctor upon because in those books as they think agreeable to the common saying they are sure to find a salve for every sore but alas these base empirical books the pest of the present age will greatly deceive them they are by no means to be confided in but on the contrary are rather to be looked upon as very injurious forasmuch as they only furnish all sorts of people with great opportunities of destroying each others health and should any person pretend to set up to practice physic on this deceitful foundation he would soon find himself miserably misled to the great and manifest injury of himself as well as his patients for it is most certain that every medicine be it never so good must always be administered in the most proper dose and at the most proper times of the disease to make it of any advantage to the patient but the chance of the mischief arising from the contrary practice no one i think would covet yet this knowledge can no otherwise be come at than in the arduous and diligent manner of studying abovementioned joined with the method of investigating the nature of diseases not that this is the only advantage which follows on our doctrine of investigation fince it not only leads us into the true nature of the disease and the certain method of cure but also at the same time into the very nature and power of medicines themselves if rightly attended to and applied and were it possible even to find out an universal remedy for all distempers it must still be subject to the due timeing and dosing the accurate knowledge of which can no otherwise be obtained than by the manner and method already laid down and this indeed is the only real and true arcanum in the practice of physic all your panaceas nostrums specifics and the like without this perfect knowledge of administering them in the most proper dose and at the most proper times of the disease will for the most part prove very mischievous and here the opinion of the late learned professor boerhaave concurs with us nec speciosos medicamentorum titulos morbis addidi cur nihil arti exitiale magis novi neque vero ipse ullum cognosco quin solo tempestivo usu tale fiat boerhaave in epistola aphorismis praefixa and these remedies can only by the greatest hazard and chance imaginable ever prove of good effect in any disease of consequence though we all know indeed that in many cases let the medicine given be ever so improper in itself or ever so unseasonably administered the strength of nature may sometimes get the better of both but this is by no means curing nor can it be any excuse for our ignorance  having thus prepared you for the method to be observed in finding out the distemper i shall now proceed to give it you in the plainest and most methodical manner i am able  i cannot introduce what i have to offer on this head with greater advantage than by laying before you the following practical observation of scheffler ut rationalis medicus curativis scopis satisfacere materias medicas invenire inventis recte uti valeat non satis erit vires custodire and morbificas causas amovere sed and morbi speciem and locum affectum exquisite cognitum habeat necesse est  agreeable with this you will observe that in order to cure any disease it is necessary to have a thorough knowledge of the disease itself and of the remedy peculiarly adapted to it it being impossible to cure a disease according to art if the nature of the disease be hid from the artist and for want of this knowledge the care and pains of many physicians have proved ineffectual for these physicians for the most part making little other use of the diagnostic symptoms than the mere naming the distemper only have very injudiciously taken their indications of cure from secondary and casual symptoms whereas the true nature of a disease is ever best found out from the diagnostic signs or marks alone and from thence also the true indications of cure must always be drawn in order to the best and most effectual method of curing the disease and as these indications wholly arise from our reasoning upon the observations of the phenomenon of nature therefore the greater our knowledge of the animal economy is the better we shall be enabled to find out the nature of the disease for it is the animal economy alone which must enable us by reasoning upon the causes signs and symptoms of diseases to find out their natures and to deduce true and just indications of cure  this however in general more expressly to come at the true method of investigating all diseases incident to the human body and from thence proceed to the most effectual methods of treating and curing them the solid knowledge of the following particulars is absolutely required viz    the next and everconcomitant cause of the disease   the seat and part affected   the ways and passages through which the evil takes its course   the inseparable signs of the distemper   the symptoms which commonly accompany the disease and   that we be careful the symptoms of the disease are rightly distinguished if we err not in these main points we are in the right way of arriving to an happy cure of the disease  it is very necessary at all times carefully to distinguish between the disease itself and the symptom the want of which has been the stumblingstone of some even very learned men in all ages since it is to be imputed to the want of this distinction as a principal if not the only obstacle that physicians have been so much at a loss for the true cause of the disease and have therefore so often taken the symptom for the disease itself not rightly distinguishing the next and immediate conjunct cause from its symptoms or accidents which may not be occasioned by the next and always accompanying cause of the disease but by some other symptom and what is so far from being the mark of the disease that it is a symptom of a symptom only  in the toothache for example when it does not proceed from a caries the genuine essence of this disease is the violent distension or stretching of the periostium by some sort of humor by which means this membrane being forced out of its natural form and situation excites a most exquisite pain which pain is not the disease but the true mark of the disease and the humor occasioning this pain the cause of the disease the inflammation fever swelled face etc which may succeed are neither of them the true mark but proceed from the pain which is the true diagnostic sign or mark of the disease each of the abovementioned being the symptom of a symptom only  of the diagnostics or signs of a disease the true marks or signs of a disease are such which are present from the beginning and as it were born with the disease they grow up with the distemper to it is height abate also and vanish with the disease these are the only sure marks or signs other signs or symptoms which do not immediately follow the disease nor any proper effects of it and which do not always appear in the disease are therefore deceitful signs and not to be trusted to though such as have inadvertently misled some even sagacious men  now these deceitful signs are not to be reckoned among the proper symptoms of the disease being only such as proceed from some proper symptom of the disease and are indeed symptoms of symptoms only for the true and proper diagnostic marks or signs of the disease must always begin grow up decline and vanish with the disease itself and from such marks only we must ever draw our indications of cure  of the symptoms of a disease as to the symptoms of any disease the first business is to distinguish the symptoms in general from the disease itself and then to make a distinction between the symptoms themselves that is the symptoms which arise and vanish with the disease are to be distinguished from those which are bred not from the disease itself but from the symptoms of the disease and the symptoms as we before observed which immediately accompany the disease and are born and die with it are the only sure marks or signs of the disease  to illustrate this by our former familiar instance of the toothache here the pain is the chief and most grievous symptom but is neither the disease itself nor the cause of the disease nor yet is it a simple symptom only forasmuch as it is the cause of other symptoms which succeed as the fever inflammation swelled face etc especially when the pain is violent those several accidents now mentioned are caused only by the raging pain of the toothache the true mark of the disease and are symptoms of a symptom only and farther these accidents of fever inflammation swelled face etc are neither in whole nor in part the cause of the toothache neither are they inseparable companions of the toothache for the toothache may be and often is without them and the swelled face in particular does not begin nor end with the disease nor does it always accompany it nor is it of the same nature with the humor occasioning that violent pain but is a symptom only of the toothache being raised by the pain and bred by consent of parts from an afflux of humors  thus you see plainly the method of investigating the nature and causes of a disease it is seat and part affected it is diagnostic symptoms and the necessity of distinguishing these latter not only from the disease itself but also from one another all which will make way to judge the better of a fit remedy to cure the disease for we cannot reasonably hope for a cure before the disease be thoroughly understood and in this manner we must come at the nature cause and cure of all diseases whatever  and indeed diseases have that surprising analogy to one another that we cannot find the nature of any one disease but the nature of several other will by the same means become manifest to us so that a general knowledge arises from a particular inquiry and we are instructed from the discovery of any one into the nature of many other diseases and the most perfect practice in curing them  from this method also of finding out the distemper is discovered at the same time the only way of making a right and true prognostic which is only a declaration of a physicians expectation in curing a sick person and this expectation can no otherwise be truly framed than from the nature of the disease the quantity and intenseness of it the natural strength of the sick and the power of medicines conjunctly the knowledge therefore of prognostics is not otherwise to be acquired than by rightly investigating the diagnostic marks of a disease whereby it is nature is discovered with that the quantity of the disease and the strength of the sick at the same time and as by this method we are also led into the nature and power of medicines themselves so here again the very medicine reflects light and in some measure confirms the knowledge of the disease as hippocrates well observes the medicine declares the disease  this then is the method by which the nature of all diseases to which human bodies are or may be liable is discovered and should ever any altogether new and unheard of disease at any time appear amongst us this will be found the sure way of coming at it is nature by only thus carefully recollecting and examining its symptoms again this will of consequence direct to the most proper method of curing the knowledge of a disease being the first step toward its cure  all the difficulty of philosophy says the great sir isaac newton seems to consist in this from the phenomenon of motions to investigate the forces of nature and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomenon  agreeable to which we observe that the symptoms of any disease being given it is nature may readily be discovered  now the method of curing diseases by drawing indications from the evident and conjunct causes has been most approved of by the best and generality of physicians to this purpose celsus rationalem quidem puto medicinam esse debere instrui vero ab evidentibus causis obscuris omnibus non a cogitatione artificis sed ab ipsa art rejectis as to the knowledge of these causes it is allowed they can only be attained by a close and assiduous observation of all the appearances in the several stages of the distemper whoever therefore is master of an exact knowledge in the histories of diseases having also due regard to the diagnostics as by our method directed may readily investigate their nature natural philosophy and the history of diseases as we observed before must ever go hand in hand in improving the art of healing it not being possible to make any great use of the latter without some degree of knowledge in the former and the greater our knowledge is in the animal economy the better the nature of diseases will be known  i have always found the keeping close to this method of investigating the nature of diseases of the greatest use to me in the course of my practice for having long since drawn up our method from the most approved authors in physic ancient and modern i have constantly applied it not only to all those histories of diseases which i read in authors whose descriptions of evident causes signs and symptoms are just where the several species of the same disease are judiciously distinguished but also to all those diseases together with their several appearances i have at any time met with among my patients and i am verily persuaded that you gentlemen will likewise reap the same advantage by the use and application of our method if duly attended in your future practice as well to the great relief of your patients as the abundant satisfaction of your own minds  now in order the more strongly to inculcate on your minds this most necessary and useful method of investigating we will here again give it you in a closer manner and in a somewhat different light setting out with an observation of lommius noscere morbum proximus est ad sanitatem gradus nemo sane hanc aut praesagire aut reddere affectis recte potest qui non animadvertere genus aegritudinis quod sit non ejus eventum omnem praenunciare certis indiciis norit  we said before that the symptoms of any disease being given it is nature may be discovered  now the symptoms of every disease are no other than the effects of some cause or some number of causes which pervert and overturn the natural actions of one or more parts for which reason by explaining these symptoms we become apprised of the perverted action or discover the disease for nothing can be the cause of a disease that does not produce the symptoms in which the nature of the disease consists  wherefore the symptoms of any disease being given it is nature may thence be discovered and the nature of a disease being assigned we have also the methods of curing it farther having the nature and causes of any disease we shall be able to determine how far the disease is curable or incurable the probabilities of curing any distemper and the most proper methods of attempting it  now the ancients as we have already observed having accurately described the diagnostic signs or marks of diseases together with their most natural and simple appearances whoever is thoroughly acquainted with the histories as delivered down to us by them and is accurate or well versed in the structure and nature of the fluids and solids of the human body may from their diagnostic signs in particular be able to discover the nature and seat of the disease and the way it is produced by the same means also he will have it in his power to show in what manner the symptoms attending the disease do flow from it is nature thus found out from it is symptoms and likewise be capable of perceiving how those symptoms give way or are cured by changing the distempered condition of the parts affected  in this examination of the nature of the disease from it is symptoms we must be most careful that every casual and foreign symptom be separated from the constant and permanent in the manner the method more at large directs it being easy by observing the rule there laid down to distinguish the constant and inseparable symptoms from those which are merely casual and secondary  the principal symptoms are for the most part casy to be explained the false symptoms are most commonly found among the secondary sort and are the symptoms of symptoms only for which reason they ought to be rejected from the number of symptoms properly belonging to the disease  indications of cure must be drawn from the nature of the disease and not from their precarious and supposed causes nor from their adventitious and casual symptoms and there must run an uninterrupted chain from the diagnostic signs of the disease through it is nature and causes till it ends in a rational and evident method of cure  thus we see that in order to cure any disease the most natural easy and practical way is first to collect the most constant symptoms and effects of the disease but in doing this we must always remember that our utmost diligence will be absolutely necessary rightly to distinguish the symptoms that in our collecting the genuine diagnostic signs of any disease we never suffer the secondary signs or symptoms of symptoms to creep into the number of the genuine diagnostic signs for if we do we shall certainly render our inquiries into the true nature of the disease almost fruitless and impracticable but by strictly observing this caution we shall readily discover the disease and it is symptoms together with the causes of both and if we can come at the nature of the disease we are about to cure there remains no difficulty as to the way of curing be the appearances of the symptoms ever so various or complicated  the direct method of cure being thus obvious the probabilities of success must be as the nature of the distemper we come to cure and the force and efficacy of the medicines we administer respectively and if we already know or can discover by practice the peculiar ways in which the medicines we make use of will act we shall be thereby instructed when one method or any one medicine is most properly administered and why it must be continued or laid aside which is the sum and substance of physic  the materials which compose the method of investigating and finding out the nature of diseases having been only dispersed in several parts of the works of hippocrates celsus and other most approved authors in physic both ancient and modern and having never yet as i know of been thoroughly collected and digested into a regular form as it may to this day be justly supposed one great reason why those excellent hints and admonitions have not always been so duly regarded and attended to as they certainly deserve so was it long ago an incentive to me to throw them together with some care and pains in the method in which i have now delivered them and i have for many years with much satisfaction and success experienced the great benefit and usefulness of so good a monitor in my own practice and i flatter myself it may become equally serviceable to others of my profession if rightly made use of it being the whole business of the physician to find out the distemper and from that to draw the method of cure and to know the power and efficacy of his medicines together with the true and exact manner of timeing and dosing them in each particular disease and its variations  this method therefore of investigating the nature of all diseases being the most natural most rational and certain way of attaining that complete knowledge i think it may not improperly be esteemed the very masterkey to the knowledge of the practice of physic and i imagine if thoroughly understood and then properly applied it will most safely conduct us from the very threshold of physic even to its consummation and that with much greater expedition and success than any other hitherto known method and as it will be of very great service to the beginner so likewise will it continue to be the most useful and necessary companion we can associate withal through the whole course of our practice wherefore that i might make this method familiar to you i have gradually opened it in the beginning of this lecture and have through the whole variously represented it more particularly i have given it you in two different views that i might the more strongly inculcate and impress it on your minds and that nothing may be wanting to it is complete use i shall endeavor in my subsequent lectures not only to make it still more familiar but also as serviceable as possibly may be both to yourselves and patients by illustrating it with frequent examples and the constant application of it to the several disorders we shall hereafter be obliged to treat of by this means gentlemen i hope you will be altogether masters of the right use of our method of investigation and the application of it in all the diseases and the varieties of them you may either meet with in authors or observe in your own future practice  for the rest i shall take care to direct you how to judge of the efficacy and powers of medicines with their peculiar way of acting how to administer each medicine in the most proper dose and most proper time of the disease when it may be necessary to alter entirely change or continue the methods and medicines when and how properly to bleed and apply blisters in the several stages and complications of a distemper i shall besides furnish you with a select materia medica and methodus praescribendi suitable to each disease this introductory knowledge joined to your own necessary diligence and constant attention will i apprehend most effectually qualify you to practice with success in every disorder we shall have occasion to lay before you in this part of our course  finis
