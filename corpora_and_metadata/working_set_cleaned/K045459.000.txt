glide along my bakers well  oh words of sweet delight now now my muse soar up the olympic height what wondrous numbers can the goddess find to paint the extatic raptures of my mind i leave it to a goddess more divine the beauteous h  l  d shall employ my line to the beauteous miss h  l  d far distant from brittannias lofty isle what shall i find to make the genius smile the bubbling fountains lose the power to please the rocky cataracts the shady trees the juicy fruitage of enchanting hue whose luscious virtues england never knew the variegated daughters of the land whose numbers flora strows with bounteous hand the verdant vesture of the smiling fields all the rich pleasures natures storehouse yields have all their powers to wake the chorded string but still they are subjects that the muse can sing h  l  d more beauteous than the god of day her name can quicken and awake the lay rouse the soft muse from indolence and ease to live to love and rouse her powers to please in vain would phoebus did not h  l  d rise it is her bright eyes that gilds the eastern skies it is she alone deprives us of the light and when she slumbers then indeed it is night to tell the separate

compleatest work that nature made thou art my substance and i am thy shade possessed of thee i joyfully would go through the loud tempest and the depth of woe from thee alone my being i derive one beauteous smile from thee makes all my hopes alive to miss h  l  d      since short the busy scene of life will prove let us my h  l  d learn to live and love to love with passions pure as morning light whose saffron beams unsullied by the night with rosy mantles do the heavens streak faint imitators of my h  l  ds cheek the joys of nature in her ruined state have little pleasure though the pains are great virtue and love when sacred bands unite it is then that nature leads to true delight often as i wander through the myrtle grove bearing the beauteous burden of my love a secret terror lest i should offend the charming maid on whom my joys depend informs my soul that virtuous minds alone can give a pleasure to the vile unknown but when the body charming and the mind to every virtuous christian act inclined meet in one person maid and angel join who must it be but h  l  d the divine what worth intrinsic will that man possess whom the dear charmer condescends to bless swift will the minutes roll the flying hours and blessings overtake the pair by showers each moment will improve upon the past and every day be better than the last love means an unadulterated flame though lust too often usurps the sacred name such passion as in h  l  ds breast can move it is that alone deserves the name of love oh was my merit great enough to find a favored station in my h  l  ds mind then would my happiness be quite complete and all revolving joys as in a center meet to miss h  l  d      tell me god of soft desires little cupid wanton boy how thou kindlest up thy fires giving pleasing pain and joy h  l  ds beauty is thy bow striking glances are thy darts making conquests never slow ever gaining conquered hearts heaven is seated in her smile junos in her portly air not britanias favorite isle can produce a nymph so fair in a desert vast and drear where disorder springs around if the lovely fair is there it is a pleasuregiving ground oh my h  l  d blessed with thee i would the raging storm defy in thy smiles i live am free when thou frownest i must die to miss h  l  d      with a present accept fair nymph this token of my love nor look disdainful on the prostrate swain by every sacred oath i will constant prove and act as worthy for to wear your chain not with more constant ardour shall the sun chase the faint shadows of the night away nor shall he on his course more constant run and cheer the universe with coming day than i in pleasing chains of conquest bound adore the charming author of my smart  for ever will i thy sweet charms resound and paint

adore in country city and at court epistle to the reverend mr catcott december   th      what strange infatuations rule mankind how narrow are our prospects how confined with universal vanity possessed we fondly think our own ideas best our tottering arguments are ever strong we are always selfsufficient in the wrong what philosophic sage of pride austere can lend conviction an attentive ear what pattern of humility and truth can bear the jeering ridicule of youth what blushing author ever ranked his muse with fowlers poetlaureat of the stews dull penny nodding over his wooden lyre conceits the vapors of geneva fire all in the language of apostles cry if angels contradict me angels lie as all have intervals of ease and pain so all have intervals of being vain but some of folly never shift the scene or let one lucid moment intervene dull single acts of manyfooted prose their tragicomedys of life compose incessant madding for a system toy the greatest of creations blessings cloy their senses dosing a continual dream they hang enraptured over the hideous scheme so virgins tottering into ripe three score their greatest likeness in baboons adore when you advance new systems first unfold the various imperfections of the old prove nature hitherto a gloomy night you the first focus of primaeval light it is not enough you think your system true the busy world would have you prove it too then rising on the ruins of the rest plainly demonstrate your ideas best many are best one only can be right though all had inspiration to indite some this unwelcome truth perhaps would tell where clogher stumbled catcott fairly fell writers on rolls of science long renowned in one fell page are tumbled to the ground we see their systems unconfuted still but catcott can confute them  if he will would you the honor of a priest mistrust an excommunication proves him just could catcott from his better sense be drawn to bow the knee to baals sacred lawn a mitred rascal to his longeard flocks gives ill example to his wh  s the px yet we must reverence sacerdotal black and saddle all his faults on natures back but hold there is solid reason to revere his lordship has six thousand pounds a year in gaming solitude he spends the nights he fasts at arthurs and he prays at whites rolls over the pavement with his swisstaild six at whites the athanasian creed for tricks whilst the poor curate in his rusty gown trudges unnoticd through the dirty town if god made order order never made these nice distinctions in the preaching trade the servants of the devil are revered and bishops pull the fathers by the beard yet in these horrid forms salvation lives these are religions representatives yet to these idols must we bow the knee  excuse me broughton when i bow to thee but sure religion can produce at least one minister of god  one honest priest search nature over procure me if you can the fancied character an honest man a man of sense not honest by constraint for fools are canvass living but in paint to mammon or to superstition slaves all orders of mankind are fools or knaves in the first attribute by none surpast tailor endeavors to obtain the last imagination may be too confined few see too far how many are half blind how are your feeble arguments perplexed to find out meaning in a senseless text you rack each metaphor upon the wheel and words can philosophic truths conceal what paracelsus humord as a jest you realize to prove your system best might we not catcott then infer from hence your zeal for scripture has devoured your sense apply the glass of reason to your sight see nature marshal oozy atoms right think for yourself for all mankind are free we need not inspiration how to see if scripture contradictory you find be orthodox and own your senses blind how blinded are their optics who aver what inspiration dictates cannot err whence is this boasted inspiration sent which makes us utter truths we never meant which couches systems in a single word at once depraved abstruse sublime absurd what moses tells us might perhaps be true as he was learned in all the egyptians knew but to assert that inspirations given the copy of philosophy in heaven strikes at religions root and fairly fells the awful terrors of ten thousand hells attentive search the scriptures and you will find what vulgar errors are with truths combined your tortured truths which moses seemed to know he could not unto inspiration owe for if from god one error you admit how dubious is the rest of holy writ what knotty difficultys fancy solves the heavens irradiate and the earth revolves but here imagination is allowed to clear this voucher from its mantling cloud from the same word we different meanings quote as david wears a many colored coat o inspiration ever hid in night reflecting various each adjacent light if moses caught thee in the parted flood if david found thee in a sea of blood if mahomet with slaughter drenched thy soil on loaded asses bearing off thy spoil if thou have favored pagan turk or jew say had not broughton inspiration too such rank absurdities debase his line i almost could have sworn he copied thine confute with candor where you can confute reason and arrogance but poorly suit yourself may fall before some abler pen infallibility is not for men with modest diffidence new schemes indite be not too positive though in the right what man of sense would value vulgar praise or rise on pennys prose or duller lays though pointed fingers mark the man of fame and literary grocers chaunt your name though in each tailors bookcase catcott shines with ornamental flowers and gilded lines though youthful ladies who by instinct scan the natural philosophy of man can every reason of your work repeat as sands in africa retain the heat yet check your flowing pride will all allow to wreathe the labored laurel round your brow some may with seeming arguments dispense tickling your vanity to wound your sense but clayfield censures and demonstrates too your theory is certainly untrue on reason and newtonian rules he proves how distant your machine from either moves but my objections may be reckoned weak as nothing but my mother tongue i speak else would i ask by what immortal power all nature was dissolved as in an hour how when the earth acquired a solid state and rising mountains saw the waves abate each particle of matter sought its kind all in a strata regular combined when instantaneously the liquid heap hardened to rocks the barriers of the deep why did not earth unite a stony mass since stony filaments through all must pass if on the wings of air the planets run why are they not impelled into the sun philosophy nay common sense will prove all passives with their active agents move if the diurnal motion of the air revolves the planets in their destined sphere how are the secondary orbs impelled how are the moons from falling headlong held twas the eternals fiat you reply and who will give eternity the lie i own the awful truth that god made all and by his fiat worlds and systems fall but study nature not an atom there will unassisted by her powers appear the fiat without agents is at best for priestcraft or for ignorance a vest some fancy god is what we nature call being itself material all in all the fragments of the deity we own is vulgarly as various matter known no agents could assist creations birth we trample on our god for god is earth it is past the power of language to confute this latitudinary attribute how lofty must imagination soar to reach absurdities unknown before thanks to thy pinions broughton thou have brought from the moons orb a novelty of thought restrain o muse thy unaccomplishd lines fling not thy saucy satire at divines this single truth thy brother bards must tell thou have one excellence of railing well but disputations are befitting those who settle hebrew points and scold in prose o learning where are all thy fancied joys thy empty pleasures and thy solemn toys proud of thy own importance though we see we have little reason to be proud of thee thou putrid foetus of a barren brain thou offspring illegitimate of pain tell me sententious mortals tell me whence you claim the preference to men of sense  wants learning see the lettered throng banter his english in a latin song oxonian sages hesitate to speak their native language but declaim in greek if in his jests a discord should appear a dull lampoon is innocently clear ye classic dunces selfsufficient fools is this the boasted justice of your schools  has parts parts which would set aside the labored acquisitions of your pride uncultivated now his genius lies instruction sees his latent beauties rise his gold is bullion yours debased with brass impressed with follys head to make it pass but  swears so loud so indiscreet his thunders rattle through the listening street ye rigid christians formally severe blind to his charities his oaths you hear observe his virtues calumny must own a noble soul is in his actions shown though dark this bright original you paint i would rather be a  than a saint excuse me catcott if from you i stray the muse will go where merit leads the way the owls of learning may admire the night but  shines with reasons glowing light still admonition presses to my pen the infant muse would give advice to men but what avails it since the man i blame owns no superior in the paths of fame in springs in mountains stratas mines and rocks catcott is every notion orthodox if to think otherwise you claim pretense which is the true reading is uncertain both being in his own handwriting and uncancelled renounce detested heretic in sense which is the true reading is uncertain both being in his own handwriting and uncancelled youre a detested heretic in sense but oh how lofty your ideas roar in showing wondering cits the fossile store the ladies are quite ravished as he tells the short adventures of the pretty shells miss biddy sickens to indulge her touch madam more prudent thinks twould seem too much the doors fly open instantly he draws the sparry lood and wonders of applause the full dressed lady sees with envying eye the sparkle of her dimond pendants die sage natural philosophers adore the fossil whimsys of the numerous store but see the purple stream begins to play to show how fountains climb the hilly way hark what a murmur echoes through the throng gods that the pretty trifle should be wrong experience in the voice of reason tells above its surface water never swells where is the priestly soul of catcott now see what a triumph sits upon his brow and can the poor applause of things like these whose souls and sentiments are all disease raise little triumphs in a man like you catcott the foremost of the judging few so at llewellins your great brother sits the laughter of his tributary wits ruling the noisy multitude with ease empties his pint and sputters his decrees dec  0th      mr catcott will be pleased to observe that i admire many things in his learned remarks this poem is an innocent effort of poetical vengeance as mr catcott has done me the honor to criticize my trifles i have taken great poetical liberties and what i dislike in verse possibly deserves my approbation in the plain prose of truth  the many admirers of mr catcott may on perusal of this rank me as an enemy but i am indifferent in all things i value neither the praise or censure of the multitude  sentiment      since we can die but once what matters it if rope or garter poison pistol sword slowwasting sickness or the sudden burst of valve arterial in the noble parts curtail the miseries of human life though varied is the cause the effects the same all to one common dissolution tends the defense dec   th      no more dear smith the hackneyd tale renew i own their censure i approve it too for how can idiots destitute of thought conceive or estimate but as they are taught say can the satirizing pen of shears exalt his name or mutilate his ears none but a lawrence can adore his lays who in a quart of claret drinks his praise t  l  r repeats what catcott told before but lying t  l  r is believed no more if in myself i think my notions just the church and all her arguments are dust religions but opinions bastard son a perfect mystery more than three in one it is fancy all distempers of the mind as education taught us we are inclined happy the man whose reason bids him see mankind are by the state of nature free who thinking for himself despises those that would upon his better sense impose is to himself the minister of god nor dreads the path where athanasius trod happy if mortals can be is the man who not by priest but reason rules his span reason to its possessor a sure guide reason a thorn in revelations side if reason fails incapable to tread through gloomy revelations thickning bed on what authority the church we own how shall we worship deities unknown can the eternal justice pleased receive the prayers of those who ignorant believe search the thick multitudes of every sect the church supreme with whitfields new elect no individual can their god define no not great penny in his nervous line but why must chatterton selected sit the butt of every critics little wit am i alone for ever in a crime nonsense in prose or blasphemy in rhyme all monosyllables a line appears is it not very often so in shears see generous eccas lengthening out my praise inrapturd with the music of my lays in all the arts of panegyric graced the cream of modern literary taste why to be sure the metaphoric line has something sentimental tender fine but then how hobbling are the other two there are some beauties but they are very few besides the author faith it is something odd commends a reverential awe of god read but another fancy of his brain he is atheistical in every strain fallacious is the charge it is all a lie as to my reason i can testify i own a god immortal boundless wise who bid our glories of creation rise who formed his varied likeness in mankind centring his many wonders in the mind who saw religion a fantastic night but gave us reason to obtain the light indulgent whitfield scruples not to say he only can direct to heavens highway while bishops with as much vehemence tell both in the authors handwriting and uncancelled sects heterodox are food for hell both in the authors handwriting and uncancelled all sorts heterodox are food for hell why then dear smith since doctors disagree their notions are not oracles to me what i think right i ever will pursue and leave you liberty to do so too song to mr g catcott        ah blame me not catcott if from the right way my notions and actions run far how can my ideas do other but stray deprived of the ruling north star   ah blame me not broderip if mounted aloft i chatter and spoil the dull air how can i imagine thy foppery soft when discords the voice of my fair   if turner remitted my bluster and rhymes if harding was girlish and cold if never an ogle was met from miss grimes if flavia was blasted and old   i chose without liking and left without pain nor welcomed the frown with a sigh i scorned like a monkey to dangle my chain and paint them new charms with a lie   once cotton was handsome i flamed and i burned i died to obtain the bright queen but when i beheld my epistle returned by jesu it altered the scene   she is damnable ugly my vanity cried you lie says my conscience you lie resolving to follow the dictates of pride i would view her a hag to my eye   but should she regain her bright luster again and shine in her natural charms it is but to accept of the works of my pen and permit me to use my own arms  oroe upon his courser fleet who swift as

receivying a garland from alices hand the sayrest lady in the land sir pigotte this viewed and furious did stand tormented in mind and bodily pain sir botelier crowned most galantlie stood as some

falling waters of the lough that tumble headlonge from the mountains browe even so they met in drierie sound de bretville fell upon the ground the blood from inward bruised wound did out his stained helmet flow as some tall bark upon the foamie main so lay de bretville on the plain sir john of the dale or compton hight advanced next in lists of fight he knew the tricks of tourneying full well in
