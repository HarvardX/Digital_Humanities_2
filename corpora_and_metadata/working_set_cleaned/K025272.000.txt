a sermon preached in lambethchapel at the consecration of the right reverend father in god john lord bishop of bangor on sunday jan  th   0    by william hayley dd dean of chichester  london printed for jacob tonson within graysinngate next graysinnlane   0   a sermon preached at the consecration of john lord bishop of bangor ephesians iv       and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers  for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ these words contain the substance of the apostles design both in this chapter and in his more copious discourse upon the same subject in the   th and   th chapters of his first epistle to the corinthians in which places he gives us an account of the government instituted in the church of christ the diversity of its officers and their gifts and powers the author of the institution and the spring of their commission together with the great end and purpose for which this wise administration was contrived and established things of the highest importance and very pertinent to the present occasion and therefore i shall as far as the time allotted for my discourse will permit take notice of these several things under the several parts of my text and then conclude with such observations as naturally flow from this doctrine i here is an account of the several orders entrusted with the government of the church some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers ii the apostle here tells us who was the author of this establishment he gave even our lord jesus christ himself who descended into the grave the lower parts of the earth and then ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things v    0 iii we are here instructed in the end and design of this dispensation and are made acquainted that all this was done for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ   i i begin with the first the several orders etc where it may be needful   to show that there was a disparity in these orders as to their office and a subordination in their ministry   to consider what they were wherein they differed and what were the peculiar employments and powers of each office and   to reflect upon the goodness and providence of god by which they have all been continued down to the present time and established in this our church    that there was a subordination in the office of the several orders in the christian church now this appears from st pauls reasoning and allusions both here and in the other epistle to the corinthians at the  th verse of this chapter he tells the ephesians that the church of christ is one body that there is one spirit one lord one faith one baptism and one god and father of all and yet he adds at the  th verse but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ i e agreeably to the true meaning of the original word  in this and other places to every one of us is given his office or employment in the church different according to the different gifts which it has pleased our lord to bestow upon us  and this he exemplifies in the following verse by representing our savior distributing these gifts as conquerors used to do when they made triumphal entries into their capital cities after some notable victories over their enemies when we know it was usual to disperse among the people medals of different bigness and different metal and other gifts some of greater and some of lesser price thus our lord jesus when he had conquered satan and sin and hell and death and made his triumphant entry into heaven distributed the different gifts of his holy spirit in such kinds and such proportions as the persons and offices required to which they were conveyed v   wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men some apostles some prophets etc  but least the subordination of the different orders should not sufficiently appear from this disparity of their gifts our apostle renders it yet more evident   cor    by comparing them to the several parts of the body of man where he not only tells us at the   v etc that there are diversities of gifts differences of administrations and diversities of operations but that these have a relation to and a dependence upon one another as the head and hands and feet have in mans body v    for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ that is in his body the church now we know in our bodies the head and hands and feet etc are not only different but subordinate the feet must walk by the direction of the eye and the hands act at the command of the head otherwise the actions will be disorderly and the whole body must suffer and if there be not the like regard in the inferior officers in the church toward the superior but all affect to direct them selves and to be the head there can be nothing else but schism and confusion in it for if all will be one member where then is the body v     i shall crave leave only to add to this head that this subordination of ministers in the church of christ is agreeable to what was practiced both under the law of nature and that of moses i need not take notice of the heathen world who were left to bare reason in this matter among whom we every where find a distinction of dignity in the orders of their priests the thing being evident among the worshippers of the true god who were not without some light of revelation even under the law of nature long before the mosaical dispensation abraham himself paid tithes to melchizedec and was blessed by him and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the greater as the author to the heb argues c   v   the priesthood was a natural right of primogeniture at first and god by a particular command ordered the firstborn to be sanctified to his service and it is no question but these are the priests which we read of before the giving of the law exodus          the lord said unto moses go down charge the people least they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves least the lord break forth among them and yet these first born thus honored with the priesthood were subject to the heads of their families and commanded by them thus moses and under him the twelve heads of tribes and the seventy fathers of families governed the church till it pleased god to take to himself the tribe of levi instead of the firstborn and then the high priest priests and levites ministerd in the service of god in an undeniable subordination from all which i think it is very plain that a coordinate ministry or a parity among all such as are employed about holy things is a scheme that never was found in any nation or age of the world it was never either commanded of god or invented by men till the confusions of late times brought it forth and let the enemies of our church have the honor of it    the subordination of these offices being established we are now to consider what they were wherein they differed and what were the peculiar employments and powers of each office now in order to find out this we must compare the catalogue of them in this place with the other in   cor       here it is he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers there it is thus god has set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after which no more orders are named but only those powers that attended them in their work miracles gifts of healing etc and at v    the apostle asks are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers and without enquiring after more orders asks only of the exercise of such powers as are before mentioned are all workers of miracles have all the gift of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret whence it seems very reasonable to infer that apostles prophets and evangelists in the one place must be the same with apostles prophets and teachers in the other and that pastors and teachers which are added over and above in my text must not be different officers from those before named but other words for the same officers relating to the different manner of receiving their commission or the different parts of their employments and therefore it is the judgment of very learned men that prophets and evangelists and prophets and teachers are the very same ministers with pastors and teachers with this only difference that the former were such as out of the first fruits of the believers were set apart and consecrated to their office by the manifestation of the spirit or by a supernatural effusion of gifts proper to their employments the latter were such as were ordained and constituted by imposition of hands as stated governors of the churches allotted to their charge however this be it is plain that evangelists in the one place are called teachers in the other from their teaching and instructing their converts and it seems as reasonable that christian prophets may be called pastors from their feeding and governing their flocks so that whether these are different names for the very same persons or whether they signify the same office but with this difference that the one respects it as given immediately by the holy ghost and the other by the imposition of the hands of the apostles the result will be the same that there are only three orders properly here intended and that it is of their office and employments that we are to enquire  and i the rather incline to this conclusion because it is agreeable to the promise and prediction of our savior himself while he was upon earth mat       behold i send to you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify etc where there are only these three orders promised the second of which though here first placed are called by the same name as in the text prophets the apostles are called wise men agreeably to their distinguishing gift which we shall see by and by was the word of wisdom and therefore st luke who was st pauls evangelist calls them by the same name which st paul himself gives them that of apostles c    v    therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them shall they slay and persecute etc and for the third sort our savior calls them scribes from the nature of their office for the office of the scribes was to teach the law and for this reason they are in the gospels frequently called by the name of doctors or teachers of the law so that evangelists or teachers under the gospel whose office was parallel to theirs might very properly bear the same name for to teach and preach the gospel teaching and preaching jesus christ are the same things in scripture luke  0   acts      thus our savior built the christian church upon the model of the jewish and in condescension to that people and in pursuanee of the types that preceded was pleased as it were to copy their high priest priests and levites in the orders of the ministry which he established under the gospel  we are then in the next place to consider the different employments of these three orders and the different powers that enabled them to discharge the same and because the higher always included the lower it may not be amiss to begin with the lowest first and so to ascend to what was peculiar to the rest    the evangelists or teachers their business was properly to preach the gospel to unbelievers to convince them of its truth by working miracles and to baptize them upon their conversion an account of which we have in the   th c of the acts where we are taught that the apostles remaining at jerusalem the rest were dispersed into judea and samaria preaching the word and that particularly philip who was one of the seven deacons and is called the evangelist went down to samaria and preached christ to them v   and that notwithstanding the opposition of simon the sorcerer they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ beholding the miracles and signs which were done and were baptized both men and women v       the prophets besides this were to preside in the assemblies of the faithful to perform divine offices administer the lords supper and instruct their flocks in the scriptures and in the fuller knowledge of the truths of the gospel and of this st paul gives us a large account in the    c o   cor where he exhorts them to desire the gift of prophecy rather than that of tongues showing that tongues were a sign to them that believe not but prophesying serves not for them that believe not but for them that believe v    and he ocasionally mentions all the parts of the christian prophets office in that chapter his preaching v   he that prophesies speaks unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort his praying and singing praises v    i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and sing with the understanding also which praying and singing are likewise in the old testament called prophesying   kin         samuel  0     chr      and last of all his celebrating of the eucharist v    which is there called blessing and giving of thanks  by all which he shows that the prophets office was peculiarly directed to the edification of believers and for this reason he tells them v   he that speaks in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesies edifieth the church    the apostles besides all this had the supreme care of all the churches upon them they were to give orders and rules for their establishment to confirm converts ordain church officers and govern and direct them when ordained and by this means to preserve that peace and order which became the church of christ thus we find in the forementioned  th of the acts v    that when the apostles had heard that samaria had received the word of god by philip the evangelist they sent unto them peter and john the apostles who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost that is the powers and gifts of the holy ghost which fitted them for the several parts of the ministry for so we see it acts      when paul hah laid his hands upon those converts at ephesus the holy ghost came upon them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied i e had the power of miracles and particularly that of tongues given them to convert unbelievers and that of prophecy to direct the faithful and besides this we find the same apostle c       going over the several churches confirming the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith ordaining them elders or church officers in every church and then commending them to the lord on whom they believed  such was the subordination of officers in the church of christ and it pleased our lord to accommodate his gifts to the nature of their several employments and these we have likewise laid down   cor      etc to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit where the gifts of wisdom knowledge and faith answer to the three sorts of ministers v       apostles prophets and teachers    by faith the gift of evangelists or teachers is meant the faith of miracles according to what our savior says to his disciples mark       have faith in god for verily i say unto you whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says and from this stephen is said acts     to be full of faith and power and to do great wonders and miracles among the people and that this is the faith here mentioned is evident from what follows which is an enumeration of some of the great powers of this faith to one the gifts of healing to another the working of miracles  properly the casting out devils to another prophecy or foretelling things to come to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues all supernatural powers for the convincing of unbelievers and necessary for the first preachers of christianity who were unlearned and plain men and therefore preached christ not by the strength of human eloquence and persuasion but by the testimony of miracles and the demonstration of the power of god    by knowledge the gift of christian prophets seems to be meant the understanding of the scripture and the mysteries of the gospel how they were foretold in the prophecies of old and how accomplished in our savior jesus and therefore st paul joins these things together   cor      though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have no charity i am nothing and this gift also was a necessary qualification for those who were to instruct believers and preach to the assemblies of persons converted whose knowledge was to be improved whose faith was to be confirmed and whose growth in the understanding of the gospel was to be promoted by these laborers in the vineyard of christ    but the principal gift was that of wisdom communicated to the apostles the supreme governors of the christian church to support them in the greatest and most difficult task that of government wisdom to direct even the preachers and prophets themselves in their several functions to contrive the most proper methods for the planting of christianity and the most prudent rules for the nourishing and preserving it and to find out the fittest instruments for both wisdom to instruct them when to bear with patience when to condescend with meekness and when to resist with courage and punish with vigor a gift infinitely beyond any of the rest here mentioned though not appearing in the same pomp with the miraculous operations of the spirit which the corinthians were for that reason too fond of without this the preachers might have been unruly the prophets disorderly and the zealous themselves indiscreet and therefore it pleased the wisdom of god to consult the strength and order and peace of his church by placing therein an authority that might preside over the subordinate officers in it that might direct the imprudent restrain the disorderly encourage the laborious and take care that all things might be done in that order and decency which becomes the body of christ    thus does the wisdom of god appear in settling the economy of his church but we must in the third place adore his goodness in having preserved this excellent order to us however unworthy of so great a blessing we have thanks be to the divine providence not only our priests and deacons answerable to the prophets and evangelists in my text but we have the apostolical authority derived to us by a continued succession of our bishops from the apostles themselves such as these the scripture tells us the apostles committed their authority to such have all ages of the church acknowledged for the successors of the apostles and it has been by the care and conduct of such that heresies have been conquered schisms prevented or repaired and the purity of the christian faith and discipline handed down to our present times and therefore we have a great deal of reason to be thankful to almighty god that among all the confusions of this latter age he has been pleased to preserve to us this inestimable advantage  nor ought we to overlook the grace and mercy of god who in these times of difficulty has been pleased to give to the present governors of our poor church so plentiful an effusion of that spirit of wisdom which attended the apostles their predecessors and who constantly directs them in supplying the places of those whom their lord calls away from their labors with persons distinguished with the visible characters of the same spirit with that wisdom which is from above first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and may god every day make us more sensible of the greatness of this blessing more fruitful under it and more thankful for it that he may be prevailed upon to continue it down to our posterity and to preserve his own institution to the end of the world and this leads me to my second general where i am to enquire after  ii the author of this establishment and in this i need be but very short since he appears so visible in the discourse of our apostle in both the places i have mentioned it is our lord jesus whom he declares to be the original of these orders and it is to his holy spirit that he tells us the church is indebted for those several gifts that accompany them v     of this chapter to every one of us is given grace or office according to the measure of the gift of christ when he led captivity captive he gave gifts unto men by christ the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by these several joints v    and   cor      there are diversities of operations but the same lord and god has set some in the church first apostles secondly prophets etc v    and he adds that their gifts are the manifestation of the spirit that though there be diversities of them yet they all proceed from that one spirit and that all these works that one and the same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will v    so that whatever men may say out of an itch of novelty or out of a design to weaken or abolish the establishment to prove this order to have been the effect of choice and the result of human deliberation must all vanish before the clear light of the word of god and we must see the divine original of our church government in spite of all the labor that is taken to reduce it to the inventions of men our lord himself has raised his spiritual temple according to his own method and his church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and christian prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone  iii we must therefore hasten to the third thing to be considered the end and design of this dispensation in these words for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ  now here are three excellent ends of this order to which we must briefly give a distinct consideration    the first is the perfecting of the saints or the uniting the several members of christs church to one another and to himself their head that by the ministry of the different parts his grace and spirit might be orderly conveyed to the whole body for its spiritual improvement and perfection for so it follows v    till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and this is consonant to what the apostle says upon the same occasion   cor       all this was done that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one of another    the second end is the work of the ministry that it might be regular and decent and successful to that great end for which it was ordained that all who are employed in it might be confined to their proper posts and proper work and not obstruct the progress of the gospel by wandering out of their due ranks and stations that the feet might not affect the work or place of the hands and neither of them that of the head but that they might remember that it is god who has set the members every one in the body as it has pleased him and that if they were all one member there would be no body   cor       it is in pursuance of this that st paul c    commands that all things in the christian assemblies be done decently and in order and that the prophets themselves observe the rules prescribed them telling them v    that the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints    the third end is what follows from the blessing of god upon the work of the ministry and that is the edifying of the body of of christ the confirming believers in a sound faith and a holy life the former st paul instances in at the   th v that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive and the latter at v    this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds and he joins both together at v    but speaking the truth in love ye may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ  thus have we considered the different orders of the ministry the author of the institution and the usefulness of it to the church of christ suffer me now to draw two or three conclusions from what has been said which i shall do very briefly and so conclude    is the manifestation of the spirit given to every man to profit withal were these orders instituted not to gratify the vanity or ambition of the persons employed but to serve and feed the flock of christ then all those that are called to any holy function must remember that they are called to be watchful and diligent to deny themselves and to guide others to labor hard to bear much and to apply their whole thoughts to acquit themselves to their great master and to carry on the salvation of those souls which he has purchased with his own blood and whoever shall through pride or sloth or unconcern neglect this work of the lord or do it deceitfully he betrays a sacred trust abuses his talents and will one day receive the bitter sentence of the unprofitable servant    is god the author of this institution and is the church edified by the work of its pastors then are they that labor in the word and doctrine entitled to a double honor both for the dignity of their commission and the benefit that arises from their service and therefore their persons ought to be respected their necessities supplied and their endeavors promoted by those that are committed to their charge and they should be esteemed very highly in love both for their masters and their works sake and if there be any so bold as to despise their office or to contemn or profane the sacred functions in which they serve he must remember that he affronts god that sent them and injures the church of christ for whose good they were sent and must hereafter be accountable for both at the tribunal of our lord    lastly did our savior institute and has he preserved in his church such a subordination of ministers as we have described and for such excellent ends men ought then to be very careful of breaking in upon this establishment both as they tender the honor of our savior and the good of his church sure it must be bold to pretend to alter by human authority or for reasons of our own what was settled by the authority of our lord for reasons of such weight as the perfecting of the saints the work of the ministry and the edifying of the body of christ nor can it well be imagined that they are true friends to the edification of christs body to purity of doctrine or holiness of life or the unity of the church who would innovate in these things and alter that form of church government which the wisdom of christ our head established for this end for the beauty and order of his body and for the happiness of its members may we therefore be truly thankful to god for the preservation of this primitive government may we be zealous for it is honor and support and continuance and above all may the persons employed in it be a grace and ornament to their function may the piety and wisdom of our fathers and the labors and order of their clergy make the ministry of the church of england a pattern for the governors and pastors of all other churches and may god give a visible blessing to their endeavors in rendering their flocks discernable from the rest of the christian world in purity of faith rectitude of manners and union of hearts that so imitating the apostolical churches in doctrine practice and discipline we may be an exemplary part of the church militant in this world and a glorious part of the church triumphant in a future  amen finis
