the stage our generals now   retired to their estates hang their old trophies over the garden gates in lifes cool evening satiate of applause nor   fond of bleeding even in brs cause   a voice there is that whispers in my ear it is reasons voice which sometimes one can hear  friend pope be prudent let your  muse take breath  and never gallop pegasus to death  lest stiff and stately void of fire and force  you limp like blackmore on a lord mayors horse farewell then   verse and love and every toy the rhymes and rattles of the man or boy what   right what true what fit we justly call let this be all my carefor this is all to lay this  0 harvest up and hoard with haste what every day will want and most the last but ask not to what    doctors i apply sworn to no master of no sect am i as drives the    storm at any door i knock and house with montagne now or now with lock sometimes a    patriot active in debate mix with the world and battle for the state free as young lyttleton her cause pursue still true to virtue    and as warm as true sometimes with aristippus or st paul indulge my candor and grow all to all back to my    native moderation slide and win my way by yielding to the tide    long as to him who works for debt the day long as the night to her whose loves away long as the years dull circle seems to run when the brisk minor pants for twentyone so slow the    unprofitable moments roll that lock up all the functions of my soul that keep me from myself and still delay lifes instant business to a future day that    task which as we follow or despise the eldest is a fool the youngest wise which done the poorest can no wants endure and which not done the richest must be poor    late as it is i put my self to school and feel some  0 comfort not to be a fool    weak though i am of limb and short of sight far from a lynx and not a giant quite i will do what mead and cheselden advise to keep these limbs and to preserve these eyes not to    go back is somewhat to advance and men must walk at least before they dance say does thy    blood rebel thy bosom move with wretched avarice or as wretched love know there are words and spells which can control

wife or vassal to a punk a switz a high dutch or a low dutch    bear  all that we ask is but a patient ear    it is the first virtue vices to abhor and the first wisdom to be fool no more but to the world no  0 bugbear is so great as want of figure and a small estate to either india see the merchant fly scared at the spectre of pale poverty see him with pains of body pangs of soul burn through the tropic freeze beneath the pole will thou do nothing for a nobler end nothing to make philosophy thy friend to stop thy foolish views thy long desires and    ease thy heart of all that it admires here wisdom calls    seek virtue first be bold  as gold to silver virtue is to gold there londons voice    get money money still  and then let virtue follow if she will this this the saving doctrine preached to all from    low st jamess up to high st paul from him whose    quills stand quiverd at his ear to him who notches sticks at westminster barnard in    spirit sense and truth abounds  pray then what wants he fourscore thousand pounds a pension or such harness for a slave as bug now has and bestia fain would have barnard thou art a    cit with all thy worth bestia and bug their honors and so forth yet every    child another song will sing  virtue brave boys it is virtue makes a king true conscious honor is to feel no sin he is armed without that is innocent within be this thy  0 screen and this thy wall of brass compared to this a ministers an ass    and say to which shall our applause belong this new court jargon or the good old song the modern language of corrupted peers or what was spoke at    cressy and poitiers    who counsels best who whispers be but great  with praise or infamy leave that to fate  get place and wealth if possible with grace  if not by any means get wealth and place for what to have a    box where eunuchs sing and foremost in the circle eye a king or    he who bids thee face with steady view proud fortune and look shallow greatness through and    while he bids thee sets the example too if    such a doctrine in st jamess air should chance to make the welldrest rabble stare if honest s take scandal at a spark that less admires the    palace than the park faith i shall give the answer    reynard gave  i cannot like dread sir your royal cave  because i see by all the tracks about  full many a beast goes in but none comes out adieu to virtue if youre once a slave send her to court you send her to her grave well if a kings a lion at the least the  0 people are a manyheaded beast can they direct what measures to pursue who know themselves so little what to do alike in nothing but one lust of gold just half the land would buy and half be sold their    countrys wealth our mightier misers drain or cross to plunder provinces the main the rest some farm the poorbox some the pews some keep assemblies and would keep the stews some    with fat bucks on childless dotards fawn some win rich widows by their chine and brawn while with the silent growth of ten per cent in dirt and darkness    hundreds stink content of all these ways if each    pursues his own satire be kind and let the wretch alone but show me one who has it in his power to act consistent with himself an hour sir job    sailed forth the evening bright and still  no place on earth he cried like greenwich hill    up starts a palace lo the obedient base slopes at its foot the woods its sides embrace the silver thames reflects its marble face now let some whimzy or that    devilish within which guides all those who know not what they mean but give the knight or give his lady spleen  away away take all your scaffolds down  for snugs the word my dear well live in town at amorous flavio is the    stocking thrown that very night he longs to lie alone    the fool whose wife elopes some thrice a quarter for matrimonial solace dies a martyr did ever  0 proteus merlin any witch transform themselves so strangely as the rich  well but the    poor  the poor have the same itch they change their    weekly barber weekly news prefer a new japanner to their shoes discharge their    garrets move their beds and run they know not whither in a chaise and one they    hire their sculler and when once aboard grow sick and damn the climate  like a lord    you laugh half beau half sloven if i stand my wig all powder and all snuff my band you laugh if coat and breeches strangely vary white gloves and linen worthy lady mary but when    no prelates lawn with hairshirt lined is half so incoherent as my mind when each opinion with the next at strife one    ebb and flow of follies all my life i    plant root up i build and then confound turn round to square and square again to round    you never change one muscle of your face you think this madness but a common case nor  0 once to chancry nor to the doctor of bedlam hales apply yet hang your lip to see a seam awry careless how ill i with myself agree kind to my dress my figure not to me is this my    guide philosopher and friend this he who loves me and who ought to mend who ought to make me what he can or none that man divine whom wisdom calls her own great without title without fortune blessed rich    even when plundered    honored while oppressed loved    without youth and followed without power at home though exiled    free though in the tower in short that reasoning high immortal thing just    less than
