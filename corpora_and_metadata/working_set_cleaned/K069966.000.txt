occasional observations on the civillist revenue  price sixpence  occasional observations on a doubletitledpaper about the clear produce of the civillist revenue from midsummer      to midsummer last  london printed and sold by m cooper at the globe in paternoster row m dcc lxi  occasional observations etc there is nothing so difficult as writing on a subject laid before you in vague terms which have a doubledesignd meaning ambiguities must arise and therefore must be excused  i shall first consider the paper i am to treat of under its title of the account of the clear produce in every year that is of what is paid in of the civillist in every year on or before the very midsummerday on which it was due  this account was humbly presented to parliament without any one voucher from the offices of revenue and is the first instance of the kind some sort of vouchers for appearance at least having been always produced on the like occasions this is made up only from the treasury books of the receipt within every single year  when the first demand was made for a deficiency of the civillist for      the account of that years receipt was stated at no more than     0  l this new account of    years states the receipt of that year at  0     l this difference is itself a proof of false accounts delivered into parliament at that time to defraud the nation it is now publicly acknowledged that this difference of       l was neither a deficiency nor an arrear standing out at midsummerday      consequently       l being the remainder of  0     l deducted from  00000 l was the whole then wanting to complete the latter sum clear to his majesty that very day it was due yet the nation was obliged to give the crown    000 l for the arrears which had at first been demanded as a deficiency in the produce  this false account stands in the printed journals of      page      but by the late new account is fully detected in a surprising able and masterly manner yet this was crammed down the whole legislature which enacted that there was an arrear of    000 l and for the glory of those times it stands recorded in our statutes to posterity  in the new account the year      is said to have produced but        l in the same account the year      produces as set down already  0     l consequently      produces but       l more than      now it appeared upon the examination of the committee in april      that over and above the  0     l received to the very midsummerday      there had been since received on account of that years pretended deficient civillist        l by the april following and that there still remained arrears standing out in the customs and in the hands of the country postmasters       l these three last mentioned sums amount to     0  l besides the    000 l given for an arrear and yet the next year      stands charged with a produce but of       l more than the preceding       i answer not for the veracity of any accounts and i must confess i have not the most implicit faith in the treasury accounts when i consider for how many years the revenue of the hawkers and pedlars escaped them and for how many more the   per cent levied in barbados and the leewardislands nor could i be surprised if now and then a whole months revenue of the civillist should escape but for the present i will acknowledge that the virginia quitrents were most properly and with the nicest economy disposed of for his majestys special service  it has been mentioned that the money received at the exchequer for the year      was        l now the    000 l for arrears was paid in there that year and therefore ought to have appeared and been added to the produce of that year and over and above the    000 l it must be remembered too that from      they had in advance the difference between the pretended produce that year of  0     l and the real produce of     0  l to answer any future arrears but perhaps treasury books may look on the    000 l as a free gift only and it may appear there as very properly disposed of in that shape again  this    years account says there was received by the excise for the year      the sum of        l but when the deficiency for that year was demanded it was charged with the produce of        l only it was afterward proved that there had been paid to the late queen within that time     0 l which added to the above        l makes a sum of        l still     0 l is wanting to make up the        l it is probable that without foreseeing the consequences the sum of       l remaining in the exchequer at midsummer      for the civillist lottery of      may be included in the above        l though no notice is taken of it in this new account but then there will be still wanting      l to make the total of the said clear produce in that year as now delivered in agree with the same article laid before the committee in      upon the subject of the then deficiency of    000 l this short detail is given only as an instance of these inaccurate accounts  it would be tedious and endless to make all the proper observations on this long period of accounts i shall therefore confine myself to that second most extraordinary and delicate performance i mean the account for the pretended deficiencies in the duties and revenues for seven years back at midsummer      amounting to no less than        l what a play of words is here the duties and revenues are one thing the art of making up accounts of the receipts only between midsummer and midsummer without regard to the arrears either of that or of former years is another thing was not this sufficiently exposed in the examination into the    000 l deficiency of      why have they not now delivered to parliament a state of the clear produce of these revenues for the whole    years why played the old exploded game fixing the title called for on the outside of the paper and another title within relating to the clear produce of each year in every year but had it been now delivered under the genuine title it was called for which is an account of the clear produce of the several branches of the revenue etc which implies not only the receipts to each midsummerday but all arrears outstanding and afterward received it might have appeared that in the two former instances of deficiencies the arrears in those two periods added to the receipts given in would have been a redundance in      and far short of        l demanded in      by which means the grossness of the impositions then would have appeared in too glaring a light  what were the methods taken to cover such extraordinary impositions it was to call for the accounts from the several officers of revenue to be laid before parliament under the proper titles and then to give private orders to those officers to make those accounts up in a direct contrary way this was discovered and proved by the commissioners themselves of the several offices on their examination before the committee in the case of the first pretended deficiency of    000 l and was expressly confirmed by the letter of a person in authority giving such private orders and produced by a principal officer of the revenue in his own justification  in the case of the second deficiency in      which had a retrospect of   years the only way that remained was the hope that the novelty and surprise of it would carry itself and not be liable to any detection from the offices the treasury therefore were fully resolved to make up the account from their own books a precedent we see followed in this    years account for who could detect them there accordingly they delivered the accounts from their books as of a certain round deficiency of duties and revenue  but to carry on some show of proper vouchers as usual they sent their orders to the customs excise and post office to know what sums they had applied out of their several branches by virtue of standing warrants from the treasury during this period of   years to have asked of them as usual what was the real produce of those revenues in that period however necessary and proper for the public was the very thing which the treasury desired should not be known to make up an account from their own books was sufficient for their purpose yet the producing something from those offices would carry a plausible appearance and be an aid to imposition they therefore ridiculously produced certificates from these several offices of the payments issued by them upon the established warrants as if the treasury could be supposed ignorant of such payments and at the same time pretend to know the produce of those revenues from their own books without the assistance of the commissioners it may be indeed that these curious books of account take no other notice of the produce in every year but what they have the expenditure of in every year and that the rest is left to auditors accounting but does there not now arise a difficulty as to this    years account has any application been made to all or any one of the offices for the least information respecting the produce of the civillist revenue  i shall now compare some other particulars in this new account with what was formerly delivered when the deficiencies were in question before parliament in order to show the inaccuracy of treasurybooks i begin with the land rents  whatever sums the receivers pay upon treasury warrants is as much part of the produce as the balances they pay into the exchequer after such warrants have been satisfied and are equally applicable to the intent of a civillist as those balances it being to support and maintain the honor and dignity of the crown in the    years account these rents produce but    0 l in the   years        and   whereas it appears by the exchequer vouchers relating to the   years pretended deficiency that those   years had produced      l a small difference indeed of      l in so small an article and much to the credit of the new accounts correctness and it must be observed that the treasurybooks only can give an account of what the receivers had paid on warrants drawn by themselves exclusive of the moneys paid by them into the exchequer i cannot conclude this paragraph without observing that in    0 the first year of the   the produce of the excise was given in at the time that immense deficiency was claimed at        l whereas in the new    years account it stands at no more than  0     l another small difference of    0 l between two treasury accounts of the same article in the same year  when the accounts for these pretended see the printed journal      page  0  deficiencies of duties and revenue for   years were perused they were found not satisfactory other accounts were called for from the several offices of the revenue and were delivered to the house by them they are verily curious and literaly fulfill what the lords say in their protest the  0th of may      against the    000 l when we reflect in what manner these accounts have been made up and in what manner they have been brought in we cannot but apprehend that a door is opened by this precedent for laying new and excessive charges on the nation the revenues appropriated to the uses of his majestys civillist are subject in their own nature to vary and even when there is no deficiency in the produce there may be arrears in the receipt these arrears may easily be increased by the management of designing ministers by private directions to receivers and by artful methods of stating accounts from all which we cannot but apprehend that now this precedent is made we may have frequent accounts of arrears  these accounts from the customs excise and post office have no regard to the arrears standing out on midsummer      which probably were about the sum of  00000 l as they were about that sum at midsummer      and whatever sum they were ought to be reckoned in aid of the deficiency of the seven years  the accounts of the customs are from christmas      to      they say the account of the customs are made up from christmas to christmas so that this account could not be given from midsummer to midsummer they likewise say it is impossible to show what has been paid since christmas      of the produce of the above years because there is no distinction in the payments whether for arrears or growing receipts  this is roundly asserted but then how came it that they could in      make up an account of the produce from midsummer      to midsummer      and how did it happen that they could then make up the account of the arrears received since midsummer      and paid into the exchequer to the amount of   0   l  to account for the differences between the accounts there was a most ridiculous explanation given of them in a paper from the treasury i dont mean a public one it relates that this revenue produced as certified from the exchequer         l and that the comptroller of the customs account for the seven years ended at christmas      when he made up the net produce to be   0     l from which deduct the payments to the prince of wales   0000 l leaves         l the difference between these two accounts is little more than  0    l but as one is an account of a net receipt in one period and the other of a net produce in another period it is no wonder that there is a difference between the two accounts this is acknowledging that the records of the exchequer received all the produce as estimated except that difference and such sort of evidence we have for making up of these accounts nevertheless the account from the customhouse certifies that the arrears standing out at midsummer      was    0 0 l it must be observed that the usual arrears standing out in every year during the reign of king george the first as likewise in the first year of his late majesty was about  0 000 l was this very extraordinary arrear left in the hands of the receiver or receivers to create a deficiency of the duties for   years does it not now appear upon the whole of this account of the produce of the customs that it is founded on estimated and fictitious valuations to answer the present purpose  there was a remarkable difference between the treasuryaccount of the net receipt and the commissioners of the excise account of the net produce to reconcile them the same explanation as has already been mentioned as to the customs says the account of the net produce of the hereditary and temporary excise according to the commissioners accounts given into parliament is         l the exchequer receipt of that revenue amounted to         l the difference   0    l after the hereditary and temporary excise is paid into the exchequer it is chargeable with the payment of       l per annum to the south sea company for subscription into their capital of the lottery      which for   years is   0    l the difference     l therefore had the king charged himself with the produce instead of the receipt of this revenue the difference would have been only     l in the   years  the civillist lottery of      which was for   000 l a year and to be paid out of the excise was for    years to pay the interest and principal of  00000 l there was subscribed of it into the south sea company      0 l at   l per cent which is       l per annum which multiplied by   years would no ways answer what       l was desired to do the remaining annual sum of    00 l which ought to have gone to the sinking fund to pay off that principal sum subscribed was taken from it under the iniquitous pretense of its having emerged into the civillist founded only and no otherwise authorized but by an opinion obtained from his majestys learned council on a false state of the case it now appears that the said annual sum of    00 l has not been accounted for as a part of the civillist revenue for the   years deficiency of duties and that amounts to     00 l where has this emerged again  the commissioners of the excise in all their former accounts delivered to parliament in accounting for the produce of the civillist revenue have constantly deducted the sum of   000 l a year for that civillist lottery from the gross produce and the remainder is the net produce of the civillist revenue and they are still obliged by the law to pay annually into the exchequer that sum of   000 l they have nothing to do with the disposition of it afterward and therefore cannot lawfully alter their method of accounting for it from a future disposition of it  the commissioners by their account to the treasury of    november      declare that the moneys which have been applied by the cashier to the uses of his majestys civil government for the year      was       l but in their account of the second of january      was only  0000 l though the remaining sum of      l was first charged by them as paid to lord orford for his pension and this is the only sum that appears to have been paid him out of the produce of the several offices of the revenue and is this all that has been paid him but this is alone sufficient to prove that this excise account to parliament cannot be right and administers sufficient cause of suspicion as to other articles i shall now state this excise account in another manner as one short convincing proposition  this account makes the net produce to be         l to which add only the   0000 l paid the prince of wales the real net produce is         l the account of the exchequer is         l to which add paid by the cashier for his majestys warrants the sum of        l makes the whole but         l which being deducted from the net produce there remains      0 l of which there was standing out in arrears at midsummer      the sum of       l and therefore there could be in that time only the sum of       l that could be applied for the civillist lottery of      for seven years  this account says the arrears standing out on midsummer      the very day they were due on was       l on midsummerday      they were but       l which is now so much more than usual that it may be suspected to have been left in the hands of the receivers to create a greater deficiency in the duties and revenue the date of this account is the second of january      and they there acknowledge that the sum of  00 0 l had been paid in for those arrears standing out at midsummer       the account delivered from the post office for the produce of the seven years on which i must first make a small observation on the correctness of the treasury accounts that for the seven years deficiency charges the receipt of the post office for      to be       l this new account for    years but       l this is the most delicate of all accounts that were delivered into parliament the commissioners have prudently avoided the signing of it having no doubt heard what happened to others in      when the account of the produce of the civillist revenue was called for by parliament and their receiving a letter from the treasury to make them up in another manner to impose on the parliament and the letter was produced for their own justification they therefore now left it to the accomptant to make up something of an account that might pass for the present it is so slovenly done that they have not cast up the total of any of the several heads of deductions nor the account of the net produce for the seven years  the first most extraordinary article i shall take notice of is the charges of the management which as it stands here for these seven years is noless than  0 0    l that it is greatly increased during this period is certain but it is impossible that it should come to so enormous a sum and there must be something not right in this article which may be thus stated to cover something else for the charges of management for the year      was but   00  l  during the old system we were not permitted to ease the nation of the heavy weight of unnecessary charges in the collection of the revenues but they were increased for the sake of a corrupt influence over the electors and elected and the nation is greatly deceived in thinking that the crown pays for the charges of collecting the civillist revenues which is a rentcharge and therefore the collection of it is a burden on the people the ministers therefore have not been desirous of easing the nation of any part of so unnecessary a burden but our exhausted state may now require it  this account from the post office makes the net produce for the seven years including the payments of his majestys warrants and grants to be      0 l the treasury account of the deficiencies of those duties for those seven years acknowledges the receipt in every year on the very midsummerday they were due on to amount to        l which leaves an arrear on the seven years but of       l yet this post office account charges the arrears standing out on midsummerday      to be       l is not this very surprising the account is dated the   th of january      and says that there has been paid of those arrears before that date the sum of       l i have all these arrears been artfully kept back for the sake of the deficiencies of the duties  this discovery now leads us to examine the article of the post office for      in this new    years account which is the year after the pretended deficiencies it charged the net receipt of the post office in every year to be but    0  l for that year yet it now appears there was paid in between midsummer      and midsummer      before the   th of january      the sum of      l besides what was paid in of the remaining arrears of       l and all that has been paid in for the produce of the year      may we not therefore suspect that this arrear of the post office for       l the arrear of the excise for       l and the arrear of the custom for    0 0 l amounting to    0   l has not been accounted for since  some of the first hours at the very beginning of the last reign passed in a due consideration of certain money affairs to that immediately succeeded the bidding for the administration which rose from  00000 l in the late reign to  00000 l a year and in the same manner the bargain was struck for it it was opened so to the parliament and a bill was ordered in for that purpose but then a bidding after game was played it was observed that the revenue in the preceding reign was not all paid on the day that they were due but were in a few months afterward and that therefore a net receipt within every year was penuriously calculated to be more advantageous this occasioned the bringing into the bill that extraordinary clause which could not be then taken notice of but was sufficiently the next year when the merit of the aftergame was to be claimed it was thought the revenue had produced for that year but     0  l the intrigue of the closet obliged the minister to make good that deficiency and he demanded it as such of the parliament and when that was too much exposed for his own friends to vote it as a deficiency he was still necessitated to take it as an arrear no one could ever think that exposed and intriguing precedent would ever have been imposed again on the people  we were engaged on the continent in the war for the austrian succession our part was directed and carried on on the most absurd selfcontradictory principles we might have had a peace by the treaty at hanau and the favorite measure from natal predilection would have been satisfied for that time by secularizations it was approved of by his majesty and by his minister with him who sent it over to the regency to be approved of here four of them though there were nineteen lord justices without communicating it to the rest of them clandestinely took it upon themselves to refuse it it would have destroyed their system for their own administration they kept the secret they added to the flame of the nation against the minister who was for peace as being the only minister that was for carrying on the war they succeeded and his majesty was forced at the end of the year      to part with the minister that was for that peace and we were then necessitated to go on with the war to give hopes of obtaining at last the favorite measure which they had prevented being obtained by another flattering themselves that events would arise to put him out of humor with his favorite measure which they happily obtained for that time by carrying it on till they could raise no more money and left the hopes to remain to the next broils that could be made or found on the continent in the mean time recover our finances reduce the interest of the funds from four to three per cent without giving the poor people any ease from it by taking off their taxes for they were reserved to be applied to such proper uses in the beginning of the year      the minister had been guilty of a most grievous provoking offense did not all these hardships then require douceurs on the eighth of december      the demand was made for the deficiencies of the duties and revenues of the civillist for        l  i will not touch upon votes of credit subsidies payments of foreign troops nor on the true motives or causes of our desperate bloody war nor on the third partition treaty for the dividing of the prussian bearskin for they may be thought foreign to my occasional observations  i sincerely believe that the only motive for calling for an account of the clear produce of the    years was to do honor to his late majesty by undeceiving the people as to the enormity of his civillist revenue and with no view to do honor to his administrations by showing with how little they had done so much nor that it could then be conceived that a doubletitled account would have been given of it and of the unavoidable consequences that must arise from it the experienced old systemites with the hopes of a successful aftergame highly blame the measure of accepting the  00000 l a year certain and thereby the giving up the benefit of the late civillist act in not accounting for any years surplus and the benefit of accounting for fictitious deficiencies some of the lower herd of murmurers who judge of the rectitude of measures by names or epithets to names have cast an eye only on the sum total of          l as the produce of    years in every year and then dividing that by    they find by certain unerring occular demonstration that his present majesty has obtained a greater civillist revenue than his late majesty had from all that has been urged in these observations it must now appear that it is absolutely necessary for the true information of the nation and to do justice to his present majesty that the account of the clear produce of the civillist revenues from midsummer      to midsummer last as called for by the parliament be truly and faithfully laid before them  the arts the ridiculous insinuations the many insulting clamours to support and revive the expiring old system must be despised by every honest man who rejoices in seeing the true spirit of our constitution once more restored which had been so long despaired of not only by the most solemn words and assurances from the the but by public acts the taking of  00000 l a year certain for the civillist revenue  all our judges are confirmed to us not one turned out as was at the beginning of the late reign to give another interpretation to the act of settlement than was before understood to be the true sense and meaning of it by putting one out and afterward restoring him upon the first vacancy to establish that prerogative in the crown and by giving freedom to every placeman to vote for his own representative in parliament  in this situation of my king and country having some knowledge of these revenues i thought it might be of service to the public to make these observations and give this sketch of the conduct of our money affairs under the old system wishing some abler pen would do the same as to our continent measures and that all the people may be truly sensible and fully convinced of that great blessing of providence to them in giving them a king born and educated a briton  the end
