public miscarriages in the particular and accidental misconduct of individuals this is not much to be wondered at because it is so easy a solution  this pretense too is plausibly urged upon the people by profligate scribblers who find their account in it it is a sort of compliment paid the public to persuade them that they have no share in the production of these national misfortunes  but a candid and mature consideration will convince us that the malady lies deeper than what is commonly suspected and on impartial enquiry it will probably be found springing not from varying and incidental but from permanent and established causes  it is the observation of the greatest of political writers that it is by no means fortune that rules the world for this we may appeal to the romans who had a long series of prosperities when they acted upon a certain plan and an uninterrupted course of misfortunes when they conducted themselves upon another there are general causes natural or moral which operate in every state which raise support or overturn it ce nest pas la fortune qui domine le monde on peut le demander aux romans qui eurent une suite continuelle des prosperites quand ils se gouvernerent sur un certain plan and une suite non interrompue de revers lors quils se conduisirent sur un autre il y a des causes generales soit morales soit physiques qui agissent dans chaque monarchy lelevent la maintiennent ou la precipitent grandeur etc des romans c      among all these various causes none perhaps so much contributes to raise or sink a nation as the manners and principles of its people but as there never was any declining nation which had not causes of declension peculiar to itself so it will require a minute investigation into the leading manners and principles of the present times to throw a just light on the peculiar causes of our calamitous situation  to delineate these manners and principles without aggravation or weakness to unravel their effects on the public state and welfare and to trace them to their real though distant sources is indeed a task of equal difficulty and importance  it may be necessary therefore to apologize even for the attempt as being supposed to lie beyond the sphere of him who makes it to this it can only be replied that a common eye may possibly discover a lurking rock or sand while the able and experienced mariners overlook the danger through their attention to the helm the sails or rigging  he will be much mistaken who expects to find here a vein of undistinguishing and licentious satire to rail at the times at large can serve no good purpose and generally arises from a want of knowledge or a want of honesty there never was an age or nation that had not virtues and vices peculiar to itself and in some respects perhaps there is no time nor country delivered down to us in story in which a wise man would so much wish to have lived as in our own  notwithstanding this our situation seems most dangerous we are rolling to the brink of a precipice that must destroy us  at such a juncture to hold up a true mirroir to the public and let the nation see themselves as the authors of their own misfortunes cannot be a very popular design but as the writer is not sollicitous about private consequences he can with the greater security adopt the words of an honest and sensible man  most commonly such as palliate evils and represent the state of things in a sounder condition than truly they are do thereby consult best for themselves and better recommend their own business and pretensions in the world but he who to the utmost of his skill and power speaks the truth where the good of his king and country are concerned will be most esteemed by persons of virtue and wisdom and to the favor and protection of such these papers are committed dr davenant on trade   sect ii of the spirit of liberty before we enumerate the concurrent causes of our present misfortunes and decline let us by way of contrast muster the few remaining virtues we have left to which in part it is owing that our misfortunes are not heavier and our decline more rapid  among these the first and most important is the spirit of liberty this happily still subsists among us not indeed in its genuine vigor for then it would work its genuine effects yet that the love of liberty is not extinguished appears from the united voice of a divided people it still animates their conversation and invigorates their addresses though in their conduct it appears no more but it is remarkable that in proportion as this spirit has grown weak in deeds it has gained strength in words and of late run out into unbounded license  this however appears beyond a doubt that we all wish to continue free though we have not the virtue to secure our freedom the spirit of liberty is now struggling with the manners and principles as formerly it struggled with the tyrants of the time but the danger is now greater because the enemy is within working secretly and securely and destroying all those internal powers from which alone an effectual opposition can arise  wherever this spirit of liberty subsists in its full vigor the vigilance and power of impotent governors are vain a nation can neither be surprised nor compelled into slavery when this is extinguished neither the virtue nor vigilance of patriots can save it in the reign of james the second great britain was free though a despotic prince was on the throne at the time when caesar fell rome was still inslaved though the tyrant was no more  this great spirit has produced more full and complete effects in our own country than in any known nation that ever was upon earth it appears indeed from a concurrence of facts too large to be produced here that whereas it has been ingrafted by the arts of policy in other countries it shoots up here as from its natural climate stock and soil from this distinction if laid in nature two or three consequences will fairly arise its effects must of course be more vigorous and full it is destruction by external violence will probably be no more than temporary it is chief danger must arise from such causes as may poison the root or attack and destroy the natural spirit itself these must be such causes as can steal upon and subdue the mind that is they must be some degeneracy or corruption of the manners and principles of the people  sect iii of the spirit of humanity let us now trace the spirit of liberty through such of its effects as are not yet destroyed by opposite principles and manners  the first that occurs is humanity by this is not meant that smoothness and refined polish of external manners by which the present age affects to be distinguished for this it is apprehended will belong to another class by humanity therefore is meant that pity for distress that moderation in limiting punishments by their proper ends and measures by which this nation has always been distinguished  the lenity of our laws in capital cases our compassion for convicted criminals even the general humanity of our highwaymen and robbers compared with those of other countries these are concurrent proofs that the spirit of humanity is natural to our nation  the many noble foundations for the relief of the miserable and the friendless the large annual supplies from voluntary charities to these foundations the frequent and generous assistance given to the unfortunate who cannot be admitted into these foundations all these are such indisputable proofs of a national humanity as it were the highest injustice not to acknowledge and applaud  sect iv of the civil administration of justice another virtue and of the highest consequence as it regards the immediate and private happiness of individuals yet left among us is the pure administration of justice as it regards private property  many causes may be assigned for the continuance of this public blessing the spirit of liberty and humanity beget a spirit of equity where no contrary passion interferes the spirit of commerce now predominant begets a kind of regulated selfishness which tends at once to the increase and preservation of property the difficulty of corrupting juries under the checks of their present establishment in most cases prevents the very attempt and the longcontinued example of a great person on the seat of equity has diffused an incorrupt spirit through the inferior courts and will shine to the latest posterity  sect v of the ruling manners of the times having made this prefatory estimate of those remaining manners which may demand esteem and applause let us now proceed to the ruling manners of the times from which this age and nation derives its present and particular complexion  it may be necessary to remark that this designed estimate extends not to the comparative excellence of manners and principles considered in every view and in all their variety of near and remote effects it relates not to the immediate happiness or misery which individuals families or nations may derive from the force of prevailing principles and manners these effects branch out into an infinity of intricate combinations which cannot be comprehended in the present but will make a material part of some future enquiry this estimate therefore confines itself to such consequences only as affect the duration of the public state so that the leading question will be how far the present ruling manners and principles of this nation may tend to its continuance or destruction  in consequence of this restriction the manners and principles of the common people will scarce find a place in the account for though the sum total of a nations immediate happiness must arise and be estimated from the manners and principles of the whole yet the manners and principles of those who lead not of those who are led of those who govern not of those who are governed of those in short who make laws or execute them will ever determine the strength or weakness and therefore the continuance or dissolution of a state  for the blind force or weight of an ungoverned multitude can have no steady nor rational effect unless some leading mind rouse it into action and point it to it is proper end without this it is either a brute and random bolt or a lifeless ball sleeping in the cannon it depends on some superior intelligence to give it both impulse and direction  indeed were the people remarkably corrupt they might properly make a part of this enquiry but in most of those important circumstances to which this estimate refers they are in general much more irreproachable than their superiors in station especially if we except the lower ranks of those who live in great towns it will therefore be unnecessary to mark the character of their principles or manners unless where they appear evidently poisoned by the example or other influence of the higher ranks in life  now the slighest observation if attended with impartiality may convince us that the character of the manners of this age and nation is by no means that of abandoned wickedness and profligacy this degree of degeneracy indeed is often imputed to the times but to what times has it not been imputed present objects are naturally magnified to the human eye while remote ones though larger in dimensions vanish into nothing hence the speculative and virtuous in every age confining their views to their own period have been apt to aggravate its manners into the highest degree of guilt to satyrize rather than describe to throw their respective times into one dark shade of horror rather than mark their peculiar color and complexion  here a large field of comparison and debate would open were it necessary or even expedient to enter upon it we might cast our eye upon the manners of rome carthage and many other states in their last declining period where we should behold such tragic scenes of cruelty impiety and oppression as would confound the most sanguine advocate for the manners of antiquity but in truth there can be no occasion for this display of profligacy for if the previous estimate already given be just if the spirit of liberty humanity and equity be in a certain degree yet left among us some of the most essential foundations of abandoned wickedness and profligacy can have no place for these are servility cruelty and oppression how far we may be from this last period of degeneracy it were presumption to affirm at present it is certain we are not arrived at it whenever this fatal time approaches it will come distinguished by its proper and peculiar characters and whoever shall estimate such times will find himself under the same circumstance with the great historian who in the profligate period of declining rome tells us he had nothing to relate but false accusations bloody proscriptions treacherous friendships and the destruction of the innocent saeva jussa continuas accusationes fallaces amicitias perniciem innocentium tacit annal l iv   this we may truly affirm is far from the character of the manners of our times which on a fair examination will probably appear to be that of a vain luxurious and selfish effeminacy  this will be evident from a simple enumeration of acknowledged facts many of them indeed in appearance too trite to merit notice and too trifling for rebuke were they not in their tendency as fatal to the stability of a nation as maxims and manners more apparently flagitious  as the first habits of infancy and youth commonly determine the character of the man we might trace the effeminacy of modern manners even to the unwholesome warmth of a nursery as soon as the puny infant is suffered to peep from this fountain of weakness and disease he is confirmed in the habits already contracted by a mistaken tenderness and care the school boys satchel and shining morningface once the characteristic of the age itself are now only to be seen among the sons of villagers and peasants while the youth of quality and fortune is wrapped up from the wholesome keenness of the air and thus becomes incapable of enduring the natural rigours of his own climate  it is odds indeed but the prevalence of fashion places him in some public school where the learned languages are taught and to do justice to the times the most considerable among these seminaries were never more ably supplied than at present but whatever be the masters ability the scholars can in general reach no farther than to words this first stage of education therefore can only be preparatory to a higher without which the other is defeated of its purpose  here then lies an essential defect in modern education the pupil is not carried on from words to things the universities where the principles of knowledge should be imbibed are growing daily thinner of young men of quality and fortune instead of being initiated in books where the wisdom of ages lies reposed our untutored youth are carried into the world where the ruling objects that catch the imagination are the sallies of folly or of vice  thus like plants hastily removed from their first bed and exposed to the inclemencies of an unwholesome air without the intervention of a higher and more enlarged nursery where stronger shoots might be obtained our rising youth are checked in their first growths and either die away into ignorance or at most become dwarfs in knowledge  but here it must not be disguised that an abuse through time has insensibly crept upon the universities themselves and greatly impaired their use and credit the public fountains of instruction are at length dried up and the professorships founded as the means of general instruction degenerated into gainful sinecures instead of these where by a proper choice every department would naturally be filled with ability in its respective science the private lectures of collegetutors have usurped and occupied their place thus the great lines of knowledge are broken and the fragments retailed at all adventures by every member of a college who chooses to erect himself into a professor of every science what can be the consequence of this practice but a partial and superficial instruction it is true there are in this sphere who would do honor to the highest academical station but what an accession of luster fame and knowledge would our universities receive were these few now confined to the narrow sphere of particular colleges ordained and appointed to illuminate the whole  neither would it reflect any dishonor on our universities if the few young men of fashion yet found there were laid under the same restraints of moral and literary discipline with those of inferior quality  the next error that presents itself to observation is that of sending our ignorant youth abroad a mind stored with taste and knowledge will indeed naturally refine that taste and increase that knowledge by seeing and judging of foreign countries for thus he acquires a large addition of new experiences and examples which may confirm or rectify his prior observations on the contrary we may affirm with truth that no circumstance in education can more surely tend to strengthen effeminacy and ignorance than the present premature and indigested travel for as the uninstructed youth must needs meet with a variety of example good and bad vile and praiseworthy as his manners are childish and his judgment crude he will naturally imbibe what is most consentaneous with his puerile habits thus while wisdom and virtue can find no place in him every foreign folly effeminacy or vice meeting with a correspondent soil at once take root and flourish  but suppose him not of that rank or fortune which may demand or admit of the grand tour he is then brought up to london and initiated in the pleasures of the metropolis here then let us view him inspired with every fashionable ambition while we take an impartial estimate of those amusements or rather employments which attract the attention of the town and form the genius and character of the present and rising generation  the first and capital article of towneffeminacy is that of dress which in all its variety of modern excess and ridicule is too low for serious animadversion yet in this must every man of every rank and age employ his mornings who pretends to keep good company the wisest the most virtuous the most polite if defective in these exterior and unmanly delicacies are avoided as low people whom nobody knows and with whom one is ashamed to be seen  how would he have been derided in the days of elizabeth when a great queen rode on horseback to st pauls who should have foretold that in less than two centuries no man of fashion would cross the street to dinner without the effeminate covering and conveyance of an easy chair  yet thus accoutred the modern man of fashion is conveyed to company wherever he goes he meets the same false delicacy in all every circumstance of modern use conspires to sooth him into the excess of effeminacy warm carpets are spread under his feet warm hangings surround him doors and windows nicely jointed prevent the least rude encroachment of the external air  vanity lends her aid to this unmanly delicacy splendid furniture a sumptuous sideboard a long train of attendants an elegant and costly entertainment for which earth air and seas are ransacked the most expensive wines of the continent the childish vagaries of a whimsical desert these are the supreme pride of the master the admiration or envy of his guests  luxury is not idle in her province but shares with her sister vanity in the labors of the day high soups and sauces every mode of foreign cookery that can quicken taste and spur the lagging appetite is assiduously employed the end of eating is not the allaying of natural hunger but the gratification of fordid and debasing appetite hence the most inflaming foods not those which nourish but those which irritate are adopted while the cool and temperate diets that purify the blood are banished to inferior tables to this every man of taste now aspires as to the true scavoir vivre  do you expect in these fashionable meetings to hear some point of morals taste in arts or literature discoursed or canvassed alas these are long since expelled from every modish assembly to speak any thing that carries weight and importance is an offense against goodbreeding the supreme elegance is to trifle agreeably  but as insipidity of conversation is soon worn out and as intemperance in wine is not of the character of refined luxury so to prevent the stagnation of folly some awakening amusement is naturally sought for  we read in ancient story that in the most polished court of the most refined period a reward was proclaimed to him who should invent a new pleasure this may justly be styled the last wretched efsort of bungling and despairing luxury  the great desideratum is at length found a pleasure which absorbs the whole man a pleasure in which there is no satiety which cloys not by use but gains new vigor from enjoyment the vulgar only can need to be informed that the pleasure here alluded to is that of gaming  but as the present increasing splendour of dress equipage furniture enter  tainments is enormously expensive what can so naturally create a lust of gold as the vain ambition of equality or superiority in this system of effeminate show hence rapacity attends profusion till the spirit of avarice glides secretly into the soul and impels the man of fashion to that gaming as a trade which he had before adopted as a pleasure but as we read that caesars lust was only the servant of his ambition so this lust of gold is no more than the handmaid to vain effeminacy  thus we see gaming established on the two great pillars of self interest and pleasure and on these foundations seems to rest the midnight riot and dissipation of modern assemblies  but though gaming be now the capital pleasure as well as trade of most men of fashion yet other incidental amusements intervene at vacant times neither can it be affirmed with truth that all are immersed in this fashionable folly nor let any one imagine that he stands clear of the ruling manners of the times because not infected with the rage of gaming let us then proceed to examine the other reigning amusements of the age and see how far they are or are not subject to the charge of unmanly delicacy  a knowledge of books a taste in arts a proficiency in science was formerly regarded as a proper qualification in a man of fashion the annals of our country have transmitted to us the name and memory of men as eminent in learning and taste as in rank and fortune it will not i presume be regarded as any kind of satire on the present age to say that among the higher ranks this literary spirit is generally vanished reading is now sunk at best into a mornings amusement till the important hour of dress comes on books are no longer regarded as the repositories of taste and knowledge but are rather laid hold of as a gentle relaxation from the tedious round of pleasure  but what kind of reading must that be which can attract or entertain the languid morningspirit of modern effeminacy any indeed that can but prevent the unsupportable toil of thinking that may serve as a preparatory whet of indolence to the approaching pleasures of the day thus it comes to pass that weekly essays amatory plays and novels political pamphlets and books that revile religion together with a general hash of these served up in some monthly mess of dullness are the meagre literary diet of town and country  true it is that amidst this general defect of taste and learning there is a writer whose force of genius and extent of knowledge might almost redeem the character of the times but that superiority which attracts the reverence of the few excites the envy and hatred of the many and while his works are translated and admired abroad and patronized at home by those who are most distinguished in genius taste and learning himself is abused and his friends insulted for his sake by those who never read his writings or if they did could neither taste nor comprehend them while every little aspiring or despairing scribler eyes him as cassius did caesar and whispers to his fellow why man he does bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves no wonder then if the malice of the lilliputian tribe be bent against this dreaded gulliver if they attack him with poisoned arrows whom they cannot subdue by strength  but in justice to the present age another observation must be added as excess of delicacy has destroyed our force of taste it has at least had one laudable effect for along with this it has carried off our grossness of obscenity a strong characteristic this of the manners of the times the untractable spirit of lewdness is sunk into gentle gallantry and obscenity itself is grown effeminate  but what vice has lost in coarseness of expression she has gained in a more easy and general admittance in ancient days bare and impudent obscenity like a common woman of the town was confined to brothels whereas the doubleentendre like a modern fine lady is now admitted into the best company while her transparent covering of words like a thin fashionable gawze delicately thrown across discloses while it seems to veil her nakedness of thought  no wonder if these leading characters of false delicacy influence our other entertainments and be attended with a low and unmanly taste in music that divine art capable of inspiring every thing that is great or excellent of rouzing every nobler passion of the soul is at length dwindled into a womans or an eunuchs effeminate trill the chaste and solemn airs of corelli of geminiani and their best disciples the divine and lofty flights of caldara and marcello the elegant simplicity of bononcini the manly the pathetic the astonishing strains of handel are neglected and despised while instead of these our concerts and operas are disgraced with the lowest insipidity of composition and unmeaning singsong the question now concerns not the expression the grace the energy or dignity of the music we go not to admire the composition but the tricks of the performer who is then surest of our ignorant applause when he runs through the compass of the throat or traverses the fingerboard with the swiftest dexterity  while music is thus debased into effeminacy her sisterart of painting cannot hope a better fate for the same dignity of manners must support the same indignity depress them connoisseurs there are indeed who have either taste or vanity yet even by these the art is considered as a matter of curiosity not of influence a circumstance which proves their taste to be spurious undirected or superficial but with regard to the public eye this is generally depraved neither the comic pencil nor the serious pen of our ingenious countryman mr hogarths treatise on the principles of beauty  have been able to keep alive the taste of nature or of beauty the fantastic and grotesque have banished both every house of fashion is now crowded with porcelain trees and birds porcelain men and beasts crosslegged mandarins and bramins perpendicular lines and stiff right angles every gaudy chinese crudity either in color form attitude or grouping is adopted into fashionable use and become the standard of taste and elegance  let us then search the theater for the remains of manly taste and here apparently at least it must be acknowledged we shall find it a great genius has arisen to dignify the stage who when it was sinking into the lowest insipidity restored it to the fullness of its ancient splendour and with a variety of powers beyond example established nature shakespeare and himself  but as the attractions of the theater arise from a complication of causes beyond those of any other entertainment so while the judicious critic admires his original excellencies it may well be questioned whether the crowd be not drawn by certain secondary circumstances rather than by a discernment of his real powers need we any other proof of this than the conduct of his fashionable hearers who sit with the same face of admiration at lear an opera or a pantomime  these seem to be the main and leading articles of our unmanly winterdelicacies and as to our summeramusements they are much of the same make only lighter and if possible more trifling as soon as the season is grown so mild as that the man of fashion can stir abroad he is seen lolling in his postchariot about the purlieus of the town the manly exercise of riding is generally disused as too coarse and indelicate for the fine gentleman the metropolis growing thin as the spring advances the same rage of pleasure dress equipage and dissipation which in winter had chained him to the town now drives him to the country for as a vain and empty mind can never give entertainment to itself so to avoid the taedium of solitude and selfconverse parties of pleasure are again formed the same effeminacies under new appearances are acted over again and become the business of the season there is hardly a corner of the kingdom where a summer scene of public dissipation is not now established here the parties meet till the winter sets in and the separate societies are once more met in london  thus we have attempted a simple delineation of the ruling manners of the times if any thing like ridicule appears to mix itself with this review it arises not from the aggravation but the natural display of folly  it may probably be asked why the ruling manners of our women have not been particularly delineated the reason is because they are essentially the same with those of the men and are therefore included in this estimate the sexes have now little other apparent distinction beyond that of person and dress their peculiar and characteristic manners are confounded and lost the one sex having advanced into boldness as the other have sunk into effeminacy  sect vi of principles most writers who have attempted to prove the efficacy of principle have supposed it to be the great and universal fountain of manners they who have espoused the opposite system observing this theory to be at variance with fact have rashly concluded that principle is void of all real influence  the truth seems to lie between these two opinions principles cannot be the fountain of manners because manners precede principles that is in our progress from infancy habits of acting are prior to habits of thinking yet on the other hand principles early and deeply ingrafted in the mind may grow up with manners may be at variance with manners may yield to manners or gathering strength by cultivation may check control or destroy them  this distinction is proper for many reasons one is evident it shows the propriety of treating of the manners first and then the principles of the times  the principles here to be estimated are such only as tend to counterwork the selfish passions these are the principle of religion the principle of honor and the principle of public spirit the first of these has the deity for it is object the second the applause of men the third the approbation of our own heart let us examine the present influence of these several principles on the manners already delineated  did the writer court the applause of his polite readers if any such peradventure may honor him with their regard he would preface this part of his subject with an apology for the rudeness of hinting at religious principle to suppose a man of fashion swayed in his conduct by a regard to futurity is an affront to the delicacy and refinement of his taste hence the day set apart by the laws of his country for religious service he derides and affronts as a vulgar and obsolete institutution should you propose to him the renewal of that family devotion which concluded the guiltless evening entertainments of his ancestry you would become an object of his pity rather than contempt the sublime truths the pure and simple morals of the gospel are despised and trod under foot can we wonder if that profession which asserts these truths and preaches these morals be treated with a similar contempt but irreligion knows no bounds when once let loose and christianity herself has been obliquely insulted within those consecrated walls where decency and policy in the absence of reason and virtue would for ever have held her in legal reverence  but notwithstanding the general contempt of religion among the fashionable world the uninformed reader is not to imagine that the present age is deep in the speculations of infidelity no such matter for that would imply a certain attention to these subjects a certain degree of selfconverse and thought and this would clash with the ruling manners of the times indeed there have not been wanting laborious husbandmen who have painfully sown their tares not in the night season but in broad daylight these have at length shot up into a large and fruitful crop of irreligious implicit faith for implicit faith is belief or disbelief without evidence and why they disbelieve i trow few of the present age can tell they have other attentions than the meagre sophisms of irreligion and are therefore well content with the conclusions without the premises this distinction will lead us to the plain reason why in an age of irreligion so capital a book as the writings of lord bolingbroke met with so cold a reception in the world had they appeared under the inviting shape of essays philosophical and moral they might have come within the compass of a breakfastreading or amused the man of fashion while under the discipline of the curling tongs but five huge quarto volumes like five coarse dishes of beef and mutton though fraught with the very marrow of infidelity what puny modern appetite could possibly sit down to  in confirmation of these truths we may conclude this part of our subject with a not incurious anecdote a certain historian of our own times bent upon popularity and gain published a large volume and omitted no opportunity that offered to disgrace religion a large impression was published and a small part sold the author being asked why he had so larded his work with irreligion his answer modestly implied he had done it that his book might sell  it was whispered him that he had totally mistaken the spirit of the times that no allurements could engage the fashionable infidel world to travel through a large quarto and that as the few readers of quartos that yet remain lie mostly among the serious part of mankind he had offended his best customers and ruined the sale of his book this information had a notable effect for a second volume as large and instructive as the first has appeared not a smack of irreligion is to be found in it and an apology for the first concludes the whole  this being the state of religious principle let us next examine how it fares with the principle of honor by this is meant the desire of fame or the applause of men directed to the end of public happiness now this great ambition which in other times or nations has wrought such wonderful effects is no longer to be found among us it is the pride of equipage the pride of title the pride of fortune or the pride of dress that have assumed the empire over our souls and levelled ambition with the dirt the honest pride of virtue is no more or where it happens to exist is overwhelmed by inferior vanities a man who should go out of the common road of life in pursuit of glory and serve the public at the expense of his ease his fortune or his pleasure would be stared or laughed at in every fashionable circle as a silly fellow who meddled with things that did not belong to him as an idiot who preferred shadows to realities and needless toil to pleasurable enjoyment the laurel wreath once aspired after as the highest object of ambition would now be rated at the marketprice of its materials and derided as a threepenny crown and if its modern substitutes the ribbon or the coronet be eagerly sought for it is not that they are regarded as the distinctions of public virtue but as the ensigns of vanity and place  but what implies or proves the general extinction of the principle of honor is a peculiar circumstance which at first view seems to challenge praise it has been weakly attributed to the moderate and forgiving spirit of these times that no age ever so patiently suffered its ruling follies to be laughed at but this in truth is a superficial and inadequate representation as well as solution of the fact we not only suffer our ruling vices and follies to be ridiculed but we cordially join in the laugh was there ever a juster picture drawn than of modern effeminacy and nonchalance in the characters of fribble and lord chalkstone did ever dramatic characters raise louder peals of laughter and applause even among those who sat for the likeness they hear with pleasure they acknowledge the truth of the representation they laugh at the picture of their own follies they go home and without a blush repeat them the truth is therefore that we can see and own our vices and follies without being touched with shame a circumstance which ancient times justly regarded as the strongest indication of degenerate and incorrigible manners  it appears then that the principle of honor is either lost or totally corrupted that no generous thirst of praise is left among us that our ambitions are trifling and unmanly as our pleasures that wealth titles dress equipage sagacity in gaming or wagers splendid furniture and a table are the sole fountains from which we desire to draw respect to ourselves or applause from others we aspire to folly and are proud of meanness thus the principle of honor is perverted and dwindled into unmanly vanity  can it be imagined that amidst this general defect of religion and honor the great and comprehensive principle of public spirit or love of our country can gain a place in our breasts that mighty principle so often feigned so seldom possessed which requires the united force of upright manners generous religion and unfeigned honor to support it what strength of thought or conscious merit can there be in effeminate minds sufficient to elevate them to this principle whose object is the happiness of a kingdom to speak therefore without flattery this principle is perhaps less felt among us than even those of religion and true honor so infatuated are we in our contempt of this powerful principle that we deride the inhabitants of a sisterkingdom for their national attachments and regards so little are we accustomed to go or even think beyond the beaten track of private interest in all things that regard our country that he who merely does his duty in any conspicuous station is looked on as a prodigy of public virtue but in other times and nations when this principle was in force enterprises were formed and deeds done which it would now be thought phrenzy to attempt think what a friend will do for a friend a sister for a brother a lover for his mistress a parent for his child even that in all its fullness of affection in other times and nations has been the aim and the work of public virtue doing or suffering for its countrys welfare  domestic affections are not yet generally extinguished there are kind fathers kind mothers affectionate children sisters brothers humanity to distress we have already marked as another character of the times but whether our very effeminacy be not one of its sources might probably be a question more curious in its progress than agreeable in its solution  however that be let us be modest in our claims and confess that our affections seldom reach farther than our relations our friends or individuals in distress happy in the present it is for us that they reach so far happy were it for us or our posterity that they were of more enlarged extent in the mean time let us with due abasement of heart acknowledge that the love of our country is no longer felt and that except in a few minds of uncommon greatness the principle of public spirit exists not  it is not affirmed or implied in this general review that every individual has assumed the garb and character of false delicacy and uncontrouled selflove as in manly ages some will be effeminate so in effeminate times the manly character will be found as in times of principle some will be void of principle so in times when principle is derided in some superior minds principle will be found but from the general combination of manners and principles in every period of time will always result one ruling and predominant character as from a confused multitude of different voices results one general murmur and strikes the distant ear or from a field covered with flocks herds or armies though various in themselves results one general and permanent color and strikes the distant eye  nam saepe in colli tendentes pabula laeta lanigerae reptant pecudes quo quamque vocantes invitant herbae gemmantes rore recenti et satiati agni ludunt blandeque coniscant omnia quae nobis long confusa videntur et veluti in viridi candor consistere colli lucretius l ii  it is enough then if from a proper point of view we have fixed the ruling color of the manners and principles for on this will depend the ruling character of the times  as it appears therefore from this delineation that show and pleasure are the main objects of pursuit as the general habit of refined indulgence is strong and the habit of enduring is lost as the general spirit of religion honor and public love are weakened or vanished as these manners are therefore left to their own workings uncontrouled by principle we may with truth and candor conclude that the ruling character of the present times is that of a vain luxurious and selfish effeminacy  part ii of the public effects of these manners and principles part ii of the public effects of these manners and principles sect i what constitutes the strength of a nation hitherto we have done little more than delineate the ruling manners and principles of the times we must now assume a severer tone and reason upon the facts thus established  there are three leading circumstances on which the internal strength of every nation most essentially depends these are the capacity valor and union of those who lead the people the first may be called the national capacity the second the national spirit of defense the third the national spirit of union  the next step therefore will be to consider all that variety of respects in which the ruling manners and defect of principle already delineated must naturally weaken or destroy these sources of internal power  as this enquiry will of course lead to a particular view of those several ranks departments employments or professions into which such a nation is divided it is presumed that no instances alleged or facts alluded to will be weakly construed into the wantonness of licentious satire every profession is honorable when directed to its proper end the public welfare and the intention of this estimate is not to defame but to enquire how far the several departments or professions on which the internal strength of this nation depends are properly or improperly directed  sect ii of the national capacity let us then first enquire how far the false delicacy and effeminacy of present manners may have weakened or destroyed the national capacity  it was a shrewd observation of a good old writer how can he get wisdom whose talk is of bullocks book of wisdom  but rusticity is not more an enemy of knowledge than effeminacy with the same propriety therefore it may now be asked how can he get wisdom whose talk is of dress and wagers cards and boroughjobbing horses women and dice the man of fashion is indeed cut off from the very means of solid instruction his late hours occasion a late rising and thus the morning which should be devoted to the acquisition of knowledge is devoted to sleep to dress and ignorance  how weak then must be the national capacity of that people whose leading members in public employ should in general be formed on such a model if instead of a general application to books instead of investigating the great principles of legislation the genius of their national constitution or its relations and dependencies on that of others the great examples and truths of history the maxims of generous and upright policy and the severer truths of philosophy on which all these are founded  if instead of these they should seldom rise in political study higher than the securing of a borough instead of history be only read in novels instead of legislation in party pamphlets instead of philosophy in irreligion instead of manly and upright manners in trifling entertainments dress and gaming  if this should ever be their ruling character what must be expected from such established ignorance but errors in the first concoction  in a nation thus circumstanced it is odds but you would see even some of its most public and solemn assemblies turned into scenes of unmanly riot instead of the dignity of freedom the tumults of licentiousness would prevail forwardness of young men without experience intemperate ridicule dissolute mirth and loud peals of laughter would be the ruling character of such an assembly  this reflection some how or other calls up the memory of a circumstance or two peculiar to the public meetings of the athenians in the court of areopagus so little was ridicule regarded as a test of truth that it was held an unpardonable offense for any member to laugh while the assembly was sitting  another wise and prudent regulation was the practice of the crier in the senate who before business began called out aloud who will speak that is turned of fifty  it is true that in every assembly of this kind the public measures will generally be determined by the few whose superiority is approved and acknowledged by the few who have been so unfashionable as to despise the ruling system of effeminacy and before they had appeared on a higher stage had labored and shone in a college but what an increase of national capacity must arise if those masterspirits were aided and their plans of government examined and improved by men of the like application and ability  but if in any nation the number of these superior minds be daily decreasing from the growing manners of the times what can a nation so circumstanced have more to fear than that in another age a general cloud of ignorance may overshadow it  how much or how little in this particular we resemble the declining state of the roman republic let any one determine from the following passage where the great author after celebrating the general ability of those who were formerly in public station concludes thus nunc contra plerique ad honores adipiscendos et ad rempublicam gerendam nudi veniunt atque inermes nulla cognitione rerum nulla scientia ornati cic de oratore l iii   let us next consider the natural effects of these effeminate manners on fleets and armies and here it is supposed it will be readily acknowledged that the conduct and fate of fleets and armies depend much on the capacity of those that lead them through every rank of office chiefly indeed of those who are highest in command but in part too of those who fill the lower stations the more because they in inferior rank aspire and by degrees ascend to the highest  now i apprehend it would be ill taken to suppose that the fashionable and prevailing manners abound not in the army and navy the gentlemen of these professions are even distinguished by their taste in dress their skill at play their attendance on every amusement provided it be but fashionable and sure it must be by miracle if this trifling and effeminate life conduct them to knowledge or produce capacity it were unjust to deny that men of ability in this order are yet among us but it would be matter of great pleasure and expectation to the public to find ignorance in this profession either uncommon or disgraceful  would these gentlemen please to look into history they would find that in polished times few have ever distinguished themselves in war who were not eminent or considerable in letters they would find pisistratus pericles alcibiades dion agesilaus epaminondas among the greeks in the roman list both the scipios cato the elder and the younger lucullus pompey brutus caesar distinguished in letters as in war  it is true indeed that in barbarous ages there want not instances of unlearned leaders who have done mighty actions in battle but we must observe that these were at least practiced in their own profession it is farther to be observed that in such times the fate of war depends little on stratagem or discipline but it is chiefly to be observed that no general rule can be drawn from a few instances a man of great natural talents takes mighty strides in any science or profession he is selftaught while the common run of men whom nature has destined to travel on to improvement by the beaten track of industry through a blind and illunderstood imitation of his superior conduct must for ever fall the victims of their vanity and ignorance  here then we find another ruling defect in the national capacity of an effeminate people how few can arise amidst this general dissipation of manners capable of conducting its fleets and armies or even suppose a man of application and ability possessed of the chief command yet in case he falls in battle how small must be the chance that the next in succession upon whom his command naturally devolves can be equal to the importance of his new station  there is another profession which under this article of the national capacity the vulgar reader will naturally expect to find considered i mean that of the clergy but the general defect of religious principle among the higher ranks has rendered this order of men altogether useless except among those in middle life where they still maintain a certain degree of estimation the contempt with which not they but their profession is treated by the ignorant and profligate is equally common indeed to high and low life a circumstance which may be an occasion of pride in the one but ought rather to be matter of humiliation to the other it is true a modern writer felicitates the present times and makes it their boast that the clergy have lost their influence see mr humes essays  by which he evidently means that religion has lost its influence yet of this at least one of the order may decently remind his countrymen that when the english protestant clergy and that christianity which they teach were most honored and respected at home england was then most honored and respected abroad  and although the present fashionable contempt that is thrown upon their profession preclude the clergy from the opportunity had they the will to practice that christian duty of overcoming evil with good yet they need not blush to find that they have fallen with the fame the manners and principles of their country nor can the worthy part of them sure aspire to truer glory than to have become the contempt of those who are become the contempt of europe  but while i defend and honor the profession i mean not to flatter the professors as far therefore as the influence of their conduct and knowledge can be supposed to affect the national capacity so far they seem falling into the same unmanly and effeminate peculiarities by which their contemporaries are distinguished such of them i mean as have opportunity of conversing with what is called the world and are supposed to make a part of it in their conduct they curb not but promote and encourage the trifling manners of the times it is grown a fashionable thing among these gentlemen to despise the duties of their parish to wander about as the various seasons invite to every scene of false gaiety to frequent and shine in all public places their own pulpits excepted  or if their age and situation sets them above these puerile amusements are we not to lament that instead of a manly and rational regard to the welfare of mankind the chief employment of many a clerical life is to slumber in a stall haunt levees or follow the gainful trade of electionjobbing  if false pleasure and selfinterest thus take possession of the heart how can we expect that a regard for religion and christianity should find a place there  in consequence of these ruling habits must we not farther lament that a general neglect of letters is now creeping even upon this profession which ought to maintain and support them instead of launching into the deeps of learning the fashionable divine hardly ventures on the shallows the great works of antiquity the monuments of ancient honor and wisdom are seldom opened or explored and even mere modern books are now generally read at second hand through the false mediums of bald translations or sorry abstracts  this seems to be the real state of the clerical profession so far as it has influence on the national capacity  the writer pretends not in any case to impose his opinions but submits them to the consideration of the public there is a wide difference between the remonstrances of reason and the insults of malice or contempt  sect iii of the national spirit of defense having seen how the manners of the times have levelled the national capacity let us next enquire how it fares with the national spirit of defense  as this part of our subject naturally involves a larger number of the community than the last it will be necessary here to take a larger compass  the national spirit of defense then to speak with precision will always be compounded of the national bodily strength hardiness courage and principle  the common people of this nation seem possessed of the three first of these four qualities in a degree sufficient to form an effectual and national spirit of defense and though they who are selected for public service be commonly most profligate in manners yet as their sphere of action is confined they commonly have a proportioned kind of principle which works its effect in battle in the land service they are zealous for the honor of their platoon their company their regiment at sea there is the same emulation whose gun whose ship whose squadron shall be best served and fought it is well known there are no better fighting men upon earth they seldom turn their backs upon their enemy unless when their officers show the way and even then are easily rallied and return to the charge with the same courage  thus our villages and ports are an effectual fund of supplies for the national spirit of defense in its inferior departments  but if we rise or rather descend to an impartial view of those who are called the better sort we shall find such a general defect in the spirit of defense as would alarm any people who were not lost to all sense of danger  our effeminate and unmanly life working along with our islandclimate has notoriously produced an increase of low spirits and nervous disorders whose natural and unalterable character is that of fear  and even where this distemper is not the present false delicacy of the fashionable world effectually disqualifies them from enduring toil or facing danger  enthusiastic religion leads to conquests rational religion leads to rational defense but the modern spirit of irreligion leads to rascally and abandoned cowardice it quenceth every generous hope that can enlarge the soul and levels mankind with the beasts that perish  can the debility of modern honor produce the manly spirit of defense alas if ever it is put in action by any thing beyond the vanity of show it is rouzed by an affront and dies in a duel  how far this dastard spirit of effeminacy has crept upon us and destroyed the national spirit of defense may appear from the general panic the nation was thrown into at the late rebellion when those of every rank above a constable instead of arming themselves and encouraging the people generally fled before the rebels while a mob of ragged highlanders marched unmolested to the heart of a populous kingdom  nay so general was this cowardly and effeminate spirit that it was not confined to the friends of liberty and britain in england it infected even their enemies who while the hardy scots risqued their lives in a strange country amidst the inclemencies of a severe season sat like cowards by the chimney corner tamely wishing the success of that mischief which their effeminate manners durst not propagate  it has been urged indeed as a proof that the national spirit of defense is not yet extinguished that we raised such large sums during that rebellion and still continue such plentiful supplies for the support of our fleets and armies this is weak reasoning for will not cowardice at least as soon as courage part with a shilling or a pound to avoid danger the capital question therefore still remains not who shall pay but who shall fight  money it is true has of late more than ever been among us regarded as the main engine of war how truly let our successes tell the world  this point will hereafter be treated more at large see part the third  in the mean time it cannot be amiss to observe that a little of the active spirit of courage would do well in order to give play to this boasted engine which otherwise may sink into a dead and unactive mass  for a natural display therefore of the genius of the times commend me to the frank declaration of an honest gentleman during the impending terror of a french invasion for my part i am no soldier and therefore think it no disgrace to own myself a coward here is my purse at the service of my country if the french come i will pay but  take me if i fight  how many modern fine gentlemen notwithstanding the warlike weapon at their side would make the same declaration had they the same sincerity  there is another circumstance in modern manners the consideration of which must not be omitted because at first view it bids fair for the spirit of defense among the great i mean the spirit of deliberate selfmurder for this ran high in ancient greece and rome when the spirit of defense was strong  for the clearing of this point it must be premised and confessed that something like the principle of honor that is the dread of infamy and shame appears the leading motive in both instances  but a farther dictinction is to be made with regard to the different objects of this fear and for this we must refer to a former section  there we have seen that the ruling pride of a modern man of fashion lies in the parade of dress gaming entertainments and equipage whereas on the contrary the ambition of an old roman was to excel in military virtue now this dictinction at once clears up the question we are upon and confirms much of what has been advanced on modern principles and manners the roman killed himself because he had been unfortunate in war the englishman because he has been unfortunate at whist the old hero because he had disgraced his country the modern because he dares not show his head at arthurs that part i sect   because he was deprived of his glory this of his ortolans and champaigne the first was encouraged by a mistaken principle of religion the latter by his being void of all religion the one because he had lost a battle or a province the other because the bailiff has seized his equipage the roman was impelled to selfdestruction by the strength of warlike honor the briton by despicable and effeminate vanity  where then shall we seek for the genuine spirit of defense where in truth should we most seek for it but among those who are our defenders by profession  but what probability is there that the spirit of defense should be strong in any profession when the members of that profession are all chosen without prior culture or preparation from a people among whom the spirit of defense is lost the truth implied in this question is so evident in itself that it is hard to go about to prove it can a mere change of dress or title or the buckling on a military weapon infuse strength hardiness courage or honor these are qualities that must either be natural which seldom happens or they must be infused by an early and continued discipline or else they come not at all schools and seminaries of this kind we have none or none that are in any degree attended to the young men designed for the military profession are bred up to the same effeminate maxims and manners which their fathers are proud of can we wonder if these shoot into action and form parallel characters well might we wonder if they did not  so then if it appear by our present success in war that our naval and military spirit of defense is strong it must be evident at the same time that this great spirit is infused by some means altogether supernatural  in the mean time what becomes of the four great natural hinges on which the true spirit of defense must hang strength hardiness courage and principle  can the modern system of false delicacy nerve the warrior with hardiness and strength these qualities i believe are hardly boasted as making any part of the modern warlike character it is a prudent as well as a modest part indeed not to throw these rough and antiquated weights into the present military scale for every common eye would detect the false pretension  but though brutal strength and unpolished hardiness be gone are not our army and navy the great schools of courage and honor where these shining qualities are of course obtained  truly it has long been so affirmed so long that the affirmation has till of late passed for proof but the nation is now beginning to grow skeptical in this point and require something more than affirmation for the support of an article of such importance  let us first weigh the probability of this from the nature of things and men true courage and a principle of honor if they be not the rare and generous growths of nature are the effect of early and continued habits though grown gentlemen may learn to dance yet their movements will be none of the most graceful and though grown gentlemen repair to the school of courage and honor yet with all their preconceived maxims of false delicacy their trifling ambitions and effeminate manners about them i ween they are like to make a sorry progress long before this the mind has taken its decisive cast of thought and can but rarely be brought back from its first obliquities  but suppose the possibility of this sudden infusion it is to be feared the consequence would fail us it is true that when armies take the field and fleets put to sea when sieges are undertaken and battles fought and glory is the prize of toil and danger  then indeed armies and navies become the schools of courage and warlike honor here is a strong and continued bias put upon the mind of every individual of force to conquer it is earliest obliquities but where nothing of this happens where land officers in the capital are occupied in dress cards and tea and in country towns divide their time between milleners shops and taverns and sea officers even in time of war instead of annoying the enemies fleets are chiefly busied in the gainful trade of catching prizes  in such a case the army must of necessity be the school not of honor but effeminacy the navy the school of avarice to the ends of effeminacy  how far these general reasonings are confirmed by a series of recent events the world is left to judge it is not the writers intention to make personal applications but to trace acknowledged facts to their principles and consequences  sect iv of the national spirit of union these accumulated proofs may convince us that the national spirit of defense is not less weakened than the national capacity by the manners and principles of the times let us next weight their various effects on the national spirit of union  it may be proper to preface this part of the estimate by observing that whereas a national capacity and spirit of defense are not necessarily affected by a national form of government the national spirit of union on the contrary is naturally strong under some forms and naturally weak under others  it is naturally strong in absolute monarchies because in the absence both of manners and principles the compelling power of the prince directs and draws every thing to one point and therefore in all common situations effectually supplies their place  but in free countries it is naturally weak unless supported by the generous principles of religion honor or public spirit for as in most cases a full national union will require that the separate and partial views of private interest be in some degree sacrificed to the general welfare so where principle prevails not the national union must ever be thwarted or destroyed by selfish views and separate interests  another circumstance must be remarked by which in free countries the national union will accidentally be often checked but not destroyed i mean by the freedom of opinion itself urged into act by the very strength of generous and prevailing principle  this distinction leads us to observe what may perhaps be deemed an overfight or inaccuracy of the celebrated montesquieu he has often given it as his opinion that factions are not only natural but necessary to free governments and this general rule he gives without restriction thus he speaks of rome on nentend parler dans les auteurs que des divisions qui perdirent rome mais on ne voit pas que ces divisions y etoient necessaires quelles y avoient toujours ete and quelles y devoient toujours etre grandeur des romans l ix   how far this proposition is true or false the distinction made above will lead us to discover when the spirit of union is checked and divisions arise from the variety and freedom of opinion only or from the contested rights and privileges of the different ranks or orders of a state not from the detached and selfish views of individuals a republic is then in its strength and gathers warmth and fire from these collisions such was the state of ancient rome in the simpler and more disinterested periods of that republic  but when principle is weakened and manners lost and factions run high from selfish ambition revenge or avarice a repubiic is then on the very eve of its destruction and such was the state of rome in the times of marius and sylla pompey and caesar anthony and augustus  therefore before we can determine whether the factions that divide a free country be salutary or dangerous it is necessary to know what is their foundation and their object if they arise from freedom of opinion and aim at the public welfare they are salutary if their source be selfish interest of what kind soever they are then dangerous and destructive  it was necessary to make these distinctions before we could say with precision how far in our own country a national spirit of union is in reality a national good  the point therefore to be examined is how far our national spirit of union is weakened or destroyed by selfish views of good by separate interests and defect of principle  now if the delineation already given of our ruling manners and principles be true the consequence must needs follow that our national spirit of union must be shaken by them  neither shall we need to cast about for evident facts that will confirm this theory glaring proofs will meet us at every turn and not only make good this conclusion but throw new light on the delineation already made  the restraints laid on the royal prerogative at the revolution and the accession of liberty thus gained by the people produced two effects with respect to parliaments one was that instead of being occasionally they were thenceforward annually assembled the other was that whereas on any trifling offense given they had been usually intimidated or dissolved they now found themselves possessed of new dignity and power their consent being necessary for raising the annual supplies  no body of men except in the simplest and most virtuous times ever found themselves possessed of power but many of them would attempt to turn it to their own private advantage thus the parliaments finding themselves of weight and finding at the same time that the disposal of all lucrative employments was vested in the crown soon bethought themselves that in exchange for their concurrence in granting supplies and forwarding the measures of government it was but equitable that the crown should concur in vesting them or their dependants with the lucrative employs of state  if this was done the wheels of government ran smooth and quiet but if any large body of claimants was dissatisfied the political uproar began and public measures were obstructed or overturned  william the third found this to be the national turn and set himself like a politician to oppose it he therefore silenced all he could by places or pensions and hence the origin of making of parliaments  but the art as yet was but in its infant state the ruling principles which had brought about the revolution had not as yet lost their force and the first essays of art are always rude time only and variety of trial and experiment can form them into perfect systems  in the mean time this new principle of selfinterest began to work deeper every day in its effects as a seat in parliament was now found to be of considerable selfish importance the contention for gain which had begun in town spread itself by degrees into the country shires and buroughs which in former times had paid their representatives for their attendance in parliament were now the great objects of request and political struggle  and as the representatives had already found their influence and made their demands on the crown so now the constituents found their influence and made their demands on the representatives  thus the great chain of political selfinterest was at length formed and extended from the lowest cobbler in a borough to the kings first minister  but a chain of selfinterest is indeed no better than a rope of sand there is no cement nor cohesion between the parts there is rather a mutual antipathy and repulsion the character of selfinterest being in a peculiar sense that of teres atque rotundus wrapped up wholly in itself and unconnected with others unless for its own sake here then we see even this chain itself ready to fall in pieces and on any sudden thwart or concussion break into an infinity of factions  besides this the lucrative employs of our country not being near so numerous as the claimants are in every degree of political power and expectation the spirit of selfish faction arose of course in its strength from unsatisfied demands and disappointed avarice  it has much been debated whether the ministers or the people have contributed more to the establishment of this system of selfinterest and faction on enquiry it would probably appear that at different periods the pendulum has swung at large on both sides it came down in former times from the minister to the representative from the representative to the managing alderman from the alderman to the cobbler in later times the impulse seems to have been chiefly in the contrary direction from the cobbler to the managing alderman from him to the member from the member to the great man who ruled the borough and thence to the minister thus what was formerly in the minister an act of supposed prudence has of late grown into an act of supposed necessity the cobbler by this time had found his strength so the pressure went upwards till it came upon the ministry  to suppose that the servants of the crown never attempted measures that were known to be bad nor ever made parliaments in order to carry their attempts into action would be ridiculous but on the other hand it is equally true what machiavel somewhere delivers as a maxim that an illdisposed citizen can do no great harm but in an illdisposed city bribery in the minister supposes a corrupt people  and to venture a plain though perhaps an unpopular truth on this occasion it must be owned that a minister is not therefore certainly corrupt in his intention because he makes a parliament by indirect and corrupt means this conduct however indefensible may arise from two opposite causes he may be afraid of the virtue of a nation in its opposing bad measures or he may not dare to rely on the virtue of a nation in supporting him in good ones  there was a noted minister in this kingdom who during his long reign seems to have put these two maxims in practice as occasion offered for if it was his maxim that every man had his priceit was his maxim too that he was obliged to bribe the members not to vote against but according to their conscience  however this is not meant as a vindication of his measures on the contrary they seem generally to have aimed no higher than to secure present expedients to oblige his friends and dependants and provide for his own safety his capacity even when he meant well seems to have been too narrow to comprehend any great plan of legislation and perhaps his character might be drawn in these few words that while he seemed to strengthen the superstructure he weakened the foundations of our constitution  but however defective ministers may have been in making the public welfare the main object of their views we may be satisfied by this estimate of things from the revolution to the present times that the nation have at least marched passibus aequis and though this work is not intended either as a defense or an accusation of ministers yet for the sake of truth it must be said that the eternal clamours of a selfish and a factious people against every ministry that rises puts one in mind of those carthaginian armies which being at once cowardly and insolent ran away at sight of an enemy and then crucified their general because he did not gain the victory  to return therefore to our subject if indeed we have departed from it evident it is that the want of principle has at length firmly established a system of political selfinterest among us which must at all times break out into factions and prevent the great effects which a national spirit of union would produce former times we plainly see have been fatally infected with this selfish spirit present times in this respect are sacred and therefore we speak not of them but if the ruling manners and present want of principle in this kingdom be not checked in their carriere we must expect that future times will be more selfish and therefore more factious than those former ones we have already described  for vanity luxury and effeminacy increased beyond all belief within these twenty years as they are of a selfish so are they of a craving and unsatisfied nature the present rage of pleasure and unmanly dissipation has created a train of new necessities which in their demands outstrip every possible supply  and if the great principles of religion honor and public spirit are weak or lost among us what effectual check can there be upon the great to control their unbounded and unwarranted pursuit of lucrative employments for the gratification of these unmanly passions  and whenever this happens what can we expect as the consequence but a general anarchy and confusion what but that disappointed avarice will kindle faction that national union must be thwarted by selfish regards that no public measure however salutary can be carried into act if it clash with any foreseen private interest  nay is it not the duty of every wellwisher to his country to consider not only how soon this may be but how far it is our present situation  what other effect can naturally arise from the vanity dissipation and rapacity of a dissolute people for in a nation so circumstanced it is natural to imagine that next to gaming and riot the chief attention of the great world must be turned on the business of electionjobbing of securing counties controuling bribing or buying of buroughs in a word on the possession of a great parliamentary interest  but what an aggravation of this evil would arise should ever those of the highest rank though prohibited by act of parliament insult the laws by interfering in elections by soliciting votes or procuring others to solicit them by influencing elections in an avowed defiance of their country and even selling vacant seats in parliament to the best bidder  would not this be a faithful copy of degenerate and declining rome ea demum romae libertas est non senatum non magistratus non leges non mores majorum non instituta patrum vereri  and what can we suppose would be the real drift of this illegitimate waste of time honor wealth and labor might not the very reason publicly assigned for it be this that they may strengthen themselves and families and thus gain a lasting interest as they call it for their dependants sons and posterity now what would this imply but a supposed right or privilege of demanding lucrative employs as the chief object of their view and whence can this supposed privilege of demand derive its force but from a foreseen power and determined purpose of kindling faction and obstructing all public measures in case of disappointment and disgust  we see then how the political system of selfinterest is at length completed and a foundation laid in our principles and manners for endless dissentions in the state  thus faction is established not on ambition but on avarice on avarice and rapacity for the ends of dissipation  need we point out particular facts in confirmation of these truths is not the nation even now laboring under this fatal malady is not the deadly bowstring already stretched and the public gasping and expiring under the tugs of opposed and contending parties  distractam laceratamque rempublicam  magis quorum in manu sit quam ut incolumis sit quaeri live   sect v of the consequences of national disunion it is not enough to have shown in what manner our defect of principle and ruling manners have completed the ruin of the national spirit of union if we would obtain a full view of our subject it is a necessary though disagreeable task to trace this disunion through its particular effects  now these will always vary along with the character of the people thus divided if the nation be warlike and the spirit of defense be strong the danger will generally arise from within if the nation be effeminate and the spirit of defense be weak the danger will generally arise from without  the first of these was the situation and fate of the ancient military republics that of corinth was destroyed by the faction of the praetor diaeus and his party the athenian commonwealth was again and again shaken and overturned by the weight of opposing parties insomuch that the history of this republic may justly be styled the history of faction when degenerate manners had destroyed the purity of the spartan constitution and laws of lycurgus agis attempted to restore them but was murdered in the generous attempt by a faction headed by the ephori the roman commonwealth in its later periods was thrown into perpetual convulsions by ambitious and warlike faction and died at last of the malady and to pass by many other proofs that might be alleged what rivers of blood have been spilt in our own country among contending factions while the spirit of arms and honor remained among us  but to give every period of manners it is due character it is confessed that in the present effeminate though factious times we have no danger of this kind to fear for as our manners are degenerated into those of women so are our weapons of offense  but as this homesecurity arises only from the common impotence it is probable that other nations may soon know of what materials we are made and therefore our danger is likely to arise from without  let us then examine what effects this national spirit of disunion must have upon us as we stand affected by any foreign enemy  it weakens the consistency of all public measures so that no great national scheme of thought can be carried into action if it is accomplishment demands any long continuity of time  it weakens not only the consistency but the vigor and expedition of all public measures so that while a divided people are contending about the means of security or defense a united enemy may surprise and invade them  these are the apparent consequences of national disunion there is another not so obvious and therefore more likely to be fatal  we have seen that in a nation circumstanced like ours the great contention among those of quality and fortune will probably lie in the affair of election interests that next to effeminate pleasure and gaming this for the same end as gaming will of course be the capital pursuit that this interest will naturally be regarded as a kind of familyfund for the provision of the younger branches and that it is force must arise from this principle that in case the head of the family is not gratified in his lucrative demands he and his dependants will raise a combustion in the state  viewing the affair then in this light we shall see that besides the general ill influence of faction this principle of disunion must farther tend to weaken or destroy both the national capacity and the national spirit of defense  for in a nation so circumstanced through the strength of this principle many high and important posts in every public and important profession must of course be filled by men who instead of ability and virtue plead this interest for their best title  thus in a time when science capacity courage honor religion public spirit are rare the remaining few who possess these virtues will often be shut out from these stations which they would fill with honor while every public and important employ will abound with men whose manners and principles are of the newest fashion  it is acknowledged there are exceptions to the truth of this remark nay were it necessary the writer could gratify his vanity by ranking some of these names in the number of his friends but notwithstanding these exceptions the general observation will maintain it is truth  how indeed can it be otherwise while the consciousness of this principle has any place in the mind is not the parliamentinterest of every powerful family continually rung in the ears of it is branches and dependants and does not this inevitably tend to relax and weaken the application of the young men of quality and fortune and render every man who has reliance on this principle less qualified for those stations which by this very principle he obtains for why should a youth of family or fashion thus he argues with himself why should he submit to the drudgery of schools colleges academies voyages campaigns fatigues and dangers when he can rise to the highest stations by the smooth and easy path of parliamentary interest  it is granted indeed that the sons and relations of men of quality and fortune have not only an equal but even a prior claim to all high employments in the state provided only they are qualified to fill them honorably  we may truly add to this that in that period of a state when capacity courage and honor form its ruling character those of high quality and degree are generally of all others the most capable most courageous most honorable  on the contrary where effeminacy and selfish vanity form the ruling character of a people there we may be no less certain that those of high rank and quality will in general be of all others most vain most selfish most incapable most effeminate  the reason is permanent and the same in both cases because in every period of every state the influence of the leading people soon or late will form it is leading character  how far these truths are verified by present facts it were needless perhaps dangerous particularly to say let it therefore be left to the candid consideration of every honest and impartial man how far several recent events by which both the honor and outward strength of this nation have been impaired have arisen from the prevailing principle here delineated  we may conclude this subject with a general remark which together with the result of these observations may form a general maxim that when factions arise from the excess of military spirit and the ambition of dominion they increase the national capacity and spirit of defense on the contrary where factions arise from selfish effeminacy the national capacity and spirit of defense will certainly be weakened or destroyed we must not omit to observe that there are two professions which even in the most selfish and effeminate times will generally maintain their proper vigor these are the professions of law and physic for as their object is the security of the property and health of individuals the most selfish and effeminate of mankind will always be more attentive to the preservation of these in proportion as they are less attentive to the public welfare and lost to all generous affections and regards thus even in the most selfish and effeminate times the ablest lawyers and physicians will generally be at the head of their profession   such are the effects of this prevailing principle of selfinterest and disunion in high life but if we take into the account all that despicable train of political managers agents and burroughjobbers which hang like leeches upon the great nor ever quit their hold till they are full gorged we shall then see this reigning evil in it is last perfection for here to incapacity and demerit is generally added insolence every low fellow of this kind looks upon the man of genius capacity and virtue as his natural enemy he regards him with an evil eye and hence undermines or defames him as one who thwarts his views questions his title and indangers his expectations he must have had little experience in the world who has not among every order met with flagrant characters of this kind and instances of this truth  thus the public body is again weakened or rather mutilated in all its limbs and that national spirit of disunion which our principles and manners have produced comes not only attended with it is proper and immediate effects but has completed the ruin of the national capacity and the national spirit of defense  sect vi an objection drawn from the manners of the french nation considered we might here close our estimate of the public effects of the ruling manners and principles of the times were not the theory here established on a number of concurrent facts apparently liable to an objection  this arises from the ruling manners of the french nation which being as vain and effeminate as our own and the very archetype from which our own are drawn should of course involve that nation in the same consequences the same defect of national capacity defense and union but as these principles of national and internal strength are on all hands acknowledged to maintain their proper vigor in france where the ruling manners are effeminate therefore say the patronizers of our modern manners these cannot be the cause of our national miscarriages and defects  it is granted then that their manners are of the same kind but on examination it will appear that whereas ours as we have seen are suffered to go on to all their proper and natural effects theirs on the contrary are checked and counteracted in their effects by a variety of causes and principles wholly dissimilar  their effeminate manners affect not their national capacity because their youth are assiduously trained up for all public offices civil naval military in schools provided at the national expense here the candidates for public employ go through a severe and laborious course of discipline and only expect to rise in station as they rise in knowledge and ability  their effeminate manners affect not their national spirit of defense because they are controuled by the principle of military honor this for some ages has been early instilled into every rising generation and is at length become so strong and universal as to form the national character it spreads through every rank inspires even the meanest in the kingdom and pervades and actuates the whole machine of government with a force little inferior to that of public virtue  it were no incurious subject to investigate this peculiar principle to it is first causes but that lies beyond the intention of the present design it may be called a peculiar principle in france because it is unconnected nay even at variance with it is manners and in no other country did this principle ever subsist in it is strength when other principles were weakened and manners lost  it may seem perhaps at first view to have arisen from the civil wars that rent the kingdom in the time of henry the great to have been transfused from thence into the gallant reign of louis and thence heightened and delivered down to present times  but though it received great heightenings in these two reigns yet it produced signal and peculiar effects before the first of these periods in proof of this we need only allege the famous route called the battle of spurs when henry the eighth of england invaded france on this occasion the body of the french army giving way through some sudden panic the officers kept their ground and rather chose to be slain or taken prisoners than give countenance to such an ignominious flight  this principle so remarkable at this day among the french we stigmatize with the name of false honor such as it is it were to be wished we had more of it it aims not indeed at generous ends beyond a certain sphere but it is plausible polite and splendid in the pursuit even of it is ungenerous ends in short the honor like the religion of france is not void of benevolence but confines its benevolence within a certain pale it is false honor as it regards other nations as it regards their own country it is true  as this principle in france secures the national spirit of defense so the power of their monarch aided by this principle secures their national spirit of union in consequence of this the world has accidentally seen their vast plan of power formed by the great colbert almost a century ago carried on though with frequent interruptions and in a great degree now accomplished through a variety of reigns wars and administrations the monarchs power gives unity and steddiness the principle of honor gives vigor to every movement of the state  thus in contradiction to all known example france has become powerful while she seemed to lead the way in effeminacy and while she has allured her neighbor nations by her own example to drink largely of her circaean and poisoned cup of manners has secured her own health by the secret antidote of principle  forced by this the character of the french nation though inconsistent is respectable they have found or rather invented the art of uniting all extremes they have virtues and vices strengths and weaknesses seemingly incompatible they are effeminate yet brave insincere yet honorable hospitable not benevolent vain yet subtle splendid not generous warlike yet polite plausible not virtuous mercantile yet not mean in trifles serious gay in enterprise women at the toilet heroes in the field profligate in heart in conduct decent divided in opinion in action united in manners weak but strong in principle contemptible in private life in public formidable  sect vii of the most probable tendency of these effects notwithstanding this apparent objection therefore the principles here advanced maintain their force and thus we see how our effeminate manners and defect of principle have weakened the national capacity and spirit of defense and by giving a new turn to our national disunion have still farther aggravated these ruling evils in the state  what then is the most probable consequence of this national debility  it is from an outward enemy as has been observed that danger is most to be apprehended  the french in land armies are far our superiors they are making large and dreadful strides toward us in naval power they have more than disputed with us the empire of the mediterranean they are driving us from our forts and colonies in america  these are the steady effects of their principles and union of our deficiency in both  these causes reach to and operate even in the new world their governors of colonies are actuated by honor and their monarchs power ours too commonly by selflove and uncontrouled rapine their zeal and policy direct them to make converts and friends of the indian nations our irreligion prevents the one our dishonest treatment the other for by the best accounts our colonies have in general copied and even outgone us in every fashionable degeneracy  should the french then possess themselves of north america what eye can be so weak as not to see the consequence must not a naval power come upon us equal if not superior to our own  thus by a gradual and unperceived decline we seem gliding down to ruin we laugh we sing we feast we play we adopt every vanity and catch at every lure thrown out to us by the nation that is planning our destruction and while fate is hanging over us are sightless and thence secure were we but as innocent as blind we should in our fondness for french manners completely resemble the lamb described by the poet  the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day had he thy reason would he skip and play pleased to the last he crops the flowery food and licks the hand that is raised to shed his blood part iii of the sources of these manners and principles part iii of the sources of these manners and principles sect i of a general mistake on this subject the public effects of our manners and principles here enumerated begin now to appear too manifest in our public miscarriages to be any longer derided the nation stands aghast at it is own misfortunes but like a man starting suddenly from sleep by the noise of some approaching ruin knows neither whence it comes nor how to avoid it  in proof of this we need only look into the late instructions from constituents to representatives these we see seldom look farther than the immediate and incidental occasion of each particular misconduct while the grand general principles in which these misconducts have been chiefly founded are neither seen nor suspected nay an impartial enquiry will probably convince us that while they strike at the shoots and branches they feed the root from whence these misconducts have been originally derived  for it seems to be the ruling maxim of this age and nation that if our trade and wealth are but increased we are powerful happy and secure and in estimating the real strength of the kingdom the sole question for many years has been what commerce and riches the nation is possessed of a question which an ancient lawgiver would have laughed at  there never was a more fatal error more greedily embraced by any people  sect ii of the effects of exorbitant trade and wealth on manners by wealth is understood every kind of useful possession or money which is it is sign and may be converted into it  by commerce is understood the exchange of wealth for mutual benefit  the effects of commerce on manners have by most writers i think been considered as uniform even the sage and amiable montesquieu says only in general terms that commerce polishes manners but corrupts manners lesprit des loix l xx c    whereas from a candid view of it is nature and effects we shall probably find that in it is first and middle stages it is beneficent in it is last dangerous and fatal  if we view commerce in its first stages we shall see that it supplies mutual necessities prevents mutual wants extends mutual knowledge eradicates mutual prejudice and spreads mutual humanity  if we view it in its middle and more advanced period we shall see it provides conveniences increases numbers coins money gives birth to arts and science creates equal laws diffuses general plenty and general happiness  if we view it in it is third and highest stage we shall see it change it is nature and effects it brings in superfluity and vast wealth begets avarice gross luxury or effeminate refinement among the higher ranks together with general loss of principle  concerning the two first stages of commerce i shall have no dispute with the present times it is benefits are generally acknowledged the dangerous effects of it is exorbitance or excess have not yet been sufficiently developed  that commerce in it is excess brings a general superfluity of goods that this general superfluity settles in particular hands into vast wealth will be readily acknowledged  the next step is to consider how vast wealth naturally produces avarice luxury or effeminacy according to the genius or circumstances of the people among whom it comes  industry in it is first stages is frugal not ungenerous it is end being that of selfpreservation and moderate enjoyment it is little superfluities are often employed in acts of generosity and beneficence but the daily increase of wealth by industry naturally increases the love of wealth the passion for money being founded not in sense but imagination admits of no satiety like those which are called the natural passions thus the habit of saving money beyond every other habit gathers strength by continued gratification the attention of the whole man is immediately turned upon it and every other pursuit held light when compared with the increase of wealth hence the natural character of the trader when his final prospect is the acquisition of wealth is that of industry and avarice  what is true in this respect of trading men is true of trading nations if their commerce be that of economy in the extreme if the last object of their pursuit be wealth for it is own sake if the leaders of such a people be commercial the character of that people and it is leaders will be found in industry and avarice  but if a trading nation has a large territory sufficient to create a landed interest commerce will produce very different effects  for as it multiplies inhabitants and brings in wealth it naturally increases the value of landed estates barren grounds are cultivated and cultivated spots are made more fertile hence a vast accession of income to the nobility and gentry  these ranks of men being not bred up to habits of industry on the contrary their increased rents coming in unsought for and their time being often a load upon them through want of capacity and employment the habit of indulgence comes on and grows of course additional wealth gives the power to gratify every desire that rises leisure improves these desires into habits thus money is at length considered as no more than the means of gratification and hence the genuine character of a rich nobility or gentry is that of expense and luxury  but the first essays of luxury like those of every other art are coarse and rude the natural character of luxury therefore is to refine by degrees especially when assisted by commerce it advances apace into refinement for commerce searches every shore and climate for it is supplies and art is studious because rewarded in arranging and applying these materials to the most exquisite and delicate use thus every coarser mode of pleasure is by degrees despised new habits of higher indulgence come on gross luxury is banished and effeminacy takes it is place  but luxury in this last period being exhausted in it is course and turned for want of new objects of indulgence into debility and languor would expire or sleep were it not awakened by another passion which again calls it into action nothing is so natural to effeminate minds as vanity this rouzes the luxurious and debilitated soul and the arts of pleasurable enjoyment are now pushed to their highest degree by the spirit of delicate emulation  thus the whole attention of the mind is centred on brillancy and indulgence money though despised as an end is greedily sought as a means and self under a different appearance from the trading spirit takes equal possession of the soul  thus as the character of a state altogether commercial in the highest degree is that of industry and avarice so in a nation of extended territory where commerce is in it is highest period while it is trading members retain their habits of industry and avarice the natural character of it is landed ranks it is nobility and gentry is that of a vain luxurious and selfish effeminacy  we speak here of the simple and proper effects of trade and wealth uncontrouled by opposite manners or principles which it is to be observed never existed probably at least in the mixed state in their full extent individuals there are and will be in almost every state and period who are influenced by dissimilar manners or principles there are traders who are generous nobles and gentry whose ultimate passion is for gold but such exceptions affect not the general principle and though these incidental mixtures weaken the different colors of different ranks or states yet still the different colors remain in their nature distinct and invariable  it is probable the reader will have discovered that this reasoning is strengthened by or rather built upon the examples of two neighbor nation one wholly commercial that of holland the other a mixed state compounded of a commercial and landed interest i mean our own and to say the truth no two nations perhaps ever existed which approached so near to the full and proper effects of the causes here alleged  it will appear immediately why the genius of the republic of holland is here analyzed into its first principles which are simply those of industry and the love of gain  in the mean time we may justly conclude from this argument that the exorbitant trade and wealth of england sufficiently account for it is present effeminacy  sect iii of the effects of exorbitant trade and wealth on the religious principle such therefore are the ruling manners which may naturally be expected in a nation thus circumstanced unless they be counteracted by opposite principles it is now time to consider the natural effects of exorbitant trade and wealth on all those salutary principles by which these effeminate manners can most effectually be controuled  let us still carry the two characteristic states of holland and england in our eye  whether then we view the commercial state where the love of money rules or the mixed state where vain effeminacy predominates we shall find both these national characters have but a bad aspect and influence on every kind of principle let us first consider that of religion  avarice seems not in it is own nature prone to destroy speculative religious belief but effectually to extinguish active religious principle  it tends not to destroy speculative belief because this effect must be a work of application time and labor now the labor of avarice is naturally bent on it is main object money therefore to waste this labor on the propagation of the unprofitable and fruitless doctrines of irreligion must ever be contrary to it is ruling character  but avarice naturally tends to the destruction of active religious principles because this is chiefly a matter of habitual impression and therefore in order to accomplish it is destruction nothing more is necessary than to forget now this requires no positive act or labor of the mind but is the natural result from an attentive pursuit of the favorite object money  hence in a mere commercial state actuated by the love of gain religion is not railed at or disputed against but only neglected and forgot and thus the genuine trader who never questioned the articles of his national faith at home scruples not to forswear christianity and tread upon the cross in japan and returns the same good christian as he went  but in the mixed state where national effeminacy forms the primary and avarice only the secondary character the effects of exorbitant trade and wealth on religious principle will be widely different  lord verulam has somewhere observed that times of atheism are civil timeshe had been much nearer the truth had he affirmed that civil times are times of atheism he mistook the cause for the effect  this effect of national luxury and refinement in producing national irreligion is not difficult to account for in some periods of a state opinions control manners but in most periods manners controulopinions where the ruling manners coincide with the common good as in the middle periods of a state there we commonly find that a rational and beneficent system of religion prevails this comes to pass because the principles of the received religion contradict not the ruling manners  but in the state and period of luxury or refinement active religious principle is lost through the attentive pursuit of pleasure as in the commercial state it is lost through the attentive pursuit of gain  and speculative belief in this period must naturally be lost along with practical because leisure and literature having opened the field of disputation vice as well as virtue will of course arm herself with every weapon of preservation and offense luxury therefore will generally list under the banner of irreligion because religion condemns her manners irreligion suffers or approves them  to confirm the truth of this reasoning we need only observe that in the period of refined luxury few but they who are involved in the vices are involved in the irreligion of the times  one exception however must be made with regard to the writers against religion for these though they promote yet are not often involved in the common degeneracy this fact has been regarded as unaccountable that sober men of morals apparently unblameable should madly unhinge the great principle of religion and society without any visible motive or advantage but by looking a little farther into human nature we shall easily resolve this seeming paradox these writers are generally men of speculation and industry and therefore though they give themselves up to the dictates of their ruling passion yet that ruling passion commonly leads to the tract of abstemious manners that desire of distinction and superiority so natural to man breaks out in a thousand various and fantastic shapes and in each of these according as it is directed becomes a virtue or a vice in times of luxury and dissipation therefore when every tenet of irreligion is greedily embraced what road to present applause can lie so open and secure as that of disgracing religious belief especially if the writer help forward the vices of the times by relaxing morals as well as destroying principle such a writer can have little else to do but to new model the paradoxes of ancient skepticism in order to figure it in the world and be regarded by the smatterers in literature and adepts in folly as a prodigy of parts and learning thus his vanity becomes deeply criminal and is execrated by the wise and good because it is gratified at the expense of his countrys welfare but the consolation which degenerate manners receive from his fatal tenets is repaid by eager praise and vice impatiently drinks in and applauds his hoarse and boding voice while like a raven he sits croaking universal death despair and annihilation to the human kind  thus where manners and religion are opposed nothing is so natural as that the one should bear down the other if religion destroy not the ruling manners these will gather strength and destroy religion  especially in a country where freedom is established and manners lost through the exorbitance of wealth the duration of religious principles can be but short despotism arms itself with terror and by checking the open and avowed profession checks in a certain degree the progress of impiety whereas it must be acknowledged and lamented as one of the unalterable defects of a free government that opinion must have its course the disease is bad but the cure would be fatal thus freedom is compelled to admit an enemy who under the pretense and form of an ally often proves her destroyer  sect iv of the effects of exorbitant trade and wealth on the principle of honor in the mixed state where luxury and effeminacy form the ruling character of a people the excess of trade and wealth naturally tends to weaken or destroy the principle of honor by fixing the desire of applause and the fear of shame on improper and ridiculous objects instead of the good of others or the happiness of the public the object of pursuit naturally sinks into some unmanly and trifling circumstance the vanity of dress entertainments equipage furniture of course takes possession of the heart  but in the pure commercial state where the love of gain predominates among the higher ranks the desire of applause and fear of shame are not perverted but extinguished the lust of gold swallows up every other passion and a nation of this character can without emotion stand the laughter and contempt of europe and say with the miser  populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo ipse domi simulac nummos contemplor in area in whatever shape therefore the passion for applause appear whether it assume the fantastic form of vanity the more solemn one of pride or the steady and elevated desire of rational esteem we shall find this excess of national avarice tends to its extinction a great writer indeed has told us that vanity creates industry lesprit des loix l xix l    which is true notwithstanding this we have seen above that industry in the excess naturally begets avarice and avarice in the excess works a total change in the soul and expels that vanity which gave it birth  the same great writer has told us that pride destroys industry ibid  the reverse of which holds equally true that industry destroys pride we speak here of pride in the blameable sense as when it rises into blind and overbearing insolence industry in the moderate degree tends to destroy this contemptuous spirit by introducing knowledge and equality and in this respect as in most others is attended with excellent effects  but the spirit of trade in its excess by introducing avarice destroys the desire of rational esteem in confirmation of this we need only cast our eyes on the hollanders and chinese among whom the trading spirit is almost in its unmixed perfection the one is the most mercenary the other the most thieving of all nations  sect v of their effects on public spirit this part of our subject needs little investigation for both in the commercial and mixed state it appears that exorbitant trade and wealth tend naturally to turn all the attention of individuals on selfish gratification  therefore they must of course generally tend to destroy the principle of public spirit because this implies that our attention and regard is turned on others  in the commercial state avarice represents wealth in the mixed state effeminacy represents pleasure as the chief good both these delusions tend to the extinction of public spirit  these delusions create a new train of wants fears hopes and wishes all these terminating in selfish regard naturally destroy every effort of generous and public principle  sect vi farther remarks on this subject in consequence of these remarks some farther distinctions will arise  thus the religious principle will seem to exist in the commercial state where avarice forms the national character while in the mixed state where luxury and effeminacy predominate it is evidently destroyed the reason is that in the first although active principle is lost speculative belief is not controverted whereas in the latter not only active principle is lost but religion itself if such a state be free is publicly insulted and derided thus in holland religion seems yet to exist while in england it is evidently destroyed  on the contrary the principle of honor will seem to exist in the mixed state where luxurious effeminacy forms the primary character of the nation while in the commercial state where avarice predominates the principle is evidently no more the reason is that in the former the love of applause and fear of shame are not wholly destroyed but perverted and turned upon unworthy objects while in the latter the passion itself is totally extinguished thus the faint appearance of honor yet remains in england while in holland it is manifestly destroyed  but as modern dutch religion and modern english honor seem no more than the ghosts of departed principles so they have precisely those effects which may reasonably be expected from such shadowy nonentities  again the colors or characters of industry and avarice will naturally be strong in the commercial state because being almost wholly unmixed with manners of a dissimilar nature the ruling genius of the state is left uncontrouled to its proper operations and effects  but in the mixed state where industry and love of gain form the character of the secondary ranks dissipation and effeminacy of the higher there the two separate characters by the force of incidental coalition and example will always influence each other in a certain degree some ambitious traders will aspire to luxurious effeminacy some of the higher orders will descend to industry and merchandise thus each rank must be tinctured with a color different from its own and hence the general color or character of each of these ranks will in some measure be controuled and weakened  this circumstance is favorable to the mixed state beyond that which is purely commercial as it checks in a certain degree the virulence of the excess and produces a national character in some measure approaching that of more moderate trade and wealth  hence too it follows that a state purely commerical when once arrived at the period of exorbitant wealth will naturally degenerate faster than that which is compounded of commerce and luxury for whatever causes check the ruling manners in their degree will check them in their consequences  but beyond this there is another reason why the state purely commercial will degenerate faster than the mixed state in the commercial state the ruling manners go hand in hand with the exorbitance of wealth because the love of gain which forms the leading character being likewise the leading motive must be even prior to this exorbitance in the order of our ideas and therefore in its effects must be at least contemporary  but in the mixed state there will always be a short period between the national exorbitance of wealth and the national increase of luxurious effeminacy because manners once got into a certain track are not at once thrown out of it there must be a short period before the leading parts of the nation can feel their increase of wealth and after this another period before new and more refined modes of pleasure can be invented  hence a neighboring republic seems to have well nigh filled up the measure of its iniquities while ours as yet are only rising toward the brim  lastly though the ruling manners of such a mixed state are luxurious and effeminate yet its public measures will be commercial first because commerce is the handmaid of wealth and therefore of pleasure secondly because the idea of national strength as well happiness being degenerated into that of wealth and external good commerce will above all things be naturally encouraged because it is the means of procuring them  sect vii a review of the argument thus our present exorbitant degree of trade and wealth in a mixed state like that of england naturally tends to produce luxurious and effeminate manners in the higher ranks together with a general defect of principle and as the internal strength of a nation will always depend chiefly on the manners and principles of it is leading members so these effeminate manners and this defect of principle operate powerfully and fatally on the national conduct and affairs they have produced a general incapacity have weakened the national spirit of defense have heightened the national disunion and this national disunion besides it is proper and immediate effects being founded in avarice for the ends of dissipation has again weakened the small remainder of public capacity and defense and thus seems to have fitted us for a prey to the insults and invasions of our most powerful enemy  sect viii an objection considered though this estimate may appear just to those who take an enlarged view of things in their principles and consequences yet i am not ignorant of certain maxims generally approved and hardly even disputed among modern politicians which if true would weaken or overturn these accumulated proofs  the capital maxim which seems to include the rest is this that vast trade and wealth above all things make a nation powerful and invincible as they increase it is numbers enable it to pay it is fleets and armies provide continual supplies for war and thus in the end tire out and defeat every enemy whose wealth and commerce are inferior  the examination of this maxim will throw many strong collateral lights upon our main subject  first it affirms that trade and wealth make a nation strong because they make it populous this indeed is true of the first and second periods of trade and wealth that it is true of the third or highest period of which england is now possessed may very reasonably be questioned in the first period industry is chiefly employed in cultivating the lands in increasing manufacturing and exchanging the produce of the mother country these branches of trade call for vast additional numbers of hands and hence an increase of numbers naturally arises  the same effect takes place in the second period of trade so far as home productions are exchanged for foreign ones this stage of commerce brings on a fresh demand of artificers of new and various kinds produces and increase of labor and therefore of inhabitants  but in the third or highest period of trade of which england is now possessed there are very extensive branches of commerce which bring no new accession of numbers to the commonwealth i mean all those branches of commerce where money is sent and exchanged for foreign goods this species of trade occasions little increase of labor and therefore less of numbers except only of those few who navigate the vessels thus employed to their respective ports and as this kind of trade will always grow and predominate in proportion as a nation becomes more luxurious and effeminate so for this reason the highest stage of trade is not naturally attended with the highest increase of labor nor consequently of numbers as is commonly imagined besides this in the refined period additional art and experience in labor prevent in some measure the increase of numbers by the invention of machines an equal degree both of tillage and trade is carried on by fewer hands than in the simpler periods and therefore the increase of numbers is by no means proportional to the increase of commerce and wealth  but these are far from being the only considerations worth our notice on this subject for when we speak of any stage of trade we must in reason take in every circumstance which naturally attends it there are other causes therefore why numbers increase not but rather naturally diminish in the highest period of trade and wealth  for first the vanity and effeminacy which this exorbitant pitch of wealth brings on lessens the desire of marriage  secondly the intemperance and disease which this period of trade naturally produces among the lower ranks in great cities bring on in some degree an impotence of propagation  thirdly this debility is always attended with a shortness of life both in the parents and the offspring and therefore a still farther diminution of numbers follows on the whole  matter of fact confirms these reasonings and lies open to every mans observation since the first increase of tillage and homemanufactures the increase of inhabitants has been great in england since the vast increase of foreign commerce the increase of numbers is hardly perceivable nay there is great reason to believe that upon the whole the nation is less populous than it was fifty years ago though it is trade perhaps is doubled some trading towns indeed are better peopled but others are thinned by the flux of commerce the metropolis seems to augment in its dimensions but it appears by the best calculations that it is numbers are diminished and as to the villages through england there is great reason to believe they are in general at a stand and many of them thinner of inhabitants than in the beginning of this century it is hard to obtain certainty in this particular without a general examination and comparison but it appears by the registers of some country parishes which i have looked into that from the year    0 to    0 the number of inhabitants increased gradually the two extremes being to each other as    to    and that from    0 to the present time the number has been at a stand if not rather diminished  but suppose what there is no reason to believe that our present excess of trade and overflow of wealth have in some degree increased our numbers yet it will probably appear that they have as much at least impaired our bodily strength for as temperance is the ruling character of the middle stage of commerce so is intemperance of the highest hence health and strength prevail in the first disease and debility in the latter this is universally confirmed by fact villages abounding with health commercial cities with disease so that an army taken from the villages with equal commanders arms and discipline would drive the same number of debilitated gindrinkers like a flock of geese before them  the author of the fable of the bees made his boast that the wisdom of the legislature had upon his plan adopted the encouragement of this pernicious liquid but the same wisdom has upon trial been obliged to discourage the use of this malignant spirit as they found that it ruined the health and shortened the lives of half the lower ranks in london  and all good men hope that the time will come when this infernal potion will be laid under such discouragements as may amount to a general prohibition the necessity of such a reformation grows greater every day not only in london but throughout the kingdom for in some villages in england there is now a greater quantity of gin consumed than of ale  but to quit these inferior considerations though they all unite in confirming the theory here advanced the weight of the reply lies indeed in another circumstance for although we should admit what is not true that our present exorbitance of trade and wealth increased our numbers and bodily force yet as the real and essential strength of a nation consists in the manners and principles of it is leading part and as our present excess of trade and wealth has produced such fatal effects on these manners and principles no increase of numbers in the inferior ranks can possibly make amends for this internal and capital defect such a nation can at best only resemble a large body actuated yet hardly actuated by an incapable a vain a dastardly and effeminate soul  but the maxim we are engaged to obviate alleges farther that this exorbitant increase of trade and wealth enables a nation to pay it is fleets and armies and afford continual supplies for war yet even this part of the maxim in it is modern acceptance is far beyond the truth  for under the present stage of trade the increase of wealth is by no means equally or proportionally diffused the trader reaps the main profit after him the landlord in a lower degree but the common artificer and still more the common labourer gain little by the exorbitant advance of trade it is true their wages are increased but so are the prices of provisions too and therefore they are no richer than before now taxes and public supplies are raised upon the consumer and as it appears from hence that only a few of the consumers are made richer by the exorbitance of trade it follows that not the nation in general but a select number of individuals only are made more capable of contributing to those supplies which are levied without distinction on the whole would they who reap the plenteous harvest of foreign trade generously allot their proportional and extraordinary gains to the service of the public we should then indeed be furnished with a new argument in favor of commerce in it is highest pitch  farther as the laboring ranks are little or nothing enriched by the exorbitant degree of trade so it often happens that even the higher ranks and the nation in general are not more nay perhaps less enabled to contribute to the public supplies than when possessed of wealth in a more moderate degree for we have seen in the progress of this estimate that the natural effect of an increase of wealth is an increase of luxury vanity and expense which if it outrun the increase of wealth as in it is nature it tends to do instead of riches will bring on public poverty for the ability or wealth of a people considered in their capacity for raising supplies consists not in the largeness of their income but in the proportion of their expenses to their income it consists not in what they have but what they can spare hence it appears that a nation may be at once very rich and very poor rich in income but poor through extravagance and as national extravagance is the natural effect of an overflow of wealth so national indigence is it is most natural and final consequence how far this is our present situation can hardly be necessary to affirm  to this argument it may possibly be objected that if great wealth is but among us new imposts will naturally force it into circulation that the more the artificers and laborers are taxed the more their wages will increase and consequently their ability to bear the increasing taxes and that as to the higher ranks exorbitant wealth enables them still better to endure additional imposts because these deprive the great of nothing but the superfluities of vanity and luxury  to this it is replied that in case of additional taxes though the poor must indeed increase their wages in order to subsist yet this increase never takes place till they are compelled by the last necessity and want the natural consequence of which must be murmurs sedition and tumults with regard to the higher ranks a parallel reply may suffice for in the refined period when manners and principles are lost the luxuries of life become necessaries among the great and therefore will be as obstinately adhered to and quitted with the same reluctance as food and clothing by the poor the consequence therefore must be the same a general discontent and disaffection to the government among the higher ranks of life  is not all this confirmed by evident facts there is at present in this nation a mass of wealth at least twelve times more than the public debt yet we are reduced to the sad necessity of plunging deeper every day what is the reason no ministry dares to provoke and exasperate a luxurious and selfish nation by demanding such sums as every one has the power had he but the will to bestow  but beyond all this will any man of sense assert that the circumstance of paying an army or a fleet is the one thing that will decide a war it is true indeed provisions arms ammunition are necessary and therefore wealth because it procures them but will a general or admiral therefore gain the victory only because his men are furnished with provisions arms and ammunition if not what can trade or wealth do toward making a nation victorious again therefore let me remind my countrymen that the capital question still remains not who shall pay but who shall fight  there is a trite observation on foot indeed drawn from the best political writers ill understood that the principles of war are wholly changed and that not the nation who has the best troops but the longest purse will in the end obtain the victory this in the modern application of it is a most dangerous maxim it naturally tends to extinguish military skill as well as honor and will inevitably sink the people that maintains it into a naton of defenseless and moneygetting cowards  it must be confessed that doctor davenant the most able writer on these subjects has affirmed that now the whole art of war is in a manner reduced to money and nowadays that prince who can best find money to feed cloth and pay his army not he that has the most valiant troops is surest of success and conquest ways and means p    v ii p     this declaration which is now stolen and retailed for new by every modern dabler in politics has had the usual fortune of these kind of thefts to be misunderstood as may appear from the general tenor of the doctors writings to show this two instances out of many may suffice even when speaking on the benefits of foreign trade he warns us as if he had foreseen all that has befallen or is likely to befall us for he says if a trading and rich people are grown soft and luxurious their wealth will invite over to them invaders from abroad and their being effeminate will make the conquest easy dav on trade  and again in terms yet stronger in succeeding times our manners may come to be depraved and when this happens all sorts of miseries will invade us the whole wealth of the kingdom will not be sufficient for it is defense ibid p       thus what he and other sensible writers have affirmed under proper restrictions and upon supposition that a nation maintained it is manners and principles is now advanced absolutely and without restriction as if manners and principles military and naval skill and courage had no part or at least no essential part in the success of war  these shallow politicians therefore might well be put in mind of the maxim of a warlike prince when his ministers dissuaded him from attacking a wealthy enemy because he wanted money to pay his troops my enemies said he are rich luxurious and effeminate my troops are valiant and hardy my officers brave and honorable they shall plant my standard in my enemys country and then my enemy shall pay them  we have lately seen this military conduct followed by a brave king in the electorate of saxony we ourselves have formerly pursued it on the plains of agincourt and cressi the french are now pursuing it on the plains of america and if we hold to our dastardly maxim they will pursue it on the plains of salisbury  thus the boasted modern maxim which we proposed to obviate seems void of truth in every branch of it as it appears from this view that without the internal strength which manners and principles produce the most exorbitant trade and wealth can never be the foundation of a successful war or give us any rational prospect either of victory or selfdefence  sect ix another objection considered such then are the natural effects of exorbitant trade and wealth unless counteracted by opposite manners or principles the history of our own nation would confirm these truths in a most striking and particular manner were it within the proposed limits of this estimate to enter so large a field of enquiry we should there see that manners and principles have always prevailed and baffled the most sanguine attempts of wealth when set in competition with them this system would be found supported by a vast variety of events from the reign of elizabeth to the present times but this might perhaps be regarded as a research rather curious than necessary since a single reflection on the present state of the kingdom may seem to stand in the place of a thousand proofs  at present therefore we shall not touch on this enquiry but rather proceed to remove another objection which may seem to overturn the theory here proposed  for it is urged that france is an exception to the truth of these remarks inasmuch as in the midst of a large and extensive commerce which brings in a vast accession of wealth she stills retains her principles and power  the fact objected is true but the consequence follows not because the trade of france is limited and controuled by such accidents as prevent it is most dangerous and ruinous effects on government  the poverty of its noblesse or leading ranks who are often possessed of sounding titles without any realities annexed as it prevents them from reaping that increase of wealth which naturally arises to a rich landed gentry from an increase of commerce so it naturally drives them to the profession of arms as the necessary means of support this strengthens and supports their monarchy which finding it is advantage from this disposition to arms naturally gratifies this military spirit in it is noblesse and gives it exercise and encouragement by frequent wars  hence the national spirit of the french noblesse has long been military in the highest degree  with regard to commerce it is growth in france has been but late meeting therefore with this established spirit of arms in the leading ranks it has not as yet been able to control it commerce indeed is encouraged but so encouraged as not to destroy the leading principle of their monarchy to this end the ranks of the kingdom are kept essentially distinguished and while the people are allured to trade by every kind of motive the noblesse or gentry are in honor prohibited from commerce it was indeed formerly proposed in france that the noblesse should be drawn down to trade but whether through deep and consummate policy or through the principle of honor itself working blindly for it is own preservation the dangerous proposal was weakly or wisely rejected whenever this overture meets with acceptance and success though it may seem for a while to give vigor to their state yet from that period we may date the downfall of france their effeminate manners now controuled by economy and the love of glory will like ours degenerate into profusion and the love of gold  on the contrary trade though encouraged is by the ruling principle of this great monarchy kept within it is proper limits and while the merchant traverseth seas in pursuit of gain the gentleman does the same in pursuit of glory thus the two incompatible provinces are kept distinct and hence while the french vie with us in trade they tower above us in principle  nay their very trading settlements among foreign nations are actuated by this ruling principle in such a manner as to give a splendour to their monarchy and commerce in the most barbarous climates numerous proofs might be given of this at present it may suffice to take one from a very fine book lately published it is usual among the french of alexandria to show an extreme respect for their consul in order to make him more considerable in the eyes of the turks and of the other nations they endeavor to give an high idea of his person and to illustrate his birth in such a manner that it is not their fault if he is not considered as issued from the blood royal if by chance he take a tour to rosetto he carries a white flag at the mast of his pinnace and when he goes out of the port as likewise when he returns into it he is saluted by a general discharge of the cannon of the french vessels nordens travels in egypt and nubia vol i p     thus while we are poorly influenced by a sorry and mercantile maxim first broached by a trading minister that the interest of a nation is it is truest honorthe french conduct themselves on an opposite and higher principle that the honor of a nation is its truest interest  in confirmation of what is here advanced we need only cast our eyes on the fortune and fate of france during the present century in the last war she was exhausted though victorious in the former she was both beaten and exhausted in both these instances it was weakly thought by every superficial politician in england that because we had exhausted the men and money we had destroyed the power of france experience has told us the reverse the spirit of honor and union working at the root soon restored those branches that war had swept away and have at length shot them into their former vigor and luxuriancy  hence then we may learn an important truth that no incidental events can make a nation little while the principles remain that made it great  sect x the conclusion from these accumulated proofs then it seems evident that our present effeminate manners and defect of principle have arisen from our exorbitant trade and wealth left without check to their natural operations and uncontrouled influence and that these manners and this defect of principle by weakening or destroying the national capacity spirit of defense and union have produced such a general debility as naturally leads to destruction  we might now proceed to confirm these reasonings by examples drawn from history for there is hardly an ancient or modern state of any note recorded in story which would not in one respect or other confirm the leading principles on which this argument is built  in these throughout their several periods we should see trade and wealth or what is in this respect equivalent conquest and opulence taking their progress at one period polishing and strengthening at another refining corrupting weakening destroying the state that gave them entrance working indeed in different ways and under a variety of appearances by avarice by faction by effeminacy by profligacy by a mixture and combination of all these evils sometimes dividing a nation against itself at others quelling it is spirit and leaving it an easy prey to the first invader sometimes checked by a rising patriot or counterworked by national misfortunes in one country corrupting manners in another principles in a third both manners and principles rendering one people blind another cowardly another treacherous to itself stealing secretly and insensibly on one nation overwhelming another in sudden destruction  but to enlarge on these subjects in that vague and undistinguishing manner which most writers have pursued in treating them though it might carry the appearance of reasoning would in truth be no more than declamation in disguise and to develope and unravel the particularity of causes and effects through all their variety of combination and mutual influence as it would extend this estimate beyond it is designed limits must be left to make a part of some future enquiry  the character effects and sources of our manners and principles being thus laid open the writer had it in his thoughts to have proceeded to the consideration of their most practicable remedies but as the closet projects of retired and speculative men often are and always are reguarded as chimerical he was therefore unwilling at present to hazard the discredit of such an attempt  however lest his attempt should be deemed more visionary than perhaps it is he judged it not improper to hint at some of the leading principles on which it is built and with this view the following reflections are submitted to the consideration of the public  the world has been long amused with a trite and hacknied comparison between the life of man and that of states in which it is pretended that they both proceed in the same irrevocable manner from infancy to maturity from maturity to death a comparison perhaps as groundless as it is common the human body contains in its very texture the seeds of certain dissolution that is though you set aside all the possible accidents arising from intemperance from the influence of the elements the climate and every other external and contingent cause the human frame itself after a certain period would grow into rigidity the fluids would decrease the solids accumulate the arteries ossify the blood stagnate and the wheels of life stand still  but in societies of whatever kind there seems no such necessary or essential tendency to dissolution the human body is naturally mortal the political only so by accident internal disorders or diseases may arise external violence may attack or overpower but these causes though always to be expected are wholly incidental the first is precisely of the same nature as intemperance the second as the influence of the external elements on the human body but there appears nothing in the internal construction of any state that tends inevitably to dissolution analogous to those causes in the human frame which lead to certain death  this observation seems confirmed by history where you see states which after being sunk in corruption and debility have been brought back to the vigor of their first principles but you must have recourse to fables for medicated old age restored to infancy or youth  if this be true it seems not altogether chimerical though confessedly difficult to bring about the reformation of a state to lay down general rules in such a case would be like giving a panacea the very empiricism of politics the remedies must be suited to the disease  we have seen that the ruling evils of our age and nation have arisen from the unheeded consequences of our trade and wealth that these have produced effeminate manners and occasioned loss of principle that these have brought on a national debility but would the lessening this exorbitant trade and wealth bring back manners and principles and restore the nations strength  i very much question the event  but whatever the consequences might be at home those abroad would certainly be fatal the french are every day gaining upon us in commerce and if ours should lessen theirs would increase to our destruction  thus are we fallen into a kind of dilemma if our commerce be maintained or increased its effects bid fair to destroy us if commerce be discouraged and lessened the growing power of our enemy threatens the same consequence  there seems then no other expedient than this that commerce and wealth be not discouraged in their growth but checked and controuled in their effects  and even in attempting this care must be had lest in controuling the effects of commerce we should destroy commerce itself  we see how strongly the natural effects of trade and wealth are controuled in france by proper checks and counteracting principles yet mere imitation is always a narrow and often an ineffectual scheme besides as our constitution is of a superior nature so our manners and principles must be adapted to it ere it can obtain it is proper strength  the virtues yet left among us and enumerated above see part i sect        may be a possible foundation for such a change  there are two different kinds of remedies which might in due time be applied the first are radical general and lasting the latter palliative particular and temporary  the first seem totally impracticable at present for as they suppose a change of manners and principles this may justly be regarded as an impossible event during the present age and rather to be wished than hoped for in the next  the palliative particular and temporary remedies may seem more practicable at this juncture i mean those which are of the coercive kind which work by opposed passions or by destroying the opportunities or occasions of evil where the ruling mischiefs lie among the people these remedies with proper care may easily be administered thus we have lately seen the salutary effects of a new kind of police established by a useful magistrate in the city of london by which the reigning evil of streetrobberies has been almost wholly suppressed although we may reasonably suppose the disposition toward them remains as strong as ever  but where the ruling mischief desolates the great there even the palliative remedies cannot easily be applied the reason is manifest a coercive power is wanting they who should cure the evil are the very delinquents and moral or political physic is what no distempered mind will ever administer to itself  necessity therefore and necessity alone must in such a case be the parent of reformation so long as degenerate and unprincipled manners can support themselves they will be deaf to reason blind to consequences and obstinate in the long established pursuit of gain and pleasure in such minds the idea of a public has no place and therefore can never be a curb to private gratification nor can such minds be ever awakened from their fatal dream till either the voice of an abused people rouse them into fear or the state itself totter through the general incapacity cowardice and disunion of those who should support it  whenever this compelling power necessity shall appear then and not till then may we hope that our deliverance is at hand effeminacy rapacity and faction will then be ready to resign the reins they would now usurp one common danger will create one common interest virtue may rise on the ruins of corruption and a despairing nation yet be saved by the wisdom the integrity and unshaken courage of some great minister  finis books printed for l davis and c reymers booksellers in holborn essays on the characteristics of the earl of shaftsbury i on ridicule considered as a test
