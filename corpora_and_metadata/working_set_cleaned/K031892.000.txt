j clark    a bold stroke for a wife a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in lincolnsinnfields  by the author of the busiebody and the gamester  omnia vincit amor the second edition  london printed for w meres and f clay without temple bar mdccxxiv price one shilling  to his grace philip duke and marquis of wharton etc my lord it has ever been the custom of poets to shelter productions of this nature under the patronage of the brightest men of their time and it is observed that the muses always met the kindest reception from persons of the greatest merit the world will do me justice as to the choice of my patron but will i fear blame my rash attempt in daring to address your grace and offer at a work too difficult for our ablest pens viz an encomium on your grace i have no plea against such just reflections but the disadvantage of education and the privilege of my sex  if your grace discovers a genius so surprising in this dawn of life what must your riper years produce your grace has already been distinguished in a most peculiar manner being the first young nobleman that ever was admitted into a house of peers before he reached the age of one and twenty but your graces judgment and eloquence soon convinced that august assembly that the excelling gifts of nature ought not to be confined to time we hope the example which ireland has set will shortly be followed by an english house of lords and your grace made a member of that body to which you will be so conspicuous an ornament  your good sense and real love for your country taught your grace to persevere in the principles of your glorious ancestors by adhering to the defender of our religion and laws and the penetrating wisdom of your royal master saw you merited your honors ere he conferred them it is one of the greatest glories of a monarch to distinguish where to bestow his favors and the world must do ours justice by owning your graces titles most deservedly worn  it is with the greatest pleasure imaginable the friends of liberty see you pursuing the steps of your noble father your courteous affable temper free from pride and ostentation makes your name adored in the country and enables your grace to carry what point you please the late lord wharton will be still remembered by every lover of his country which never felt a greater shock than what his death occasioned their grief had been inconsolable if heaven out of its wonted beneficence to this favorite isle had not transmitted all his shining qualities to you and phoenix like raised up one patriot out of the ashes of another  that your grace has a high esteem for learning particularly appears by the large progress you have made therein and your love for the muses shows a sweetness of temper and generous humanity peculiar to the greatness of your soul for such virtues reign not in the breast of every man of quality  defer no longer then my lord to charm the world with the beauty of your numbers and show the poet as you have done the orator convince our unthinking britous by what vile arts france lost her liberty and teach em to avoid their own misfortunes as well as to weep over henry iv who if it were possible for him to know would forgive the bold assassins hand for the honor of having his fall celebrated by your graces pen  to be distinguished by persons of your graces character is not only the highest ambition but the greatest reputation to an author and it is not the least of my vanities to have it known to the public i had your graces leave to prefix your name to this comedy  i wish i were capable to cloth the following scenes in such a dress as might be worthy to appear before your grace and draw your attention as much as your graces admirable qualifications do that of all mankind but the muses like most females are least liberal to their own sex  all i dare say in favor of this piece is that the plot is entirely new and the incidents wholly owing to my own invention not borrowed from our own or translated from the works of any foreign poet so that they have at least the charm of novelty to recommend em if they are so lucky in some leisure hour to give your grace the least diversion they will answer the utmost ambition of my lord  your graces most obedient most devoted and most humble servant susanna centlivre  rrologue by a gentleman spoken by mrs thurmond tonight we come upon a bold design to try to please without one borrowed line our plot is new and regularly clear and not one single tittle from moliere over buried poets we with caution tread and parish sextons leave to rob the dead for you bright british fair in hopes to charm ye we bring tonight a lover from the army you know the soldiers have the strangest arts such a proportion of prevailing parts you would think that they rid post to womens hearts i wonder whence they draw their bold pretense we do not choose them sure for our defense that plea is both impolitick and wrong and only suits such dames as want a tongue is it their eloquence and fine address the softness of their language  nothing less is it their courage that they bravely dare to storm the sex at once  egad it is there they act by us as in the rough campaign unmindful of repulses charge again they mine and countermine resolved to win and if a breach is made  they will come in you will think by what we have of soldiers said our female wit was in the service bred but she is to the hardy toil a stranger she loves the cloth indeed but hates the danger yet to this circle of the brave and gay she bid me for her good intentions say she hopes you will not reduce her to halfpay as for our play it is english humor all then will you let our manufacture fall would you the honor of our nation raise keep english credit up and english plays

could never yet bring my self to join with either party   col you are perfectly in the right sir philip  a fine person should not embark himself in the slovenly concern of politics dress and pleasure are objects proper for the soul of a fine gentleman   sir phil and love    col oh that is included under the article of pleasure   sir phil parbleu il est un homme desprit i must embrace you  rises

all countries    col there are some finished beauties i confess in france italy germany nay even in holland mais sont bien rare but les belles angloises  oh sir philip where find we such women such symetry of shape such elegancy of dress such regularity of features such sweetness of temper such commanding eyes and such bewitching smiles   sir phil ah parbleu vous estez attraper   col non je vous

support that branch of pleasure which was imported with their peace and since naturalized by the ingenious mr heidegger   sir phil the ladies assure me it will become part of the constitution  upon which i subscribed a hundred guineas  it will be of great service to the public at least to the company of surgeons and the city in general   col ha ha it may help to ennoble the blood of the city are

aside   sir phil and i have the honor to be very well with the ladies i can assure you sir and i will not affront a million of fine women to make one happy   col nay marriage is really reducing a mans taste to a kind of half pleasure but then it carries the blessing of peace along with it one goes to sleep without fear and wakes without pain   sir phil there is something of that in it a wife is a
