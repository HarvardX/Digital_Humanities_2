an extract of the life and death of mr john janeway fellow of kingscollege in cambridge  by james wheatley  norwich printed by william chase       an extract of the life and death of mr john janeway chap i an account of him from his childhood to the seventeenth year of his age mr john janeway was born in the year      october    of religious parents in tylly in the county of hertford he soon gave his parents the hope of much comfort and the symptoms of something more than ordinary quickly appeared in him so that some who saw this child much feared that his life would be but short others hoped that god had some work to do by or for him he showed that neither of them were mistaken in their conjectures concerning him he soon outran his superiors for age in learning and it was thought by no incompetent judges that for pregnancy of wit solidity of judgment the vastness of his intellectuals and the greatness of his memory he had no superiors and few equals considering his age and education  he was initiated in the latin tongue by his father afterward he was brought up in st pauls school in london where he made a considerable proficiency in latin and greek under the care of mr langley when he was about eleven years old he took a great fancy to arithmetic and the hebrew tongue  about this time his parents removing into a little village called aspoden had the opportunity of having their son instructed by a learned neighbor who was pleased to count it a diversion to read mathematics to him being then about twelve years old and he made such progress in those studies that he read oughtred with understanding before he was thirteen years old a person of quality hearing of the admirable proficiency of this boy sent for him up to london and kept him with him for some time to read mathematics to him that which made him the more to be admired was that he did what he did with the greatest facility he had no small skill in music and other concomitants of the mathematics  in the year      he was chosen by mr rous the provost of eaton college one of the foundation of that school where he gave no unsuitable returns to the high expectation that was conceived of him  after a little continuance at eaton he obtained leave of his master to go to oxford to perfect himself in the study of mathematics where being with dr ward one of the professors of the university he attained to a strange exactness in that study nothing being within the reach of a man but he would undertake and grasp the doctor looked upon him as one of the wonders of his age loved him dearly and could not for some time after his death scarce mention his name without tears when he had spent about a quarter of a year with dr ward at oxford he was commanded to return to eaton where he soon gave proof of his improvement of his time while he was absent by calculating of the eclipses for many years before hand so that by this time he had many eyes upon him as the glory of the school yet he did not discover the least affectation or selfconceit neither did any discernable pride attend these excellencies so that every one took more notice of his parts than himself  at about seventeen years old he was chose to kings college in cambridge at which time the electors did even contend for the patronage of this scholar he was chosen first that year and an elder brother of his in the sixth place but he was very willing to change places with his elder brother letting him have the first and thankfully accepting of the sixth place  besides his great learning and many other ornaments of nature his deportment was so sweet and lovely his demeanor so courteous and obliging many of them who had little kindness for morality much less for grace could not but speak well of him his great wisdom and learning did even command respect he had an excellent power over his passions and was in a great measure free from the vice which usually attends such an age and place  but all this while he understood little of the worth of christ and his own soul he studied indeed the heavens and knew the motion of the sun moon and stars but he thought little of god who made these things or of his own heart he did not as yet much busy himself in the serious observation of the wandering of his spirit the creature had not yet led him to the creator he was still too ready to take up with mere speculation but god when he was about eighteen years old shone in upon his soul with power and convinced him what a poor thing it was to know so much of the heavens and never come there and that the greatest knowledge in the world without christ was but an empty dry business he now thought mr bolton had some reasons on his side when he said give me the most magnificent glorious worlding that ever trod upon earthly mould richly crowned with all the ornaments and excellencies of nature art policy preferment or what heart can wish besides yet without the life of grace to animate and enable them he were to the eye of heavenly wisdom but as a rotten carcass stuck over with flowers magnified dung gilded rottenness golden damnation he began now to be of anaxagorass mind that his work upon earth was to study heaven and get thither and that except a man might be admitted to greater preferment than this world can bestow it was not worth the while to be born  chap ii of his conversion and carriage when fellow of the college the great work of conversion was not carried on upon his soul in that dreadful manner that it is upon some but the lord was pleased sweetly to unlock his heart by the exemplary life and heavenly discourse of a young man in the college whose heart god had enflamed with love to his soul he quickly made an attempt upon this yung man and the spirit of god set home his counsels with such power that they proved effectual for his awakening being accompanied with the preaching of dr hill and dr arrowsmith together with the reading of mr baxters saints everlasting rest  now a mighty alteration might easily be discerned in him he began not to taste so much sweetness in those kind of studies which he so greedily employed himself in formerly he began to pity them who were curious in their enquiries after every thing but that which is most needful to be known christ and themselves and that which sometimes was his gain he now counted loss for christ yea doubtless he esteemed all things but as dung and dross in comparison of christ and desired to know nothing but christ and him crucified not that he looked upon human learning as useless but when fixed below christ and not improved for christ he looked upon wisdom as folly and learning as madness and that which would make one more like the devil and more fit for his service  mr janeway now considered how he might best improve what he did already know and turn all his studies into the right channel grace did not take him off from but made him more diligent and spiritual in his study and now christ was at the end and bottom of every thing how did he plot and contrive how he might most express his love and thankfulness to him who had brought him out of darkness into his mavelous light to this end he sent up and down packets of divine letters in which he did discourse so substantially and experimentally of the great things of god that it would not at all have unbecome some gray head to have owned what he wrote  he was not a little like young elihu in whose words he used to excuse his freedom with persons of years whose souls he dearly pitied he said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in a man and the inspiration of the almighty gives them understanding i am full of matter the spirit within me constrains me behold my belly is as wine which has no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles i will speak that i may be refreshed o then how sweet was the savor of his graces he could not but speak the things which he had seen and heard and even invite all the world to taste and see how good the lord was  he began first with his relations begging and wooing of them to think of their immortal souls and to lay in speedy provisions for a deathbed and eternity oh with what compassion did he plead the cause of christ with their souls what pathetick expressions did he use what vehement expostulations how frequent how particular in his applications to them o with what gravity and majesty would he speak of the mysteries of the gospel  read what his language was when he was between eighteen and nineteen years old in a letter to a friend that had the care of many children  sir your charge is great upon a temporal account but greater upon a spiritual out of an earnest desire of the good of souls and your own joy and peace i importunately request that you should have a great care of your children and be often dropping in some wholesome admonitions and this i humbly with submission to your judgment in it commend to you not to admonish them always together but likewise privately one by one wherein you may please to press upon them their natural corruption the necessity of regeneration the excellency of christ and how unspeakably lovely it is to see young ones sitting out for heaven this way i think may do most good having had experience of it myself in some small measure god grant that all may work for the edifying of those who are committed to you i leave you under the protection of him that has loved us and given himself for us    when he was about twenty years old he was made fellow of the college which did not a little advance those noble projects which he had for the promoting of the interest of the lord christ then how sweetly would he insinuate into the young ones desiring to carry as many of them as possible he could along with him to heaven many attempts he made upon some of the same house that he might season them with grace and animate and encourage those who were looking toward heaven and as for his own relations never was there a more compassionate and tenderhearted brother how many pathetick letters did he send to them and how did he follow them with prayers and tears  read what his heart was in the following lines  distance of place cannot at all lessen that natural bond whereby we are conjoined in blood neither ought to lessen that of love nay where true love is it cannot for love toward you i can only say this that i feel it better than i can express it but love felt and not expressed is little worth i therefore desire to make my love manifest in the best way i can let us look upon one another not as brethren only but as members of the same body whereof christ is the head let us therefore breath and hunger after him so that our close knot may meet in christ if we are in christ and christ in us then we shall be one with one another this i know you cannot complain for want of instruction god has not been to us a dry wilderness you have had line upon line and precept upon precept he has planted you by the rivers of water it is the lord alone indeed who makes fruitful but yet we are not to stand still and do nothing there is a crown worth looking for seek therefore and that earnestly oh seek by continual prayer keep your soul in a praying frame this is a great and necessary duty nay a high and precious privilege if thou can say nothing come and lay thyself in an humble manner before the lord you may believe me for i have experienced what i say there is more sweetness in one glimpse of gods love than in all that the world can afford oh do but try oh taste and see how good the lord is get into a corner and throw yourself down before the lord and beg of god to make you sensible of your lost state by nature and of the excellency and necessity of christ say lord give me a broken heart soften and melt me any thing in the world so i may be but enabled to value christ and be persuaded to accept of him as he is tendered in the gospel o that i may be delivered from the wrath to come oh a blessing for me even for me and resolve not to be content till the lord have in some measure answered you oh my bowels yearn toward you oh that you did but know with what affection i write now unto you and what prayers and tears are mingled with these lines the lord set these things home and give you an heart to apply them to yourself the lord bless all the means that you enjoy for his blessing is all in all give me leave to deal plainly and to come yet a little close to you for i love your soul so well that i cannot bear the thoughts of the loss of it know this that except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven gods favor is not to be recovered without it this new birth has its foundation laid in a sense of sin and a godly sorrow for it and a heart set against it without this there can be no salvation look well about you and see into yourself and thou will see that thou art at hells mouth without this first step and nothing but free grace and pure mercy is between you and the state of the devils the lord deliver us from a secure careless heart here you see a natural mans condition how dare thou then lie down in security oh look about for your souls sake what shall i say what shall i do to awaken your poor soul i say again wthout repentance there is no remission and repentance itself may lose its labor if it be not in the right manner tears and groans and prayers will not do without christ most when they are convinced of sin and are under fears of hell reform something and thus the wound is healed and by this thousands fall short of heaven for if we be not brought off from ourselves and our righteousness as well as our sins we are never like to be saved we must see an absolute need of a christ and give ourselves up to him and count all but dung and dross in comparison of christs righteousness look therefore for mercy only in christ for his sake rely upon gods mercy the terms of the gospel are repent and believe gracious terms mercy for fetching nay mercy for desiring nay for nonothing but receiving do thou desire mercy and grace i know thou do even this is the gift of god to desire hunger after christ let desires put you upon endeavors the work itself is sweet yea repentance and mourning itself has more sweetness in it than all the worlds comforts upon repentance and believing comes justification after this sanctification by the spirit dwelling in us by this we come to be the children of god to be made partaker of the divine nature to lead new lives to have a suitableness to god it is unworthy a christian to have such a narrow spirit as not to act for christ with all ones heart and soul and strength be not ashamed of christ be not afraid of the frowns and scoffs of the wicked be sure to keep a conscience void of offense and by no means yield to any known sin be much in prayer and in secret prayer and in reading the scriptures therein are laid up the glorious mysteries which are hid from many eyes my greatest desire is that god would work his own great work in you i desire to see you not as formerly but that the lord would make me an instrument of your souls good for which i grealy long chap iii his great love to prayer he was mighty in prayer and his spirit was oftentimes so transported in it that he forgot the weakness of his own body and of other spirits indeed the acquaintance that he had with god was so sweet and his converse with him so frequent that when he was engaged in duty he scarce knew how to leave that which was so delightful to his spirit his constant course for some years was this he prayed at least three times a day in secret sometimes seven times twice a day in the family or college and he found the sweetness of it beyond imagination and enjoyed wonderful communion with god he could say by experience that the ways of wisdom were ways of pleasantness and all her paths peace he knew what it was to wrestle with god and he could scarce come off his knees without his fathers blessing he was used to converse with god with a holy familiarity as a friend and would upon all occasions run to him for advice and had many strange and immediate answers of prayer one of which i think it not impertinent to give an account of  his honored father mr william janeway minister of kelshall in hartfordshire being sick and being under somewhat dark apprehensions as to the state of his soul he would often say to his son john oh son this passing into eternity is a great thing this dying is a solemn business and enough to make ones heart ache that has not his pardon sealed and his evidences for heaven clear and truly son i am under no small fears as to my own estate for another world oh that god would clear his love oh that i could say cheerfully i can die and upon good grounds be able to look death in the face and venture upon eternity with wellgrounded peace and comfort  seeing his father continuing under despondings of spirit though no christians that knew him but had a high esteem of him for his uprightness he got by himself and spent some time in wrestling with god upon his account earnestly begging of god that he would fill him with joy unspeakable in believing and that he would speedily give him some token for good that he might joyfully and honorably leave this world after he was risen from his knees he came down to his father and asked him how he felt himself his father made no answer for some time but wept exceedingly a passion that he was not subject to and continued for some considerable time weeping so that he was not able to speak but at last having recovered himself with unspeakably joy he burst out oh son now it is come it is come it is come i bless god i can die the spirit of god has witnessed with my spirit that i am his child now i can look up to god as my dear father and christ as my redeemer i can now say this is my friend and this is my beloved my heart is full it is brim full i can hold no more i know now what that sentence means the peace of god which passes all understanding i know now what that white stone is wherein a new name was written which none know but they who have it and that fit of weeping which you saw in me was a fit of overpowered love and joy so great that i could not contain myself neither can i express what glorious discoveries god had made of himself unto me and had that joy been greater i question whether i could have born it and whether it would not have separated soul and body bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name that has pardoned all my sins and sealed the pardon he has healed my wounds and caused the bones which he had broken to rejoice oh help me to bless the lord he has put a new song into my mouth oh bless the lord for his infinite goodness oh now i can die it is nothing i bless god i can die i desire to be dissolved and to be with christ you may well think that his sons heart was not a little refreshed to hear such words and see such a sight and to meet the messenger that he had sent to heaven returned back again so speedily it was so immediate and clear an answer of his own prayers as if god had said unto him thy tears and prayers are heard for thy father thou have like a prince prevailed with god thou have god the blessing go down and see  upon this the young man too broke forth into praises and even into an ecstasy of joy that god should deal so familiarly with him and the father and son together were so full of joy light life love and praise that there was a little heaven in the place he could not then but express himself in this manner oh blessed for ever blessed be god for his infinite grace oh who would not pray unto god verily he is a god that hears prayers and that my soul knows right well and then he told his joyful father how much he was affected with his former despondings and what he had been praying for just before with all the earnestness he could his father hearing this and perceiving that his former comforts came by prayer and his own childs prayer too was the more refreshed and the more confirmed that it was from the spirit of god and no delusion and immediately his son standing by he fell into another fit of triumphing joy his weak body being almost ready to sink under that great weight of glory that shone in so powerfully upon his soul he could then say now let thy servant depart in peace for my eyes have seen thy salvation he could now walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil oh how sweet a thing is it to have ones interest in christ cleared how comfortable to have our calling and election made sure how lovely is the sight of a smiling jesus when one is dying how refreshing is it when heart and flesh and all are failing to have god for the strength of our heart and our portion for ever oh did the foolish unexperienced world but know what these things mean did they but understand what it is to have their senses spiritually exercised could they but taste and see how good the lord is it would soon cause them to disrelish their low and brutish pleasures and look upon all worldly joys as infinitely short of one glimpse of gods love after this his father had a sweet calm upon his spirits and went in the strength of that provision till he came within the gates of the new jerusalem having all his graces greatly improved and showed so much humility love of god contempt of the world such prizing of christ such patience as few christians arrive to especially his faith by which with extraordinary confidence he cast his widow and eleven fatherless children upon the care of that god who had fed him with this manna in his wildernessstate the benefit of which faith all his children none of which were in his lifetime provided for have since experienced and it is scarce to be imagined how helpful this his son was to his father by his heavenly discourse humble advice and prayers after four months conflict with a consumption he sweetly slept in jesus  after the death of his father he did what he could to supply his absence doing the part of a husband son and brother so that he was no small comfort to his poor mother in her disconsolate state and all the rest of his relations that had any sense of god upon their spirits to one of which he thus addresseth himself upon the death of a sweet child  he that in afflictions would find comfort must strive to see spiritual comforts to be the greatest even that comfort which is from god in the face of jesus christ this this will be a cordial this will be as marrow and fatness to the soul they who have an interest in christ what need they be moved with any worldly trouble is not christ better than ten children is not his loving kindness better than life is not all the world a shadow compared with one hours enjoyment of him even on this side of glory o therefore strive to get your interest in this comfort secured and then all is well he that has christ has all things if god be reconciled to you through him then he will withold no good thing from you  we poor foolish creatures do scarce know what is good for ourselves but it is no small encouragement to the people of god that wisdom itself takes care of them and one who loves them better than they love themselves looks after them and he has given his promise for it that all shall work together for their good and what better foundation of comfort can there be in the whole world than this  let this serve as a remedy against excessive grief get your love to god increased which if you do the love of all other things will wax cold and if you have given god your heart you will give him leave to take what he will that is yours and what he has you will judge rather well kept than lost  remember that scripture and let it have its due impression upon your spirit he that loves father or mother brother or sister yea or children more than me is not worthy of me o labor to have your affections therefore more raised up to him who is most worthy of them let him have the uppermost room in your heart and let your love to all other things be placed in subjection to your love of god be ruled by it and directed to it  chap iv his return to kingscollege after his fathers death and his temptations from satan when his father was dead he returned again to kingscollege and was a member of a secret society which began to plot how they might best improve their gifts and graces so as to be serviceable to god and their generations their custom was frequently to meet together to pray and to communicate studies and experiences some of this company did degenerate but others lived to let the world understand that what they did was from a vital principle amongst whom this young man was none of the least one of their designs was to engage the juniors if possible before they were ensnared by wicked company when they came fresh from school after some time most of his dear companions were transplanted either into gentlemens families or livings and mr janeway being one of the youngest was for a while left alone in the college but he wanting the comfortable diversion of suitable society fixed so intensely upon his studies that he soon gave such a wound to his bodily constitution as could never be thoroughly healed  thus you have a taste of his spirit and may perceive what it was that he had his heart set upon what kept his graces in such vigor and activity and how desirous he was that others should be sharers with him in this mercy yet for all this he had his gloomy days and the sun was sometimes overcast his sweets were sometimes imbittered with dreadful and horrid temptations the devil shot his poisonous arrows at him yet through the captain of his salvation he came more than a conqueror out of the field he was with paul many times lifted up into the third heavens and saw and heard things unutterable but lest he should be exalted above measure there was a messenger of satan sent to buffet him  it would make a christians heart even ache to hear what strange temptations he was exercised with but he was well armed for such a conflict having on the shield of faith whereby he quenched the fiery darts of that wicked one yet this fight cost him the sweating of his very body for agonies of spirit and tears and strong cries to heaven for fresh help as for himself he was wont to take an arrow out of gods quiver and discharge it by faith and prayer for the discomfiture of his violent enemy who at last was fain to fly  these temptations and conflicts with satan did not a little help him in his dealing with one that was sorely afflicted with the like temptations and because i judge it may be of use to such i insert a letter of his to one in the like case  dear friend you say that you are troubled with blasphemous thoughts so then though they are blasphemous yet they are your trouble and neither sent for nor welcome and so are not assented to in your mind what then shall we think of them if they were your own production your heart would be delighted in its own issue but you do nothing less sure then they are the injections of that wicked one who is the accuser of the brethren and the disturber of the peace of the people of god but does satan use to employ those weapons but against those that he is in fear of losing he is not wont to assault and fight against his surest friends in this manner those that he has fast in his own possession he leads on as softly and quietly as he can fearing lest such disturbance should make them look about them and so they should awake and see their danger but as for those that have in some measure escaped his snares he follows them hard with all the discouragements he can these things are no other but a bitter relish of those things which you know to be bitter after that you have tasted how good the lord is what then shall i call these motions of your mind they are the souls loathing of the morsels which satan would have it to swallow down but you will say if these horrible thoughts be not your sin yet they are your misery and you desire to be freed from them and you will ask how shall i get free from them first see that you possess your soul in patience and know this that god has an overruling hand in all this and wait upon him for he can and will bring forth good out of all this evil at present you see no light yet trust in the lord and stay yourself upon your god can christ forget the purchase of his own blood can a mother forget her suckling child yet god cannot forget his god has gracious intents in all this and his bowels yearn toward you yea our savior suffers with us through his ardent love by sympathy as well as he has suffered for us and you know he has all power in his hand who does employ this power in a way of love toward his this power is made yours through the prayer of faith but for your own work do this  first let not such thoughts have any time of abode in your mind but turn them out with all the abhorrence you can but not with so much trouble and disturbance of mind as i believe you do for by this the devil is pleased and makes you your own tormentor  secondly always divert your thoughts to some good thing and let those very injections be constantly the occasion of your more spiritual meditation think the quite contrary or fall a praying with earnestness and the devil will be weary if he find his designs thus broken and that those sparks of hell which he struck into the soul to kindle and inflame corruption do put warmth into grace and set faith and prayer a working thus resist him and he will flee from you  thirdly consider that this is no new thing for we are not in this ignorant of satans devises that if any soul has escaped out of the chains of darkness if he will have heaven he shall have it with as much trouble as the devil can lay on and if he and his had their wills no good man should have one peaceable hour but blessed be god the devil cannot pluck us out of those almighty arms with which he does embrace his dear children  yours in our dear lord john janeway   his love to christ and souls made him very desirous to spend and be spent in the work of the ministry accordingly he did comply with the first loud and clear call to preach the everlasting gospel and though he was but two and twenty years old yet he came to that work like one that understood what kind of employment preaching was he was a workman that needed not to be ashamed that was thoroughly furnished for every good word and work one that was able to answer gainsayers one in whom the word of god dwelt richly one full of the spirit and power one that hated sin with a perfect hatred and loved holiness with all his soul in whom religion in its beauty did shine one that knew the terrors of the lord and knew how to beseech sinners in christs stead to be reconciled unto god one that was a son of thunder and a son of consolation in a word i may speak that of him which paul speaks of timothy that i knew none like minded that did naturally care for souls and had he lived to have preached often oh what use might such a man have been of in his generation one in whom learning and holiness did as it were strive which should excel he never preached publicly but twice and then he came to it as if he had been used to that work forty years delivering the word of god with that power and majesty with that tenderness and compassion with what readiness and freedom that it made his hearers amazed he was lead into the mystery of the gospel and he spoke nothing to others but what was the language of his heart and the fruit of great experience and which one might easily perceive had no small impression first upon his own spirits  his first and last sermons were upon communion and intimate converse with god out of job xxii    a subject that few christians under heaven were better able to manage than himself and that scarce any could handle so feelingly as he for he did for some considerable time maintain such an intimate familiarity with god that he seemed to converse with him as one friend does converse with another this text he made some entrance into whilst he was here but the perfecting of his acquaintance with god was a work fitter for another world  he was one that kept an exact watch over his thoughts words and actions and made a review of all that passed him at least once a day in a solemn manner he kept a diary in which he did write down every evening what the frame of his spirit had been all the day long especially in every duty he took notice what profit he received in his spiritual traffic what returns from that far country what answers of prayer what deadness and flatness and what observable providence did present themselves and the substance of what he had been doing and any wanderings of thoughts inordinancy in any passion which though the world could not discern he could it cannot be conceived by them which do not practice the same to what a good account this turned this made him retain a grateful remembrance of mercy and live in a constant adoring of divine goodness this brought him to a very intimate acquaintance with his own heart this kept his spirit low and fitted him for free communications with god this made him more lively and active this helped him to walk humbly with god this made him speak more affectionately and experimentally to others of the things of god and in a word this left a sweet calm upon his spirits because he every night made even his accounts and if his sheets should prove his winding sheet it had been all one for he could say his work was done so that death could not surprise him  chap v an account of the latter part of his life for the latter part of his life he lived like a man that was quite weary of the world and that looked upon himself as a stranger here and lived in the constant sight of a better he plainly declared himself but a pilgrim that looked for a better country a city that had foundations whose builder and maker was god his habit his language his deportment all spoke him one of another world his meditations were so intense long and frequent that they ripened him apace for heaven but somewhat weakened his body few christians attain to such a holy contempt of the world and to such clear joyful constant apprehensions of the transcendent glories of the unseen world  he made it his whole business to keep up sensible communion with god and to grow into an humble familiarity with god and to maintain it and if by reason of company or any necessary business this was in any measure interrupted he would complain like one out of his element till his spirit was recovered into a delightful unmixed free intercourse with god he was never so well satisfied as when he was more immediately engaged in what brought him nearer to god and by this he constantly enjoyed those comforts which others rarely meet with his graces and experiences toward his end grew to astonishment his faith got up to a full assurance his desires into a kind of enjoyment he was often brought into the banqueting house and there christs banner over him was love and he sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was pleasant unto his taste his eyes beheld the king in his beauty and while he sat at his table his spikenard did send forth its pleasant smell he had frequent visions of glory lay in the bosom of his master and was surely a very beloved disciple and highly favored his lord often called him up to the mount to him and let him see his excellent glory o the sweet foretaste that he had of those pleasures that are at the right hand of god how often was he feasted with the feast of fat things those wines on the lees well refined and sometimes he was like a giant refreshed with new wine rejoicing to run the race that was set before him whether of doing or of suffering he was even sick of love and he could say to the poor unexperienced world o taste and see and to christians come and i will tell you what god has done for my soul o what do christians mean that they do no more to get their senses spiritually exercised o why do they not make religion the very business of their lives o why is the soul christ and glory thus despised is there nothing in communion with god are all those comforts of christians that follow hard after him worth nothing is it not worth the while to make ones calling and election sure o why do men and women jest and dally in the great matter of eternity little do people think what they slight when they are seldom and formal in secret duties and when they neglect the great duty of meditation which i have through rich mercy found so sweet and refreshing o what do christians mean that they keep at such a distance from a christ did they but know the thousandth part of that sweetness which is in him they could not choose but follow him hard they would run and not be weary and walk and not be faint  he could sensibly and experimentally commend the ways of god to the poor unexperienced world and say his ways are pleasantness and justify wisdom and say her paths were peace he could take off those aspersions which the devil and the world cast upon godliness in the power of it here is one that could challenge all the atheists in the world to dispute here is one that could bring sensible demonstrations to prove a deity and the reality and excellencies of invisibles which these fools and madmen make the subject of their scorn here is one that would not change delights with the greatest epicures living and vie pleasure with all the sensualists of the world which of them all could in the midst of their jollity say this is the pleasure that shall last for ever which of them can say among their cups i can now look death in the face and this very moment i can be content yea glad to leave these delights as knowing i shall enjoy better and this he could do when he fared deliciously in spiritual banquets every day he could upon better reason than he did say soul thou have goods laid up for many years he knew full well that what he did here enjoy was but a little to what he should have shortly in his presence there is fullness of joy at his right hand there are pleasures for evermore where is the belshazzar that would not quake in the midst of his cups whilst he is quaffing the richest wine if he should see a hand upon the wall writing bitter things against him telling him that this night his soul must be required of him that now he must come away and give an account of all his ungodly pleasures before the mighty god where is the sinner that could be contented to hear the lord roaring out of zion whilst he is roaring in the tavern which of them would be glad to hear the trumpet sound and to hear that voice arise ye dead and come to judgment which of them would rejoice to see the mountains quake the elements melting with fervent heat and the earth consumed with flames and the lord christ whom they despised coming in the clouds with millions of his saints and angels to be avenged upon those that knew not god and obeyed not his gospel is not that a blessed state when a man can lift up his head with joy when others tremble with fear and sink with sorrow and this was the condition of this holy young man in the midst of all worldly comforts he longed for death and the thoughts of the day of judgment made all his enjoyments sweeter o how did he long for the coming of christ whilst some have been discoursing by him of that great and terrible day of the lord he would smile and humbly express his delight in the forethought of that approaching hour  i remember once there was a great talk that one had foretold the doomsday should be upon such a day although he blamed their daring folly that would pretend to know that which was hid from the angels themselves yet granting their suspicion to be true what then said he what if the day of judgment were come as it will most cerrainly come shortly if i were sure the day of judgment were to begin within an hour i should be glad with all my heart if at this very instant i should hear such thunderings and see such lightnings as israel did at mount sinai i am persuaded my very heart would leap for joy through infinite mercy the very meditation of that day has even ravished my soul and the thought of the certainty and nearness of it is more refreshing to me than the comforts of the whole world surely nothing can more revive my spirits than to behold the blessed jesus the joy life and beauty of my soul would it not more rejoice me than josephs wagons did old jacob i lately dreamed that the day of judgment was come methought i heard terrible cracks of thunder and saw dreadful lightnings the foundations of the earth did shake and the heavens were rolled together as a garment yea all things visible were in a flame methought i saw the graves opened and the earth and sea giving up their dead methought i saw millions of angels and christ coming in the clouds methought i beheld the ancient of days sitting upon his throne and all other thrones cast down methought i beheld him whose garments were white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from him thousands of ten thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him and the judgment was set and the books were opened o with what an ecstasy of joy was i surprised methought it was the most heartraising sight that ever my eyes beheld and then i cried out i have waited for thy salvation o god and so i mounted into the air to meet my lord in the clouds  this i record only to show how far he was from being daunted at the thoughts of death or judgment and to let other christians know what is attainable in this life and what folly it is for us to take up with so little when our lord is pleased to make such noble provisions for us and by wise and diligent improvement of those means which god has offered us we may have an entrance administered to us abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ  oh how comfortable how honorable and how profitable is this state these are your men that quit themselves like christians this is true gallantry noble manhood real valor this was the condition of mr janeway for about three years before he died i will not deny but that he had some clouds but he usually walked in a sweet even humble serenity of spirit and though he daily questioned many actions yet did he not question his state but had his heart fixed upon that rock that neither waves nor winds could shake his senses were still so spiritually exercised as that he could look up to heaven as his country and inheritance and to god as his father and to christ as his redeemer and that which is scarce to be heard of he counted it the highest act of patience to be willing to live and a very great selfdenial to be contented to be in this world and to dwell in this side a full and eternal enjoyment of that royal glorious one whom his soul was so much in love with  chap vi his last sickness and death his body is now shaken again and he falls into a deep consumption but this messenger of god did not in the least damp him spitting of blood was no ghastly thing to one that had his eye upon the blood of jesus faint sweats did not daunt him that had always such revival cordials at hand it is matter of joy to him that he was now in some hopes of having his earnest desires satisfied  after he had been a while sick a sudden dimness seized upon his eyes by and by his sight quite failed and there was such a visible alteration in him that he and others judged these things to be the symptoms of death approaching but when he was thus taken he was not in the least surprised but was lifted up with joy to think what a life he was going to looking upon death itself as one of his fathers servants and his friends that was sent as a messenger to conduct him safely to his glorious palace  when he felt his body ready to faint he called to his mother and said dear mother i am dying but i beseech you be not troubled for i am through mercy quite above the fears of death it is no great matter i have nothing troubles me but the apprehensions of your grief i am going to him whom i love above life  but it pleased the lord to raise him again a little out of his fainting fit for his master had yet more work for him to do before he must receive his wages although his outward man decayed apace yet he is renewed in the inward man day by day his graces were never more active and his experiences never greater when one would have thought he should have been taken up with his distemper and that it had been enough for him to grapple with his pains he quite forgets his weakness and is so swallowed up of the life to come that he had scarce leisure to think of his sickness  for several weeks together i never heard the least word that favored with any complaint or weariness under the hand of god except his eager desire to be with christ be counted complaining and his haste to be in heaven impatience now was the time when one might have seen heaven and the glory of another world realized to sense his faith grew exceedingly and his life was proportionable and his joys were equal to both  o the rare seize the high and divine expressions that dropped from his mouth i have not words to express what a strange triumphant angelical frame he was in for some considerable time together it was a very heaven upon earth to hear and see a man admiring god at such a rate those that did not see cannot well conceive what a sweet frame he was in for at least six weeks before he died his soul was almost always filled with those joys unspeakable and full of glory how often would he cry out oh that i could let you know what i now feel oh that i could show you what i see oh that i could express the thousandth part of that sweetness that i now find in christ you would all think it then well worth the while to make it your business to be religious oh my dear friends we little think what christ is worth upon a deathbed i would not for a world nay for millions of worlds be now without christ and a pardon i would not for a world be to live any longer the very thoughts of a possibility of recovery makes me tremble  when one came to visit him and told him that he hoped it might please god to raise him again and that he had seen many a weaker man restored to health and that lived many a good year after and do you think to please me said he by such discourse as this no friend you are much mistaken in me if you think that the thoughts of life and health and the world are pleasing to me the world has quite lost its excellency in my judgment o how poor and contemptible a thing it is in all its glory compared with the glory of that invisible world which i now live in the sight of and as for life christ is my life health and strength and i know i shall have another kind of life when i leave this i tell you it would incomparably more please me if you should say to me you are no man of this world you cannot possibly hold out long before tomorrow you will be in eternity i tell you i do so long to be with christ that i could be contented to be cut in pieces and to be put to the most exquisite torments so i might but die and be with christ oh how sweet is jesus come lord jesus come quickly death do thy worst death has lost its terribleness death it is nothing i say death is nothing through grace to me i can as easily die as shut my eyes to turn my head and sleep i long to be with christ i long to die  his mother and brethren standing by him he said dear mother i beseech you earnestly as ever i desired any thing of you in my life that you would cheerfully give me up to christ do not hinder me now i am going to rest and glory i am afraid of your prayers lest they pull one way and mine another  and then turning to his brethren he speak thus to them i charge you all do not pray for my life any more you do me wrong if you do oh that glory the unspeakable glory that i behold my heart is full my heart is full christ smiles and i cannot choose but smile can you find in your heart to stop me who am now going to the complete and eternal enjoyment of christ would you keep me from my crown the arms of my blessed savior are open to embrace me the angels stand ready to carry my soul into his bosom oh did you but see what i see you would all cry out with me how long dear lord come lord jesus come quickly oh why are his chariotwheels so long a coming  and all this while he lay like a triumphing conqueror smiling and rejoicing in spirit  there was never a day toward his end but as weak as he was he did some special piece of service for his great master yea almost every hour did produce fresh wonders  a judicious and holy minister came often to visit him and discoursed with him of the excellency of christ and the glory of the invisible world sir said he i feel something of it my heart is as full as it can hold in this lower state i can hold no more here oh that i could let you know what i feel  this holy minister praying with him his soul was ravished with the abundant incomes of light life and love so that he could scarce bear it nor the thoughts of staying any longer in the world but longed to be in such a condition wherein he should have yet more grace and more comfort and be better able to bear that weight of glory some manifestations whereof did even almost sink his wek body and had he not been sustained by a great power his very joys would have overwhelmed him and whilst he was in these ecstasies of joy and love he was wont to cry out  who am i lord who am i that thou should be mindful of me why me lord why me oh what shall i say unto thee o thou preserver of men o why me lord why me if thou will look upon such a poor worm who can hinder who would not love thee oh blessed father oh how sweet and gracious have thou been unto me  and thus he went on admiring and adoring of god in a more high and heavenly manner than i can cloth with words suppose what you can on this side heaven and i am persuaded you might have seen it in him he was wonderfully taken with the goodness of god to him in sending that aged experienced minister to help him in his last great work upon earth who am i said he that god should send to me a messenger one among a thousand  though he was toward his end most commonly in a triumphant joyful frame yet sometimes even then he had some small intermissions in which he would cry out hold out faith and patience yet a little while and your work is done and when he found not his heart wound up to the highest pitch of thankfulness admiration and love he would with great sorrow bemoan himself and cry out in this language  and what is the matter now oh my soul what will thou can thou thus unworthily slight this admirable and astonishing condescension of god to thee seems it a small matter that the great jehovah should deal thus familiarly with this worm and will thou pass this over as a common mercy what meanest thou oh my soul that thou do not constantly adore and praise this rare strong and unspeakable love is it true oh my soul does god deal familiarly with man and are his humble zealous and constant love praise and service too good for god why are not thou oh my soul swallowed up every moment with this free unparalled everlasting love and then he breaks out again into another triumphant ecstasy of praise and joy and expressed a little of that which was unexpressibly in some such words as these  stand astonished ye heavens and wonder o ye angels at this infinite grace was ever any under heaven more beholding to free grace than i does god use to do thus with his creatures admire him for ever and ever oh ye redeemed ones oh those joys the taste of which i have the everlasting joys which are at his right hand for evermore eternity eternity itself is too short to praise this god in o bless the lord with me come let us short for joy and boast in the god of our salvation oh help me to praise the lord for his mercy endures for ever one of his brethren that had formerly been wrought upon by his holy exhortations and example praying with him and seeing of him as he apprehended near his dissolution desired that the lord would be pleased to continue those astonishing comforts to the last moments of his breath and that he might go from one heaven to another from grace and joy imperfect to perfect grace and glory and when his work was done here give him if it were his will the most easy and triumphant passage to rest  at the end of the duty he burst out into a wonderful passion of joy sure that was joy unspeakable and full of glory oh what an amen did he speak amen amen amen hallelujah  it would have made any christians heart to leap to have seen and heard what some saw and heard at that time and i question not but that it would somewhat affect them to hear and read it though it be scarce possible to speak the half of what was admirable in him for it being so much beyond precedent it did even astonish and amaze those of us that were about him that our relation must fall hugely short of what was real  i verily believe that it exceeds the highest rhetoric to set out to the life what this heavenly creature did then deliver i want words to speak and so did he for he saw things unutterable but yet so much he speak as justly drew the admiration of all that saw him he talked as if he had been in the third heaven and broke out in such words as these  oh he is come he is come oh how sweet how glorious is the blessed jesus how shall i do to speak the thousandth part of his praises oh for words to set out a little of that excellency but it is unexpressible oh how excellent glorious and lovely is the precious jesus he is sweet he is altogether lovely and now i am sick of love he has ravished my soul with his beauty i shall die sick of love  oh my friends stand by and wonder come look upon a dying man and wonder i cannot myself but stand and wonder was there ever a greater kindness was there ever sensibler manifestations of rich grace oh why me lord why me sure this is akin to heaven and if i were never to enjoy any more than this it were well worth all the torments that men and devils could invent to come through even a hell to such transcendent joys as these if this be dying dying is sweet let no true christians ever be afraid of dying oh death is sweet to me this bed is soft christs arms and kisses his smiles and visits sure they would turn hell into heaven oh that you did but see and feel what i do come and behold a dying man more cheerful than ever you w any healthful man in the midst of his sweetest enjoyments oh sirs worldly pleasures are pitiful poor sorry things compared with one glimpse of this glory which shines so strongly into my soul oh why should any of you be so sad when i am so glad this this is the hour that i have waited for  about eight and forty hours before his death his eyes were dim and his sight much failed his jaws shook and trembled and his feet were cold and all the symptoms of death were upon him and his extreme parts were already almost dead and senseless and yet even then his joys were if possible greater  he had so many fits of joy unspeakable that he seemed to be in one continued act of seraphick love and praise he speak like one that was just entering into the gates of the new jerusalem the greatest part of him was now in heaven not a word dropped from his mouth but it breathed christ and heaven oh what encouragement did he give to them which did stand by to follow christ in an humble believing zealous course of life adding one degree of grace to another and using all diligence to make their calling and election sure and that then they also should find a glorious passage into a blessed eternity  but most of his work was praise an hundred times admiring of the bottomless love of god to him oh why me lord why me and then he would give instructions to them that came to see him he was scarce ever silent because the love of christ and souls did constrain him there was so much work done for christ in his last hours that i am ready to think he did as much in an hour as some do in a year  every particular person had a faithful affectionate warning and that good minister that was so much with him used this as an argument to persuade him to be willing to live a little longer and to be patient to tarry gods leisure sure god have something for thee to do that is yet undone some word of exhortation to some poor soul that you have forgot  the truth of it is he was filled with the love of christ that he could scarce bear absence from him a moment he knew that he should be capable of bearing greater glory above than he could here it was the judgment of some that were with him that his heart was not only habitually but actually set on god all the day long and nothing of human frailty appeared except it were his passionate desire to die and difficult to bring himself to be willing to stay below heaven  he was wont every evening to take his leave of his friends hoping not to see them till the morning of the resurrection and he desired that they would make sure of a comfortable meeting at our fathers house in that other world  one passage i cannot omit which was this that when ministers or christians came to him he would beg of them to spend all the time that they had with him in praise o help me to praise god i have now nothing else to do from this time to eternity but to praise and love god i have what my soul desires upon earth i cannot tell what to pray for but what i have graciously given the wants that are capable of supplying in this world are supplied i want but one thing and that is a speedy lift to heaven i expect no more here i cannot desire more i cannot hear more oh praise praise praise that infinite boundless love that has to a wonder looked upon my soul help me o my friends to praise and admire him that has done such astonishing wonders for my soul he has pardoned all my sins he has filled me with his goodness he has given me grace and glory and no good thing has he withheld from me  come help me with praises all is too little come help me oh ye glorious and mighty angels who are so well skilled in this heavenly work of praise praise him all ye creatures upon the earth let every thing that has being help me to praise him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise is now my work and i shall be engaged in that sweet employment for ever bring the bible turn to davids psalms and let us sing a psalm of praise come let us lift up our voice in the praise of the most high i will sing with you as long as my breath does last and when i have none i shall do it better  and then turning to some of his friends that were weeping he desired them rather to rejoice than weep upon his account it may justly seem a wonder how he could speak so much as he did when he was so weak but the joy of the lord did strengthen him  in his sickness the scriptures that he took much delight in were the fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth of john the fifty fourth of isaiah was very refreshing also to him he would repeat that word with everlasting mercies will i gather with abundance of joy  he commended the study of the promises to believers and desired that they would be sure to make good their claim to them and then they might come to the wells of consolation and drink thereof their fill  according to his desire most of the time that was spent with him was spent in praise and he would still be calling out more praise still o help me to praise him i have now nothing else to do i have done with prayer and all other ordinances i have almost done conversing with mortals i shall presently be beholding christ himself that died for me and loved me and washed me in his blood  i shall before a few hours are over be in eternity singing the song of moses and the song of the lamb i shall presently stand upon mount zion with an innumerable company of angels and the spirits of the just made perfect and jesus the mediator of the new covenant i shall hear the voice of much people and be one amongst them which shall say hallelujah salvation glory honor and power unto the lord our god and again we shall say hallelujah and yet a very little while and i shall sing unto the lamb a song of praise saying worthy art thou to receive praise who were slain and have redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and have made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign with thee for ever and ever  methinks i stand as it were with one foot in heaven and the other upon earth methinks i hear the melody of heaven and by faith i see the angels waiting to carry my soul to the bosom of jesus and i shall be for ever with the lord in glory and who can choose but rejoice in all this  several times he speak in this language and repeated many of these words often over and over again with far greater affection than can be well worded and i solemnly profess that what is here written is no hyperbole and that the twentieth part of what was observable in him is not recorded we cannot word it exactly as he did yet you have the substance and many things in his own words with little or no variation  the day before his death he looked somewhat earnestly upon his brother james who stood by him very sad of whom he judged that he was putting up some ejaculations to god upon his account i thank thee dear brother for thy love said he thou art now praying for me and i know thou love me dearly but christ loves me ten thousand times more than thou do come and kiss me dear brother before i die and so with his cold dying lips he kissed him and said i shall go before and i hope thou shall follow after to glory  though he was almost always praising god and exhorting them that were about him to mind their everlasting concerns and secure an interest in christ and though he slept but very little for some nights yet he was not in the least impaired in his intellectuals but his actions were all decent and becoming a man and his discourse to a spiritual understanding highly rational solid divine and so he continued to the last minute of his breath  a few hours before his death he called all his relations and brethren together that he might give them one solemn warning more and bless them and pray for them as his breath and strength would give him leave which he did with abundance of authority affection and spirituallity which take briefly as it follows  first he thanked his dear mother for her tender love to him and desired that she might be in travel to see christ formed in the souls of the rest of her children and see of the travel of her soul and meet them with joy in that great day  then he charged all his brethren and sisters in general as they would answer it before god that they should carry it dutiful to their dear mother and for his eldest brother william at whose house he lay sick his prayer was that he might be swallowed up of christ and love to souls and be more and more exemplary in his life and successful in his ministry and finish his course with joy  his next brothers name was andrew a citizen of london who was with him and saw him in his triumphing state but his necessary business calling him away he could not then be by yet he was not forgot but he was thus blessed the god of heaven remember my poor brother at london the lord make him truly rich in giving him the pearl of great price and make him a fellow citizen with the saints and of the household of god the lord deliver him from the sins of that city may the world be kept out of his heart and christ dwell there oh that he may be as his name is a strong man and that i may meet him with you  then he called his next brother whose name was james whom he hoped god had made him a spiritual father to to whom he thus addressed himself brother james i hope the lord has given thee a goodly heritage the lines are fallen to thee in pleasant places the lord is thy portion i hope the lord has showed thee the worth of christ hold on dear brother christ heaven and glory are worth striving for the lord give thee more abundance of his grace  then his next brother abraham was called to whom he speak to this purpose the blessing of the god of abraham rest upon thee the lord make thee a father of many spiritual children  his fifth brother was joseph whom he blessed in this manner let him bless thee oh joseph that blessed him that was separated from his brethren o that his everlasting arms may take hold on thee it is enough if yet thou may live in his sight my heart has been working toward thee poor joseph and i am not without hopes that the arms of the almighty will embrace thee the god of thy father bless the with the blessing of heaven above  the next was his sister mary to whom he spoke thus poor sister mary thy body is weak and thy days will be filled with bitterness thy name is marah the lord sweeten all with his grace and peace and give thee health in thy soul be patient make sure of christ and all is well  then his other sister whose name was sarah was called whom he thus blessed sister sarah thy body is strong and healthful oh that thy soul may be so too the lord make thee first a wise virgin and then a mother in israel a pattern of modesty humility and holiness  then another brother jacob was called whom he blessed after this manner the lord make thee an israelite indeed in whom there is no guile oh that thou may learn to wrestle with god and like a prince may prevail and not go without the blessing  then he prayed for his youngest brother benjamin who was then but an infant poor little benjamin o that the father of the fatherless would take care of thee poor child that thou which never saw thy father upon earth may see him with joy in heaven the lord be thy father and portion may thou prove the son of thy mothers right hand and the joy of her age  o that none of us all may be found amongst the unconverted in the day of judgment o that every one of us may appear with our honored father and dear mother before christ with joy that they may say lord here are we and the children which thou have given us oh that we may live to god here and live with him hereafter and now my dear mother brethren and sisters farewell i leave you for a while and i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified  and now dear lord my work is done i have finished my course i have fought the good fight and henceforth there remains for me a crown of righteousness now come dear lord jesus come quickly  then the minister came to give him his last visit and to do the office of an inferior angel to help to convey his blessed soul to glory who was now even upon mount pisgah and had a full sight of that goodly land at a little distance when this minister spoke to him his heart was in a mighty flame of love and joy which drew fears of joy from him being almost amazed to hear a man just a dying talk as if he had been with jesus and came from the immediate presence of god o the smiles that were then in his face and the unspeakable joy that was in his heart one might have read grace and glory in his countenance oh the praise the triumphant praises that he put up and every one must speak praise about him or else they made a jar in his harmony  and indeed most did as well as they could help him in praise so that i never heard nor knew more praise given to god in one room than in his chamber  a little before he died in the prayer or rather praises he was so wrapped up with admiration and joy that he could scarce forbear shouting for joy in the conclusion of the duty with abundance of faith and fervency he said aloud amen amen  and now his desires will soon be satisfied death comes apace to do his office his jaws are loosened more and more and quiver greatly his hands and feet are as cold as clay and a cold sweat is upon him but oh how glad was he when he felt his spirit just a going never was death more welcome to any mortal i think though the pangs of death were strong yet that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory made him endure those bitter pains with much patience and courage in the extremity of his pains he desired his eldest brother to lay him a little lower and to take away one pillow from him that he might die with the more ease his brother replied that he durst not for a world do any thing that might hasten his death a moment then he was well satisfied and did sweetly resign himself up wholly to gods disposal and after a few minutes with a sudden motion gathering up all his strength he gave himself a little turn on one side and in the twinkling of an eye departed to the lord  and now blessed soul thy longings are satisfied and thou see and feel a thousand times more than thou did upon earth and yet thou can bear it with delight thou art now welcomed to thy fathers house by christ the beloved of thy soul now thou have heard him say come thou blessed of my father and well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy lord and wear that crown which was prepared for thee before the foundation of the world  oh that all the relations which thou have left behind thee may live thy life and die thy death and live with christ and thee for ever and ever amen amen  he died june      aged      and was buried in kelshall church in hartfordshire  finis
