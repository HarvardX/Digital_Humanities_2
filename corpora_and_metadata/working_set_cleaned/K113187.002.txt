tolerably perspicuous and his veriication often harmonious but his poetry is of a grave and sententious turn he has much good sense solid reflection and useful observation but he is serious and didactic on all occasions he preserves the tone of the scholar and the moralist on the most lively topics for this reason he seems to have been characterised by chaucer with the appellation of the

to book some new thing to the reder in berthlettes edition from the prologue see supr vol i p     notes   this tripartite work is represented by three volumes on gowers curious tomb in the conventual church of saint mary overee in southwark now remaining in its ancient state and this circumstance furnishes me with an obvious opportunity of adding an anecdote relating to our poets munificence and piety which ought not to be omitted although a poet he largely contributed to rebuild that church in its present elegant form and to render it a beautiful pattern of the lighter gothic architecture at the same time he founded at his tomb a perpetual chantry  it is on the last of these pieces the confessio amantis that gowers character and reputation as a poet are almost entirely founded this poem which bears no immediate reference to the other two divisions is a dialogue between a lover and his confessor who is a priest of venus and like the mystagogue in the picture of cebes is called genius here as if it had been impossible for a lover not to be a good catholic the ritual of religion is applied to the tender passion and ovids art of love is blended with the breviary in the course of the confession every evil affection of the human heart which may tend to impede the progress or counteract the success of love is scientifically subdivided and its fatal effects exemplifid by a variety of apposite stories extracted from classics and chronicles the poet often introduces or recapitulates his matter in a few couplets of latin long and short verses this was in imitation of boethius  this poem is strongly tinctured with those pedantic affectations concerning the passion of love which the french and italian poets of the fourteenth century borrowed from the troubadours of provence and which i have above examined at large but the writers particular model appears more immediately to have been john of meuns celebrated romaunt de la rose he has however seldom attempted to imitate the picturesque imageries and expressive personifications of that exquisite allegory his most striking pourtraits which yet are conceived with no powers of creation nor delineated with any fertility of fancy are idleness avarice micherie or thieving and negligence the ecretary of sloth lib iv f    a col   lib v f    a col   lib iv f    a col   lib v f     a col    instead of boldly clothing these qualities with corporeal attributes aptly and poetically imagined he coldly yet sensibly describes their operations and enumerates their properties what gower wanted in invention he supplied from his commonplace book which appears to have been stored with an inexhaustible fund of instructive maxims pleasant narrations and philosophical definitions it seems to have been his object to crowd all his erudition into this elaborate performance yet there is often some degree of contrivance and art in his manner of introducing and adapting subjects of a very distant nature and which are totally foreign to his general design  in the fourth book our confessor turns chemist and discoursing at large on the hermetic science developes its principles and exposes its abuses with great penetration lib iv f    b col    he delivers the doctrines concerning the vegetable mineral and animal stones to which falstaff alludes in shakespeare faltaffe mentions a philosophers or chemists two stones see p

mysteries which had been just opened to our countrymen by the books of roger bacon see supr vol   p       in the seventh book the whole circle of the aristotelic philosophy is explained which our lover is desirous to learn supposing that the importance and variety of its speculations might conduce to sooth his anxieties by diverting and engaging his attention such a discussion was not very likely to afford him much consolation especially as hardly a single ornamental digression is admitted to decorate a field naturally so destitute of flowers almost the only one is the following

and other established authors whose materials they gave in a commodious abridgement and in whose place by selecting those stories only which suited the taste of the times they substituted a more agreeable kind of reading nor was it by these means only that they greatly contributed to retard the acquisition of those ornaments of style and other arts of composition which an attention to the genuine models would have afforded but by being written without any ideas of elegance and in the most barbarous phraseology yet productive as they were of these and other inconvenient consequences they were not without their use in the rude periods of literature by gradually weaning the minds of readers from monkish legends they introduced a relish for real and rational history and kindling an ardour of inquiring into the transactions of past ages at length awakened a curiosity to obtain a more accurate and authentic knowledge of important events by searching the original authors nor are they to be entirely neglected in modern and more polished ages for besides that they contain curious pictures of the credulity and ignorance of our ancestors they frequently preserve facts transcribed from books which have not descended to posterity it is extremely probable that the plan on which they are all constructed that of deducing a perpetual history from the creation to the writers age was partly taken from ovids metamorphoses and partly from the bible  in the mean time there are three histories of a less general nature which gower seems more immediately to have followed in some of his

is recited  here perhaps we may perceive the groundwork of the title  in this mixture of moralisation and narrative the gesta romanorum somewhat resembles the plan of gowers poem in the rubric of the

elegant little apologue which seems to be of eastern invention has lately so much employed the searches of the commentators on shakespeare and that the circumstances of the story as it is told by gower may be compared with those with which it appears in other books  the poet is speaking of a king whose officers and courtiers complained that after a long attendance they had not received adequate rewards and preferments due to their services the king who was no stranger to their complaints artfully contrives a scheme to prove whether this defect proceeded from his own want of generosity or their want of discernment  anon he let two cofres coffers chests make of one semblance of one make so lyche like  that no life thilke throw that one may fro that other know they were into his chamber brought but no man wot why they be brought and netheles the king has bid that they be set in privy stead as he that was of wisdom sligh when he thereto his time sigh saw  all

jewels that they should choose which of the two they liked best and that the contents should instantly be distributed among them all a knight by common consent is appointed to choose for them who fixes upon the chest filled with straw and stones  this king then in the same stead place  anon that other cofre undede whereas they sawen great richesse wile more than they couthen guess lo says the

somewhat similar in which the emperor frederick places before two beggars two pasties one filled with capons the other with florins ibid b col    it must be confessed that there is a much greater and a more beautiful variety of incidents in this story as it is related in the gesta romanorum which shakespeare has followed than in gower and was it not demonstrable that this compilation preceded our

have completed their triumph over human credulity in gowers age who probably was an ingenious adept in the false and frivolous speculations of this admired species of study  gower amidst his graver literature appears to have been a great reader of romances the lover in speaking of the gratification which his passion receives from the sense of hearing says that to hear his lady speak is more delicious than to feast on all the dainties that could be compounded by a cook of lombardy they are not so restorative  as bin the words of her mouth for as the wyndes of the south ben most of all

a col    the romance of idoyne and amadas is recited as a favorite history among others in the prologue to a collection of legends called cursor mundi translated from the french see supr vol   p    notes t  i have already observed our poets references to sir lancelots romance  our authors account of the progress of the latin language is extremely curious he supposes that it was invented by the old tuscan prophetess carmens that it was reduced to method to composition pronunciation and prosody by the grammarians aristarchus donatus and didymus adorned with the flowers of eloquence and rhetoric by tully then enriched by translations from the chaldee arabic and greek languages more especially by the version of the hebrew bible into latin by saint jerome in the fourth century and that at length after the labors of many celebrated writers it received its final consummation in ovid the poet of lovers at the mention of ovids name the poet with the dexterity and address of a true master of transition seizes the critical moment of bringing back the dialogue to its proper argument lib iv f    b col     the confessio amantis was most probably written after chaucers troilus and

romantic or classical history we have david and bathsheba sampson and dalila and solomon with all is concubines virgil also socrates plato and ovid are enumerated as lovers nor must we be surprised to find aristotle honored with a place in this gallant groupe for whom says the poet the queen of greece made such a syllogism as destroyed all his logic but among the rest troilus and cressida are introduced seemingly with an intention of paying a compliment to chaucers poem on their story which had been submitted to gowers correction chaucers tr cress urr edit p      although this famous pair had been also recently celebrated in boccacios filostrato see supr vol i p      and in another place speaking of his absolute devotion to his ladys will he declares himself ready to acquiesce in her choice whatsoever she shall command whether if when tired of dancing and caroling she should choose to play at chess or read troilus and cressida this is certainly chaucers poem  that when her lit on nights wake in chamber as to carol and dance methinke i may me more avaunce if i may gone upon her hand than if i win a kings land for when i may her hand beclip clasp  with such gladness i dance and skip methinketh i touch not the floor the roe which renneth on the moore is than naught so light as i  and when it falls other gate gaiety or way  so that her likes not to dance but on the dies to cast a chance or ask of love some demand or else that her list command to read and here of troilus lib iv     b col    that this poem was written after chaucers flower and leaf may be partly collected from the following passage which appears to be an imitation of chaucer and is no bad specimen of gowers most poetical manner rosiphele a beautiful princess but setting love at defiance the daughter of herupus king of armenia is taught obedience to the laws of cupid by seeing a vision of ladies  when come was the month of may she would walk upon a day and that was er the son arist arose  of women but a few it wist but a few of her women knew of this  and forth she went prively unto a park was fast by all soft walkende on the gras till she came there there where the launde was through which ran a great rivere it thought her fair and said here i will abide under the shawe and bad her women to withdraw and there she stood alone stille to think what was in her will she sighe saw the sweet flowers spring she herd glad fowls sing she sigh beasts in her kind the buck the do the heart the hynde the males go with the femele and so began there a quarele dispute  between love and her own

this splendid troop on a horse lean galled and lame a beautiful lady in a tattered garment her saddle mean and much worn but her bridle richly studded with gold and jewels and round her waist were more than an hundred halters the princess asks the meaning of this strange procession and is answered by the lady on the lean horse that these are specter of ladies who when living were obedient and faithful votaries of love as to myself she adds i am now receiving my annual penance for being a rebel to love  for i whilom no love had my horse is now feeble and badde and al to torn is mine araie and every year this fresh mai these lusty ladies ride about and i must needs sew follow her route in this manner as ye now see and trusse her hallters forth with me and am but her horse knave their

knight faithfully for the last fortnight of her life  now have ye herd all mine answer to god madam i you betake and warns all for my sake of love that they be not idell and bid hem think of my bridell and with that word all suddenly she passes as it were a sky a shadow  umbra  all clean out of the ladies sight lib iv f  0 seq  my readers will easily conjecture the change which this spectacle must naturally produce in the obdurate heart of the princess of armenia there is a farther proof that the flower and leaf preceded the confessio amantis in the eighth book our authors lovers

judiciously departed from the fable in converting sicily into the more popular court of king arthur  perhaps in estimating gowers merit i have pushed the notion too far that because he shows so much learning he had no great share of natural abilities but it should be considered that when books began to grow fashionable and the reputation of learning conferred the highest honor poets became ambitious of being thought scholars and sacrificed their native powers of invention to the ostentation of displaying an extensive course of reading an to the pride of profound erudition on this account the minstrels of these times who were totally uneducated and poured forth spontaneous rhymes in obedience to the workings of nature often exhibit more genuine strokes of passion and imagination than the professed poets chaucer is an exception to this observation whose original feelings were too strong to be suppressed by books and whose learning was overbalanced by genius  this affectation of appearing learned which yet was natural at the revival of literature in our old poets even in those who were altogether destitute of talents has lost to posterity many a curious picture of manners and many a romantic image some of our ancient bards however aimed at no other merit than that of being able to versify and attempted nothing more than to cloth in rhyme those sentiments which would have appeared with equal propriety in prose  sect ii one of the reasons which rendered the classic authors of the lower empire more popular than those of a purer age was because they were christians among these no roman writer appears to have been more studied and esteemed from the beginning to the close of the barbarous centuries than boethius yet it is certain that his allegorical personifications and his visionary philosophy founded on the abstractions of the platonic school greatly concurred to make him a favorite it is observable that this spirit of personification tinctures the writings of some of the christian fathers about or rather before this period most of the agents in the shepherd of hermas are ideal beings an ancient lady converses with hermas and tells him that she is the church of god afterward several virgins appear and discourse with him and when he desires to be informed who they are he is told by the shepherdangel that they are faith abstinence patience

section with an apology for chaucer gower and occleve who are supposed by the severe etymologists to have corrupted the purity of the english language by affecting to introduce so many foreign words and phrases but if we attend only to the politics of the times we shall find these poets as also some of their successors much less blameable in this respect than the critics imagine our wars with france which began in the reign of edward the third were of long continuance the principal nobility of england at this period resided in france with their families for many years john king of france kept his court in england o which exclusive of these french lords who were his fellow prisoners or necessary attendants the chief nobles of his kingdom must have occasionally resorted edward the black prince made an expedition into spain john of gaunt duke of lancaster and his brother the duke of york were matched with the daughters of don pedro king of castile all these circumstances must have concurred to produce a perceptible change in the language of the court it is rational therefore and it is equitable to suppose that instead of coining new words they only complied with the common and fashionable modes of speech would chaucers poems have been the delight of those courts in which he lived had they been filled with unintelligible pedantries the cotemporaries of these poets never complained of their obscurity but whether defensible on these principles or not they much improved the vernacular style by the use of this exotic phraseology it was thus that our primitive diction was enlarged and enriched the english language owes its copiousness elegance and harmony to these innovations  sect iii i consider chaucer as a genial day in an english spring a brilliant sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual luster the sudden appearance of cloudless skies and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmosphere after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity but winter returns with redoubled horrors the clouds condense more formidably than before and those tender buds and early blossoms which were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sunshine are nipped by frosts and torn by tempests  most of the poets that immediately succeeded chaucer seem rather relapsing into barbarism than availing themselves of those striking ornaments which his judgment and imagination had disclosed they appear to have been insensible to his vigor of versification and his flights of fancy it was not indeed likely that a poet should soon arise equal to chaucer and it must be remembered that the national distractions which ensued had no small share in obstructing the exercise of those studies which delight in peace and repose his successors however approach him in no degree of proportion among these john lydgate is the poet who follows him at the shortest interval  i have placed lydgate in the reign of henry the sixth and he seems to have arrived at his highest point of eminence about the year    0 in a copy of lydgates chronicle of english kings there is a stanza of edward the fourth mss harl        in his poem ab inimicis nostris etc edward the fourth his queen and modir are remembered mss harl ibid   fol

appeared before he was a monk of the benedictine abbey of bury in suffolk and an uncommon ornament of his profession yet his genius was so lively and his accomplishments so numerous that i suspect the holy father saint benedict would hardly have acknowledged him for a genuine disciple after a short education at oxford he traveled into france and italy see one of his ditties mss harl         fol     i have been offte in dyvers londys etc   and returned a complete master of the language and the literature of both countries he chiefly studied the italian and french poets particularly dante boccacio and alain chartier and became so distinguished a proficient in polite learning that he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the nobility the arts of versification and the elegancies of composition yet although philology was his object he was not unfamiliar with the fashionable philosophy he was not only a poet and a rhetorician but a geometrician an astronomer a theologist and a disputant on the whole i am of opinion that lydgate made considerable additions to those amplifications of our language in which chaucer gower and occleve led the way and that he is the first of our writers whose style is clothed with that perspicuity in which the english phraseology appears at this day to an english reader  to enumerate lydgates pieces would be to write the catalogue of a little library no poet seems to have possessed a greater versatility of talents he moves with equal ease in every mode of composition his hymns and his ballads have the same degree of merit and whether his subject be the life of a hermit or a hero of saint austin or guy earl of warwick ludicrous or legendary religious or romantic a history or an allegory he writes with facility his transitions were rapid from works of the most serious and laborious kind to sallies of levity and pieces of popular entertainment his muse was of universal access and he was not only the poet of his monastery but of the world in general if a disguising was intended by the company of goldsmiths a mask before his majesty at eltham a maygame for the sheriffs and aldermen of london a mumming before the lord mayor a procession of pageants from the creation for the festival of corpus christi or a carol for the coronation lydgate was consulted and gave the poetry see a variety of his pieces of this kind mss ashmol    ii stowe says that at the reception of margaret queen of henry sixth several pageaunts the verses by lydgate were shown at pauls gate in      hist p     see also mss harl

exhibiting the habits weapons architecture utensils and many other curious particulars belonging to the age of the ingenious illuminator there are two exquisite portraits of the king one of william curteis abbot of bury and one of the poet lydgate kneeling at saint edmunds shrine there is an ancient drawing probably coeval of lydgate presenting his poem called the pilgrim to the earl of salisbury mss harl        it was written      another of these drawings will be mentioned below  in one of the kings pictures he is represented on his throne crowned and receiving this volume from the abbot kneeling in another he appears as a child prostrate on a carpet at saint edmunds shrine which is richly delineatd yet without any idea of perspective or proportion the figures of a great number of monks and attendants are introduced among the rest two noblemen perhaps the kings uncles with bonnets or caps of an uncommon shape it appears that our pious monarch kept his christmas at this magnificent monastery and that he remained here in a state of seclusion from the world and of an exemption from public cares till the following easter and that at his departure he was created a brother of the chapter fol    it is highly probable that this sumptuous book the poetry of which was undertaken by lydgate at the command of abbot curteis cutis was abbot of bury between the years

and profane characters and incidents but the common sense of mankind had not yet attained a just estimate of things lydgate in another piece has versified the rubrics of the missal which he applies to

chaucer prol b i f ii a col   seq  whose capital compositions he enumerates and on whose poetry he bestows repeated encomiums  i cannot quit this work without adding an observation relating to boccacio its original author which perhaps may deserve attention it is highly probable that boccacio learned many anecdotes of grecian history and grecian fable not to be found in any greek writer now extant from his preceptors barlaam leontius and others who had lived at constantinople while the greek literature was yet flourishing some of these are perhaps scattered up and down in the composition before us which contains a considerable part of the grecian story and especially in his treatise of the genealogies of the gods in fifteen books first printed in      fol and in italian by betussi venet      in french at paris      fol in the interpretation of the fables he is very prolix and jejune  boccacio himself calls his master leontius an inexhaustible archive of grecian tales and fables although not equally conversant with those of the latins geneal deor lib xv cap vi  he confesses that he took many things in his book of the genealogies of the gods from a vast work entitled collectivum now lost written by his cotemporary paulus peruinus the materials of which had in great measure been furnished by barlaam quicquid apud graecos inveniri potest adjutorio barlaae arbitror collegisse geneal deor lib xv cap vi  we are informed also that perusinus made use of some of these fugitive greek scholars especially barlaam for collecting rare books in that language perusinus was librarian about the year    0 to robert king of jerusalem and sicily and was the most curious and inquisitive man of his age for searching after unknown or uncommon manuscripts especially histories and poetical compositions and particularly such as were written in greek i will beg leave to cite the words of boccacio who records this anecdote et si usquam curiosissimus uit homo in perquirendis

imported into italy by the dispersion of the constantinopolitan exiles are only known at present through the medium of his writings it is certain that many oriental fictions found their way into

colonnas prologue and postscript from the prologue these things originally written by the grecian dctys and the phrygian dares who were present in the trojan war and faithful relators of what they saw are transferred into this book by guido of colonna a judge  and although a certain roman cornelius by name the nephew of the great sallustius translated dares and dictys into latin yet attempting to be concise he has very improperly omitted those particulars of the history which would have proved most agreeable to the reader in my own book therefore every article belonging to the trojan story will be comprehended  and in his postscript and i guido de colonna have followed the said dictys in every particular for this reason because dictys made his work perfect and complete in every thing  and i should have decorated this history with more mtaphors and ornaments of style and by incidental digressions which are the pictures of composition but deterred by the difficulty of the work etc guido has indeed mae dictys nothing more than the groundwork of his story all this is translated in lydgates prologue  who perpetually occur as authorities in lydgates translation homer is however

the fashionable art of illumining i do not however suppose that colonna who flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century had ever seen homers poems he might have known these and many other particulars contained in the iliad from those factitious historian whom he professes to follow yet it is not in the mean time impossible that lydgate might have seen the iliad at least in a latin translation leontius pilatus already mentioned one of the learned constantinopolitan exiles had translated the iliad into latin prose with part of the odyssy at the desire of boccacio it is a slight error in vigneul marville that this translation was procured by petrarch mel litt tom i p    the very ingenious and accurate author of memoires pour la vie de petrarque is mistaken in saying that hody supposes this version to have been made by petrarch himself live vi tom iii p     on the contrary hody has adjusted this matter with great perspicuity and from the best authorities de graec illustr lib i c   p   seq  about the year    0 this appears from petrarchs epistles to his friend boccacio senil lib iii cap    in which among other curious circumstances the former requests boccacio to send him to venice that part of leontiuss new latin version of the odyssey in which ulysses descent into hell and the vestibule of erebus are described he wishes also to see how homer blind and an asiatic had described the lake of averno and the mountain of circe in another part of these letters he acknowledges the receipt of the latin homer and mentions with how much satisfaction and joy the report of its arrival in the public library at venice was received by all the greek and latin scholars of that city hody ubi supr p         the latin iliad in prose was published under the name of laurentius

believe that lydgate had ever consulted these translations although he had traveled in france and italy one may venture to pronounce peremptorily that he did not understand as he probably never had seen the original after the migration of the roman emperors to greece boccacio was the first european that could read homer nor was there perhaps a copy of either of homers poems existing in europe till about the time the greeks were driven by the turks from constantinople see boccat geneal deor xv     theodorus archbishop of canterbury in the seventh century brought from rome into england a

i believe gave the trojan story its romantic additions it had long before been falsified by dictys and dares but those writers misrepresenting or enlarging homer only invented plain and credible facts they were the basis of colonna who first filled the faint outlines of their fabulous history with the colorings of eastern fancy and adorned their scanty forgeries with the gorgeous trappings of gothic chivalry or as our author expresses himself in his prologue speaking of colonnas improvements on his originals  for he enlumineth by craft and cadence this noble story with many a fresh color of rhetorike and many a rich flower of eloquence to make it sound the bett better  clothed with these new inventions this favorite tale descended to later times yet it appears not only with these but with an infinite variety of other embellishments not fabricated by the fertile genius of colonna but adopted from french enlargements of colonna and incorporated from romances on other subjects in the french recuyel of troy written by a french ecclesiastic rauol le feure about the year      and translated by caxton as for instance hercules having killed the eleven giants of cremona builds over them a vast tower on which he placed eleven images of metal of the size and figure of the giants b ii c    something like this i think is in amadis de gaul robert braham in the epistle to the reader prefixed to the edition of lydgates troybook of      is of opinion that the fables in the french recuyel ought to be ranked with the trifeling tales and baraye lurdries of robyn hode and bevys of hampton and are not to be compared with the faithful and true reports of this history given by dares phrigius and dictys cretensis   the description of the city of troy as newly built by king priam is extremely curious not for the capricious incredibilities and absurd inconsistencies which it exhibits it is three days journey in length and breadth the walls are two hundred cubits high of marble and

improved species which began to grow fashionable in lydgates age although much of this is in colonna he avoids to describe it geometrically having never read euclid he says that priam procured   each

account of the trojan theater must not be omitted as it displays the imperfect ideas of the stage at least of dramatic exhibition which now prevailed or rather the absolute inexistence of this sort of spectacle our author supposes that comedies and tragedies were first represented at troy all that follows on this subject is not in colonna  he defines a comedy to begin with complaint and to end with gladness expressing the actions of those only who live in the lowest condition but tragedy he informs us begins in prosperity and ends in adversity showing the wonderful vicissitudes of fortune which have happened in the lives of kings and mighty conquerours in the theater of troy he adds was a pulpit in which stood a poet who rehearsed the noble deeds that were historial of kings princes and worthy emperors and above all related those fatal and sudden catastrophes which they sometimes suffered by murder poison conspiracy or other secret and unforeseen machinations  and this was told and read by the poet and while that he in the pulpet stood with deadlye face all devoyd of blood singing his dites with tresses al to rent amydde the theater shrouded in a tent there came out men gastfull of their cheres disfygured their faces with vyseres playing by signs in the peoples sight that the poet song has on height that which the poet sung standing in the pulpit  so that there was no manner discourdaunce atween his ditees and their countenance for like as he alofte did express words of joye or of hevinesse  so craftily they the actors could them themselves transfygure lib ii cap x see also b iii c xxviii  it is added that these plays or rytes of tragedyes old were acted at troy and in the theater hallowed and yholde when the months of april and may returned  in this detail of the dramatic exhibition which prevailed in the ideal theater of troy a poet placed on the stage in a pulpit and characteristically habited is said to have recited a series of tragical adventures whose pathetic narrative was afterward expressed by the dumb gesticulations of a set of masqued actors some perhaps may be inclined to think that this imperfect species of theatric representation was the rude drama of lydgates age but surely lydgate would not have described at all much less in a long and labored digression a public show which from its nature was familiar and notorious on the contrary he describes it as a thing obsolete and existing only in remote times had a more perfect and legitimate stage now subsisted he would not have deviated from his subject to communicate unnecessary information and to deliver such minute definitions of tragedy and comedy on the whole this formal history of a theater conveys nothing more than an affected display of lydgates learning and is collected yet with apparent inaccuracy and confusion of circumstances from what the ancient grammarians have left concerning the origin of the greek tragedy or perhaps it might be borrowed by our author from some french paraphrastic version of colonnas latin romance  among the ancient authors beside those already mentioned cited in this poem are lollius for the history of troy ovid for the tale of medea and jason ulysses and polyphemus the myrmidons and other stories statius for polynices and eteocles the venerable bede fulgentius the mythologist justinian with whose institutes colonna as a civilian must have been well acquainted pliny and jacobus de vitriaco the last is produced to prove that philometer a famous philosopher invented the game of chess to divert a tyrant from his cruel purposes in chaldea and that from thence it was imported into greece but colonna or rather lydgate is of a different opinion and contends in opposition to his authority that this game so sotyll and so marvaylous was discovered by prudent clerks during the siege of troy and first practiced in that city y colonna calls him ille fabularius sulmonensis  fabulose commentans etc signat b   jacobus de vitriaco was a canon regular at paris and among other dignities in the church bishop of ptolemais in palestine about the year    0 this tradition of the invention of chess is mentioned by jacobus de vitriaco in his oriental and occidental history in three books  the anecdote of philometer is i think in egidius romanus on this subject abovementioned chaucer calls athalus that is attalus philometer the same person and who is often mentioned in pliny the invento of chess dreme p  0  col   edit urr   i must not pass over an instance of lydgates gallantry as it is the gallantry of a monk colonna takes all opportunities of satirising the fair sex and lydgate with great politeness declares himself absolutely unwilling to translate those passages of this severe moralist which contain such unjust and illiberal misrepresentations of the female character instead of which to obviate these injurious reflections our translator enters upon a formal vindication of the ladies not by a panegyric on their beauty nor encomiums on those amiable accomplishments by which they refine our sensibilities and give elegance to life but by a display of that religious fortitude with which some women have suffered martyrdom or of that inflexible chastity by means of which others have been snatched up alive into heaven in a state of genuine virginity among other striking examples which the calendar affords he mentions the transcendent grace of the eleven thousand virgins who were martyred at cologne in germany in the mean time female saints as i suspect in the barbarous ages were regarded with a greater degree of respect on account of those exaggerated ideas of gallantry which chivalry inspired and it is not improbable that the distinguished honors paid to the virgin mary might have partly proceeded from this principle  among the anachronistic improprieties which this poem contains some of which have been pointed out the most conspicuous is the fiction of hectors sepulcher or tomb which also merits our attention for another reason as it affords us an opportunity of adding some other notices of the modes of ancient architecture to those already mentioned the poet from colonna supposes that hector was buried in the principal church of troy near the high altar within a magnificent oratory erected for that purpose exactly resembling the gothic shrines of our cathedrals yet charged with many romantic decorations  with crafty archys raysyd wonder clean embowed over all the work to cure so marveylous was the celature that all the rofe and closure envyrowne was of with fine gold plated up and down with knottes grave wonder curyous fret full of stonys rich and precious etc the structure is supported by angels of gold the steps are of crystal within is not only an image of hector in solid gold but his body embalmed and exhibited to view with the resemblance of real life by means of a precious liquor circulating through every part in golden tubes artificially disposed and operating on the principles of vegetation this is from the chemistry of the times before the body were four inextinguishible lamps in golden sockets to complete the work priam founds a regular chantry of priests whom he accommodates with mansions near the church and endows with revenues to sing in this oratory for the soul of his son hector b iii  xxviii joseph of exeter in his latin poem entitled antiocheis or the crusade has borrowed from this tomb of hector in his brilliant description of the mausoleum of teuthras lib iv     i have quoted the passage in the second dissertation signat i   in the bodleian library there is a prodigious folio manuscript on vellum a translation of colonnas trojan history into verse mss laud k    fol  which has been confounded

me to be lydgates troyeboke divested of the octave stanza and reduced into a measure which might more commodiously be sung to the harp it may however be thought that this poem is rather a translation or imitation of some french original as the writer often refers to the romance if this be the case it is not immediately formed from the troyeboke of lydgate as i have suggested in the text i believe it to be about lydgates age but there is no other authority for supposing it to be written by lydgate than that in the beginning of the bodleian manuscript now before us a handwriting of about the reign of james the first assigns it to that poet i will give a few lines from the poem itself which begins with jasons expedition to cholcos the constant prelude to the trojan story in all the writers of this school  in colkos i will a cite was that men called hanne jaconitas fair and mekel great  large and long with walls huge and wondir strong fful of toures and heye paleis off rich knytes and

appears from the reference to an original the romans tells so i will however give the outlines of the story which is not uninteresting nor inartificially constructed  dioclesian a powerful emperor in germany has a rupture with barnard earl of toulouse concerning boundaries of territory contrary to the repeated persuasions of the empress who is extremely beautiful and famous for her conjugal fidelity he meets the earl with a numerous army in a pitched battle to decide the quarrel the earl is victorious and carries home a great multitude of prisoners the most respectable of which is sir tralabas of turkey whom he treats as his companion in the midst of their festivities they talk of the beauties of the empress the earls curiosity is inflamed to see so matchless a lady and he promises liberty to sir tralabas if he can be conducted unknown to the emperors court and obtain a sight of her without discovery they both set forward the earl disguised like a hermit when they arrive at the emperors court sir tralabas proves false treacherously imparts the secret to the empress that he has brought with him the earl of toulouse in disguise who is enamoured of her celebrated beauty and proposes to take advantage of so fair an opportunity of killing the emperors great and avowed enemy she rejects the proposal with indignation injoyns the knight not to communicate the secret any farther and desires to see the earl next day in the chapel at mass the next day the earl in his hermits weeds is conveniently placed at mass at leaving the chapel he asks an alms of the empress and she gives him forty florins and a ring he receives the present of the ring with the highest satisfaction and although obliged to return home in point of prudence and to avoid detection comforts himself with this reflection  well is me i have thy grace of the to have this thing if ever i have grace of the that any love between us be this may be a tokenyng he then returns home the emperor is called into some distant country and leaves his consort in the custody of two knights who attempting to gain her love without success contrive a stratagem to defame her chastity she is thrown into prison and the emperor returns unexpectedly the emperors disappointment is thus described anon to the chamber went he he longyd sore his wife to se that was so sweet a wight he called them that should her keep where is my wif is she on sleep how farys that byrd so bright the traitors answered anon and ye wit how she had done etc  the young knight sir artour that was her hervour etc for bale his armies abroad he sprede and sell in swoone on his bed   in consequence of a vision the tale of the two treacherous knights is believed and she is sentenced to the flames yet under the restriction that if a champion can be found who shall foil the two knights in battle her honor shall be cleared and her life saved a challenge is published in all parts of the world and the earl of toulouse notwithstanding the animosities which still subsist between him and the emperor privately undertakes her quarrel he appears at the emperors court in the habit of a monk and obtains permission to act as confessor to the empress in her present critical situation in the course of the confession she protests that she was always true to the emperor yet owns that once she gave a ring to the earl of toulouse the supposed confessor pronounces her innocent of the charge brought against her on which one of the traitorous knights affirms that the monk was suborned to publish this confession and that he deserved to be consumed in the same fire which was prepared for the lady the monk pretending that the honor of his religion and character was affected by this insinuation challenges both the knights to combat they are conquered and the empress after this trial is declared innocent he then openly discovers himself to be the earl of toulouse the emperors ancient enemy a solemn reconciliation ensues the earl is appointed seneschal of the emperors domain the emperor lives only three years and the earl is married to the empress  in the execution of this performance our author was obliged to be concise as the poem was intended to be sung to the harp yet when he breaks through this restraint instead of dwelling on some of the beautiful situations which he story affords he is diffuse in displaying trivial and unimportant circumstances these popular poets are never so happy as when they are describing a battle or a feast  it will not perhaps be deemed impertinent to observe that about this period the minstrels were often more amply paid than the clergy in this age as in more enlightened times the people loved better to be pleased than instructed during many of the years of the reign of henry the sixth particularly in the year    0 at the annual feast of the fraternity of the holy cross at abingdon a town in berkshire twelve priests each received four pence for singing a dirge and the same number of minstrels were rewarded each with two shillings and four pence beside diet and horsemeat some of these minstrels came only from maydenhithe or maidenhead a town

extent and therefore purposely reserved for this period which greatly contributed to the improvement of our literature and consequently of our poetry i mean the many translations of latin books especially classics which the french had been making for about the two last centuries and were still continuing to make into their own language in order to do this more effectually i will collect into one view the most distinguished of these versions not solicitous about those notices on this subject which have before occurred incidentally nor scrupulous about the charge of anticipation which to prepare the reader i shall perhaps incur by lengthening this enquiry for the sake of comprehension beyond the limits of the period just assigned in the mean time it may be pertinent to premise that from the close communication which formerly subsisted between england and france manuscript copies of many of these translations elegantly written and often embellished with the most splendid illuminations and curious miniatures were presented by the translators or their patrons to the kings of england and that they accordingly appear at present among the royal manuscripts in the british museum some of these however were transcribed if not translated by command of our kings and others brought into england and placed in the royal library by john duke of bedford regent of france  it is

polish and reform their old rude translations made two hundred years before and to reduce many of their metrical versions into prose at the same time the rage of translating ecclesiastical tracts began to decrease the latter circumstance was partly owing to the introduction of better books and partly to the invention of printing instead of procuring laborious and expensive translations of the ancient fathers the printers who multiplied greatly toward the close of this century found their advantage in publishing new translations of more agreeable books or in giving ancient versions in a

translators historical additions are the description of the first foundation of troy by priam and the succession of ascanius and his descendants after the death of turnus he introduces a digression upon boccacio for giving in his fall of princes an account of the death of dido different from that in the fourth book of the eneid among his omissions he passes over eneass descent into hell as a tale manifestly forged and not to be believed by any rational reader as if many other parts of the translators story were not equally fictitious and incredible it was translated and printed by caxton    0   the conclusion intended to be drawn from this long digression is obvious by means of these french translations our countrymen who understood french much better than latin became acquainted with many useful books which they would not otherwise have known with such assistances a commodious access to the classics was opened and the knowledge of ancient literature facilitated and familiarised in england at a much earlier period than is imagined and at a time when little more than the productions of speculative monks and irrefragrable doctors could be obtained or were studied very few englishmen i will venture to pronounce had read livy before the translation of bercheur was imported by the regent duke of bedford it is certain that many of the roman poets and historians were now read in england in the original but the latin language was for the most part confined to a few ecclesiastics when these authors therefore appeared in a language almost as intelligible as the english they fell into the hands of illiterate and common readers and contributed to sow the seeds of a national erudition and to form a popular taste even the french versions of the religious philosophical historical and allegorical compositions of those more enlightened latin writers who flourished in the middle ages had their use till better books came into vogue pregnant as they were with absurdities they communicated instruction on various and new subjects enlarged the field of information and promoted the love of reading by gratifying that growing literary curiosity which now began to want materials for the exercise of its operations how greatly our poets in general availed themselves of these treasures we may collect from this circumstance only even such writers as chaucer and lydgate men of education and learning when they translate a latin author appear to execute their work through the medium of a french version it is needless to pursue this history of french translation any farther i have given my reason for introducing it at all in the next age a great and universal revolution in literature ensued and the english themselves began to turn their thoughts to translation  these french versions enabled caxton our first printer to enrich the state of letters in this country with many valuable publications he found it no difficult task either by himself or the help of his

title commenced and whether this officer was ever solemnly crowned with laurel at his first investiture i will not pretend to determine after the earches of the learned seldom on this question have proved unsuccessful it seems most probable that the barbarous and inglorious name of versifier gradually gave way to an appellation of more elegance and dignity or rather that at length those only were in general invited to this appointment who had received accademical sanction and had merited a crown of laurel in the universities for their abilities in latin composition particularly latin versification thus the kings laureate was nothing more than a graduated rhetorician employed in the service of the king that he originally wrote in latin appears from the ancient title versificator and may be moreover collected from the two latin poems which baston and gulielmus who appear to have respectively acted in the capacity of royal poets to richard the first and edward the second officially composed on richards crusade and edwards iege of striveling castle see supr vol i p     by the way baston is called by bale laureatus apud oxonienses cent iv cap      andrew bernard

the kings poet laureate see an instrument pro poeta laureato dat      rymers fod tom xii p     but by the way in this instrument there is no specification of any thing to be done officially by bernard the king only grants to andrew bernard poetae auato which we may construe either the laureated poet or a poet laureate a salary of ten marcs till he can obtain some equivalent appointment this however is only a precept to the treasurer and chamberlains to disburse the salary and refers to letters patent not printed by rymer it is certain that gower and chaucer were never appointed to this office

english till the reformation of religion had begun to diminish the veneration for the latin language or rather till the love of novelty and a better sense of things had banished the narrow pedantries of monastic erudition and taught us to cultivate our native tongue in the mean time it is to be wished that another change might at least be suffered to take place in the execution of this institution which is confessedly gothic and unaccommodated to modern manners i mean that the more than annual return of a composition on a trite argument would be no longer required i am conscious i say this at a time when the best of kings affords the most just and copious theme for panegyric but i speak it at a time when the department is honorably filled by a poet of taste and genius which are idly wasted on the most splendid subjects when imposed by constraint and perpetually repeated  to what is here incidentally collected on an article more curious than important i add an observation which shows that the practice of other nations in this respect altogether corresponded with that of our own when we read of the laureated poets of italy and germany we are to remember that they most commonly received this honor from the state or some university seldom at least not immediately from the prince and if we find any of these professedly employed in the department of a courtpoet that they were not in consequence of that peculiar situation styled poets laureate the distinction at least in general was previously conferred the reader who requires a full and particular information concerning

rowlie a secular priest of that place about the year one thousand four hundred and seventy are genuine  it must be acknowledged that there are some circumstances which incline us to suspect these pieces to be a modern forgery on the other hand as there is some degree of plausibility in the history of their discovery as they possess considerable merit and are held to be the real productions of rowlie by many respectable critics it is my duty to give them a place in this series of our poetry if it was for no other reason than that the world might be furnished with an opportunity of examining their authenticity by exhibiting therefore the most specious evidences which i have been able to collect concerning the manner in which they were brought to light i acknowledge myself greatly indebted to the ingenious doctor harrington of bath for facilitating my enquiries on this subject  and by producing such specimens as in another respect cannot be deemed unacceptable i will endeavor not only to gratify the curiosity of the public on a subject that has long engaged the general attention and has never yet been fairly or fully stated but to supply the more inquisitive reader with every argument both external and internal for determining the merits of this interesting controversy i shall take the liberty to add my own opinion on a point at least doubtful but with the greatest deference to decisions of much higher authority  about the year    0 william cannynge an opulent merchant and an alderman of bristol afterward an ecclesiastic and dean of westbury college erected the

portico of the church the founder placed an iron chest secured by six different locks it is said there were four chests but this is a circumstance of no consequence  which seems to have been principally intended to receive instruments relating to his new structure and perhaps to his other charities these will be mentioned below  inventories of vestments and ornaments see an inventory of

have directed that this venerable chest should be annually visited and opened by the mayor and other chief magistrates of bristol attended by the vicar and churchwardens of the parish and that a feast should be celebrated every year on the day of visitation but this order that part at least which relates to the inspection of the chest was soon neglected  in the year      when the present new bridge at bristol was finished and opened for passengers an account of the ceremonies observed on occasion of opening the old bridge appeared in one of the bristol journals taken as it was declared from an ancient manuscript the old bridge was built about the year      history of bristol ms archiv bodl c iii by abel wantner  archdeacon furney in the year      left by will to the bodleian library large collections by vaious hands relating to the history and antiquities of the city church and county of gloucester which are now preserved there archiv c ut supr at the end of n iii is the manuscript history just mentioned supposed to have been compiled by abel wantner of minchinhampton in glocestershire who published proposals and specimens for a history of that county in         curiosity was naturally raised to know from whence it came at length after much enquiry concerning the person who sent this singular memoir to the newspaper it was discovered that he was a youth about seventeen years old whose name was chatterton and whose father had been sexton of radcliffe church for many years and also master of a writingschool in that parish of which the churchwardens were trustees the father however was now dead and the son was at first unwilling to acknowledge from whom or by what means he had procured so valuable an original but after many promises and some threats he confessed that he received a manuscript on parchment containing the narrative abovementioned together with many other manuscripts on parchment from his father who had found them in an iron chest the same that i have mentioned placed in a room situated over the northern entrance of the church  it appears that the father became possessed of these manuscripts in the year      for in that year he was permitted by the churchwardens of radcliffechurch to take from this chest several written pieces of parchment supposed to be illegible and useless for the purpose of converting them into covers for the writingbooks of his scholars it is impossible to ascertain what or how many writings were destroyed in consequence of this absurd and unwarrantable indulgence our schoolmaster however whose accomplishments were much above his station and who was not totally destitute of a taste for poetry found as it is said in this immense heap of obsolete manuscripts many poems written by thomas rowlie abovementioned priest of saint johns church in bristol and the confessor of alderman cannynge which he carefully preserved these at his death of course fell into the hands of his son  of the extraordinary talents of this young man more will be said hereafter it will be sufficient to observe at present that he saw the merit and value of these poems which he diligently transcribed in the year    0 he went to london carrying with him these transcripts and many originals in hopes of turning so instimable a treasure to his great advantage but from these flattering expectations falling into a dissipated course of life which ill suited with his narrow circumstances and finding that a writer of the most distinguished taste and judgment mr walpole had pronounced the poems to be suspicious in a fit of despair arising from distress and disappointment he destroyed all his papers and poisoned himself some of the poems however both transcripts and originals he had previously sold either to mr catcott a merchant of bristol or to mr barrett an eminent surgeon of the same place and an ingenious antiquary with whom they now remain mr barrett to whom i am greatly oiged or his unreserved and liberal information on this subject is now engaged in writing the antiquities of bristol  but it appears that among these there were but very few of parchment most of the poems which they purchased were copies in his own hand he was always averse to give any distinct or satisfactory account of what he possessed but from time to time as his necessities required he produced copies of his originals which were bought by these gentlemen the originals one or two only excepted he chose to retain in his own possession  the chief of these poems are the tragedy of ella the execution of sir charles bawdwin ode to ella the battle of hastings the tournament one or two dialogues and a description of cannynges feast  the tragedy of ella has six characters one of which is a lady named birtha it has a chorus consisting of minstrels whose songs are often introduced ella was governor of the castle of bristol and a puissant champion against the danes about the year   0 the story seems to be the poets invention the tragedy is opened with the following soliloquy  celmonde at brystowe before yonne roddie son has droove his wayne through half his joornie dyghte in gites of gowlde me

in that era for he died bishop of saint andrews in      but he is oddly coupled with chaucer in another respect for he wrote only some latin chronicles besides lydgate must have been sufficiently acquainted with chaucers age for he was living and a young man when chaucer died the writer also mntions stone the carmelite as living with chaucer and turgotus whereas he was lydgates cotemporary

belonging to radcliffechurch an ancient record was discovered containing the expenses for edward the fourth to see the execution of sir charles baldwin with a description of a canopy under which the

were written on one piece of parchment and as pretended in rowlies own hand this was shown to an ingenious critic and intelligent antiquary of my acquaintance who assure me that the writing was a gross and palpable forgery it was not even skilfully counterfeited the form of the letters although artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance differed very essentially from every one of our early alphabets nor were the characters uniform and consistent part of the same manuscript exhibiting some letters shaped according to the present round hand while others were traced in imitation of the ancient court and text hands the parchment was old and that it might look still older was stained on the outside with ochre which was easily rubbed off with a linen cloth care had also been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast to communicate a stronger stamp of rude antiquity the ode was written like prose no distinction or termination being made between the several verses lydgates answer which makes a part of this manuscript and is written by the same hand i have already proved to be a manifest imposition this parchment has since been unfortunately lost at the same time another manuscript on parchment written as pretended by rowlie was shown to this gentleman which tallying in every respect with the ode to ella plainly appeared to be forged in the same manner and by the same modern hand it was in prose and contained an account of saxon coins and the rise of coining in england with a list of coins poems ancient inscriptions monuments and other curiosities in the cabinet of cannynge abovementioned this parchment is also lost and i believe no copy remain  i have myself carefully examined the original manuscript as it is called of the little piece entitled accounte of w cannynges feast it is likewise on parchment and i am sorry to say that the writing betrays all the suspicious signatures which were observed in that of the ode to ella i have repeatedly and diligently compared it with three or four authentic manuscripts of the time of edward the fourth to all which i have found it totally unlike among other smaller vestiges of forgery which cannot be so easily described and explained here at the bottom are added in ink two coats of arms containing empalements of cannynge and of his friends or relations with familynames apparently delineated by the same pen which wrote the verses even the style and drawing of the armorial bearings discover the hand of a modern herald this i believe is the only pretended original of the poetry of rowlie now remaining  as to internal arguments an unnatural affectation of ancient spelling and of obsolete words not belonging to the period assigned to the poems strikes us at first sight of these old words combinations are frequently formed which never yet existed in the unpolished state of the english language and sometimes the antiquated diction is most inartificially misapplied by an improper contexture with the present modes of speech the attentive reader will also discern that our poet sometimes forgets his assumed character and does not always act his part with consistency for the chorus or interlude of the damsel who drowns herself which i have cited at length from the tragedy of ella is much more intelligible and free from uncouth expressions than the general phraseology of these compositions in the battle of hastings said to be translated from the saxon stonehenge is called a druidical temple the battle of hastings was fought in the year  0   we will grant the saxon original to have been written soon afterward about which time no other notion prevailed concerning this miraculous monument than the supposition which had been delivered down by long and constant tradition that it was erected in memory of hengists massacre this was the established and uniform opinion of the welsh and armorican bards who most probably received it from the saxon minstrels and that this was the popular belief at the time of the battle of hastings appears from the evidence of geoffrey of monmouth who wrote his history not more than eighty years after that memorable event and in this doctrine robert of gloucester and all the monkish chroniclers agree that the druids constructed this stupendous pile for a place of worship was a discovery reserved for the sagacity of a wiser age and the laborious discussion of modern antiquaries in the epistle to lydgate prefixed to the tragedy our poet condemns the absurdity and impropriety of the religious dramas and recommends some great story of human manners as most suitable for theatrical representation but this idea is the result of that taste and discrimination which could only belong to a more advanced period of society it would be tedious and trifling to descend to minute particulars but i will mention one or two in the ode to ella the poet supposes that the spectre of ella sometimes appears in the mynster that is bristolcathedral but when rowlie is supposed to have lived the present cathedral of bristol was nothing more than an augustine monastery in which henry the eighth established long afterward a bishop and a dean and chapter in the year      minster is a word almost appropriated to cathedrals and i will venture to say that the church of this monastery before the present foundation took place never was called bristolminster or the minster the inattention to this circumstance has produced another unfortunate anachronism in some of rowlies papers where in his panegyric on cannynge he says the favouryte of godde the ryende of the church the companyonne of kings and the fadre of his natyve city the great and good wyllyamme canynge bristol was never styled a city till the erection of its

henr viii ms wantner ut supr in which manuscript to that period it is constantly called a town  the description of cannynges feast is called an accounte of cannynges feast i do not think that so early as the year    0 the word accounte had lost its literal and original sense of a computus or computation and was used in a looser acceptance for narrative or detail nor had it even then lost its true spelling account in which its proper and primary signification is preserved and implied     but above all the cast of thought the complexion of the sentiments and the structure of the composition evidently prove these pieces not ancient the ode to ella for instance has exactly the air of modern poetry such i mean as is written at this day only disguised with antique spelling and phraseology that rowlie was an accomplished literary character a scholar an historian and an antiquarian if contended for i will not deny he is also said to have been an eminent mechanic and mathematician i am informed that one of rowlies manuscripts discovered in cannynges iron chest was a plan for supporting the tower of the templechurch in bistol which had greatly declined from its perpendicular in a late reparation of that church some subterraneous works were found minutely corresponding with this manuscript  nor is it impossible that he might write english poetry but that he is the writer of the poems which i have here cited and which have been so confidently ascribed to him i am not yet convinced  on the whole i am inclined to believe that these poem were composed by the son of the schoolmaster before mentioned who inherited the inestimable treasures of cannynges chest in radcliffechurch as i have already related at large this youth who died at eighteen was a prodigy of genius and would have proved the first of english poets had he reached a maturer age from his childhood he was fond of reading and writing verses and some of his early compositions which he wrote without any design to deceive have been judged to be most astonishing productions by the first critic of the present age from his situation and connections he became a skilful practitioner in various kinds of handwriting availing himself therefore of his poetical talent and his facility in the graphic art to a miscellany of obscure and neglected parchments which were commodiously placed in his own possession he was tempted to add others of a more interesting nature and such as he was enabled to forge under these circumstances without the fear of detection as to his knowledge of the old english literature which is rarely the study of a young poet a sufficient quantity of obsolete words and phrases were readily attainable from the glossary to chaucer and to percys ballads it is confessed that this youth wrote the execution of sir charles bawdwin and he who could forge that poem might easily forge all the rest  in the mean time we will allow that some pieces of poetry written by rowlie might have been preserved in cannynges chest and that these were enlarged and improved by young chatterton but if this was the case they were so much altered as to become entirely new compositions the poem which bids the fairest to be one of these originals is cannynges feast but the parchmentmanuscript of this little poem has already been proved to be a forgery a circumstance which is perhaps alone sufficient to make us suspect that no originals ever existed  it will be asked for what end or purpose did he contrive such an imposture i answer from lucrative views or perhaps from the pleasure of deceiving the world a motive which in many minds operates more powerfully than the hopes of gain he probably promised himself greater emoluments from this indirect mode of exercising his abilities or he might have sacrificed even the vanity of appearing in the character of an applauded original author to the private enjoyment of the success of his invention and dexterity  i have observed above that cannynge ordered his iron chest in radcliffechurch to be solemnly visited once in every year and that an annual entertainment should be provided for the visitors in the notices relating to this matter which some of the chief patrons of rowlies poetry have lately sent me from bristol it is affirmed that this order is contained in cannynges will and that he specifies therein that not only his manuscript evidences abovementioned but that the poems of his confessor rowlie which likewise he had deposited in the aforesaid iron chest were also to be submitted to this annual

not wyling to be idle i went to the minster of our lady and saint goodwin and then did purchase the saxon manuscripts and set my self diligently to translate and word it in english meter which in one

our attention in historiis in prosa dictando mutavit hence we may perhaps infer that they were not before in prose and that he took the from old metrical legends this is a presumptive proof that the

contains    heads  where the prose of saint etheldred is opposed to her poetical legend and these improved prosenarratives were often turned back again into verse even so late as in the age before us

excellent legend after the manner of the legend of thomas a becket he has the character of an elegant latin writer and seems to have done the same piece of service perhaps in the same way to other

saint without his legend mss harl       and mss reg    c   what shall we think of the judgment and abilities of the dignified ecclesiastic who could seriously patronise so ridiculous a narrative    by

the labors of goscelin partly resembled those of symeon metaphrastes a celebrated constantinopolitan writer of the tenth century who obtained the distinguishing appellation of the metaphrast because at the command and under the auspices of constantine porphyrogenitus he modernised the more ancient narratives of the miracles and martyrdoms of the most eminent eastern and western saints for the use of the greek church or rather digested from detached imperfect or obsolete books on the subject a new and more commodious body of the sacred biography  among the many striking contrasts between the manners and characters of ancient and modern life which these annals present we must not be surprised to find a mercer a sheriff and an alderman of london descending from his important occupations to write verses this is robert fabyan who yet is generally better known as an historian than as a poet he was esteemed not only the most facetious but the most learned of all the mercers sheriffs and aldermen of his time and no layman of that age is said to have been better skilled in the latin language he flourished about the year      in his chronicle or concordance of histories from brutus to the year      it is his usual practice at the division of the books to insert metrical prologues and other pieces in verse the best of his metres is the complaint of king edward the second who like the personages in boccacios fall of princes is very dramatically introduced reciting his own misfortunes fol     tom ii edit      see hearnes lib nig scacc p     and praefat p xxxviii fabyan says they

of henry the fifth is that a new weathercock was placed on the cross of saint pauls steeple it is said that cardinal wolsey commanded many copies of this chronicle to be committed to the flames

of sapience in which there is no imagination but a system of natural philosophy grammar logic rhetoric geometry astronomy theology and other topics of the fashionable literature caxton appears to be the author by the prologue yet it is not improbable that he might on this occasion employ some professed versifier at least as an assistant to prepare a new book of original poetry for his press the writers design is to describe the effects of wisdom from the beginning of the world and the work is a history of knowledge or learning in a vision he meets the goddess sapience in a delightful meadow

which their bodies are butchered and their limbs mangled by demons with various weapons the slothful are tormented in a horrible hall dark and tenebrous swarming with innumrable flying serpents of

loathsome pool abounding with venomous creatures on whose banks tables are spread from which they are perpetually crammed with toads by devils concupiscence is punished in a field full of immense pits or wells overflowing with fire and sulphur this visionary scene of the infernal punishments seems to be borrowed from a legend related by matthew paris under the reign of king john in which the soul of one thurkhill a native of tidstude in essex is conveyed by saint julian from his body when laid asleep into hell and heaven in hell he has a sight of the torments of the damned which are presented under the form and name of the infernal pageants and greatly resemble the fictions i have just described among the tormented is a knight who had passed his life in shedding much innocent blood at tilts and tournaments he is introduced completely armed on horseback and couches his lance against the demon who is commissioned to seize and to drag him to his eternal destiny there is likewise a priest who never said mass and a baron of the exchequer who took bribes turkill is then conducted into the mansions of the blessed which are painted with strong oriental coloring and in paradise a garden replenished with the most delicious fruits and the most exquisite variety of trees plants and flowers he sees adam a personage of gigantic proportion but the most beautiful symmetry reclined on the side of a fountain which sent forth four streams of different water and color and under the shade of a tree of immense size and height laden with fruits of every kind and breathing the richest

scenery cooperated with the mysteries of whose nature they partook at first in introducing the drama it was customary to prepare these shows at the reception of a prince or any other solemnity of a similar kind and they were presented on moveable theaters or occasional stages erected in the streets the speeches were in verse and as the procession moved forward the speakers who constantly bore some allusion to the ceremony either conversed together in the form of a dialogue or addressed the noble person whose presence occasioned the celebrity speakers seem to have been admitted into our pageants about the reign of henry the sixth  in the year      when henry the sixth after his coronation at paris made a triumphal entry into london many stanzas very probably written by lydgate were

supr fol     seq but this is a rare instance so early  in the application of which some degree of learning and invention appeared  i have observed in a former work and it is a topic which will again be considered in its proper place that the frequent and familiar use of allegoric personifications in the public pageants i mean the general use of them greatly contributed to form the school of spenser see obs fairy queen ii  0  but moreover from what is here said it seems probable that the pageaunts which being shown on civil occasions derived great part of their decorations and actors from historical fact and consequently made profane characters the subject of public exhibition dictated ideas of a regular drama much sooner than the mysteries which being confined to scripture stories or rather the legendary miracles of sainted martyrs and the no less ideal personifications of the christian virtues were not calculated to make so quick and easy a transition to the representations of real life and rational action  in the year   0  when the princess catharine of spain came to london to be married to prince arthur her procession through the city was very magnificent the pageants were numerous and superbly furnished in which the principal actors or speakers were not only god the father saint catharine and saint ursula but king alphonsus the astronomer and an ancestor of the princess a senator an angel job boethius nobility and virtue these personages sustained a sort of action at least of dialogue the lady was compared to hesperus and the prince to arcturus and alphonsus from his skill in the stars was introduced to be the fortune tellers of the match chron ms  these machineries were contrived and directed by an ecclesiastic of great eminence bishop fox who says bacon was not only a grave counselor for war or peace but also a good surveyor of works and a good master of ceremonies and any thing else that was fit for the active part belonging to the service of court or state of a great king it is probable that this prelates dexterity and address in the conduct of a courtrareeshow procured him more interest than the gravity of his counsels and the depth of his political knowledge at least his employment in this business presents a striking picture of the importance of those popular talents which even in an age of blind devotion and in the reign of a superstitious monarch were instrumental in paving the way to the most opulent dignities of the church whosoever adds the same penetrating historian had these toys in compiling they were not altogether pedantical bacons henry the seventh compl hist engl vol i p      about the year      henry the seventh went a progress into the north and at every place of distinction was received with a pageant in which he was saluted in a poetical oration not always religious as at york by ebranck a british king and the founder of the city as well as by the holy virgin and king david at worcester by henry the sixth his uncle at hereford by saint george and king ethelbert at entering the cathedral there at bristol by king bremmius prudence and justice the two latter characters were personated by young girls from a manuscript in the cotton library printed in leland collectan ad calc vol iii p       in the mean time it is to be granted that profane characters were personated in our pageants before the close of the fourteenth century stowe relates that in the year      for the entertainment of the young prince richard son of edward the black prince one hundred and thirty citizens rode disguised from newgate to kennington where the court resided attended with an innumerable multitude of waxen torches and various instruments of music in the evening of the sunday preceding candlemasday in the first rank were fortyeight habited like esquires with visors and in the second the same number in the character of knights then followed one richly arrayed like an emperor and after him at some distance one statelytyred like a pope whom followed twentyfour cardinals and after them eight or ten with black visors not amiable as if they had been legates from some foreign princes but this parade was nothing more than a dumb show unaccompanied with any kind of interlocution this appears from what follows for our chronicler adds that when they entered the hall of the palace they were met by the prince the queen and the lords whom the said mummers did salute showing by a pair of dice their desire to play with the prince which they managed with so much complaisance and skill that the prince won of them a bowl a cup and a ring of gold and the queen and lords each a ring of gold afterward having been feasted with a sumptuous banquet they had the honor of dancing with the young prince and the nobility and so the ceremony was concluded stowes surv land page    edit       to it will perhaps be said that this show was not properly a pageant but a mummery but these are frivolous distinctions and taken

the privy chamber bale says that he was called by the king ab interori camera ad privatum cubiculum cent viii  his facility in the french tongue was a qualification which might strongly recommend him to the faour of henry the seventh who was fond of studying the best french books then in vogue bacon ut supr p       hawes has left many poems which are now but imperfectly known and scarcely

life chapter p  0  see also middletons dissert p     but no such poem appears in that edition in saint johns college library at oxford  the strongest argument which induces me to give this poem to hawes and not to lydgate is that it was printed in hawess lifetime with his name by wynkyn de word bale also mentions among hawess poems templum crystallinum in one book there is however a no less strong argument for giving it to lydgate and that is from hawes himself who reciting lydgates works in the pastime of pleasure says thus ch xiv edit      signat g iiii ut infr  and the time to pass of love he made the bright temple of glass and i must add that this piece is expressly recited in the large catalogue of lydgates works belonging to w thin in speghts edition of chaucer printed   0  fol     yet on the whole i think this point still doubtful and i leave it to be determined by the reader before whom the evidence on both sides is laid at large    on a comparison it will be found to be a copy of the house of fame of chaucer in which that poet sees in a vision a temple of glass on the walls of which were engraved stories from virgils enid and ovids epistles it also strongly resembles that part of chaucers assembly of fowls in which there is the fiction of a temple of brass built on pillars of jasper whose walls are painted with the stories of unfortunate lovers v   0  and in his assembly of ladies in a chamber made of beryl and crystal belonging to the sumptuous castle of pleasant regard the walls are decorated with historical sculptures of the same kind v      the situation of hawess temple on a craggy rock of ice is evidently taken from that of chaucers house of fame in chaucers dream the poet is transported into an island where wall and yate was all of glass v

that all the picturesque invention which appears in this composition entirely belongs to chaucer yet there was some merit in daring to depart from the dull taste of the times and in choosing chaucer for a model after his sublime fancies had been so long forgotten and had given place for almost a century to legends homilies and chronicles in verse in the mean time there is reason to believe that chaucer himself copied these imageries from the romance of guigemar one of the metrical tales or lais of bretagne fol     mss harl     see supr dissertat i  translated from the armorican original into

is not however impossible that he might get this fiction from some of the early romances about troy  although perhaps chaucer might not look further than the temples in boccacios theseid for these ornaments at the same time it is to be remembered that the imagination of these old poets must have been assisted in this respect from the mode which anciently prevailed of entirely covering the walls

adventur which had happened to a baon of arragon ot unknown to king alphonsus and he now proceeds to tell no unaffecting story concerning a jealous husband at the close the minstrel humbly requests the king and queen to banish all jealous husbands from their dominions the king replied minstrel your tale is pleasant and gentle and you shall be rewarded but to show you still further how much you have entertained me i command that henceforth your tale shall be called le jaloux chatie our troubadours tale is greatly enlivened by these accompaniments and by being thrown into the mouth of a minstrel  is represented walking in a delicious meadow here he discovers a path which conducts him to a glorious image both whose hands are stretched out and pointing to two highways one of which is the path of contemplation the other of active life leading to the tower of beauty he chooses the lastmentioned path yet is often tempted to turn aside into a variety of byepaths which seemed more pleasant but proceeding directly forward he sees afar off another image on whose breast is written this is the road to the tower of doctrine he that would arrive there must avoid sloth etc the evening being far advanced he sits down at the feet of the image and falls into a profound sleep when toward the morning he is suddenly awakened by the loud blast of a horn he looks forward through a valley

as hawks our forefathers reduced hunting to a science and have left large treatises on this species of diversion which was so connected with their state of life and manners the most curious one i know is or was lately among the manuscripts of mr farmor of tusmore in oxfordshire it is entitled le art de venerie le quel maistre guillame twici venour le roy dangleterre sist n son temps per aprandre

received a tribute for every bird that was sold in that kingdom even within the verge of the court the king of france never rode out on any occasion without this officer see supr vol i p      an ingenious french writer insinuates that the passion for hunting which at this day subsists as a favorite and ashionable species of diversion in the most civilized countries of europe is a strong indication of our gothic origin and is one of the savage habits yet unreformed of our northern ancestors perhaps there is too much refinement in this remark the pleasures of the chase seem to have been implanted by nature and under due regulation if pursued as a matter of mere relaxation and not of employment are by no means incompatible with the modes of polished life    her palfrey is pegasus

have left it doubtful whether it was the third henry who ordered this romance to be translated into latin vol i p     but beside the proofs there suggested in favor of that hypothesis it appears that henry the third paid great attention to these compositions from the following curious anecdote just published which throws new light on that monarchs character  arnaud daniel a troubadour highly celebrated by dante and petrarch about the year    0 made a voyage into england where in the court of king henry the third he met a minst who challenged him at difficult rhymes the challenge was acceped a considerable wager was laid and the rival bards were shut up in separate chambers of the palace the king who appears to have much interested himself in the dispute allowed them ten days for composing and five more for learning to sing their respective pieces after which each was to exhibit his performance in the presence of his majesty the third day the english minstrel announced that he was ready the troubadour declared he had not wrote a line but that he had tried and could not as yet put two words together the following evening he overheard the minstrel practicing his chanson to himself the next day he had the good fortune to hear the same again and learned the air and words at the day appointed they both appeared before the king arnaud desired to sing first the minstrel in a fit of the greatest surprise and astonishment suddenly cried out cest ma chanson this is my song the king said it was impossible the minstrel still insisted upon it and arnaud being closely pressed ingenuously told the whole affair the king was much entertained with this adventure and ordering the wager to be withdrawn loaded them with rich presents but he afterward obliged arnaud to give a chanson of his own composition millot ut supr tom ii p      in the mean time i would not be understood to deny that henry the second encouraged these pieces for it partly appears that gualter mapes

to shadow the education of a complete gentleman or rather to point out those accomplishments which constitute the character of true gallantry and most justly deserve the reward of beauty it is not pretended that the personifications display that force of coloring and distinctness of delineation which animate the ideal portraits of john of meun but we must acknowledge that hawes has shown no inconsiderable share of imagination if not in inventing romantic action at least in applying and enriching the general incidents of the gothic fable in the creation of allegoric imagery he has

rhetoryke that species of poetry which deals in fiction and allegoric fable had been entirely lost and neglected he allows that some of lydgates successors had been skilful versifiers in the balade

abating all their chere the mighty walls of ely monastery the stones rocks and towers semblably the marble pillours and images ech one sweet all for sorrow when this cock was gone etc egl iii  it should be remembered that these pastorals were probably written while our poet was a monk of ely and although alcock was then dead yet the memory of his munificence and piety was recent in the moastery he also compliments alcocks predeessour moreton afterward archbishop of canterbury not without an allusion to his troubles and restoration to favor under richard the third and henry the

of his age  some men deliteth beholding men to fight or goodly knights in pleasant apparayle or sturdie soldiers in bright harnes and male armor and coats of mail   some glad is to see these ladies

and heroical el iv  the tower of virtue and honor introduced as a song of one of the shepherds into these pastorals exhibits no very masterly strokes of a sublime and inventive fancy it has much of the trite imagery usually applied in the fabrication of these ideal edifices it however shows our author in a new walk of poetry this magnificent tower or castle is built on inaccessible cliffs of flint the walls are of gold bright as the sun and decorated with old historyes and pictures manyfolde the turrets are beautifully shaped among its heroic inhabitants are king henry the eighth howard duke of norfolk and the earl of shrewsbury labor is the porter at the gate and virtue governs the house labor is thus pictured with some degree of spirit  fearful is labor without favor at all dreadful of visage a monster intractable like cerberus lying at gates infernal to some men his look is half intolerable his shoulders large for burden strong and able his body bristled his neck mighty and stiff by sturdie sinews his joints strong and stable like marble stones his hands be as stiff here must man vanquish the dragon of cadmus against the chimere here stoutly must he fight here must he vanquish the fearful pegasus for the golden flece here must he show his might if labor gainsay he can nothing be right this monster labor often changes his figure sometime an ox a bore or lion wight plainly he seems thus changes his nature like as protheus often changes his stature          under his brows he dreadfully does lowre with glistering eyes and sidedependant beard for thirst and hunger always his chere is sour his horned forehead does make faint hearts afeard always he drinks and yet always is dry the sweat distilling with drops abundant etc e egl iv the poet adds that when the noble howard had long boldly contended with this hideous monster had broken the bars and doors of the castle had bound the porter and was now preparing to ascend the tower of virtue and honor

mantuan our authors model appeared about the year   00 and were followed by many others their number multiplied so soon that a collection of thirtyeight modern bucolic poets in latin was printed at basil in the year      viz xxxviii author bucolici basil       vo  these writers judged this indirect and disguised mode of dialogue consisting of simple characters which spoke freely and plainly the most safe and convenient vehicle for abusing the corruptions of the church mantuan became so popular as to acquire the estimation of a classic and to be taught in schools nothing better proves the reputation in which this writer was held than a speech of shakespeares pedant the pedagogue holofernes  fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub ulmo one of mantuans lines farnaby in his preface to martial says that fauste precor gelida was too often preferred to arma virumque cano i think there is an old black letter translation of mantuan into english another translation appeared by one thomas harvey     mantuan was three times printed in england before the year   00 viz b mantuani carmelitae theologi adolescentia seu bucolica with the commentary of jodocus badius excud g dewes and h marshe

viii aprilis  to and they were reprinted by the same      and       might partly suggest the new idea of this kind of poetry  with what avidity the italian and french poets in their respective languages entered into this species of composition when the rage of latin versification had subsided and for the purposes abovementioned is an inquiry reserved for a future period i shall only add here that before the close of the fifteenth century virgils bucolics were translated into italian viz la bucolica di virgilio per fratrem evangelistam fossa de cremona ord servorum in venezia       to but thirteen years earlier we find bernardo pulci nella bucolica di virgilio di jeronimo benivieni jacopo fiorino buoninsegni de sienna epistole di luca pulci in firenze per bartolomeo miscomini      a dedication is perixed by which it appears that buoninsegni wrote a piscatory eclogue the first ever written in italy in the year      there was a second edition of pulcis vrsion la bucolica di virgilio tradotta per bernardo pulci con lelegie in fiorenza       by bernardo pulci fossa de cremona benivieni and fiorini buoninsegni  sect viii it is not the plan of this work to comprehend the scotch poetry but when i consider the close and national connection between england and scotland in the progress of manners and literature i am sensible i should be guilty of a partial and defective representation of the poetry of the former was i to omit in my series a few scotch writers who have adorned the present period with a degree of sentiment and spirit a command of phraseology and a fertility of imagination not to be found in any english poet since chaucer and lydgate more especially as they have left striking specimens of allegorical invention a species of composition which appears to have been for some time almost totally extinguished in england  the first i shall mention is william dunbar a native of salton in east lothian about the year    0 his most celebrated poems are the thistle and the rose and the golden terge  the thistle and the rose was occasioned by the marriage of james the fourth king of scotland with margaret tudor eldest daughter of henry the seventh king of england an event in which the whole future political state of both nations was vitally interested and which ultimately produced the union of the two crowns and kingdoms it was finished on the ninth day of may in the year   0  nearly three months before the arrival of the queen in scotland whose progress from richmond to edinburgh was attended with a greater magnificence of parade processions and spectacles than i ever remember to have seen on any similar occasion see a memoir cited above in lelands coll tom iii append edit    0 p     it is worthy of particular notice that during this expedition there was in the magnificent suite of the princess a company of players under the direction of one john inglish who is sometimes called johannes among the said lords and the

the city of edinburgh p     afterward the ceremonies of this stately marriage are described which yet is not equal in magnificence and expense to that of richard the second with isabell of france at calais in the year      this lastmentioned marriage is recorded with the most minute circumstances the dresses of the king and the new queen the names of the french and english nobility who attended the presents one of which is a golden cup studded with jewels and worth three thousand pounds given on both sides the banquets entertainments and a variety of other curious particulars in five large

replies that the spring of the present year was unpromising and ungenial unattended with the usual song of birds and serenity of sky and that storms and showers and the loud blasts of the horn of lord eolus had usurped her mild dominion and hitherto prevented him from wandering at leisure under the vernal branches may rejects his excuse and with a smile of majesty commands him to arise and to perform his annual homage to the flowers the birds and the sun they both enter a delicious garden filled with the richest colors and odours the sun suddenly appears in all his glory and is thus

circumstances nature immediately commands every bird beast and flower to appear in her presence and as they had been used to do every maymorning to acknowledge her universal sovereignty she sends the roe to bring the beasts the swallow to collect the birds and the yarrow the yarrow is achillea or millefolium commonly called sneeswort there is no reason for selecting this plant to go on a message to the flowers but that its name has been supposed to be derived from arrow being held a remedy for healing wounds inflicted by that weapon the poet to apologize for his boldness in personifying a plant has added full craftily conjurit scho st xii to summon the flowers they are assembled before her in an instant the lion advances first whose figure is drawn with great force and expression  this

border or tressure adorned with flower de luces we should remember that heraldry was now a science of high importance and esteem nature lifting up his cluvis cleir or shining claws and suffering him to rest on her knee crowns him with a radiant diadem of precious stones and creates him the king of beasts at the same time she injoins him to exercise justice with mercy and not to suffer his subjects of the smallest size or degree to be oppressed by those of superior strength and dignity this part of natures charge to the lion is closed with the following beautiful stroke which indicates the moral tenderness of the poets heart  and lat no bowgle with his busteous boisterous strong hornis the meik pluch ox ploughox oppress for all his pride bot in the yok go peciable him besyd st xvi  she next crowns the eagle king of fowls and sharpening his talons like darts of steel orders him to govern great and small the wren or the peacock with an uniform and equal impartiality i need not point out to my reader the political lessons couched under these commands nature now calls the flowers and observing the thistle to be surrounded with a bush of spears and therefore qualified for war gives him a crown of rubies and says in field go forth and fend the laif defend the rest  the poet continues elegantly to picture other parts of the royal arms in ordering the thistle who is now king of vegetables to prefer all herbs or flowers of rare virtue and rich odor nor ever to permit the nettle to associate with the flour de lys nor any ignoble weed to be ranked in competition with the lily in the next stanza where nature directs the thistle to honor the rose above all other flowers exclusive of the heraldic meaning our author with much address insinuates to king james the fourth an exhortation to conjugal fidelity drawn from the high birth beauty and amiable accomplishments of the royal bride the princess margaret among the pageants exhibited at edinburgh in honor of the nuptials she was complimented with the following curious mixture of classical and scriptural history ny to that cross was a scarfawst scaffold made where was represented paris and the three deesses

she calls o lusty daughter most benyng and whose lineage she exalts above that of the lily this was a preference of tudor to valois she crowns the rose with clarefied gems the luster of which illumines all the land the rose is hailed queen by the flowers last her praises are sung by the universal chorus of birds the sound of which awakens the poet from his delightful dream the fairy scene is vanished and he calls to the muse to perpetuate in verse the wonders of the splendid vision  although much fine invention and sublime fabling are displayed in the allegorical visions of our old poets yet this mode of composition by dealing only in imaginary personages and by excluding real characters and human actions necessarily fails in that chief source of entertainment which we seek in ancient poetry the representation of ancient manners  another general observation immediately resulting from the subject of this poem may be here added which illustrates the present and future state of the scotch poetry the marriage of a princess of england with a king of scotland from the new communication and intercourse opened between the two courts and kingdoms by such a connection must have greatly contributed to polish the rude manners and to improve the language literature and arts of scotland  the design of dunbars golden terge is to show the gradual and imperceptible influence of love when too far indulged over reason the discerning reader will observe that the cast of this poem is tinctured with the morality and imagery of the romaunt of the rose and the flower and leaf of chaucer  the poet walks forth at the dawn of a bright day the effects of the rising sun on a vernal landscape with its accompaniments are thus delineated in the manner of lydgate yet with more

was with their yell that in the deepest pot of hell he smorit them with smoke st xi  i have been prolix in my citations and explanations of his poem because i am of opinion that the imagination of dunbar is not less suited to satirical than to sublime allegory and that he is the first poet who has appeared with any degree of spirit in this way of writing since pierce plowman his thistle and rose and golden terge are generally and justly mentioned as his capital works but the natural complexion of his genius is of the moral and didactic cast the measure of this poem is partly that of sir thopas in chaucer and hence we may gather by the way that sir thopas was anciently viewed in the light of a ludicrous composition it is certain that the pageants and interludes of dunbars age must have quickened his invention to form those grotesque groupes the exhibition of moralities was now in high vogue among the scotch a morality was played at the marriage of james the fourth and the

this specimen will be relished by every reader who is fond of lively touches of fancy and rural imagery but the verses will have another merit with those critics who love to contemplate the progress of composition and to mark the original workings of genuine nature as they are the effusion of a mind not overlaid by the descriptions of other poets but operating by its own force and bias in the delineation of a vernal landscape on such objects as really occurred on this account they deserve to be better understood and i have therefore translated them into plain modern english prose in the

the moon which they placed in the center of universal nature again they supposed the earth to be surrounded by three elementary spheres fire air and water milton in his elegy on the death of a fair

crystalline heaven etc fol iv this idea is taken from genesis i   see also saint paul epist cor ii xii   the same system is in tasso where the archangel michael descends from heaven gier lib c ix t  0

surrounded by the nine orders of angels singing with ineffable harmony because the scriptures have mentioned several degrees of angels dionysius the areopagite and others have divided them into nine orders and those they have reduced into three hierarchies this was a tempting subject for the refining genius of the schooldivines and accordingly we find in thomas aquinas a disquisition de ordinatione angelorum secundum hierarchias et ordines quaest cviii the system which perhaps makes a better figure in poetry than in philosophy has been adopted by many poets who did not outlive the influence of the old scholastic sophistry see dante parad c xxviii tasso mentions among la grande oe del ciel tree folte squadre et ogni squadra instrutta in tree ordini gira etc gier lib xviii    and

who has used this popular theory parad l v     regions they passed and mighty regencies of seraphim and potentates and thrones in their triple degrees  and it gives great dignity to his arrangement of

ingenious and active universal poverty and every national disorder should abound it is very probable that the poem was written solely with a view of introducing this complaint after an enquiry into the causes of these infelicities which are referred to political mismanagement and the defective administration of justice the commonwealth of scotland appears whose figure is thus delineated  we saw

lyndesay under the reign of james the fifth who acted as a viceroy to france a scotch historian might collect many striking features of the state of his country during that interesting period drawn from the life  the poet then supposes that remembrance conducts him back to the cave on the seashore in which he fell asleep he is awakened by a ship firing a broadside they spared not the powder nor the stones a proof that stones were now used instead of leaden bullets at first they shot darts or carrieaux i e quarrels from great guns afterward stones which they called gunstones in the brut of

their national genius were more zealous and early friends to a reformation of religion than their neighbors in england the pomp and elegance of the catholic worship made no impression on a people whose devotion sought only for solid edification and who had no notion that the interposition of the senses could with any propriety be admitted to cooperate in an exercise of such a nature which appealed to reason alone and seemed to exclude all aids of the imagination it was natural that such a people in their system of spiritual refinement should warmly prefer the severe and rigid plan of calvin and it is from this principle that we find most of their writers at the restoration of learning taking all occasions of censuring the absurdities of popery with an unusual degree of abhorrence and asperity  in the course of the poem before us an allegory on the corruptions of the church is introduced not destitute of invention humor and elegance but founded on one of the weak theories of wickliffe who not considering religion as reduced to a civil establishment and because christ and his apostles were poor imagined that secular possessions were inconsistent with the simplicity of the gospel  in the primitive and pure ages of christianity the poet supposes that the church married poverty whose children were chastity and devotion the emperor constantine soon afterward divorced this sober and decent couple and without obtaining or asking a dispensation married the church with great solemnity to property pope silvester ratified the marriage and devotion retired to a hermitage they had two daughters riches and sensuality who were very beautiful and soon attracted such great and universal regard that they acquired the chief ascendancy in all spiritual affairs such was the influence of sensuality in particular that chastity the daughter of the church by poverty was exiled she tried but in vain to gain protection in italy and france her success was equally bad in england she strove to take refuge in the court of scotland but they drove her from the court to the clergy the bishops were alarmed at her appearance and protested they would harbor no rebel to the sea of rome they sent her to the nuns who received her in form with processions and other honors but news being immediately dispatched to sensuality and riches of her friendly reception among the nuns she was again compelled to turn fugitive she next fled to the mendicant friars who declared they could not take charge of ladies at last she was found secreted in the nunnery of the burrowmoor near edinburgh where she had met her mother poverty and her sister devotion sensuality attempts to besiege this religious house but without effect the pious sisters were armed at all points and kept an

passage in the poem before us bot in the kirk and market placis i think they should nocht hide their facis  he therefore advises the king to issue a proclamation both throw the land and borrowstonis

excrescence of female tails was prohibited in the same statute that na woman wear tails unfit in length the legitimate length of these tails is not however determined in this statute a circumstance which we may collect from a mandate issued by a papal legate in germany in the fourteenth century it is decreed that the apparel of women which ought to be consistent with modesty but now through their foolishness is degenerated into wantonness and extravagance more particularly the immoderate length of their petticoats with which they sweep the ground be restrained to a moderate fashion agreeably to the decency of the sex under pain of the sentence of excommunication velamina etiam mulierum quae ad vrecundiam designandam eis sunt concessa sed nunc per insipientiam earum in lasciviam

tom ii p      the orthodoxy of petticoats is not precisely ascertained in thi salutary edict but as it excommunicates those female tails which in our authors phrase keep the kirk and causey clean and allows such a moderate standard to the petticoat as is compatible with female delicacy it may be concluded that the ladies who covered their feet were looked upon as very laudable conformists an inch or two less would have been avowed immodesty an inch or two more an affectation bordering upon heresy see notes to ac sc poems ut supr p      what good effects followed from this ecclesiastical censure i do not find it is however evident that the scottish act of parliament against long tails was as little observed as that against muzzling probably the force of the poets satire effected a more speedy reformation of such abuses than the menaces of the church or the laws of the land but these capricious vanities were not confined to scotland alone in england as we are informed by several antiquaries the women of quality first wore trains in the reign of richard the second a novelty which induced a well meaning divine of those times to write a tract contra caudas dominarum against the tails of the ladies see collectanea historica ex dicion ms thomae gascoign apud hearnes w hemingford p      whether or no this remonstrance operated so far as to occasion the contrary extreme and even to have been the distant cause of producing the short petticoats of the present age i cannot say as an apology however for the english ladies in adopting this fashion we should in justice remember as was the case of the scotch that it was countenanced by anne richards queen a lady not less enterprising than successful in her attacks on established forms and whose authority and example were so powerful as to abolish even in defiance of france the afe commodious and natural mode of riding on horseback hitherto practiced by the women of england and to introduce sidesaddles chaucer represents

powerful as to claim a place in the history of france about the year    0 he had occupied a strong castle for the space of ten years in the province of auvergne in which he lived with the splendour and dominion of a petty sovereign having amassed by pillaging the neighboring country one hundred thousand francs his depredations brought in an annual revenue of twenty thousand floreins afterward he is tempted imprudently to sell his castle to one of the generals of the king for a considerable sum froissart introduces marcell after having sold his fortress uttering the following lamentation which strongly paints his system of depredation the feudal anarchy and the trade and traveling of those days what a joy was it when we rode forth at adventure and sometime found by the way a rich priour or merchant or a route of mulettes of montpellyer of narbone of lymons of fongans of tholous or of carcassone laden with clothe of brusselles or peltre ware coming from the fayres or laden with spycery

scotland have never yet been written with tolerable care and at present are only known from the meagre outlines of dempster and mackenzie the scotch appear to have had an early propensity to theatrical representations and it is probable that in the prosecution of such a design among several other interesting and unexpected discoveries many anecdotes conducing to illustrate the rise and

time when many of the nobility of england could hardly read or write their names and was the general patron of such genius as his age produced he encouraged skeleton almost the only professed poet of the reign of henry the seventh to write an elegy on the death of his father which is yet extant but still stronger proofs of his literary turn especially of his singular passion for poetry may be collected from a very splendid manuscript which formerly belonged to this very distinguished peer and is at present preserved in the british museum mss reg    d     it contains a large collection of english poems elegantly engrossed on vellum and superbly illuminated which had been thus sumptuously transcribed for his use the pieces are chiefly those of lydgate after which follow the aforesaid

totally given up to the pursuits of leisure and peace he was in the year      one of the leaders who commanded at the battle of blackheath against lord audley and his partisans and was often engaged

out that he was guilty of a murder just committed but titus knowing the true state of the case and desiring to save the life of his friend by losing his own charged himself with the murder at which the real murderer who stood among the crowd at the trial was so struck that he confessed the fact all three are saved and titus to repair the broken fortunes of gesippus gives him his sister in

been a writer without decorum at any period the manners of chaucers age were undoubtedly more rough and unpolished than those of the reign of henry the seventh yet chaucer a poet abounding in humor and often employed in describing the vices and follies of the world writes with a degree of delicacy when compared with skeleton that skeltons manner is gross and illiberal was the opinion of his cotemporaries at least of those critics who lived but a few years afterward and while his poems yet continued in vogue puttenham the author of the art of english poesy published in the year      speaking of the species of short meter used in the minstrelromances for the convenience of being sung to the harp at feasts and in carols and rounds and such other light or lascivious poems which are commonly more commodiously uttered by those buffoons or vices in plays than by any other person and in which the sudden return of the rhyme fatigues the ear immediately subjoins such were the rimes of

keltons characteristic vein of humor is capricious and grotesque if his whimsical extravagancies ever move our laughter at the same time they shock our sensibility his festive levities are not only vulgar and indelicate but frequently want truth and propriety his subjects are often as ridiculous as his meter but he sometimes debases his matter by his versification on the whole his genius seems better suited to low burlesque than to liberal and manly satire it is supposed by caxton that he improved our language but he sometimes affects obscurity and sometimes adopts the most familiar phraseology of the common people  he thus describes in the book of colin cloute the pompous houses of the clergy  building royally their mancyons curiously with turrettes and with toures with halles

and theology he died        i have before observed that the frequent and public exhibition of personifications in the pageaunts which anciently accompanied every high festivity greatly contributed to cherish the spirit of allegorical poetry and even to enrich the imagination of spenser and of shakespeare there is a passage in antony and cleopatra where the metaphor is excedingly beautiful but where the beauty both of the expression and the allusion is lost unless we recollect the frequency and the nature of these shows in sakespeares age act iv sc xi i must cite the whole of the context

of the impersonated vices and virtues appeared must have concurred in producing this effect and hence at the same time we are led to account for the national relish for allegorical poetry which so long prevailed among our ancestors by means of these spectacles ideal beings became common and popular objects and emblematic imagery which at present is only contemplated by a few retired readers in the obsolete pages of our elder poets grew familiar to the general eye  sect xvi in a work of this general and comprehensive nature in which the fluctuations of genius are surveyed and the dawnings or declensions of taste must alike be noticed it is impossible that every part of the subject can prove equally splendid and interesting we have i fear been toiling for some time through materials not perhaps of the most agreeable and edifying nature but as the mention of that very rude species of our drama called the morality has incidentally diverted our attention to the early state of the english stage i cannot omit so fortunate and seasonable an opportunity of endeavoring to relieve the weariness of my reader by introducing an obvious digression on the probable causes of the rise of the mysteries which as i have before remarked preceded and at length produced these allegorical fables in this respect i shall imitate those mapmakers mentioned by swift who  over inhospitable downs place elephants for want of towns nor shall i perhaps fail of being pardoned by my reader if on the same principle i should attempt to throw new light on the history of our theater by pursuing this

everal days charlemagne established many great marts of this sort in france as did william the conqueror and his norman successors in england see supr vol i p      the merchants who frequented these fairs in numerous caravans or companies employed every art to draw the people together they were therefore accompanied by juglers minstrels and buffoons who were no less interested in giving their attendance and exerting all their skill on these occasions as now but few large towns existed no public spectacles or popular amusements were established and as the sedentary pleasures of domestic life and private society were yet unknown the fairtime was the season for diversion in proportion as these shows were attended and encouraged they began to be set off with new decorations and improvements and the arts of buffoonery being rendered still more attractive by extending their circle of exhibition acquired an importance in the eyes of the people by degrees the clergy observing that the entertainments of dancing music and mimicry exhibited at these protracted annual celebrities made the people less religious by promoting idleness and a love of festivity proscribed these sports and excommunicated the performers but finding that no regard was paid to their censures they changed their plan and determined to take these recreations into their own hands they turned actors and instead of proane mummeries presented stories taken from legends or the bible this was the origin of sacred comedy the death of saint catharine acted by the monks of saint dennis rivalled the popularity of the professed players music was admitted into the churches which served as theaters for the represention of holy farces the festivals among the french called la fete de foux de lane for

subject is also very ingenious and quite new religious plays he supposes came originally from constantinople where the old grecian stage continued to flourish in some degree and the tragedies of sophocles and euripides were represented till the fourth century about that period gregory nazianzen an archbishop a poet and one of the fathers of the church banished pagan plays from the stage at constantinople and introduced select stories from the old and new testament as the ancient greek tragedy was a religious spectacle a transition was made on the same plan and the chorusses were turned into christian hymns see supr vol i p      gregory wrote many sacred dramas for this purpose which have not survived those inimitable compositions over which they triumphed for a time one however his tragedy called  or christs passion is still extant op greg nazianz tom ii p     in a manuscript cited by lambeccius it is called  iv    it seems to have been falsely attributed to apollinaris an

imitation of euripides and that this is the first time the virgin mary has been produced on the stage the fashion of acting spiritual dramas in which at first a due degree of method and decorum was preserved was at length adopted from constantinople by the italians who framed in the depth of the dark ages on this foundation that barbarous species of theatrical representation called mysteries or sacred comedies and which were soon afterward received in france hist genesis addit p     this opinion will acquire probability if we consider the early commercial intercouse between italy and constantinople and although the italians at the time when they may be supposed to have imported plays of this nature did not understand the greek language yet they could understand and consequently could imitate what they saw  in defense of voltaires hypothesis it may be further observed that the feast of fools and of the ass with other religious farces of that sort so common in europe originated at constantinople they were instituted although perhaps under other names in the greek church about the year   0 by theophylact patriarch of constantinople probably with a better design than is imagined by the ecclesiastical annalists that of weaning the minds of the people from the pagan ceremonies particularly the bacchanalian and calendary solemnities by the substitution of christian spectacles partaking of the same spirit of licentiousness the fact is however recorded by cedrenus one of the byzantine historians who flourished about the year  0 0 in the following words    that is theophylact introduced the practice which prevails even to this day of scandalising god and the memory of his saints on the most splendid and popular festivals by indecent and ridiculous songs and enormous shoutings even in the midst of those sacred hymns which we ought to offer to the divine grace with compunction of heart for the salvation of our souls but he having collected a

lively philosopher on this occasion that in the fourth century it was customary to make christian parodies and imitations in greek of the best greek classics for the use of the christian schools this practice prevailed much under the emperor julian who forbad the pagan poets orators and philosophers to be taught in the christian seminaries apollinaris bishop of laodicea abovementioned wrote greek tragedies adapted to the stage on most of the grand events recorded in the old testament after the manner of euripides on some of the familiar and domestic stories of scripture he composed comedies in imitation of menander he wrote christian odes on the plan of pindar in imitation of homer he wrote an heroic poem on the history of the bible as far as the reign of saul in twentyfour books sozomen ubi infra says that he compiled a system of grammar  on the christian model  sozomen says that these compositions now lost rivalled their great originals in genius expression and conduct his son a

itinerants traveled in companies and taking their stations in the most public streets and singing with their staves in their hands and their hats and mantles fantastically adorned with shells and emblems painted in various colors formed a sort of theatrical spectacle at length their performances excited the charity and compassion of some citizens of paris who erected a theater in which they might exhibit their religious stories in a more commodious and advantageous manner with the addition of scenery and other decorations at length professed practitioners in the histrionic art were hired to perform these solemn mockeries of religion which soon became the principal public amusement of a devout but undiscerning people  to those who are accustomed to contemplate the great picture of human follies which the unpolished ages of europe hold up to our view it will not appear surprising that the people who were forbidden to read the events of the sacred history in the bible in which they were faithfully and beautifully related should at the same time be permitted to see them represented on the stage disgraced with the grossest improprieties corrupted with inventions and additions of the most ridiculous kind sullied with impurities and expressed in the language and gesticulations of the lowest farce  on the whole the mysteries appear to have originated among the ecclesiastics and were most probably first acted at least with any degree of form by the monks this was certainly the case in the english monasteries in some regulations given by cardinal wolsey to the monasteries of the canons regular of st austin in the year      the brothers are forbidden to be lusores aut mimici players or mimics dugd monast ii     but the prohibition means that the monks should not go

practice among the french see supra vol i      the only persons who could read were in the religious societies and various other circumstances peculiarly arising from their situation profession and institution enabled the monks to be the sole performers of these representations  as learning increased and was more widely disseminated from the monasteries by a natural and easy transition the practice migrated to schools and universities which were formed on the monastic plan and in many respects resembled the ecclesiastical bodies hence a passage in shakespeares hamlet is to be explained

simony bales gods promises and christs descent into hell the scholars of the times were composing and acting plays on historical subjects and in imitation of plautus and terence hence ideas of a legitimate fable must have been imperceptibly derived to the popular and vernacular drama and we may add while no settled or public theaters were known and plays were chiefly acted by itinerant

at clerkenwell which thenc took its name in the presence of most of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom in the years    0 and   0  in the ignorant ages the parishclerks of london might justly be considered as a literary society it was an essential part of their profession not only to sing but to read an accomplishment almost solely confined to the clergy and on the whole they seem to come under the character of a religious fraternity they were incorporated into a guild or fellowship by king henry the third about the year    0 under the patronage of saint nicholas it was anciently customary for men and women of the first quality ecclesiastics and others who were lovers of churchmusic to be admitted into this corporation and they gave large gratuities for the support or education of many persons in the practice of that science their public feasts which i have already mentioned were frequent and celebrated with singing and music most commonly at guildhall chapel or college stowes surv land ut supr lib v p      before the reformation this society was constantly hired to assist as a choir at the magnificent funerals of the nobility or other distinguished personages which were celebrated within the city of london or in its neighborhood the splendid ceremonies of their anniversary procession and mass in the year      are thus related by strype from an old chronicle may the sixth was a goodly evensong at guildhall college by the masters of the clarks and their fellowship with singing and playing and the morrow after was a great mass at the same place and by the same fraternity when every clark offered an halfpenny the mass was sung by diverse of the queens marys chapel and children and after mass done every clark went their procession two and two together each having on a surplice and a rich cope and a garland and then fourscore standards streamers and banners and each one that bare them had an albe or a surplice then came in order the waits playing and then thirty clerks singing festa dies there were four of these choirs then came a canopy borne over the sacrament by four of the masters of the clerks with staff torches burning etc eccles mem vol iii chapter xiii p      their profession employment and character naturally dictated to this spiritual brotherhood the representation of plays especially those of the scriptural kind and their constant practice in shows processions and vocal music easily accounts for their address in detaining the best company which england afforded in the fourteenth century at a religious farce for more than a week  before i conclude this inquiry a great part of which has been taken up in endeavoring to show the connection between places of education and the stage it ought to be remarked that the ancient fashion of acting plays in the inns of court which may be ranked among seminaries of instruction although for a separate profession is deducible from this source the first representation of this sort which occurs on record and is mentioned with any particular circumstances was at graysinn john roos or roo student at graysinn and created a sergeant at law in the year

cardinal wolsey that the author was degraded and imprisoned hollinsh chron iii      in the year    0 under the reign of edward the sixth an order was made in the same society that no comedies commonly

manuscript papers o the late mr thomas coxeter of triniy college in oxford an ingenious and inqusitive gleaner of anecdotes for a biograhy of english poets there was a correspondence between sir fulke greville and daniel the poet concerning improvements and reformations proposed to be made in these courtinterludes but this subject will be more fully examined and further pursued in its proper place  after the restoration when the dignity of the old monarchical manners had suffered a long eclipse from a calvinistic usurpation a feeble effort was made to revive these liberal and elegant amusements at whitehall for about the year      queen catharine ordered crown to write a pastoral called calisto which was acted at court by the ladies mary and anne daughters of the duke of york and the young nobility about the same time lady anne afterward queen played the part of semandra in lees mithridates the young noblemen were instructed by betteron and the princesses by his wife who perhaps conceived shakespeare more fully than any female that ever appeared on the stage in remembrance of her theatrical instructions anne when queen assigned mrs betterton an annual pension of one hundred pounds langb dram p p    edit      cibbers apol p      this was an early practice in france in    0 margaret de valois queen of navarre wrote moralities which she called pastorals to be acted by the ladies of her court    but it was not only by the parade of processions and the decorations of scenery that these spectacles were recommended some of them in point of poetical composition were eminently beautiful and elegant among these may be mentioned a masque on the story of circe and ulysses called the inner temple masque written by william brown a student of that society about the year    0 printed from a manuscript in emanuelcollege at cambridge by tho davies works of w brown land      vol iii p     in the dedication to the society the author says if it degenerate in kind from those other the society has produced blame yourselves for not keeping a happier muse wood says that brown retiring to the inner temple became famed there for his poetry ath oxon i p      from this piece as a specimen of the templemasques in this view i make no apology for my anticipation in transcribing the following ode which circe sings as a charm to drive away sleep from ulysses who is discovered reposing under a large tree it is addressed to sleep  the charm son of erebus and night hye away and aim thy flighte where consorte none other foul than the batte and sullen owl where upon the lymber gras poppy and mandragoras with like simples not a few hang for ever drops of dew where flows lethe without coil softly like a stream of oil hye thee thither gentle sleep with this greek no longer keep thrice i charge thee by my wand thrice with moly from my hand do i touch ulysses eyes and with the iaspis then arise sagest greek page      in praise of this song it will be sufficient to say that it reminds us of some favorite touches in miltons comus to which it perhaps gave birth indeed one cannot help observing here in general although the observation more properly belongs to another place that a masque thus recently exhibited on the story of circe which there is reason to think had acquired some popularity suggested to milton the hint of a masque on the story of comus it would be superfluous to point out minutely the absolute similarity of the two characters they both deal in incantations conducted by the same mode of operation and producing effects exactly parallel  from this practice of performing interludes in the inns of court we may explain a passage in shakespeare but the present establishment of the context embarrasses that explanation as it perplexes the sentence in other respects in the second part of henry the fourth shallow is boasting to his cousin silence of his heroic exploits when he studied the law at clementsinn i was once of clements inn where i think they will talk of mad shallow yet sil you were called lusty shallow then cousin shall i was called any thing and i would have done any thing indeed too and roundly too there was i and

green when i lay at clementsinn i was then sir dagonet in arthurs show there was a little quiver fellow and he would manage you his piece thus etc does he mean that he acted sir dagonet at mileend green or at clementsinn by the application of a parenthesis only the passage will be cleared from ambiguity and the sense i would assign will appear to be just i remember at mileend green when i lay at clementsinn i was then sir dagonet in arthurs show there was a little quiver fellow etc that is i remember when i was a very young man at clementsinn and not fit to act any higher part than sir dagonet in the interludes which we used to play in the society that among the soldiers who were exercised in mileend green there was one remarkable fellow etc in the text when i laid at clements inn i

house and now much lyith there ibid fol     and in many other places  the performance of this part of sir dagonet was another of shallows feats at clementsinn on which he delights to expatiate a circumstance in the mean time quite foreign to the purpose of what he is saying but introduced on that account to heighten the ridicule of his character just as he had told silence a little before that he saw schoggans head broke by alstaffe at the courtgate and the very same day i did fight with one sampson stockfish a fruiterer behind graysinn not to mention the satire implied in making shallow act sir dagonet who was king arthurs fool arthurs show here supposed to have been presented at clementsinn was probably an interlude or masque which actually existed and was very popular in shakespeares age and seems to have been compiled from mallorys morte arthur or the history of king arthur then recently published and the favorite and most fashionable romance that mileend green was

lacewoman of cheapside went foremost and led the queen by the hand etc see ibid p  0    but these spectacles and entertainments in our lawsocieties not so much because they were romantic and ridiculous in their mode of exhibition as that they were institutions celebrated for the purposes of merriment and festivity were suppressed or suspended under the false and illiberal ideas of reformation and religion which prevailed in the fanatical court of cromwell the countenance afforded by a polite court to such entertainments became the leading topic of animadversion and abuse in the miserable declamations of the puritan theologists who attempted the business of national reformation without any knowledge of the nature of society and whose censures proceeded not so much from principles of a purer morality as from a narrowness of mind and from that ignorance of human affairs which necessarily accompanies the operations of enthusiasm  sect xvii we are now arrived at the commencement of the sixteenth century but before i proceed to a formal and particular examination of the poetry of that century and of those that follow some preliminary considerations of a more general nature and which will have a reference to all the remaining part of our history for the purpose of preparing the reader and facilitating our future inquiries appear to be necessary  on a retrospect of the fifteenth century we find much poetry written during the latter part of that period it is certain that the recent introduction into england of the art of typography to which our countrymen afforded the most liberal encouragement and which for many years was almost solely confined to the impression of english books the fashion of translating the classics from french versions the growing improvements of the english language and the diffusion of learning among the laity greatly contributed to multiply english composition both in prose and verse these causes however were yet immature nor had they gathered a sufficient degree of power and stability to operate on our literature with any vigorous effects  but there is a circumstance which among some others already suggested impeded that progression in our poetry which might yet have been expected under all these advantages a revolution the most fortunate and important in most other respects and the most interesting that occur in the history of the migration of letters now began to take place which by diverting the attention of ingenious men to new modes of thinking and the culture of new languages introduced a new course of study and gave a temporary check to vernacular composition this was the revival of classical learning  in the course of these annals we must have frequently remarked from time to time striking symptoms of a restless disposition in the human mind to rouse from its lethargic state and to break the bonds of barbarism after many imperfect and interrupted efforts this mighty deliverance in which the mouldering gothic fabrics of false religion and false philosophy fell together was not effectually completed till the close of the fifteenth century an event almost fortuitous and unexpected gave a direction to that spirit of curiosity and discovery which had not yet appeared in its full force and extent for want of an object about the year      the dispersion of the greeks after constantinople had been occupied by the turks became the means of gratifying that natural love of novelty which has so frequently led the way to the noblest improvements by the introduction of a new language and new books and totally changed the state of letters in europe but it should be remembered that some learned grecians foreseeing the persecutions impending over their country frequented italy and taught their language there before the taking of constantinople some greks who attended the florentine council and never returned for fear of the turks founded the present royal library in the city of turenne in the year   0  the greek emperor unable to resist the frequent insults of these barbarians came into england to seek redress or protection from henry the fourth he landed at dover attended by many learned greeks and the next day was honorably received at christchurch priory at canterbury by the prior thomas chyllenden in a manuscript called speculum parvulorum lib   c  0 mss bibl lambth   this great change commenced in italy a country from many circumstances above all others peculiarly qualified and prepared to adopt such a deviation italy during the darkest periods of monastic ignorance had always maintained a greater degree of refinement and knowledge than any other european country in the thirteenth century when the manners of europe appear to have been overwhelmed with every species of absurdity its luxuries were less savage and its public spectacles more rational than those of france england and germany its inhabitants were not only enriched but enlightened by that flourishing state of commerce which its commodious situation aided by the combination of other concomitant advantages contributed to support even from the time of the irruptions of the northern barbarians some glimmerings of the ancient erudition still remained in this country and in the midst of superstition and false philosophy repeated efforts were made in italy to restore the roman classics to mention no other instances alberti mussato he was honored with the laurel and died      of padua and a commander in the paduan army against the veronese wrote two latin tragedies ecerrinis printed at venice      fol with his epistolae elegi soliloquia eclogae cento ovidianus latin history of italy and bavarus ad filium and in muratoris rer ital scriptor om x mediolan      p                   see also in thesaur ital om vi part ii lugd bat      among his inedited works are mentioned lier de lit naturae et fortunae on natural causes and fate and three books in heroic verse on the war against the veronese abovementioned the name and writings of mussato were hardly known till they were brought forward to the public notice in the essay on pope which i shall not be accused of partiality as i only join the voice of the world in calling the most agreeable and judicious pice of criticism produced by the present age  or the fate of the tyrant ecerinus of verona and achilleis on the plan of the greek drama and in imitation of seneca before the year    0 the many monuments of legitimate sculpture and architecture preserved in italy had there kept alive ideas of elegance and grace and the italians from their familiarity with those precious remains of antiquity so early as the close of the fourteenth century had laid the rudiments of their perfection in the ancient arts another circumstance which had a considerable share in claring the way for this change and which deserves particular attention was the innovation introduced into the italian poetry by petrarch who inspired with the most elegant of passions and clothing his exalted feelings on that delicate subject in the most melodious and brilliant italian versification had totally eclipsed the barbarous beauties of the provencial troubadours and by this new and powerful magic had in an eminent degree contributed to reclaim at least for a time the public taste from a love of gothic manners and romantic imagery  in this country so happily calculated for their favorable reception the learned ugitives of greece when their empire was now destroyed found shelter and protection hither they imported and here they interpreted their ancient writers which had been preserved entire at constantinople these being eagerly studied by the best italian scholars communicated a taste for the graces of genuine poetry and eloquence and at the same time were instrumental in propagating a more just and general relish for the roman poets orators and historians in the mean time a more elegant and sublime philosophy was adopted a philosophy more friendly to works of taste and imagination and more agreeable to the sort of reading which was now gaining ground the scholastic subtleties and the captious logic of aristotle were abolished for the mild and divine wisdom of plato  it was a circumstance which gave the greatest splendor and importance to this new mode of erudition that it was encouraged by the popes who considering the encouragement of literature as a new expedient to establish their authority over the minds of men and enjoying an opulent and peaceable dominion in the voluptuous region of italy extended their patronage on this occasion with a liberality so generous and unreserved that the court of rome on a sudden lost its austere character and became the seat of elegance and urbanity nicholas the fifth about the year    0 established public rewards at rome for composition in the learned languages appointed pofessors in humanity and employed intelligent persons to traverse all parts of europe in search of classic manuscripts buried in the monasteries see dominei georgii dissertatio de nich quinti erga li et literat viros patrocnio romans       to

fatal and illtimed popularity did not reflect that they were shaking the throne which they thus adorned  among those who distinguished themselves in the exercise of these studies the first and most numerous were the italian ecclesiastics if not from principles of inclination and a natural impulse to follow the passion of the times it was at least their interest to concur in forwarding those improvements which were commended countenanced and authorized by their spiritual sovereign they abandoned the pedantries of a barbarous theology and cultivated the purest models of antiquity the cardinals and bishops of italy composed latin verses and with a success attained by none in more recent times in imitation of lucretius catullus and virgil nor would the encouragement of any other european potentate have availed so much in this great work of restoring literature as no other patronage could have operated with so powerful and immediate an influence on that order of men who from the nature of their education and profession must always be the principal instruments in supporting every species of liberal erudition  and here we cannot but observe the necessary connection between literary composition and the arts of design no sooner had italy banished the gothic style in eloquence and poetry than painting sculpture and architecture at the same time and in the same country

which those arts were intended to remove and reform that the foundations i have mentioned did not produce any lasting beneficial effects and that the technical phraseology of metaphysics and casuistry still continued to prevail at cambridge appears from the following anecdote in the reign of henry the seventh that university was so destitute of skill in latinity that it was obliged to hire an

restrictions it must be acknowledged that their literature was clogged with pedantry and depressed by the narrow notions of the times their writings show that they knew not how to imitate the beauties of the ancient classics exulting in an exclusive privilege the certainly did not see the solid and popular use of these studies at least they did not choose or would not venture to communicate them to the people who on the other hand were not prepared to receive them any attempts of that kind for want of assistances which did not then exist must have been premature and these lights were too feeble to dissipate the universal darkness the writers who first appeared after rome was ravaged by the goths such as boethius prudentius orosius fortunatius and sedulius and who naturally from that circumstance and because they were christians came into vogue at that period still continued in the hands of common readers and superseded the great originals in the early ages of christianity a strange opinion prevailed in conformity to which arnobius composed his celebrated book against the gentile superstitions that pagan authors were calculated to corrupt the pure theology of the gospel

lillyes excepted epistol     p   0 tom iii  and that ancient prejudices were now gradually wearing off and a national taste for critical studies and the graces of composition began to be diffused appears from this circumstance alone that from the year one thousand five hundred and three to the reformation there were more grammar schools most of which at present are perhaps of little use and importance founded and endowed in england than had been for three hundred years before the practice of educating our youth in the monasteries growing into disuse near twenty new grammar schools were established within this period and among these wolseys school at ipswich which soon fell a sacrifice to the resentment or the avarie of henry the eighth deserves particular notice as it rivalled those

does not appoint a philosophylecturer in his college as had been the constant practice in most of the previous foundations perhaps suspecting that such an endowment would not have coincided with his new course of erudition and would have only served to encourage that species of doctrine which had so long choked the paths of science and obstructed the progress of useful knowledge  these happy beginnings in favor of new and a rational system of academical education were seconded by the auspicious munificence of cardinal wolsey about the year      he founded a public chair at oxford for

explained within the walls of his own monastery plautus terence and cicero to those academics who saw the utility of philology and were desirous of deserting the gothic philosophy it may seem at first surprising that fox a weak and prejudiced writer should allow any merit to a catholic but barnes afterward appears to have been one of foxs martyrs and was executed at the stake in smithfield for a defense of lutheranism  but these innovations in the system of study were greatly discouraged and opposed by the friends of the old scholastic circle of sciences and the bigoted partisans of the catholic communion who stigmatized the greek language by the name of heresy even bishop fox when he founded the greek lecture abovementioned that he might not appear to countenance a dangerous novelty was obliged to cover his excellent institution under the venerable mantle of the authority of the church for as a seeming apology for what he had done he refers to a canonical decree of pope clement

disagreement in human affairs between cause and effect when we consider that this edict of pope clement which originated from a superstitious reverence annexed to two of these languages because they composed part of the superscription on the cross of christ should have so strongly counteracted its own principles and proved an instrument in the reformation of religion  the university of oxford was rent into factions on account of these bold attempts and the advocates of the recent improvements when the gentler weapons of persuasion could not prevail often proceeded to blows with the rigid champions of the schools but the facetious disposition of sir thomas more had no small share in deciding this singular controversy which he treated with much ingenious ridicule see among other proofs

oxford in particular these united endeavors for establishing a new course of liberal and manly science were finally consummated in the magnificent foundation of wolseys college to which all the accomplished scholars of every country in europe were invited and for whose library transcripts of all the valuable manuscripts which now fill the vatican were designed wood hist univ oxon i       but the progress of these prosperous beginnings was soon obstructed the first obstacle i shall mention was indeed but of short duration it was however an unfavourable circumstance that in the midst of this career of science henry who had ever been accustomed to gratify his passions at any rate sued for a divorce against his queen catharine the legality of this violent measure being agitated with much deliberation and solemnity wholly engrossed the attention of many able philologists whose genius and acquisitions were destined to a much nobler employment and tended to revive for a time the frivolous subtleties of casuistry and theology  but another cause which suspended the progression of these letters of much more importance and extent ultimately most happy in its consequences remains to be mentioned the enlarged conceptions acquired by the study of the greek and roman writers seem to have restored to the human mind a free exertion of its native operations and to have communicated a certain spirit of enterprise in examining every subject and at length to have released the intellectual capacity of mankind from that habitual subjection and that servility to system which had hitherto prevented it from advancing any new principle or adopting any new opinion hence under the concurrent assistance of a preparation of circumstances all centering in the same period arose the reformation of religion but this defection from the catholic communion alienated the thoughts of the learned from those pursuits by which it was produced and diverted the studies of the most accomplished scholars to inquiries into the practices and maxims of the primitive ages the nature of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction the authority of scripture and tradition of popes councils and schoolmen topics which men were not yet qualified to treat with any degree of penetration and on which the ideas of the times unenlightened by philosophy or warped by prejudice and passion were not calculated to throw just and rational illustrations when the bonds of spiritual unity were once broken this separation from an established faith ended in a variety of subordinate sects each of which called forth its respective champions into the field of religious contention the several princes of christendom were politically concerned in these disputes and the courts in which poets and orators had been recently caressed and rewarded were now filled with that most deplorable species of philosophers polemical metaphysicians the public entry of luther into worms when he had been summoned before the diet of that city was equally splendid with that of the emperor charles the fifth luther op ii          rome in return roused from her deep repose of ten centuries was compelled to vindicate her insulted doctrines with reasoning and argument the profound investigations of aquinas once more triumphed over the graces of the ciceronian urbanity and endless volumes were written on the expediency of auricular confession and the existence of purgatory thus the cause of polite literature was for awhile abandoned while the noblest abilities of europe were wasted in theological speculation and absorbed in the abyss of controversy yet it must not be forgotten that wit and raillery drawn from the sources of elegant erudition were sometimes applied and with the greatest success in this important dispute the lively colloquies of erasmus which exposed the superstitious practices of the papists with much humor and in pure latinity made more protestants than the ten tomes of john calvin a work of ridicule was now a new attempt and it should be here observed to the honor of erasmus that he was the first of the literary reformers who tried that species of composition at least with any degree of popularity the polite scholars of italy had no notion that the german theologists were capable of making their readers laugh they were now convinced of their mistake and soon found that the german pleasantry prepared the way for a revolution which proved of the most serious consequence to italy  another great temporary chek given to the general state of letters in england at this period was the dissolution of the monasteries many of the abuses in civil society are attended with some advantages in the beginnings of reformation the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly while the benefit arising from the change is the slow effect of time and not immediately perceived or enjoyed scarce any institution can be imagined less favorable to the interests of mankind than the monastic yet these seminaries although they were in a general view the nurseries of illiterate indolence and undoubtedly deserved to be uppressed under proper restrictions contained invitations and opportunities to studious leisure and literary pursuits on this event therefore a visible revolution and decline in the national state of learning succeeded most of the youth of the kingdom betook themselves to mechanical or other illiberal employments the profession of letters being now supposed to be without support and reward by the abolition of the religious houses many towns

visit rome was incarcerated by the inquisitors of the holy see as a presumptuous and dangerous heretic  it is with reluctance i enter on the bloody reign of the relentless and unamiable mary whose many dreadful martyrdoms of men eminent for learning and piety shock our sensibility with a double degree of horror in the present softened state of manners at a period of society when no poentate would inflict executions of so severe a nature and when it would be difficult to find devotees hardy enough to die for difference of opinion we must however acknowledge that she enriched both universities with some considerable benefactions yet these donations seem to have been made not from any general or libeal principle of advancing knowledge but to repair the breaches of reformation and to strengthen the return of superstition it is certain that her restoration of popery together with the monastic institution its proper appendage must have been highly pernicious to the growth of polite erudition yet although the elegant studies were now beginning to suffer a new relapse in the midst of this reign under the discouragement of all these inauspicious and unfriendly circumstances a college was established at oxford in the constitution of which the founder principally inculcates the use and necessity of classical literature and recommends it as the most important and leading object in that system of academical study which he prescribes to the youth of the new society in the year       for beside a lecturer in philosophy appointed for the ordinary purpose of teaching the

softened her temper and enlightened her understanding she frequently spoke in public with propriety and always with prudence and dignity  in the beginning of the reign of queen elisabeth which soon followed when the return of protestantism might have been expected to produce a speedy change for the better puritanism began to prevail and as the first fervours of a new sect are always violent retarded for some time the progress of ingenuous and useful knowledge the scriptures being translated into english and every man assuming a right to dictate in matters of faith and to choose his own principles weak heads drew false conclusions and erected an infinite variety of petty religions such is the abuse which attends the best designs that the meanest reader of the new testament thought he had a full comprehension of the most mysterious metaphysical doctrines in the christian faith and scorned to acquiesce in the sober and rational expositions of such difficult subjects which he might have received from a competent and intelligent teacher whom it was his duty to follow the bulk of the people who now possessed the means of discussing all theological topics from their situation and circumstances in life were naturally averse to the splendour the dominion and the opulence of an hierarchy and disclaimed the yoke of episcopal jurisdiction the new deliverance from the numerous and burdensome superstitions of the papal communion drove many pious reformers into the contrary extreme and the rage of opposition ended in a devotion entirely spiritual and abstracted external forms were abolished as impediments to the visionary reveries of a mental intercourse with heaven and because the church of rome had carried ceremonies to an absurd excess the use of any ceremonies was deemed unlawful the love of new doctrines and a new worship the triumph of gaining proselytes and the persecutions which accompanied these licentious zealots all contributed to fan the flame of enthusiasm the genius of this refined and false species of religion which defied the salutary checks of all human authority when operating in its full force was attended with consequences not less pernicious to society although less likely to last than those which flowed from the establishment of the ancient superstitions during this unsettled state of things the english reformed clergy who had fled into germany from the menaces of queen mary returned home in great numbers and in consideration of their sufferings and learning and their abilities to vindicate the principles of a national church erected in opposition to that of rome many of them were preferred to bishoprics and other eminent ecclesiastical stations these divines brought back with them into england those narrow principles concerning church government and ceremonies which they had imbibed in the petty states and republics abroad where the calvinistic discipline was adopted and where they had lived like a society of philosophers but which were totally inconsistent with the nature of a more extended church established in a great and magnificent nation and requiring an uniform system of policy a regular subordination of officers a solemnity of public worship and an observance of exterior institutions they were however in the present circumstances thought to be the most proper instruments to be employed at the head of ecclesiastical affairs not only for the purpose of vindicating the new establishment by argument and authority but of eradicating every trace of the papal corruptions by their practice and example and of effectually fixing the reformation embraced by the church of england on a durable basis but unfortunately this measure specious and expedient as it appeared at first tended to destroy that constitution which it was designed to support and to counteract those principles which had been implanted by cranmer in the reformed system of our religion their reluctance or refusal to conform in a variety of instances to the established ceremonies and their refinements in theological discipline filled the church with the most violent divisions and introduced endless intricate disputations not on fundamental doctrines of solid importance to the real interests of christianity but on positive points of idle and empty speculation which admitting no elegance of composition and calling forth no vigor of abilities exercised the learning of the clergy in the most barbarous and barren field of controversial divinity and obstructed every pursuit of polite or manly erudition even the conforming clergy from their want of penetration and from their attachment to authorities contributed to protract these frivolous and unbecoming controversies for if in their vindication of the sacerdotal vestments and of the cross of baptism instead of arguing from the jews the primitive christians the fathers councils and customs they had only appealed to common sense and the nature of things the propriety and expediency of those formalities would have been much more easily and more clearly demonstrated to these inconveniences we must add that the common ecclesiastical preferments were so much diminished by the seizure and alienation of impropriations in the late depredations of the church and which continued to be carried on with the same spirit of rapacity in the reign of elisabeth that few persons were regularly bred to the church or in other words received a learned education hence almost any that offered themselves were without distinction or examination admitted to the sacred function insomuch that in the year    0 an injunction was directed to the bishop of london from his metropolitan requiring him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other illiterate persons who exercised secular occupations strypes grindal b i chapter iv b  0  but as the vil was unavoidable this caution took but little effect numerous illuminated artificers began arly to preach

reign of queen mary wrote a pamphlet entitled the displaying o proteants and ondry their practices etc land        mo this piece soon acquired importance by being answered by lawrence humphries and other eminent reformers he printed other pieces of the same tendency he was likewise an english poet and i am glad of this opportunity of mentioning him in that character as i could not have ventured to give him a place in the series of our poetry he wrote the mirror of love land       to dedicated to queen mary also the pathway to the tower of perfection land       to with some other pieces  about the year      tere were only two divines and those of higher rank the president of magdalen college doctor lawrence humphreys mentioned in the last note of whom it will not be improper to

hadrian junius basil      fol  and the dean of christ church who were capable of preaching the public sermons before the university of oxford wood ut supr i      i will mention one instance of the extreme ignorance of our inferior clergy about the middle of the sixteenth century in the year    0 horn bishop of winchester enjoined the minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory every week one chapter of saint pauls epistles in latin and this formidable task almost beneath the abilities of an ordinary schoolboy was actually repeated by some of them before the bishop dean and prebendaries at a public episcopal visitation of that church registr horn episc winton fol  0 b  it is well known that a set of homilies was published to supply their incapacity in composing sermons but it should be remembered that one reason for prescribing this authorized system of doctrine was to prevent preachers from disturbing the peace of the church by disseminating their own novel and indigested opinions  the taste for latin composition in the reign of elisabeth notwithstanding it was fashionable both to write and speak in that language was much worse than in the reign of henry the eighth when juster models were studied and when the novelty of classical literature excited a general emulation to imitate the roman authors the latinity of aschams prose has little elegance the versification and phraseology of buchanans latin poetry are splendid and sonorous but not marked with the chaste graces and simple ornaments of the augustan age one is surprised to find the learned archbishop grindal in the statutes of a school which he founded and amply endowed recommending such barbarous and degenerate classics as palingenius sedulius and prudentius to be taught in his new foundation strypes grindal b ii chapter xvii p     this was in iu       these indeed were the classics of a reforming bishop but the wellmeaning prelate would have contributed much more to the success of his intended reformation by directing books of better taste and less piety that classical literature and the public institution of youth were now in the lowest state we may collect from a provision in archbishop parkers foundation of three scholarships at cambridge in the year      he orders that the scholars who are appointed to be elected from three the most considerable schools in kent and norfolk shall be the best and aptest scholars well instructed in the grammar and if it may be such as can make a verse blomefields norfolk ii      it became fashionable in this reign to study greek at court the maids of honor indulged their ideas of sentimental affection in the sublime contemplations of platos phaedo and the queen who understood greek better than the canons of windsor and was certainly a much greater pedant than her successor james the first translated isocrates aschams scholemaster p    b edit      and epistol lib i p    ut supr  but this passion for the greek language soon ended where it began nor do we find that it improved the national taste or influenced the writings of the age of elisabeth  all changes of rooted establishments especially of a national religion are attended with shocks and convulsions unpropitious to the repose science and study but these unavoidable inconveniences last not long when the liberal genius of protestantism had perfected its work and the first anaticisms of wellmeaning but misguided zealot had subsided every species of useful and elegant knowledge recovered its strength and arose with new vigor acquisitions whether in theology or humanity were no longer exclusively confined to the clergy the laity eagerly embraced those pursuits from which they had long been unjustly restrained and soon after the reign of elisabeth men attained that state of general improvement and those situations with respect to literature and life in which they have ever since persevered  but it remains to bring home and to apply this change in the sentiments of mankind to our main subject the customs institutions traditions and religion of the middle ages were favorable to poetry their pageaunts processions spectacles and ceremonies were friendly to imagery to personification and allegory ignorance and superstition so opposite to the real interests of human society are the parents of imagination the very devotion of the gothic times was romantic the catholic worship besides that its numerous exterior appendages were of a picturesque and even of a poetical nature disposed the mind to a state of deception and encouraged or rather authorized every species of credulity its visions miracles and legends propagated a general propensity to the mavelous and strengthened the belief of specter demons witches and incantations these illusions were heightened by churches of a wonderful mechanism and constructed on such principles of inexplicable architecture as had a tendency to impress the soul with every false sensation of religious fear the savage pomp and the capricious heroism of the baronial manners were replete with incident adventure and enterprise and the intractable genius of the feudal policy held forth those irregularities of conduct discordancies of interest and dissimilarities of situation that framed rich materials for the minstrelmuse the tacit compact of fashion which promotes civility by diffusing habits of uniformity and therefore destroys peculiarities of character and situation had not yet operated upon life nor had domestic convenience abolished unwieldy magnificence literature and a better sense of things not only banished these barbarities but superseded the mode of composition which was formed upon them romantic poetry gave way to the force of reason and inquiry as its own enchanted palaces and gardens instantaneously vanished when the christian champion displayed the shield of truth and baffled the charm of the necromancer the study of the classics together with a colder magic and a tamer mythology introduced method into composition and the universal ambition of rivalling those new patterns of excellence the faultless models of greece and rome produced that bane of invention imitation erudition was made to act upon genius fancy was weakened by reflection and philosophy the fashion of treating every thing scientifically applied speculation and theory to the arts of writing judgment was advanced above imagination and rules of criticism were established the brave eccentricities of original genius and the daring hardiness of native thought were intimidated by metaphysical sentiments of perfection and refinement setting aside the consideration of the more solid advantages which are obvious and are not the distinct object of our contemplation at present the lover of true poetry will ask what have we gained by this revolution it may be answered much good sense good taste and good criticism but in the mean time we have lost a set of manners and a system of machinery more suitable to the purposes of poetry than those which have been adopted in their place we have parted with extravagancies that are above propriety with incredibilities that are more acceptable than truth and with fictions that are more valuable than reality  end of the second volume emendations and additions in the first and second volume  the binder is directed to place emendations and

distinguished by italics it appears that walter mapes a learned archdeacon in england under the reign of king henry the second wrote a french sangreal which he translated from latin by the command of that monarch under the idea that walter mapes was a writer on this subject and in the fabulous way some critics may be induced to think that the walter archdeacon of oxford from whom geoffrey of monmouth professes to have received the materials of his history was this walter mapes and not walter calenius who was also an eminent scholar and an archdeacon of oxford see vol i p    geoffrey says in his dedication to robert earl of gloucester finding nothing said in bid or gildas of king arthur and his sucessours although their actions highly deserved to be recorded in writing and are orally celebrated by the british bards i was much surprised at so strange an omission at length walter archdeacon of oxford a man of great eloquence and learned in foreign histories offered me an ancient book in the british or armorican tongue which in one unbroken story and an elegant diction related the deeds of the british kings from brutus to cadwallader at his request although unused to rhetorical flourishes and contented with the simplicity of my own plain language i undertook the translation of that book into latin b i chapter i see also b xii chapter xx some writers suppose that

unaffecting in the italian poet emilia walking in the garden and singing is seen and heard first by arcite who immediately calls palamon they are both equally and at the same point of time captivated with her beauty yet without any expressions of jealousy or appearance of rivalry but in chaucers management of the commencement of this amor palamon by seeing emilia first acquires an advantage over arcite which ultimately renders the catastrophe more agreeable to poetical justice it is an unnatural and unanimated picture which boccacio presents of the two young princes violently enamoured of the same object and still remaining in a state of amity in chaucer the quarrel between the two friends the foundation of all the future beautiful distress of the piece commences at this moment and causes a conversation full of mutual rage and resentment this rapid transition from a friendship cemented by every tie to the most implacable hostility is on this occasion not only highly natural but produces a sudden and unexpected change of circumstances which enlivens the detail and is always interesting even afterward when arcite is released from the prison by perithous he embraces palamon at parting and in the fifth book of the theseide when palamon goes armed to the grove in search of arcite whom he finds sleeping they meet on terms of much civility and friendship and in all the mechanical formality of the manners of romance in chaucer this dialogue has a very different cast palamon at seeing arcite feels a cold sword glide throughout his heart he starts from his ambuscade and instantly salutes arcite with the appellation of false traitor and although boccacio has merit in discriminating the characters of the two princes by giving palamon the impetuosity of achilles and arcite the mildness of hector yet arcite by boccacio is here injudiciously represented as too moderate and pacific in chaucer he returns the salute with the same degree of indignation draws his sword and defies palamon to single combat so languid is boccacios plan of this amor that palamon does not begin to be jealous of arcite till he is informed in the prison that arcite lived as a favorite servant with theseus in disguise yet known to emilia when the lovers see emilia from the window of their tower she is supposed by boccacio to observe them and not to be displeased at their signs of admiration this circumstance is justly omitted by chaucer as quite unnecessary and not tending either to promote the present business or to operate in any distant consequences on the whole chaucer has eminently shown his good sense and judgment in rejecting the superfluities and improving the general arrangement of the story he frequently corrects or softens boccacios false manners and it is with singular address he has often abridged the italian poets ostentatious and pedantic parade of ancient history and mythology  page     l    read sharp  page     l    for boris read beris  page   0 not c

    chaucer appears to have been as much indebted to boccacio in his troilus and cresseide as in his knights tale at the same time we must observe that there are several long passages and even

these two passages is in the philostrato but the former containing petrarchs sonnet is not and when chaucer says he translates from latin we must remember that the italian language was called latino

compositions till some clear instance of imitation be produced i shall be slow to believe that in either he ever copied the poets of provence with whose works i apprehend he had very little if any acquaintance vol i append pref p xxxvi i have advanced the contrary doctrine at least by implication and i here beg leave to explain myself on a subject materially affecting the system of criticism that has been formed on chaucers works i have never affirmed that chaucer imitated the provencial bards although it is by no means improbable that he might have known their tales but as the peculiar nature of the provencial poetry entered deeply into the substance cast and character of some of those french and italian models which he is allowed to have followed he certainly may be said to have copied although not immediately the matter and manner of these writers i have called his house of fame originally a provencial composition i did not mean that it was written by a provencial troubadour but that chaucers original was compounded of the capricious mode of fabling and that extravagant style of fiction which constitute the essence of the provencial poetry as to the flower and the leaf which dryden pronounces to have been composed after their manner it is framed on the old allegorising spirit of the provencial writers refined and disfigured by the fopperies of the french poets in the fourteenth century the ideas of these fablers had been so strongly imbibed that they continued to operate long after petrarch had introduced a more rational method of composition  page     not q

own little story book the seven wise masters except that instead of dioclesian of rome the king is called cyrus of persia and instead of one tale each of the philosophers tells two the circumstance of persia is an argument that syntipas was originally an oriental composition see what is collected on this curious subject which is intimately concerned with the history of the invention of the middle

colors the dews clouds and imageries which gems differently exposed to the sun moon stars fire or air at particular seasons and inspected by persons particularly qualified were seen to exhibit this

english by an entry in the first leaf in the handwriting and under the signature of thomas lord fairfax cromwells general an antiquarian and a lover and collector of curious manuscripts he gave twentynine ancient manuscripts to the bodleian library one of which is a beautiful manuscript of gowers confessio amanis when the recordtower in s marys abbey at york was accidentally blown up in the grand rebellion he offered rewards to the soldiers who could bring him fragments of the scattered parchments luckily however the numerous original evidences lodged in this repository had been just before transcribed by roger dodsworth and the transcripts which formed the groundwork of dugdales monasticon consisting of forynine large folio volumes were bequeathed by fairfax to the same library fairfax also when oxford was garrisoned by the parliamentary forces exerted his utmost diligence in preserving the bodleian library from pillage so that it suffered much less than when that city was in the possession of the royalists  it appears that this book was presented by the poet gower about the year   00 to henry the fourth and that it was given by lord fairfax to his friend and kinsman sir thomas gower knight and baronet in the year      by another entry lord fairfax acknowledges to have received it in the same year as a present from that learned gentleman charles gedde esquire of saint andrews in scotland and at the end are five or six latin anagrams on gedde written and signed by lord fairfax with this title in nomen venerandi et annosi amici sui caroli geddei by king henry

  but the cinquante balades or fifty french sonnets abovementioned are the curious and valuable part of lord gowers manuscript they are not mentioned by those who have written the life of this poet or have catalogued his works nor do they appear in any other manuscript of gower which i have examined but if they should be discovered in any other i will venture to pronounce that a more authentic unembarrassed and practicable copy than this before us will not be produced although it is for the most part unpointed and obscured with abbreviations and with those mispellings which flowed from a scribe unacquainted with the french language  to say no more however of the value which these little pieces may derive from being so scarce and so little known they have much real and intrinsic merit they are tender pathetic and poetical and place our old poet gower in a more advantageous point of view than that in which he has hitherto been usually seen i know not if any even among the french poets themselves of this period have left a set of more finished sonnets for they were probably written when gower was a young man about the year    0 nor had yet any english poet treated the passion of love with equal deliccy of sentiment and elegance of composition i will transcribe four of these balades as correctly and intelligibly as i am able although i must confess there are some lines

import that the church pavement was washed against the coming of king edward but this does not at all prove or imply that the king sat at the great mynsterr window to see the gallant lancastrian baldwin pass to the scaffold a circumstance and a very improbable one mentioned in rowlies pretended poem on this subject the notice at most will prove only that the king assisted at mass in this church when he came to bristol nor is it improbable that the other churches of bristol were cleaned or adorned at the coming of a royal guest wanter above quoted is evidently wrong in the date      which ought to be      or       page     notes col   to l   add i have observed but for what reason i know not that saint ewins church at bristol was called the minster i however suspect that the poet here means bristol cathedral he calls with his accustomed misapplication of old words worcester cathedral the minster of our lady infr p   0 but i do not think this was a common appellation for that church in lydgates life of saint alban minster is used in its first simple acceptance mss coll trin oxon number xxxviii fol     saint albone of that mynstre leyde the first stone that is of saint albans monastery  page     to the end of the section add what is here said of rowlie was not only written but printed almost two years before the correct and complete edition of his poems appeared had i been apprised of that publication i should have been much more sparing in my specimens of these forgeries which had been communicated to me in manuscript and which i imagined i was imparting to my readers as curiosities i had as yet seen only a few extracts of these poems nor were those transcripts which i received always exact circumstances which i mention here to show the inconveniences under which i labored both with regard to my citations and my criticisms these scanty materials however contained sufficient evidence to convince me that the pieces were not genuine  the entire and accurate collection of rowlies now laid before the public has been so little instrumental in inducing me to change my opinion that it has served to exemplify and confirm every argument which i have produced in support of my suspicions of an imposition it has likewise afforded some new proofs  those who have been conversant in the works even of the best of our old english poets well know that one of their leading characteristics is inequality in these writers splendid descriptions ornamental comparisons poetical images and striking thoughts occur but rarely for many pages together they are tedious prosaic and uninteresting on the contrary the poems before us are every where supported they are throughout poetical and animated they have no imbecillities of style or sentiment our old english bards abound in unnatural conceptions strange imaginations and even the most ridiculous absurdities but rowlies poems present us with no incongruous combinations no mixture of manners institutions customs and characters they appear to have been composed after ideas of discrimination had taken place and when even common writers had begun to conceive on most subjects with precision and propriety there are indeed in the battle of hastings some great anachronisms and practices are mentioned which did not exist till afterward but these are such inconsistencies as proceeded from fraud as well as ignorance they are such as no old poet could have possibly fallen into and which only betray an unskilful imitation of ancient manners the verses of lydgate and his immediate successors are often rugged and unmusical but rowlies poetry sustains one uniform tone of harmony and if we brush away the asperities of the antiquated spelling conveys its cultivated imagery in a polished and agreeable strain of versification chatterton seems to have thought that the distinction of old from modern poetry consisted only in the use of old words in counterfeiting the coins of a rude age he did not forget the usual application of an artificial rust but this disguise was not sufficient to conceal the elegance of the workmanship  the battle of hastings just mentioned might be proved to be a palpable forgery for many other reasons it is said to be translated from the saxon of turgot but turgot died in  0   and the battle of hastings was fought in  0   we will however allow that turgot lived in the reign of the conqueror but on that supposition is it not extraordinary that a cotemporary writer should mention no circumstances of this action which we did not know before and which are not to be found in malmsbury ordericus vitalis and other ancient chroniclers especially as turgots description of this battle was professedly a detached and separate performance and at least on that account would be minute and circumstantial an original and a cotemporary writer describing this battle would not only have told us something new but would otherwise have been full of particularities the poet before us dwells on incidents common to all battles and such as were easily to be had from popes homer we may add that this piece not only detects itself but demonstrates the spuriousness of all the rest chatterton himself allowed the first part of it to be a forgery of his own the second part from what has been said could not be genuine and he who could write the second part was able to write every line in the whole collection but while i am speaking of this poem i cannot help exposing the futility of an argument which has been brought as a decisive evidence of its originality it is urged that the names of the chiefs who accompanied the conqueror correspond with the roll of battleabbey as if a modern forger could not have seen this venerable record but unfortunately it is printed in hollinsheads chronicle  it is said that chatterton on account of his youth and education could not write these poems this may be true but it is no proof that they are not forged who was their author on the hypothesis that rowlie was not is a new and another question i am however of opinion that it was chatterton for if we attend only to some of the pieces now extant in a periodical magazine which he published under his own signature and which are confessedly of his composition to his letters now remaining in manuscript and to the testimony of those that were acquainted with his conversation he will appear to have been a singular instance of a prematurity of abilities to have acquired a store of general information far exceeding his years and to have possessed that comprehension of mind and activity of understanding which predominated over his situations in life and his opportunities of instruction some of his publications in the magazines discover also his propensity to forgery and more particularly in the walk of ancient manners which seem greatly to have struck his imagination these among others are ethelgar a saxon poem in prose kenrick translated from the saxon cerdich translated from the saxon godred crovan a poem composed by dothnel syrric king of the isle of man the hirlas composed by blythyn prince of north wales gothmund translated from the saxon anecdote of chaucer and of the antiquity of christmas games the latter piece in which he quotes a register of keinsham nunnery which was a priory of black canons and advances many imaginary facts strongly shows his track of reading and his fondness for antiquarian imagery in this monthly collection he inserted ideal drawings of six achievements of saxon heraldry of an inedited coin of queen sexburgeo wife of king kinewalch and of a saxon amulet with explanations equally fantastic and arbitrary from rowlies pretended parchments he produced several heraldic delineations he also exhibited a draught by rowlie of bristol castle in its perfect state i very much doubt if this fortress was not almost totally ruinous in the reign of edward the fourth this draught however was that of an edifice evidently fictitious it was exceedingly ingenious but it was the representation of a building which never existed in a capricious and affected style of gothic architecture reducible to no period or system  to the whole that is here suggested on this subject let us add chattertons inducements and qualifications for forging these poems arising from his character and way of living he was an adventurer a professed hireling in the trade of literature full of projects and inventions artful enterprising unprincipled indigent and compelled to subsist by expedients  page     to not b add in the british museum there is a poem entitled a cristemasse game made by master benet how god almighty seyde to his apostelys and echeon of them were baptiste and none knew of other the piece
