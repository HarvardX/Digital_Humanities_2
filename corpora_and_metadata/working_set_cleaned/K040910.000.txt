mr burkes speech on the motion made for papers relative to the directions for charging the nabob of arcots private debts to europeans on the revenues of the carnatic february   th      with an appendix containing several documents    juliani epist    london printed for j dodsley pall mall mdcclxxxv  advertisement that the least informed reader of this speech may be enabled to enter fully into the spirit of the transaction on occasion of which it was delivered it may be proper to acquaint him that among the princes dependent on this nation in the southern part of india the most considerable at present is commonly known by the title of the nabob of arcot  this prince owed the establishment of his government against the claims of his elder brother as well as those of other competitors to the arms and influence of the british east india company being thus established in a considerable part of the dominions he now possesses he began about the year      to form at the instigation as he asserts of the servants of the east india company a variety of designs for the further extension of his territories some years after he carried his views to certain objects of interior arrangement of a very pernicious nature none of these designs could be compassed without the aid of the companys arms nor could those arms be employed consistently with an obedience to the companys orders he was therefore advised to form a more secret but an equally powerful interest among the servants of that company and among others both at home and abroad by engaging them in his interests the use of the companys power might be obtained without their ostensible authority the power might even be employed in defiance of the authority if the case should require as in truth it often did require a proceeding of that degree of boldness  the company had put him into possession of several great cities and magnificent castles the good order of his affairs his sense of personal dignity his ideas of oriental splendor and the habits of an asiatick life to which being a native of india and a mohammedan he had from his infancy been enured would naturally have led him to fix the seat of his government within his own dominions instead of this he totally sequestered himself from his country and abandoning all appearance of state he took up his residence in an ordinary house which he purchased in the suburbs of the companys factory at madras in that place he has lived without removing one day from thence for several years past he has there continued a constant cabal with the companys servants from the highest to the lowest creating out of the ruins of the country brilliant fortunes for those who will and entirely destroying those who will not be subservient to his purposes  an opinion prevailed strongly confirmed by several passages in his own letters as well as by a combination of circumstances forming a body of evidence which cannot be resisted that very great sums have been by him distributed through a long course of years to some of the companys servants besides these presumed payments in ready money of which from the nature of the thing the direct proof is very difficult debts have at several periods been acknowledged to those gentlemen to an immense amount that is to some millions of sterling money there is strong reason to suspect that the body of these debts is wholly fictitious and was never created by money bona fide lent but even on a supposition that this vast sum was really advanced it was impossible that the very reality of such an astonishing transaction should not cause some degree of alarm and incite to some sort of enquiry  it was not at all seemly at a moment when the company itself was so distressed as to require a suspension by act of parliament of the payment of bills drawn on them from india  and also a direct tax upon every house in england in order to facilitate the vent of their goods and to avoid instant insolvency  at that very moment that their servants should appear in so flourishing a condition as besides ten million of other demands on their masters to be entitled to claim a debt of three or four millions more from the territorial revenue of one of their dependent princes  the ostensible pecuniary transactions of the nabob of arcot with very private persons are so enormous that they evidently set aside every pretense of policy which might induce a prudent government in some instances to wink at ordinary loose practice in ill managed departments no caution could be too great in handling this matter no scrutiny too exact it was evidently the interest and as evidently at least in the power of the creditors by admitting secret participation in this dark and undefined concern to spread corruption to the greatest and the most alarming extent  these facts relative to the debts were so notorious the opinion of their being a principal source of the disorders of the british government in india was so undisputed and universal that there was no party no description of men in parliament who did not think themselves bound if not in honor and conscience at least in common decency to institute a vigorous enquiry into the very bottom of the business before they admitted any part of that vast and suspicious charge to be laid upon an exhausted country every plan concurred in directing such an enquiry in order that whatever was discovered to be corrupt fraudulent or oppressive should lead to a due animadversion on the offenders and if any thing fair and equitable in its origin should be found nobody suspected that much comparatively speaking would be so found it might be provided for in due subordination however to the ease of the subject and the service of the state  these were the alleged grounds for an enquiry settled in all the bills brought into parliament relative to india and there were i think no less than four of them by the bill commonly called mr pitts bill the enquiry was specially and by express words committed to the court of directors without any reserve for the interference of any other person or persons whatsoever it was ordered that they should make the enquiry into the origin and justice of these debts as far as the materials in their possession enabled them to proceed and where they found those materials deficient they should order the presidency of fort st george madras to complete the enquiry  the court of directors applied themselves to the execution of the trust reposed in them they first examined into the amount of the debt which they computed at compound interest to be l      00 sterling whether their mode of computation either of the original sums or the amount on compound interest was exact that is whether they took the interest too high or the several capitals too low is not material on whatever principle any of the calculations were made up none of them found the debt to differ from the recital of the act which asserted that the sums claimed were  very large the last head of these debts the directors compute at l       0 sterling of the existence of this debt the directors heard nothing until      and they say that although they had repeatedly written to the nabob of arcot and to their servants respecting the debt yet they had never been able to trace the origin thereof or to obtain any satisfactory information on the subject  the court of directors after stating the circumstances under which the debts appeared to them to have been contracted add as follows for these reasons we should have thought it our duty to enquire very minutely into those debts even if the act of parliament had been silent on the subject before we concurred in any measure for their payment but with the positive injunctions of the act before us to examine into their nature and origin we are indispensably bound to direct such an enquiry to be instituted they then order the president and council of madras to enter into a full examination etc etc  the directors having drawn up their order to the presidency on these principles communicated the draught of the general letter in which those orders were contained to the board of his majestys ministers and other servants lately constituted by mr pitts east india act these ministers who had just carried through parliament the bill ordering a specific enquiry immediately drew up another letter on a principle directly opposite to that which was prescribed by the act of parliament and followed by the directors in these second orders all idea of an enquiry into the justice and origin of the pretended debts particularly of the last the greatest and the most obnoxious to suspicion is abandoned they are all admitted and established without any investigation whatsoever except some private conference with the agents of the claimants is to pass for an investigation and a fund for their discharge is assigned and set apart out of the revenues of the carnatic  to this arrangement in favor of their servants servants suspected of corruption and convicted of disobedience the directors of the east india company were ordered to set their hands asserting it to arise from their own conviction and opinion in flat contradiction to their recorded sentiments their strong remonstrance and their declared sense of their duty as well under their general trust and their oath as directors as under the express injunctions of an act of parliament  the principles upon which this summary proceeding was adopted by the ministerial board are stated by themselves in a number in the appendix to this speech  by another section of the same act the same court of directors were ordered to take into consideration and to decide on the indeterminate rights of the rajah of tanjore and the nabob of arcot and in this as in the former case no power of appeal revision or alteration was reserved to any other it was a jurisdiction in a cause between party and party given to the court of directors specifically it was known that the territories of the former of these princes had been twice invaded and pillaged and the prince deposed and imprisoned by the companys servants influenced by the intrigues of the latter and for the purpose of paying his pretended debts the company had in the year      ordered a restoration of the rajah to his government under certain conditions the rajah complained that his territories had not been completely restored to him and that no part of his goods money revenues or records unjustly taken and withheld from him were ever returned the nabob on the other hand never ceased to claim the country itself and carried on a continued train of negotiation that it should again be given up to him in violation of the companys public faith  the directors in obedience to this part of the act ordered an enquiry and came to a determination to restore certain of his territories to the rajah the ministers proceeding as in the former case without hearing any party rescinded the decision of the directors refused the restitution of the territory and without regard to the condition of the country of tanjore which had been within a few years four times plundered twice by the nabob of arcot and twice by enemies brought upon it solely by the politics of the same nabob the declared enemy of that people and without discounting a shilling for their sufferings they accumulate an arrear of about  00000 pounds of pretended tribute to this enemy and then they order the directors to put their hands to a new adjudication directly contrary to a judgment in a judicial character and trust solemnly given by them and entered on their records  these proceedings naturally called for some enquiry on the   th of february      mr fox made the following motion in the house of commons after moving that the clauses of the act should be read  that the proper officer do lay before this house copies and extracts of all letters and orders of the court of directors of the united east india company in pursuance of the injunctions contained in the   th and   th clauses of the said act and the question being put it passed in the negative by a very great majority  the last speech in the debate was the following which is given to the public not as being more worthy of its attention than others some of which were of consummate ability but as entering more into the detail of the subject  speech etc the times we live in mr speaker have been distinguished by extraordinary events habituated however as we are to uncommon combinations of men and of affairs i believe nobody recollects any thing more surprising than the spectacle of this day the right honorable gentleman right honorable henry dundas  whose conduct is now in question formerly stood forth in this house the prosecutor of the worthy baronet sir thomas rumbold late governor of madras who spoke after him he charged him with several grievous acts of malversation in office with abuses of a public trust of a great and heinous nature in less than two years we see the situation of the parties reversed and a singular revolution puts the worthy baronet in a fair way of returning the prosecution in a recriminatory bill of pains and penalties grounded on a breach of public trust relative to the government of the very same part of india if he should undertake a bill of that kind he will find no difficulty in conducting it with a degree of skill and vigor fully equal to all that have been exerted against him  but the change of relation between these two gentlemen is not so striking as the total difference of their deportment under the same unhappy circumstances whatever the merits of the worthy baronets defense might have been he did not shrink from the charge he met it with manliness of spirit and decency of behavior what would have been thought of him if he had held the present language of his old accuser when articles were exhibited against him by that right honorable gentleman he did not think proper to tell the house that we ought to institute no enquiry to inspect no paper to examine no witness he did not tell us what at that time he might have told us with some show of reason that our concerns in india were matters of delicacy that to divulge any thing relative to them would be mischievous to the state he did not tell us that those who would enquire into his proceedings were disposed to dismember the empire he had not the presumption to say that for his part having obtained in his indian presidency the ultimate object of his ambition his honor was concerned in executing with integrity the trust which had been legally committed to his charge that others not having been so fortunate could not be so disinterested and therefore their accusations could spring from no other source than faction and envy to his fortune  had he been frontless enough to hold such vain vapouring language in the face of a grave a detailed a specified matter of accusation whilst he violently resisted every thing which could bring the merits of his cause to the test had he been wild enough to anticipate the absurdities of this day that is had he inferred as his late accuser has thought proper to do that he could not have been guilty of malversation in office for this sole and curious reason that he had been in office had he argued the impossibility of his abusing his power on this sole principle that he had power to abuse he would have left but one impression on the mind of every man who heard him and who believed him in his senses  that in the utmost extent he was guilty of the charge  but sir leaving these two gentlemen to alternate as criminal and accuser upon what principles they think expedient it is for us to consider whether the chancellor of the exchequer and the treasurer of the navy acting as a board of control are justified by law or policy in suspending the legal arrangements made by the court of directors in order to transfer the public revenues to the private emolument of certain servants of the east india company without the enquiry into the origin and justice of their claims prescribed by an act of parliament  it is not contended that the act of parliament did not expressly ordain an enquiry it is not asserted that this enquiry was not with equal precision of terms specially committed under particular regulations to the court of directors i conceive therefore the board of control had no right whatsoever to intermeddle in that business there is nothing certain in the principles of jurisprudence if this be not undeniably true that when a special authority is given to any persons by name to do some particular act that no others by virtue of general powers can obtain a legal title to intrude themselves into that trust and to exercise those special functions in their place i therefore consider the intermeddling of ministers in this affair as a downright usurpation but if the strained construction by which they have forced themselves into a suspicious office which every man delicate with regard to character would rather have sought constructions to avoid were perfectly sound and perfectly legal of this i am certain that they cannot be justified in declining the enquiry which had been prescribed to the court of directors if the board of control did lawfully possess the right of executing the special trust given to that court they must take it as they found it subject to the very same regulations which bound the court of directors it will be allowed that the court of directors had no authority to dispense with either the substance or the mode of enquiry prescribed by the act of parliament if they had not where in the act did the board of control acquire that capacity indeed it was impossible they should acquire it  what must we think of the fabric and texture of an act of parliament which should find it necessary to prescribe a strict inquisition that should descend into minute regulations for the conduct of that inquisition that should commit this trust to a particular description of men and in the very same breath should enable another body at their own pleasure to superfede all the provisions the legislature had made and to defeat the whole purpose end and object of the law this cannot be supposed even of an act of parliament conceived by the ministers themselves and brought forth during the delirium of the last session  my honorable friend has told you in the speech which introduced his motion that fortunately this question is not a great deal involved in the labyrinths of indian detail certainly not but if it were i beg leave to assure you that there is nothing in the indian detail which is more difficult than in the detail of any other business i admit because i have some experience of the fact that for the interior regulation of india a minute knowledge of india is requisite but on any specific matter of delinquency in its government you are as capable of judging as if the same thing were done at your door fraud injustice oppression peculation engendered in india are crimes of the same blood family and cast with those that are born and bred in england to go no farther than the case before us you are just as competent to judge whether the sum of four millions sterling ought or ought not to be passed from the public treasury into a private pocket without any title except the claim of the parties when the issue of fact is laid in madras as when it is laid in westminster terms of art indeed are different in different places but they are generally understood in none the technical style of an indian treasury is not one jot more remote than the jargon of our own exchequer from the train of our ordinary ideas or the idiom of our common language the difference therefore in the two cases is not in the comparative difficulty or facility of the two subjects but in our attention to the one and our total neglect of the other had this attention and neglect been regulated by the value of the several objects there would be nothing to complain of but the reverse of that supposition is true the scene of the indian abuse is distant indeed but we must not infer that the value of our interest in it is decreased in proportion as it recedes from our view in our politics as in our common conduct we shall be worse than infants if we do not put our senses under the tuition of our judgment and effectually cure ourselves of that optical illusion which makes a briar at our nose of greater magnitude than an oak at five hundred yards distance  i think i can trace all the calamities of this country to the single source of our not having had steadily before our eyes a general comprehensive wellconnected and wellproportioned view of the whole of our dominions and a just sense of their true bearings and relations after all its reductions the british empire is still vast and various after all the reductions of the house of commons stripped as we are of our brightest ornaments and of our most important privileges enough are yet left to furnish us if we please with means of showing to the world that we deserve the superintendance of as large an empire as this kingdom ever held and the continuance of as ample privileges as the house of commons in the plenitude of its power had been habituated to assert but if we make ourselves too little for the sphere of our duty if on the contrary we do not stretch and expand our minds to the compass of their object be well assured that every thing about us will dwindle by degrees until at length our concerns are shrunk to the dimensions of our minds it is not a predilection to mean sordid homebred cares that will avert the consequences of a false estimation of our interest or prevent the shameful dilapidation into which a great empire must fall by mean reparations upon mighty ruins  i confess i feel a degree of disgust almost leading to despair at the manner in which we are acting in the great exigencies of our country there is now a bill in this house appointing a rigid inquisition into the minutest detail of our offices at home the collection of sixteen millions annually a collection on which the public greatness safety and credit have their reliance the whole order of criminal jurisprudence which holds together society itself have at no time obliged us to call forth such powers no nor any thing like them there is not a principle of the law and constitution of this country that is not subverted to favor the execution of that project appendix no    and for what is all this apparatus of bustle and terror is it because any thing substantial is expected from it no the stir and bustle itself is the end proposed the eyeservants of a shortsighted master will employ themselves not on what is most essential to his affairs but on what is nearest to his ken great difficulties have given a just value to economy and our minister of the day must be an oeconomist whatever it may cost us but where is he to exert his talents at home to be sure for where else can he obtain a profitable credit for their exertion it is nothing to him whether the object on which he works under our eye be promising or not if he does not obtain any public benefit he may make regulations without end those are sure to pay in present expectation whilst the effect is at a distance and may be the concern of other times and other men on these principles he chooses to suppose for he does not pretend more than to suppose a naked possibility that he shall draw some resource out of crumbs dropped from the trenchers of penury that something shall be laid in store from the short allowance of revenue officers overloaded with duty and famished for want of bread by a reduction from officers who are at this very hour ready to batter the treasury with what breaks through stone walls for an increase of their appointments from the marrowless bones of these skeleton establishments by the use of every sort of cutting and of every sort of fretting tool he flatters himself that he may chip and rasp an empirical alimentary powder to diet into some similitude of health and substance the languishing chimeras of fraudulent reformation  whilst he is thus employed according to his policy and to his taste he has not leisure to enquire into those abuses in india that are drawing off money by millions from the treasures of this country which are exhausting the vital juices from members of the state where the public inanition is far more sorely felt than in the local exchequer of england not content with winking at these abuses whilst he attempts to squeeze the laborious illpaid drudges of english revenue he lavishes in one act of corrupt prodigality upon those who never served the public in any honest occupation at all an annual income equal to two thirds of the whole collection of the revenues of this kingdom  actuated by the same principle of choice he has now on the anvil another scheme full of difficulty and desperate hazard which totally alters the commercial relation of two kingdoms and what end soever it shall have may bequeath a legacy of heartburning and discontent to one of the countries perhaps to both to be perpetuated to the latest posterity this project is also undertaken on the hope of profit it is provided that out of some i know not what remains of the irish hereditary revenue a fund at some time and of some sort should be applied to the protection of the irish trade here we are commanded again to task our faith and to persuade ourselves that out of the surplus of deficiency out of the savings of habitual and systematic prodigality the minister of wonders will provide support for this nation sinking under the mountainous load of two hundred and thirty millions of debt but whilst we look with pain at his desperate and laborious trifling whilst we are apprehensive that he will break his back in stooping to pick up chaff and straws he recovers himself at an elastic bound and with a broadcast swing of his arm he squanders over his indian field a sum far greater than the clear produce of the whole hereditary revenue of the kingdom of ireland the whole of the net irish hereditary revenue is on a medium of the last seven years about l   0000 yearly the revenues of all denominations fall short more than l   0000 yearly of the charges on the present produce if mr pitts scheme was to take place he might gain from seven to ten thousand pounds a year   strange as this scheme of conduct in ministry is and inconsistent with all just policy it is still true to itself and faithful to its own perverted order those who are bountiful to crimes will be rigid to merit and penurious to service their penury is even held out as a blind and cover to their prodigality the economy of injustice is to furnish resources for the fund of corruption then they pay off their protection to great crimes and great criminals by being nexorable to the paltry frailties of little men and these modern flagellants are sure with a rigid fidelity to whip their own enormities on the vicarious back of every small offender  it is to draw your attention to economy of quite another order it is to animadvert on offenses of a far different description that my honorable friend has brought before you the motion of this day it is to perpetuate the abuses which are subverting the fabric of your empire that the motion is opposed it is therefore with reason and if he has power to carry himself through i commend his prudence that the right honorable gentleman makes his stand at the very outset and boldly refuses all parliamentary information let him admit but one step toward enquiry and he is undone you must be ignorant or he cannot be safe but before his curtain is let down and the shades of eternal night shall veil our eastern dominions from our view permit me sir to avail myself of the means which were furnished in anxious and inquisitive times to demonstrate out of this single act of the present minister what advantages you are to derive from permitting the greatest concern of this nation to be separated from the cognizance and exempted even out of the competence of parliament the greatest body of your revenue your most numerous armies your most important commerce the richest sources of your public credit contrary to every idea of the known settled policy of england are on the point of being converted into a mystery of state you are going to have one half of the globe hid even from the common liberal curiosity of an english gentleman here a grand revolution commences mark the period and mark the circumstances in most of the capital changes that are recorded in the principles and system of any government a public benefit of some kind or other has been pretended the revolution commenced in something plausible in something which carried the appearance at least of punishment of delinquency or correction of abuse but here in the very moment of the conversion of a department of british government into an indian mystery and in the very act in which the change commences a corrupt private interest is set up in direct opposition to the necessities of the nation a diversion is made of millions of the public money from the public treasury to a private purse it is not into secret negociations for war peace or alliance that the house of commons is forbidden to enquire it is a matter of account it is a pecuniary transaction it is the demand of a suspected steward upon ruined tenants and an embarrassed master that the commons of great britain are commanded not to inspect the whole tenor of the right honorable gentlemans argument is consonant to the nature of his policy the system of concealment is fostered by a system of falsehood false facts false colors false names of persons and things are its whole support  sir i mean to follow the right honorable gentleman over that field of deception clearing what he has purposely obscured and fairly stating what it was necessary for him to misrepresent for this purpose it is necessary you should know with some degree of distinctness a little of the locality the nature the circumstances the magnitude of the pretended debts on which this mavelous donation is founded as well as of the persons from whom and by whom it is claimed  madras with its dependencies is the second but with a long interval the second member of the british empire in the east the trade of that city and of the adjacent territory was not very long ago among the most flourishing in asia but since the establishment of the british power it has wasted away under an uniform gradual decline insomuch that in the year      not one merchant of eminence was to be found in the whole country mr smiths examination before the select committee appendix no    during this period of decay about six hundred thousand sterling pounds a year have been drawn off by english gentlemen on their private account by the way of china alone appendix no    if we add four hundred thousand as probably remitted through other channels and in other mediums that is in jewels gold and silver directly brought to europe and in bills upon the british and foreign companies you will scarcely think the matter overrated if we six the commencement of this extraction of money from the carnatic at a period no earlier than the year    0 and close it in the year    0 it probably will not amount to a great deal less than twenty millions of money  during the deep silent flow of this steady stream of wealth which set from india into europe it generally passed on with no adequate observation but happening at some periods to meet rifts of rocks that checked its course it grew more noisy and attracted more notice the pecuniary discussions caused by an accumulation of part of the fortunes of their servants in a debt from the nabob of arcot was the first thing which very particularly called for and long engaged the attention of the court of directors this debt amounted to eight hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling and was claimed for the greater part by english gentlemen residing at madras this grand capital settled at length by order at ten per cent afforded an annuity of eightyeight thousand pounds fourth report mr dundass committee p     whilst the directors were digesting their astonishment at this information a memorial was presented to them from three gentlemen informing them that their friends had lent likewise to merchants of canton in china a sum of not more than one million sterling in this memorial they called upon the company for their assistance and interposition with the chinese government for the recovery of the debt this sum lent to chinese merchants was at    per cent which would yield if paid an annuity of two hundred and forty thousand pounds a witness examined before the committee of secrecy says that eighteen per cent was the usual interest but he had heard that more had been given the above is the account which mr b received   perplexed as the directors were with these demands you may conceive sir that they did not find themselves very much disembarrassed by being made acquainted that they must again exert their influence for a new reserve of the happy parsimony of their servants collected into a second debt from the nabob of arcot amounting to two millions four hundred thousand pounds settled at an interest of    per cent this is known by the name of the consolidation of      as the former of the nabobs debts was by the title of the consolidation of      to this was added in a separate parcel a little reserve called the cavalry debt of one hundred and sixty thousand pounds at the same interest the whole of these four capitals amounting to four millions four hundred and forty thousand pounds produced at their several rates annuities amounting to six hundred and twentythree thousand pounds a year a good deal more than one third of the clear land tax of england at four shillings in the pound a good deal more than double the whole annual dividend of the east india company the nominal masters to the proprietors in these funds of this interest three hundred and eightythree thousand two hundred pound a year stood chargeable on the public revenues of the carnatic  sir at this moment it will not be necessary to consider the various operations which the capital and interest of this debt have successively undergone i shall speak to these operations when i come particularly to answer the right honorable gentleman on each of the heads as he has thought proper to divide them but this was the exact view in which these debts first appeared to the court of directors and to the world it varied afterward but it never appeared in any other than a most questionable shape when this gigantic phantom of debt first appeared before a young minister it naturally would have justified some degree of doubt and apprehension such a prodigy would have filled any common man with superstitious fears he would exorcise that shapeless nameless form and by every thing sacred would have adjured it to tell by what means a small number of slight individuals of no consequence or situation possessed of no lucrative offices without the command of armies or the known administration of revenues without profession of any kind without any sort of trade sufficient to employ a pedlar could have in a few years as to some even in a few months have amassed treasures equal to the revenues of a respectable kingdom was it not enough to put these gentlemen in the noviciate of their administration on their guard and to call upon them for a strict enquiry if not to justify them in a reprobation of those demands without any enquiry at all that when all england scotland and ireland had for years been witness to the immense sums laid out by the servants of the company in stocks of all denominations in the purchase of lands in the buying and building of houses in the securing quiet seats in parliament or in the tumultuous riot of contested elections in wandering throughout the whole range of those variegated modes of inventive prodigality which sometimes have excited our wonder sometimes roused our indignation that after all india was four millions still in debt to them india in debt to them for what every debt for which an equivalent of some kind or other is not given is on the face of it a fraud what is the equivalent they have given what equivalent had they to give what are the articles of commerce or the branches of manufacture which those gentlemen have carried hence to enrich india what are the sciences they beamed out to enlighten it what are the arts they introduced to cheer and to adorn it what are the religious what the moral institutions they have taught among that people as a guide to life or as a consolation when life is to be no more that there is an eternal debt a debt still paying still to owe which must be bound on the present generation in india and entailed on their mortgaged posterity for ever a debt of millions in favor of a set of men whose names with few exceptions are either buried in the obscurity of their origin and talents or dragged into light by the enormity of their crimes  in my opinion the courage of the minister was the most wonderful part of the transaction especially as he must have read or rather the right honorable gentleman says he has read for him whole volumes upon the subject the volumes by the way are not by one tenth part so numerous as the right honorable gentleman has thought proper to pretend in order to frighten you from enquiry but in these volumes such as they are the minister must have found a full authority for a suspicion at the very least of every thing relative to the great fortunes made at madras what is that authority why no other than the standing authority for all the claims which the ministry has thought fit to provide for  the grand debtor  the nabob of arcot himself hear that prince in the letter written to the court of directors at the precise period whilst the main body of these debts were contracting in his letter he states himself to be what undoubtedly he is a most competent witness to this point after speaking of the war with hyder ali in      and      and of other measures which he censures whether right or wrong it signifies nothing and into which he says he had been led by the companys servants he proceeds in this manner  if all these things were against the real interests of the company they are ten thousand times more against mine and against the prosperity of my country and the happiness of my people for your interests and mine are the same what were they owing to then to the private views of a few individuals who have enriched themselves at the expense of your influence and of my country for your servants have no trade in this country neither do you pay them high wages yet in a few years they return to england with many lacks of pagodas how can you or i account for such immense fortunes acquired in so short a time without any visible means of getting them  when he asked this question which involves its answer it is extraordinary that curiosity did not prompt the chancellor of the exchequer to that enquiry which might come in vain recommended to him by his own act of parliament does not the nabob of arcot tell us in so many words that there was no fair way of making the enormous sums sent by the companys servants to england and do you imagine that there was or could be more honesty and good faith in the demands for what remained behind in india of what nature were the transactions with himself if you follow the train of his information you must see that if these great sums were at all lent it was not property but spoil that was lent if not lent the transaction was not a contract but a fraud either way if light enough could not be furnished to authorize a full condemnation of these demands they ought to have been left to the parties who best knew and understood each others proceedings it was not necessary that the authority of government should interpose in favor of claims whose very foundation was a defiance of that authority and whose object and end was its entire subversion  it may be said that this letter was written by the nabob of arcot in a moody humor under the influence of some chagrin certainly it was but it is in such humors that truth comes out and when he tells you from his own knowledge what every one must presume from the extreme probability of the thing whether he told it or not one such testimony is worth a thousand that contradict that probability when the parties have a better understanding with each other and when they have a point to carry that may unite them in a common deceit  if this body of private claims of debt real or devised were a question as it is falsely pretended between the nabob of arcot as debtor and paul benfield and his associates as creditors i am sure i should give myself but little trouble about it if the hoards of oppression were the fund for satisfying the claims of bribery and peculation who would wish to interfere between such litigants if the demands were confined to what might be drawn from the treasures which the companys records uniformly assert that the nabob is in possession of or if he had mines of gold or silver or diamonds as we know that he has none these gentlemen might break open his hoards or dig in his mines without any disturbance from me but the gentlemen on the other side of the house know as well as i do and they dare not contradict me that the nabob of arcot and his creditors are not adversaries but collusive parties and that the whole transaction is under a false color and false names the litigation is not nor ever has been between their rapacity and his hoarded riches no it is between him and them combining and confederating on one side and the public revenues and the miserable inhabitants of a ruined country on the other these are the real plaintiffs and the real defendants in the suit refusing a shilling from his hoards for the satisfaction of any demand the nabob of arcot is always ready nay he earnestly and with eagerness and passion contends for delivering up to these pretended creditors his territory and his subjects it is therefore not from treasuries and mines but from the food of your unpaid armies from the blood withheld from the veins and whipped out of the backs of the most miserable of men that we are to pamper extortion usury and peculation under the false names of debtors and creditors of state  the great patron of these creditors to whose honor they ought to erect statues the right honorable gentleman mr dundas  in stating the merits which recommended them to his favor has ranked them under three grand divisions the first the creditors of      then the creditors of the cavalry loan and lastly the creditors of the loan in      let us examine them one by one as they pass in review before us  the first of these loans that of      he insists has an indisputable claim upon the public justice the creditors he affirms lent their money publicly they advanced it with the express knowledge and approbation of the company and it was contracted at the moderate interest of ten per cent in this loan the demand is according to him not only just but meritorious in a very high degree and one would be inclined to believe he thought so because he has put it last in the provision he has made for these claims  i readily admit this debt to stand the fairest of the whole for whatever may be my suspicious concerning a part of it i can convict it of nothing worse than the most enormous usury but i can convict upon the spot the right honorable gentleman of the most daring misrepresentation in every one fact without any exception that he has alleged in defense of this loan and of his own conduct with regard to it i will show you that this debt was never contracted with the knowledge of the company that it had not their approbation that they received the first intelligence of it with the utmost possible surprise indignation and alarm  so far from being previously apprized of the transaction from its origin that it was two years before the court of directors obtained any official intelligence of it the dealings of the servants with the nabob were concealed from the first until they were found out says mr sayer the companys council by the report of the country the presidency however at last thought proper to send an official account on this the directors tell them to your great reproach it has been concealed from us we cannot but suspect this debt to have had its weight in your proposed aggrandizement of mahomed ali the nabob of arcot but whether it has or has not certain it is you are guilty of an high breach of duty in concealing it from us  these expressions concerning the ground of the transaction its effect and its clandestine nature are in the letters bearing date march         after receiving a more full account on the   d march    0 they state that messrs john pybus john call and james bourchier as trustees for themselves and others of the nabobs private creditors had proved a deed of assignment upon the nabob and his son of fifteen districts of the nabobs country the revenues of which yielded in time of peace eight lacks of pagodas l  0000 sterling annually and likewise an assignment of the yearly tribute paid the nabob from the rajah of tanjore amounting to four lacks of rupees l 0000 the territorial revenue at that time possessed by these gentlemen without the knowledge or consent of their masters amounted to three hundred and sixty thousand pound sterling annually they were making rapid strides to the entire possession of the country when the directors whom the right honorable gentleman states as having authorized these proceedings were kept in such profound ignorance of this royal acquisition of territorial revenue by their servants that in the same letter they say this assignment was obtained by three of the members of your board in january      yet we do not find the least trace of it upon your consultations until august      nor do any of your letters to us afford any information relative to such transactions till the  st of november      by your last letters of the  th of may      you bring the whole proceedings to light in one view  as to the previous knowledge of the company and its sanction to the debts you see that this assertion of that knowledge is utterly unfounded but did the directors approve of it and ratify the transaction when it was known the very reverse on the same  d of march the directors declare upon an impartial examination of the whole conduct of our late governor and council of fort george madras and on the fullest consideration that the said governor and council have in notorious violation of the trust reposed in them manifestly preserred the interest of private individuals to that of the company in permitting the assignment of the revenues of certain valuable districts to a very large amount from the nabob to individuals  and then highly aggravating their crimes they add we order and direct that you do examine in the most impartial manner all the abovementioned transactions and that you punish by suspension degradation dismission or otherwise as to you shall seem meet all and every such servant or servants of the company who may by you be found guilty of any of the above offenses we had say the directors the mortification to find that the servants of the company who had been raised supported and owed their present opulence to the advantages gained in such service have in this instance most unfaithfully betrayed their trust abandoned the companys interest and prostituted its influence to accomplish the purposes of individuals whilst the interest of the company is almost wholly neglected and payment to us rendered extremely precarious here then is the rock of approbation of the court of directors on which the right honorable gentleman says this debt was founded any member mr speaker who should come into the house on my reading this sentence of condemnation of the court of directors against their unfaithful servants might well imagine that he had heard an harsh severe unqualified invective against the present ministerial board of control so exactly do the proceedings of the patrons of this abuse tally with those of the actors in it that the expressions used in the condemnation of the one may serve for the reprobation of the other without the change of a word  to read you all the expressions of wrath and indignation fulminated in this dispatch against the meritorious creditors of the right honorable gentleman who according to him have been so fully approved by the company would be to read the whole  the right honorable gentleman with an address peculiar to himself every now and then slides in the presidency of madras as synonymous to the company that the presidency did approve the debt is certain but the right honorable gentleman as prudent in suppressing as skilful in bringing forward his matter has not chosen to tell you that the presidency were the very persons guilty of contracting this loan creditors themselves and agents and trustees for all the other creditors for this the court of directors accuse them of breach of trust and for this the right honorable gentleman considers them as perfectly good authority for those claims it is pleasant to hear a gentleman of the law quote the approbation of creditors as an authority for their own debt  how they came to contract the debt to themselves how they came to act as agents for those whom they ought to have controlled is for your enquiry the policy of this debt was announced to the court of directors by the very persons concerned in creating it till very lately say the presidency the nabob placed his dependence on the company now he has been taught by illadvisers that an interest out of doors may stand him in good stead he has been made to believe that his private creditors have power and interest to overruled the court of directors for the threats of the creditors and total subversion of the authority of the company in favor of the nabobs power and the increase thereby of his evil dispositions and the great derangement of all public concerns see select committee fort st georges letters   st november      and january   st    0 september         and governor bourchiers letters to the nabob of arcot   st november      and december  th       the nabob was not misinformed the private creditors instantly qualified a vast number of votes and having made themselves masters of the court of proprietors as well as extending a powerful cabal in other places as important they so completely overturned the authority of the court of directors at home and abroad that this poor baffled government was soon obliged to lower its tone it was glad to be admitted into a partnership with its own servants the court of directors establishing the debt which they had reprobated as a breach of trust and which was planned for the subversion of their authority settled its payments on a par with those of the public and even so were not able to obtain peace or even equality in their demands all the consequences lay in a regular and irresistible train by employing their influence for the recovery of this debt their orders issued in the same breath against creating new debts only animated the strong desires of their servants to this prohibited prolific sport and it soon produced a swarm of sons and daughters not in the least degenerated from the virtue of their parents  from that moment the authority of the court of directors expired in the carnatic and every where else every man says the presidency who opposes the government and its measures finds an immediate countenance from the nabob even our discarded officers however unworthy are received into the nabobs service he the nabob is in a great degree the cause of our present inability by diverting the revenues of the carnatic through private channels  even this peshcush the tanjore tribute circumstanced as he and we are he has assigned over to others who now set themselves in opposition to the company consultations october         on the   th communicated to the nabob  it was indeed a matter of no wonderful sagacity to determine whether the court of directors with their miserable salaries to their servants of four or five hundred pound a year or the distributor of millions was most likely to be obeyed it was an invention beyond the imagination of all the speculatists of our speculating age to see a government quietly settled in one and the same town composed of two distinct members one to pay scantily for obedience and the other to bribe high for rebellion and revolt  the next thing which recommends this particular debt to the right honorable gentleman is it seems the moderate interest of ten per cent it would be lost labor to observe on this assertion the nabob in a long apologetic letter nabobs letter to governor palk papers published by the directors in      papers printed by the same authority      for the transaction between him and the body of the creditors states the fact as i shall state it to you in the accumulation of this debt the first interest paid was from thirty to thirtysix per cent it was then brought down to twentyfive per cent at length it was reduced to twenty and there it found its rest during the whole process as often as any of these monstrous interests fell into an arrear into which they were continually falling the arrear formed into a new capital see papers printed by order of a general court in    0 p     and p     as also nabobs letter to governor dupre   th july      i have taken up loans by which i have suffered a loss of upwards of a crore of pagodas four million sterling by interest on an heavy interest  letter   th january      notwithstanding i have taken much trouble and have made many payments to my creditors yet the load of my debt which became so great by interest and compound interest is not cleared  was added to the old and the same interest of twenty per cent accrued upon both the company having got some scent of the enormous usury which prevailed at madras thought it necessary to interfere and to order all interests to be lowered to ten per cent this order which contained no exception though it by no means pointed particularly to this class of debts came like a thunderclap on the nabob he considered his political credit as ruined but to find a remedy to this unexpected evil he again added to the old principal twenty per cent interest accruing for the last year thus a new fund was formed and it was on that accumulation of various principals and interests heaped upon interests not on the sum originally lent as the right honorable gentleman would make you believe that ten per cent was settled on the whole  when you consider the enormity of the interest at which these debts were contracted and the several interests added to the principal i believe you will not think me so skeptical if i should doubt whether for this debt of l   0000 the nabob ever saw l  00000 in real money the right honorable gentleman suspecting with all his absolute dominion over fact that he never will be able to defend even this venerable patriarchal job though sanctified by its numerous issue and hoary with prescriptive years has recourse to recrimination the last resource of guilt he says that this loan of      was provided for in mr foxs india bill and judging of others by his own nature and principles he more than insinuates that this provision was made not from any sense of merit in the claim but from partiality to general smith a proprietor and an agent for that debt if partiality could have had any weight against justice and policy with the then ministers and their friends general smith had titles to it but the right honorable gentleman knows as well as i do that general smith was very far from looking on himself as partially treated in the arrangements of that time indeed what man dared to hope for private partiality in that sacred plan for relief to nations  it is not necessary that the right honorable gentleman should sarcastically call that time to our recollection well do i remember every circumstance of that memorable period god forbid i should forget it o illustrious disgrace o victorious defeat may your memorial be fresh and new to the latest generations may the day of that generous conflict be stamped in characters never to be cancelled or worn out from the records of time let no man hear of us who shall not hear that in a struggle against the intrigues of courts and the perfidious levity of the multitude we fell in the cause of honor in the cause of our country in the cause of human nature itself but if fortune should be as powerful over fame as she has been prevalent over virtue at least our conscience is beyond her jurisdiction my poor share in the support of that great measure no man shall ravish from me it shall be safely lodged in the sanctuary of my heart never never to be torn from thence but with those holds that grapple it to life  i say i well remember that bill and every one of its honest and its wise provisions it is not true that this debt was ever protected or enforced or any revenue whatsoever set apart for it it was left in that bill just where it stood to be paid or not to be paid out of the nabobs private treasures according to his own discretion the company had actually given it their sanction though always relying for its validity on the sole security of the faith of him the nabob of arcot who without their knowledge or consent entered into the original obligation it had no other sanction it ought to have had no other so far was mr foxs bill from providing funds for it as this ministry have wickedly done for this and for ten times worse transactions out of the public estate that an express clause immediately preceded positively forbidding any british subject from receiving assignments upon any part of the territorial revenue on any pretense whatsoever appendix no     you recollect mr speaker that the chancellor of the exchequer strongly professed to retain every part of mr foxs bill which was intended to prevent abuse but in his india bill which let me do justice is as able and skilful a performance for its own purposes as ever issued from the wit of man premeditating this iniquity  hoc ipsum ut strueret trojamque aperiret achivis expunged this essential clause broke down the fence which was raised to cover the public property against the rapacity of his partisans and thus levelling every obstruction he made a firm broad highway for sin and death for usury and oppression to renew their ravages throughout the devoted revenues of the carnatic  the tenor the policy and the consequences of this debt of      are in the eyes of ministry so excellent that its merits are irresistible and it takes the lead to give credit and countenance to all the rest along with this chosen body of heavyarmed infantry and to support it in the line the right honorable gentleman has stationed his corpse of black cavalry if there be any advantage between this debt and that of      according to him the cavalry debt has it it is not a subject of defense it is a theme of panegyric listen to the right honorable gentleman and you will find it was contracted to save the country to prevent mutiny in armies to introduce economy in revenues and for all these honorable purposes it originated at the express desire and by the representative authority of the company itself  first let me say a word to the authority this debt was contracted not by the authority of the company not by its representatives as the right honorable gentleman has the unparalleled confidence to assert but in the evermemorable period of      by the usurped power of those who rebelliously in conjunction with the nabob of arcot had overturned the lawful government of madras for that rebellion this house unanimously directed a public prosecution the delinquents after they had subverted government in order to make to themselves a party to support them in their power are universally known to have dealt jobs about to the right and to the left and to any who were willing to receive them this usurpation which the right honorable gentleman well knows was brought about by and for the great mass of these pretended debts is the authority which is set up by him to represent the company to represent that company which from the first moment of their hearing of this corrupt and fraudulent transaction to this hour have uniformly disowned and disavowed it  so much for the authority as to the facts partly true and partly colorable as they stand recorded they are in substance these  the nabob of arcot as soon as he had thrown off the superiority of this country by means of these creditors kept up a great army which he never paid of course his soldiers were generally in a state of mutiny see mr dundass  st  d and  d reports  the usurping council say that they labored hard with their master the nabob to persuade him to reduce these mutinous and useless troops he consented but as usual pleaded inability to pay them their arrears here was a difficulty the nabob had no money the company had no money every public supply was empty but there was one resource which no season has ever yet dried up in that climate the soucars were at hand that is private english moneyjobbers offered their assistance messieurs tailor majendie and call proposed to advance the small sum of l   0000 to pay off the nabobs black cavalry provided the companys authority was given for their loan this was the great point of policy always aimed at and pursued through a hundred devices by the servants at madras the presidency who themselves had no authority for the functions they presumed to exercise very readily gave the sanction of the company to those servants who knew that the company whose sanction was demanded had positively prohibited all such transactions  however so far as the reality of the dealing goes all is hitherto fair and plausible and here the right honorable gentleman concludes with commendable prudence his account of the business but here it is i shall beg leave to commence my supplement for the gentlemans discreet modesty has led him to cut the thread of the story somewhat abruptly one of the most essential parties is quite forgotten why should the episode of the poor nabob be omitted when that prince chooses it no body can tell his story better excuse me if i apply again to my book and give it you from the first hand from the nabob himself  mr stratton became acquainted with this and got mr tailor and others to lend me four lacks of pagodas toward discharging the arrears of pay of my troops upon this i wrote a letter of thanks to mr stratton and upon the faith of this money being paid immediately i ordered many of my troops to be discharged by a certain day and lessened the number of my servants mr tailor etc some time after acquainted me that they had no ready money but they would grant teeps payable in four months this astonished me for i did not know what might happen when the sepoys were dismissed from my service i begged of mr tailor and the others to pay this sum to the officers of my regiments at the time they mentioned and desired the officers at the same time to pacify and persuade the men belonging to them that their pay would be given to them at the end of four months and that till those arrears were discharged their pay should be continued to them two years are nearly expired since that time but mr tailor has not yet entirely discharged the arrears of those troops and i am obliged to continue their pay from that time till this i hoped to have been able by this expedient to have lessened the number of my troops and discharge the arrears due to them considering the trifle of interest to mr tailor and the others as no great matter but instead of this i am oppressed with the burden of pay due to those troops and the interest which is going on to mr tailor from the day the teeps were granted to him what i have read to you is an extract of a letter from the nabob of the carnatic to governor rumbold dated the   d and received the   th of march      see further consultations  d february        suppose his highness not to be well broken in to things of this kind it must indeed surprise so known and established a bondvender as the nabob of arcot one who keeps himself the largest bond warehouse in the world to find that he was now to receive in kind not to take money for his obligations but to give his bond in exchange for the bond of messieurs tailor majendie and call and to pay besides a good smart interest legally    per cent in reality perhaps twenty or twentyfour per cent for this exchange of paper but his troops were not to be so paid or so disbanded they wanted bread and could not live by cutting and shuffling of bonds the nabob still kept the troops in service and was obliged to continue as you have seen the whole expense to exonerate himself from which he became indebted to the soucars  had it stood here the transaction would have been of the most audacious strain of fraud and usury perhaps ever before discovered whatever might have been practiced and concealed but the same authority i mean the nabobs brings before you something if possible more striking he states that for this their paper he immediately handed over to these gentlemen something very different from paper that is the receipt of a territorial revenue of which it seems they continued as long in possession as the nabob himself continued in possession of any thing their payments therefore not being to commence before the end of four months and not being completed in two years it must be presumed unless they prove the contrary that their payments to the nabob were made out of the revenues they had received from his assignment thus they condescend to accumulate a debt of l   0000 with an interest of    per cent in compensation for a lingering payment to the nabob of l  0000 of his own money  still we have not the whole about two years after the assignment of those territorial revenues to these gentlemen the nabob receives a remonstrance from his chief manager in a principal province of which this is the tenor  the entire revenue of those districts is by your highness order set apart to discharge the tuncaws assignments granted to the europeans the gomastahs agents of mr tailor to mr de fries are there in order to collect these tuncaws and as they receive all the revenue that is collected your highnesss troops have seven or eight months pay due which they cannot receive and are thereby reduced to the greatest distress in such times it is highly necessary to provide for the sustenance of the troops that may be ready to exert themselves in the service of your highness  here sir you see how these causes and effects act upon one another one body of troops mutinies for want of pay a debt is contracted to pay them and they still remain unpaid a territory destined to pay other troops is assigned for this debt and these other troops fall into the same state of indigence and mutiny with the first bond is paid by bond arrear is turned into new arrear usury engenders new usury mutiny suspended in one quarter starts up in another until all the revenues and all the establishments are entangled into one inextricable knot of confusion from which they are only disengaged by being entirely destroyed in that state of confusion in a very few months after the date of the memorial i have just read to you things were found when the nabobs troops famished to feed english soucars instead of defending the country joined the invaders and deserted in entire bodies to hyder ali mr dundass  st report p       and appendix no    0    for the mutinous state and desertion of the nabobs troops for want of pay see also report   of the same committee   the manner in which this transaction was carried on shows that good examples are not easily forgot especially by those who are bred in a great school one of those splendid examples give me leave to mention at a somewhat more early period because one fraud furnishes light to the discovery of another and so on until the whole secret of mysterious iniquity bursts upon you in a blaze of detection the paper i shall read you is not on record if you please you may take it on my word it is a letter written from one of undoubted information in madras to sir john clavering describing the practice that prevailed there whilst the companys allies were under sale during the time of governor winchs administration   one mode says coverings correspondent of amassing money at the nabobs cost is curious he is generally in arrears to the company here the governor being cashkeeper is generally on good terms with the banker who manages matters thus the governor presses the nabob for the balance due from him the nabob flies to his banker for relief the banker engages to pay the money and grants his notes accordingly which he puts in the cashbook as ready money the nabob pays him an interest for it at two and three per cent per mensem till the tunkaws he grants on the particular districts for it are paid matters in the mean time are so managed that there is no call for this money for the companys service till the tuncaws become due by this means not a cash is advanced by the banker though he receives a heavy interest from the nabob which is divided as lawful spoil  here mr speaker you have the whole art and mystery the true freemason secret of the profession of soucaring by which a few innocent inexperienced young englishmen such as mr paul benfield for instance without property upon which any one would lend to themselves a single shilling are enabled at once to take provinces in mortgage to make princes their debtors and to become creditors for millions  but it seems the right honorable gentlemans favorite soucar cavalry have proved the payment before the mayors court at madras have they so why then defraud our anxiety and their characters of that proof is it not enough that the charges which i have laid before you have stood on record against these poor injured gentlemen for eight years is it not enough that they are in print by the orders of the east india company for five years after these gentlemen have borne all the odium of this publication and all the indignation of the directors with such unexampled equanimity now that they are at length stimulated into feeling are you to deny them their just relief but will the right honorable gentleman be pleased to tell us how they came not to give this satisfaction to the court of directors their lawful masters during all the eight years of this litigated claim were they not bound by every tie that can bind man to give them this satisfaction this day for the first time we hear of the proofs but when were these proofs offered in what cause who were the parties who inspected who contested this belated account let us see something to oppose to the body of record which appears against them the mayors court the mayors court pleasant does not the honorable gentleman know that the first corpse of creditors the creditors of      stated it as a sort of hardship to them that they could not have justice at madras from the impossibility of their supporting their claims in the mayors court why because say they the members of that court were themselves creditors and therefore could not sit as judges memorial from the creditors to the governor and council   d january    0  are we ripe to say that no creditor under similar circumstances was member of the court when the payment which is the ground of this cavalry debt was put in proof in the year      mr james call one of the proprietors of this specific debt was actually mayor appendix to  d report of mr dundass committee no     the only proof which appeared on the enquiry instituted in the general court of      was an affidavit of the lenders themselves deposing what no body ever denied that they had engaged and agreed to pay  not that they had paid the sum of l   0000 this was two years after the transaction and the affidavit is made before george proctor mayor an attorney for certain of the old creditors proceedings of the president and council of fort saint george   d february       nay are we not in a manner compelled to conclude that the court was so constituted when we know there is scarcely a man in madras who has not some participation in these transactions it is a shame to hear such proofs mentioned instead of the honest vigorous scrutiny which the circumstances of such an affair so indispensably calls for  but his majestys ministers indulgent enough to other scrutinies have not been satisfied with authorizing the payment of this demand without such enquiry as the act has prescribed but they have added the arrear of twelve per cent interest from the year      to the year      to make a new capital raising thereby   0 to l    000 then they charge a new twelve per cent on the whole from that period for a transaction in which it will be a miracle if a single penny will be ever found really advanced from the private stock of the pretended creditors  in this manner and at such an interest the ministers have thought proper to dispose of l    000 of the public revenues for what is called the cavalry loan after dispatching this the right honorable gentleman leads to battle his last grand division the consolidated debt of      but having exhausted all his panegyric on the two first he has nothing at all to say in favor of the last on the contrary he admits that it was contracted in defiance of the companys orders without even the pretended sanction of any pretended representatives nobody indeed has yet been found hardy enough to stand forth avowedly in its defense but it is little to the credit of the age that what has not plausibility enough to find an advocate has influence enough to obtain a protector could any man expect to find that protector any where but what must every man think when he finds that protector in the chairman of the committee of secrecy right honorable henry dundas  who had published to the house and to the world the facts that condemn these debts  the orders that forbid the incurring of them  the dreadful consequences which attended them even in his official letter when he tramples on his parliamentary report yet his general language is the same read the preface to this part of the ministerial arrangement and you would imagine that this debt was to be crushed with all the weight of indignation which could fall from a vigilant guardian of the public treasury upon those who attempted to rob it what must be felt by every man who has feeling when after such a thundering preamble of condemnation this debt is ordered to be paid without any sort of enquiry into its authenticity without a single step taken to settle even the amount of the demand without an attempt so much as to ascertain the real persons claiming a sum which rises in the accounts from one million three hundred thousand pound sterling to two million four hundred thousand pound principal money appendix to the  th report of mr dundass committee no     without an attempt made to ascertain the proprietors of whom no list has ever yet been laid before the court of directors of proprietors who are known to be in a collusive shuffle by which they never appear to be the same in any two lifts handed about for their own particular purposes  my honorable friend who made you the motion has sufficiently exposed the nature of this debt he has stated to you that its own agents in the year      in the arrangement they proposed to make at calcutta were satisfied to have twentyfive per cent at once struck off from the capital of a great part of this debt and prayed to have a provision made for this reduced principal without any interest at all this was an arrangement of their own an arrangement made by those who best knew the true constitution of their own debt who knew how little favor it merited no sense of the common danger in case of a war can prevail on him the nabob of arcot to furnish the company with what is absolutely necessary to assemble an army though it is beyond a doubt that money to a large amount is now hoarded up in his coffers at chepauk and tunkaws are granted to individuals upon some of his most valuable countries for payment of part of those debts which he has contracted and which certainly will not bear inspection as neither the debtor or creditors have ever had the confidence to submit the accounts to our examination though they expressed a wish to consolidate the debts under the auspices of this government agreeably to a plan they had formed madras consultations  0th july      mr dundass appendix to  d report     see also last appendix to ditto report no     b  and how little hopes they had to find any persons in authority abandoned enough to support it as it stood  but what corrupt men in the fond imaginations of a sanguine avarice had not the confidence to propose they have found a chancellor of the exchequer in england hardy enough to undertake for them he has cheered their drooping spirits he has thanked the peculators for not despairing of their commonwealth he has told them they were too modest he has replaced the twentyfive per cent which in order to lighten themselves they had abandoned in their conscious terror instead of cutting off the interest as they had themselves consented to do with the fourth of the capital he has added the whole growth of four years usury of twelve per cent to the first overgrown principal and has again grafted on this meliorated stock a perpetual annuity of six per cent to take place from the year      let no man hereafter talk of the decaying energies of nature all the acts and monuments in the records of peculation the consolidated corruption of ages the patterns of exemplary plunder in the heroic times of roman iniquity never equalled the gigantic corruption of this single act never did nero in all the insolent prodigality of despotism deal out to his praetorian guards a donation fit to be named with the largess showered down by the bounty of our chancellor of the exchequer on the faithful band of his indian sepoys  the right honorable gentleman mr dundas lets you freely and voluntarily into the whole transaction so perfectly has his conduct confounded his understanding that he fairly tells you that through the course of the whole business he has never conferred with any but the agents of the pretended creditors after this do you want more to establish a secret understanding with the parties to fix beyond a doubt their collusion and participation in a common fraud  if this were not enough he has furnished you with other presumptions that are not to be shaken it is one of the known indications of guilt to stagger and prevaricate in a story and to vary in the motives that are assigned to conduct try these ministers by this rule in their official dispatch they tell the presidency of madras that they have established the debt for two reasons first because the nabob the party indebted does not dispute it secondly because it is mischievous to keep it longer afloat and that the payment of the european creditors will promote circulation in the country these two motives for the plainest reasons in the world the right honorable gentleman has this day thought fit totally to abandon in the first place he rejects the authority of the nabob of arcot it would indeed be pleasant to see him adhere to this exploded testimony he next upon grounds equally solid abandons the benefits of that circulation which was to be produced by drawing out all the juices of the body laying aside or forgetting these pretenses of his dispatch he has just now assumed a principle totally different but to the full as extraordinary he proceeds upon a supposition that many of the claims may be fictitious he then finds that in a case where many valid and many fraudulent claims are blended together the best course for their discrimination is indiscriminately to establish them all he trusts i suppose as there may not be a fund sufficient for every description of creditors that the best warranted claimants will exert themselves in bringing to light those debts which will not bear an enquiry what he will not do himself he is persuaded will be done by others and for this purpose he leaves to any person a general power of excepting to the debt this total change of language and prevarication in principle is enough if it stood alone to fix the presumption of unfair dealing his dispatch assigns motives of policy concord trade and circulation his speech proclaims discord and litigations and proposes as the ultimate end detection  but he may shift his reasons and wind and turn as he will confusion waits him at all his doubles who will undertake this detection will the nabob but the right honorable gentleman has himself this moment told us that no prince of the country can by any motive be prevailed upon to discover any fraud that is practiced upon him by the companys servants he says what with the exception of the complaint against the cavalry loan all the world knows to be true and without that princes concurrence what evidence can be had of the fraud of any the smallest of these demands the ministers never authorized any person to enter into his exchequer and to search his records why then this shameful and insulting mockery of a pretended contest already contests for a preference have arisen among these rival bond creditors has not the company itself struggled for a preference for years without any attempt at detection of the nature of those debts with which they contended well is the nabob of arcot attended to in the only specific complaint he has ever made he complained of unfair dealing in the cavalry loan it is fixed upon him with interest on interest and this loan is excepted from all power of litigation  this day and not before the right honorable gentleman thinks that the general establishment of all claims is the surest way of laying open the fraud of some of them in india this is a reach of deep policy but what would be thought of this mode of acting on a demand upon the treasury in england instead of all this cunning is there not one plain way open that is to put the burden of the proof on those who make the demand ought not ministry to have said to the creditors the person who admits your debt stands excepted to as evidence he stands charged as a collusive party to hand over the public revenues to you for sinister purposes you say you have a demand of some millions on the indian treasury prove that you have acted by lawful authority prove at least that your money has been bona fide advanced entitle yourself to my protection by the fairness and fullness of the communications you make did an honest creditor ever refuse that reasonable and honest test  there is little doubt that several individuals have been seduced by the purveyors to the nabob of arcot to put their money perhaps the whole of honest and laborious earnings into their hands and that at such high interest as being condemned at law leaves them at the mercy of the great managers whom they trusted these seduced creditors are probably persons of no power or interest either in england or india and may be just objects of compassion by taking in this arrangement no measures for discrimination and discovery the fraudulent and the fair are in the first instance confounded in one mass the subsequent selection and distribution is left to the nabob with him the agents and instruments of his corruption whom he sees to be omnipotent in england and who may serve him in future as they have done in times past will have precedence if not an exclusive preference these leading interests domineer and have always domineered over the whole by this arrangement the persons seduced are made dependent on their seducers honesty comparative honesty at least must become of the party of fraud and must quit its proper character and its just claims to entitle itself to the alms of bribery and peculation  but be these english creditors what they may the creditors most certainly not fraudulent are the natives who are numerous and wretched indeed by exhausting the whole revenues of the carnatic nothing is left for them they lent bonaa fide in all probability they were even forced to lend or to give goods and service for the nabobs obligations they had no trusts to carry to his market they had no faith of alliances to sell they had no nations to betray to robbery and ruin they had no lawful government seditiously to overturn nor had they a governor to whom it is owing that you exist in india to deliver over to captivity and to death in a shameful prison lord pigot   these were the merits of the principal part of the debt of      and the universally conceived causes of its growth and thus the unhappy natives are deprived of every hope of payment for their real debts to make provision for the arrears of unsatisfied bribery and treason you see in this instance that the presumption of guilt is not only no exception to the demands on the public treasury but with these ministers it is a necessary condition to their support but that you may not think this preference solely owing to their known contempt of the natives who ought with every generous mind to claim their first charities you will find the same rule religiously observed with europeans too attend sir to this decisive case  since the beginning of the war besides arrears of every kind a bond debt has been contracted at madras uncertain in its amount but represented from four hundred thousand pound to a million sterling it stands only at the low interest of eight per cent of the legal authority on which this debt was contracted of its purposes for the very being of the state of its publicity and fairness no doubt has been entertained for a moment for this debt no sort of provision whatever has been made it is rejected as an outcast whilst the whole undissipated attention of the minister has been employed for the discharge of claims entitled to his favor by the merits we have seen  i have endeavored to find out if possible the amount of the whole of those demands in order to see how much supposing the country in a condition to furnish the fund may remain to satisfy the public debt and the necessary establishments but i have been foiled in my attempt about onefourth that is about l   0000 of the loan of      remains unpaid how much interest is in arrear i could never discover seven or eight years at least which would make the whole of that debt about l    000 this stock which the ministers in their instructions to the governor of madras state as the least exceptionable they have thought proper to distinguish by a marked severity leaving it the only one on which the interest is not added to the principal to beget a new interest  the cavalry loan by the operation of the same authority is made up to l   000 and this l    000 made up of principal and interest is crowned with a new interest of twelve per cent  what the grand loan the bribery loan of      may be is amongst the deepest mysteries of state it is probably the first debt ever assuming the title of consolidation that did not express what the amount of the sum consolidated was it is little less than a contradiction in terms in the debt of the year      the sum was stated in the act of consolidation and made to amount to l   0000 capital when this consolidation of      was first announced at the durbar it was represented authentically at l   00000 in that or rather in an higher state sir thomas rumbold found and condemned it in sir thomas rumbolds letter to the court of directors march   th     he represents it as higher in the following manner  how shall i paint to you my astonishment on my arrival here when i was informed that independent of this four lacks of pagodas the cavalry loan independent of the nabobs debt to his old creditors and the money due to the company he had contracted a debt to the enormous amount of sixtythree lacks of pagodas l    0000  i mention this circumstance to you with horror for the creditors being in general servants of the company renders my task on the part of the company difficult and invidious  i have freed the sanction of this government from so corrupt a transaction it is in my mind the most venal of all proceedings to give the companys protection to debts that cannot bear the light and though it appears exceedingly alarming that a country on which you are to depend for resources should be so involved as to be nearly three years revenue in debt in a country too where one years revenue can never be called secure by men who know any thing of the politics of this part of india  i think it proper to mention to you that although the nabob reports his private debt to amount to upwards of sixty lacks yet i understand that it is not quite so much  afterward sir thomas rumbold recommended this debt to the favorable attention of the company but without any sufficient reason for his change of disposition however he went no further  it afterward fell into such a terror as to sweat away a million of its weight at once and it sunk to l   00000 nabobs proposals november   th      and memorial of the creditors march  st       however it never was without a resource for recruiting it to its old plumpness there was a sort of floating debt of about   or l  00000 more ready to be added as occasion should require  in short when you pressed this sensitive plant it always contracted its dimensions when the rude hand of enquiry was withdrawn it expanded in all the luxuriant vigor of its original vegetation in the treaty of      the whole of the nabobs debt to private europeans is by mr sullivan agent to the nabob and the creditors stated at l   00000 which if the cavalry loan and the remains of the debt of      be subtracted leaves it nearly at the amount originally declared at the durbar in      but then there is a private instruction to mr sullivan which it seems will reduce it again to the lower standard of l   00000 failing in all my attempts by a direct account to ascertain the extent of the capital claimed where in all probability no capital was ever advanced i endeavored if possible to discover it by the interest which was to be paid for that purpose i looked to the several agreements for assigning the territories of the carnatic to secure the principal and interest of this debt in one of them nabobs proposals to his new consolidated creditors november   th      i found in a sort of postscript by way of an additional remark not in the body of the obligation the debt represented at l   00000 but when i computed the sums to be paid for interest by instalments in another paper i found they produced the interest of two millions at twelve per cent and the assignment supposed that if these instalments might exceed they might also fall short of the real provision for that interest paper signed by the nabob  th january    0   another instalment bond was afterward granted in that bond the interest exactly tallies with a capital of l   00000 kistbundi to july       0  but pursuing this capital through the correspondence i lost sight of it again and it was asserted that this instalment bond was considerably short of the interest that ought to be computed to the time mentioned governors letter to the nabob   th       here are therefore two statements of equal authority differing at least a million from each other and as neither persons claiming nor any special sum as belonging to each particular claimant is ascertained in the instruments of consolidation or in the instalment bonds a large scope was left to throw in any sums for any persons as their merits in advancing the interest of that loan might require a power was also left for reduction in case a harder hand or more scanty funds might be found to require it stronger grounds for a presumption of fraud never appeared in any transaction but the ministers faithful to the plan of the interested persons whom alone they thought fit to confer with on this occasion have ordered the payment of the whole mass of these unknown unliquidated sums without an attempt to ascertain them on this conduct sir i leave you to make your own reflections  it is impossible at least i have found it impossible to fix on the real amount of the pretended debts with which your ministers have thought proper to load the carnatic they are obscure they shun enquiry they are enormous that is all you know of them  that you may judge what chance any honorable and useful end of government has for a provision that comes in for the leavings of these gluttonous demands i must take it on myself to bring before you the real condition of that abused insulted racked and ruined country though in truth my mind revolts from it though you will hear it with horror and i confess i tremble when i think on these awful and confounding dispensations of providence i shall first trouble you with a few words as to the cause  the great fortunes made in india in the beginnings of conquest naturally excited an emulation in all the parts and through the whole succession of the companys service but in the company it gave rise to other sentiments they did not find the new channels of acquisition flow with equal riches to them on the contrary the high floodtide of private emolument was generally in the lowest ebb of their affairs they began also to fear that the fortune of war might take away what the fortune of war had given wars were accordingly discouraged by repeated injunctions and menaces and that the servants might not be bribed into them by the native princes they were strictly forbidden to take any money whatsoever from their hands but vehement passion is ingenious in resources the companys servants were not only stimulated but better instructed by the prohibition they soon fell upon a contrivance which answered their purposes far better than the methods which were forbidden though in this also they violated an ancient but they thought an abrogated order they reversed their proceedings instead of receiving presents they made loans instead of carrying on wars in their own name they contrived an authority at once irresistible and irresponsible in whose name they might ravage at pleasure and being thus freed from all restraint they indulged themselves in the most extravagant speculations of plunder the cabal of creditors who have been the object of the late bountiful grant from his majestys ministers in order to possess themselves under the name of creditors and assignees of every country in india as fast as it should be conquered inspired into the mind of the nabob of arcot then a dependant on the company of the humblest order a scheme of the most wild and desperate ambition that i believe ever was admitted into the thoughts of a man so situated report of the select committee madras consultations january        see also papers published by the order of the court of directors in      and lord macartneys correspondence with mr hastings and the nabob of arcot see also mr dundass appendix no     b nabobs propositions through mr sulivan and assam khan art   and indeed the whole  first they persuaded him to consider himself as a principal member in the political system of europe in the next place they held out to him and he readily imbibed the idea of the general empire of indostan as a preliminary to this undertaking they prevailed on him to propose a tripartite division of that vast country one part to the company another to the marattas and the third to himself to himself he reserved all the southern part of the great peninsula comprehended under the general name of the decan  on this scheme of their servants the company was to appear in the carnatic in no other light than as a contractor for the provision of armies and the hire of mercenaries for his use and under his direction this disposition was to be secured by the nabobs putting himself under the guarantee of france and by the means of that rival nation preventing the english for ever from assuming an equality much less a superiority in the carnatic in pursuance of this treasonable project treasonable on the part of the english they extinguished the company as a sovereign power in that part of india they withdrew the companys garrisons out of all the forts and strong holds of the carnatic they declined to receive the ambassadors from foreign courts and remitted them to the nabob of arcot they fell upon and totally destroyed the oldest ally of the company the king of tanjore and plundered the country to the amount of near five millions sterling one after another in the nabobs name but with english force they brought into a miserable servitude all the princes and great independent nobility of a vast country the principal object of the expedition is to get money from tanjore to pay the nabobs debt if a surlpus to be applied in discharge of the nabobs debts to his private creditors consultations march  0      and for further lights consultations   th june      we are alarmed lest this debt to individuals should have been the real motive for the aggrandizement of mahomed ali the nabob of arcot and that we are plunged into a war to put him into possession of the mysore revenues for the discharge of the debt letter from the directors march          in proportion to these treasons and violences which ruined the people the fund of the nabobs debt grew and flourished  among the victims to this magnificent plan of universal plunder worthy of the heroic avarice of the projectors you have all heard and he has made himself to be well remembered of an indian chief called hyder ali khan this man possessed the western as the company under the name of the nabob of arcot does the eastern division of the carnatic it was among the leading measures in the design of this cabal according to their own emphatic language to extirpate this hyder ali letter from the nabob may  st      and ditto   th april    0  st october ditto   th september        th march       they declared the nabob of arcot to be his sovereign and himself to be a rebel and publicly invested their instrument with the sovereignty of the kingdom of mysore but their victim was not of the passive kind they were soon obliged to conclude a treaty of peace and close alliance with this rebel at the gates of madras both before and since that treaty every principle of policy pointed out this power as a natural alliance and on his part it was courted by every sort of amicable office but the cabinet council of english creditors would not suffer their nabob of arcot to sign the treaty nor even to give to a prince at least his equal the ordinary titles of respect and courtesy letter from the presidency at madras to the court of directors   th june       from that time forward a continued plot was carried on within the divan black and white of the nabob of arcot for the destruction of hyder ali as to the outward members of the double or rather treble government of madras which had signed the treaty they were always prevented by some overruling influence which they do not describe but which cannot be misunderstood from performing what justice and interest combined so evidently to enforce mr dundass committee report i appendix no      when at length hyder ali found that he had to do with men who either would sign no convention or whom no treaty and no signature could bind and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself he decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestined criminals a memorable example to mankind he resolved in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things to leave the whole carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection he became at length so confident of his force so collected in his might that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of the nabob of arcot he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction and compounding all the materials of fury havoc and desolation into one black cloud he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the carnatic  then ensued a scene of woe the like of which no eye had seen no heart conceived and which no tongue can adequately tell all the horrors of war before known or heard of were mercy to that new havoc a storm of universal fire blasted every field consumed every house destroyed every temple the miserable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages in part were slaughtered others without regard to sex to age to the respect of rank or sacredness of function fathers torn from children husbands from wives enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry and amidst the goading spears of drivers and the trampling of pursuing horses were swept into captivity in an unknown and hostile land those who were able to evade this tempest fled to the walled cities but escaping from fire sword and exile they fell into the jaws of famine  the alms of the settlement in this dreadful exigency were certainly liberal and all was done by charity that private charity could do but it was a people in beggary it was a nation which stretched out its hands for food for months together these creatures of sufferance whose very excess and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of our austerest fasts silent patient resigned without sedition or disturbance almost without complaint perished by an hundred a day in the streets of madras every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the streets or on the glacis of tanjore and expired of famine in the granary of india i was going to awake your justice toward this unhappy part of our fellow citizens by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this plague of hunger of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of man this comes the nearest to our heart and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is but i find myself unable to manage it with decorum these details are of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the hearers they are so humiliating to human nature itself that on better thoughts i find it more advisable to throw a pall over this hideous object and to leave it to your general conceptions  appendix no   report of the committee of assigned revenue for eighteen months without intermission this destruction raged from the gates of madras to the gates of tanjore and so completely did these masters in their art hyder ali and his more ferocious son absolve themselves of their impious vow that when the british armies traversed as they did the carnatic for hundreds of miles in all directions through the whole line of their march they did not see one man not one woman not one child not one fourfooted beast of any description whatever one dead uniform silence reigned over the whole region with the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few forts i wish to be understood as speaking literally i mean to produce to you more than three witnesses above all exception who will support this assertion in its full extent that hurricane of war passed through every part of the central provinces of the carnatic six or seven districts to the north and to the south and these not wholly untouched escaped the general ravage  the carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to england figure to yourself mr speaker the land in whose representative chair you sit figure to yourself the form and fashion of your sweet and cheerful country from thames to trent north and south and from the irish to the german sea east and west emptied and embowelled may god avert the omen of our crimes by so accomplished a desolation extend your imagination a little further and then suppose your ministers taking a survey of this scene of waste and desolation what would be your thoughts if you should be informed that they were computing how much had been the amount of the excises how much the customs how much the land and malt tax in order that they should charge take it in the most favorable light for public service upon the relics of the satiated vengeance of relentless enemies the whole of what england had yielded in the most exuberant seasons of peace and abundance what would you call it to call it tyranny sublimed into madness would be too faint an image yet this very madness is the principle upon which the ministers at your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues of the carnatic when they were providing not supply for the establishments of its protection but rewards for the authors of its ruin  every day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant the carnatic is a country that will soon recover and become instantly as prosperous as ever they think they are talking to innocents who will believe that by sowing of dragons teeth men may come up ready grown and ready armed they who will give themselves the trouble of considering for it requires no great reach of thought no very profound knowledge the manner in which mankind are increased and countries cultivated will regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded in order that the people after a long period of vexation and plunder may be in a condition to maintain government government must begin by maintaining them here the road to economy lies not through receipt but through expense and in that country nature has given no short cut to your object men must propagate like other animals by the mouth never did oppression light the nuptial torch never did extortion and usury spread out the genial bed does any of you think that england so wasted would under such a nursing attendance so rapidly and cheaply recover but he is meanly acquainted with either england or india who does not know that england would a thousand times sooner resume population fertility and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from both revenue than such a country as the carnatic  the carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile soil the general size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise it is some days since i moved that a curious and interesting map kept in the india house should be laid before you mr barnards map of the jaghire  the india house is not yet in readiness to send it i have therefore brought down my own copy and there it lies for the use of any gentleman who may think such a matter worthy of his attention it is indeed a noble map and of noble things but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine speculations of avarice run mad in addition to what you know must be the case in every part of the world the necessity of a previous provision of habitation seed stock capital that map will show you that the use of the influences of heaven itself are in that country a work of art the carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or running streams and it has rain only at a season but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command this is the national bank of the carnatic on which it must have a perpetual credit or it perishes irretrievably for that reason in the happier times of india a number almost incredible of reservoirs have been made in chosen places throughout the whole country they are formed for the greater part of mounds of earth and stones with sluices of solid masonry the whole constructed with admirable skill and labor and maintained at a mighty charge in the territory contained in that map alone i have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit from these reservoirs currents are occasionally drawn over the fields and these watercourses again call for a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly levelled taking the district in that map as a measure there cannot be in the carnatic and tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs of the larger and middling dimensions to say nothing of those for domestic services and the use of religious purification these are not the enterprises of your power nor in a style of magnificence suited to the taste of your minister these are the monuments of real kings who were the fathers of their people testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own these are the grand sepulchers built by ambition but by the ambition of an unsatiable benevolence which not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life had strained with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations the guardians the protectors the nourishers of mankind  long before the late invasion the persons who are objects of the grant of public money now before you had so diverted the supply of the pious funds of culture and population that everywhere the reservoirs were fallen into a miserable decay see report iv mr dundass committee p     but after those domestic enemies had provoked the entry of a cruel foreign foe into the country he did not leave it until his revenge had completed the destruction begun by their avarice few very few indeed of these magazines of water that are not either totally destroyed or cut through with such gaps as to require a serious attention and much cost to reestablish them as the means of present subsistence to the people and of future revenue to the state  what sir would a virtuous and enlightened ministry do on the view of the ruins of such works before them on the view of such a chasm of desolation as that which yawned in the midst of those countries to the north and south which still bore some vestiges of cultivation they would have reduced all their most necessary establishments they would have suspended the justest payments they would have employed every shilling derived from the producing to reanimate the powers of the unproductive parts while they were performing this fundamental duty whilst they were celebrating these mysteries of justice and humanity they would have told the corpse of fictitious creditors whose crimes were their claims that they must keep an awful distance that they must silence their inauspicious tongues that they must hold off their profane unhallowed paws from this holy work they would have proclaimed with a voice that should make itself heard that on every country the first creditor is the plow that this original indefeasible claim supersedes every other demand  this is what a wise and virtuous ministry would have done and said this therefore is what our minister could never think of saying or doing a ministry of another kind would have first improved the country and have thus laid a solid foundation for future opulence and future force but on this grand point of the restoration of the country there is not one syllable to be found in the correspondence of our ministers from the first to the last they felt nothing for a land desolated by fire sword and famine their sympathies took another direction they were touched with pity for bribery so long tormented with a fruitless itching of its palms their bowels yearned for usury that had long missed the harvest of its returning months interest is rated in india by the mouth  they felt for peculation which had been for so many years raking in the dust of an empty treasury they were melted into compassion for rapine and oppression licking their dry parched unbloody jaws these were the objects of their solicitude these were the necessities for which they were studious to provide  to state the country and its revenues in their real condition and to provide for those fictitious claims consistently with the support of an army and a civil establishment would have been impossible therefore the ministers are silent on that head and rest themselves on the authority of lord macartney who in a letter to the court of directors written in the year      speculating on what might be the result of a wise management of the countries assigned by the nabob of arcot rates the revenues as in time of peace at twelve hundred thousand pound a year as he does those of the king of tanjore which had not been assigned at four hundred and fifty on this lord macartney grounds his calculations and on this they choose to ground theirs it was on this calculation that the ministry in direct opposition to the remonstrances of the court of directors have compelled that miserable enslaved body to put their hands to an order for appropriating the enormous sum of l   0000 annually as a fund for paying to their rebellious servants a debt contracted in defiance of their clearest and most positive injunctions  the authority and information of lord macartney is held high on this occasion though it is totally rejected in every other particular of this business i believe i have the honor of being almost as old an acquaintance as any lord macartney has a constant and unbroken friendship has subsisted between us from a very early period and i trust he thinks that as i respect his character and in general admire his conduct i am one of those who feel no common interest in his reputation yet i do not hesitate wholly to disallow the calculation of      without any apprehension that i shall appear to distrust his veracity or his judgment this peace estimate of revenue was not grounded on the state of the carnatic as it then or as it had recently stood it was a statement of former and better times there is no doubt that a period did exist when the large portion of the carnatic held by the nabob of arcot might be fairly reputed to produce a revenue to that or to a greater amount but the whole had so melted away by the slow and silent hostility of oppression and mismanagement that the revenues sinking with the prosperity of the country had fallen to about l  00000 a year even before an enemys horse had imprinted his hoof on the soil of the carnatic from that view and independently of the decisive effects of the war which ensued sir air coote conceived that years must pass before the country could be restored to its former prosperity and production it was that state of revenue namely the actual state before the war which the directors have opposed to lord macartneys speculation they refuse to take the revenues for more than l  00000 in this they are justified by lord macartney himself who in a subsequent letter informs the court that his sketch is a matter of speculation it supposes the country restored to its ancient prosperity and the revenue to be in a course of effective and honest collection if therefore the ministers have gone wrong they were not deceived by lord macartney they were deceived by no man the estimate of the directors is nearly the very estimate furnished by the right honorable gentleman himself and published to the world in one of the printed reports of his own committee mr dundass committee rep i p   and ditto rep iv    where the revenue of      stated only at    lacks   0 lacks stated as the revenue supposing the carnatic to be properly managed  but as soon as he obtained his power he chose to abandon his account no part of his official conduct can be defended on the ground of his parliamentary information  in this clashing of accounts and estimates ought not the ministry if they wished to preserve even appearances to have waited for information of the actual result of these speculations before they laid a charge and such a charge not conditionally and eventually but positively and authoritatively upon a country which they all knew and which one of them had registered on the records of this house to be wasted beyond all example by every oppression of an abusive government and every ravage of a desolating war but that you may discern in what manner they use the correspondence of office and that thereby you may enter into the true spirit of the ministerial board of control i desire you mr speaker to remark that through their whole controversy with the court of directors they do not so much as hint at their ever having seen any other paper from lord macartney or any other estimate of revenue than this of      to this they hold here they take post here they entrench themselves  when i first read this curious controversy between the ministerial board and the court of directors common candor obliged me to attribute their tenacious adherence to the estimate of      to a total ignorance of what had appeared upon the records but the right honorable gentleman has chosen to come forward with an uncalledfor declaration he boastingly tells you that he has seen read digested compared every thing and that if he has sinned he has sinned with his eyes broad open since then the ministers will obstinately shut the gates of mercy on themselves let them add to their crimes what aggravations they please they have then since it must be so wilfully and corruptly suppressed the information which they ought to have produced and for the support of peculation have made themselves guilty of spoliation and suppression of evidence see appendix no   statement in the report of the committee of assigned revenue  the paper i hold in my hand which totally overturns for the present at least the estimate of      they have no more taken notice of in their controversy with the court of directors than if it had no existence it is the report made by a committee appointed at madras to manage the whole of the six countries assigned to the company by the nabob of arcot this committee was wisely instituted by lord macartney to remove from himself the suspicion of all improper management in so invidious a trust and it seems to have been well chosen this committee has made a comparative estimate of the only six districts which were in a condition to be let to farm in one set of columns they state the gross and net produce of the districts as let by the nabob to that statement they oppose the terms on which the same districts were rented for five years under their authority under the nabob the gross farm was so high as l   0000 sterling what was the clear produce why no more than about l   0000 and this was the whole profit to the nabobs treasury under his own management of all the districts which were in a condition to be let to farm on the   th of may      lord macartneys leases stipulated a gross produce of no more than about l   0000 but then the estimated net amount was nearly double the nabobs it however did not then exceed l   0000 and lord macartneys commissioners take credit for an annual revenue amounting to this clear sum here is no speculation here is no inaccurate account clandestinely obtained from those who might wish and were enabled to deceive it is the authorized recorded state of a real recent transaction here is not twelve hundred thousand pound not eight hundred the whole revenue of the carnatic yielded no more in may      than four hundred and eighty thousand pounds nearly the very precise sum which your minister who is so careful of the public security has carried from all descriptions of establishment to form a fund for the private emolument of his creatures  in this estimate we see as i have just observed the nabobs farms rated so high as l   0000 hitherto all is well but follow on to the effective net revenue there the illusion vanishes and you will not find nearly so much as half the produce it is with reason therefore lord macartney invariably throughout the whole correspondence qualifies all his views and expectations of revenue and all his plans for its application with this indispensable condition that the management is not in the hands of the nabob of arcot should that fatal measure take place he has over and over again told you that he has no prospect of realizing any thing whatsoever for any public purpose with these weighty declarations confirmed by such a state of indisputable fact before them what has been done by the chancellor of the exchequer and his accomplices shall i be believed they have delivered over those very territories on the keeping of which in the hands of the committee the defense of our dominions and what was more dear to them possibly their own job depended they have delivered back again without condition without arrangement without stipulation of any sort for the natives of any rank the whole of those vast countries to many of which he had no just claim into the ruinous mismanagement of the nabob of arcot to crown all according to their miserable practice whenever they do any thing transcendently absurd they preface this their abdication of their trust by a solemn declaration that they were not obliged to it by any principle of policy or any demand of justice whatsoever  i have stated to you the estimated produce of the territories of the carnatic in a condition to be farmed in      according to the different managements into which they might fall and this estimate the ministers have thought proper to suppress since that two other accounts have been received the first informs us that there has been a recovery of what is called arrear as well as of an improvement of the revenue of one of the six provinces which were let in      the province of tinnevelly  it was brought about by making a new war after some sharp actions by the resolution and skill of colonel fullarton several of the petty princes of the most southerly of the unwasted provinces were compelled to pay very heavy rents and tributes who for a long time before had not paid any acknowledgment after this reduction by the care of mr irwin one of the committee that province was divided into twelve farms this operation raised the income of that particular province the others remain as they were first farmed so that instead of producing only their original rent of l   0000 they netted in about two years and a quarter l    0000 sterling which would be about l   0000 a year if the recovered arrear was not included what deduction is to be made on account of that arrear i cannot determine but certainly what would reduce the annual income considerably below the rate i have allowed  the second account received is the letting of the wasted provinces of the carnatic this i understand is at a growing rent which may or may not realise what it promises but if it should answer it will raise the whole at some future time to l   00000  you must here remark mr speaker that this revenue is the produce of all the nabobs dominions during the assignment the nabob paid nothing because the company had all supposing the whole of the lately assigned territory to yield up to the most sanguine expectations of the right honorable gentleman and suppose l   00000 to be annually realized of which we actually know of no more than the realizing of six hundred thousand out of this you must deduct the subsidy and rent which the nabob paid before the assignment namely l   0000 a year this reduces back the revenue applicable to the new distribution made by his majestys ministers to about l  00000 of that sum fiveeighths are by them surrendered to the debts the remaining three are the only fund left for all the purposes so magnificently displayed in the letter of the board of control that is for a newcast peace establishment a new fund for ordnance and fortifications and a large allowance for what they call the splendor of the durbar  you have heard the account of these territories as they stood in      you have seen the actual receipt since the assignment in      of which i reckon about two years and a quarter productive i have stated to you the expectation from the wasted part for realizing all this you may value yourselves on the vigor and diligence of a governor and committee that have done so much if these hopes from the committee are rational  remember that the committee is no more your ministers who have formed their fund for these debts on the presumed effect of the committees management have put a complete end to that committee their acts are rescinded their leases are broken their renters are dispersed your ministers knew when they signed the deathwarrant of the carnatic that the nabob would not only turn all these unfortunate farmers of revenue out of employment but that he has denounced his severest vengeance against them for acting under british authority with a knowledge of this disposition a british chancellor of the exchequer and treasurer of the navy incited by no public advantage impelled by no public necessity in a strain of the most wanton perfidy which has ever stained the annals of mankind have delivered over to plunder imprisonment exile and death itself according to the mercy of such execrable tyrants as amir al omra and paul benfield the unhappy and deluded souls who untaught by uniform example were still weak enough to put their trust in english faith appendix no   and for the peculiar hardship of one of the cases no  they have gone farther they have thought proper to mock and outrage their misery by ordering them protection and compensation from what power is this protection to be derived and from what fund is this compensation to arise the revenues are delivered over to their oppressor the territorial jurisdiction from whence that revenue is to arise and under which they live is surrendered to the same iron hands and that they shall be deprived of all refuge and all hope the minister has made a solemn voluntary declaration that he never will interfere with the nabobs internal government see extract of their letter in the appendix no   a   the last thing considered by the board of control among the debts of the carnatic was that arising to the east india company which after the provision for the cavalry and the consolidation of      was to divide the residue of the fund of l   0000 a year with the lenders of      this debt the worthy chairman who sits opposite to me contends to be three millions sterling lord macartneys account of      states it to be at that period l   00000 the first account of the court of directors makes it l  00000 this like the private debt being without any solid existence is incapable of any distinct limits whatever its amount or its validity may be one thing is clear it is of the nature and quality of a public debt in that light nothing is provided for it but an eventual surplus to be divided with one class of the private demands after satisfying the two first classes never was a more shameful postponing a public demand which by the reason of the thing and the uniform practice of all nations supersedes every private claim  those who gave this preference to private claims consider the companys as a lawful demand else why did they pretend to provide for it on their own principles they are condemned  but i sir who profess to speak to your understanding and to your conscience and to brush away from this business all false colors all false appellations as well as false facts do positively deny that the carnatic owes a shilling to the company whatever the company may be indebted to that undone country it owes nothing to the company for this plain and simple reason  the territory charged with the debt is their own to say that their revenues fall short and owe them money is to say they are in debt to themselves which is only talking nonsense the fact is that by the invasion of an enemy and the ruin of the country the company either in its own name or in the names of the nabob of arcot and rajah of tanjore has lost for several years what it might have looked to receive from its own estate if men were allowed to credit themselves upon such principles any one might soon grow rich by this mode of accounting a flood comes down upon a mans estate in the bedford level of a thousand pounds a year and drowns his rents for ten years the chancellor would put that man into the hands of a trustee who would gravely make up his books and for this loss credit himself in his account for a debt due to him of l  0000 it is however on this principle the company makes up its demands on the carnatic in peace they go the full length and indeed more than the full length of what the people can bear for current establishments then they are absurd enough to consolidate all the calamities of war into debts to metamorphose the devastations of the country into demands upon its future production what is this but to avow a resolution utterly to destroy their own country and to force the people to pay for their sufferings to a government which has proved unable to protect either the share of the hushandman or their own in every lease of a farm the invasion of an enemy instead of forming a demand for arrear is a release of rent nor for that release is it at all necessary to show that the invasion has left nothing to the occupier of the soil though in the present case it would be too easy to prove that melancholy fact it is certain that the incursion of a few of hyders horse into the jaghire in      cost the company upwards of pagodas   000 in allowances for damages consultations february   th       i therefore applauded my right honorable friend who when he canvassed the companys accounts as a preliminary to a bill that ought not to stand on falsehood of any kind fixed his discerning eye and his deciding hand on these debts of the company from the nabob of arcot and rajah of tanjore and at one stroke expunged them all as utterly irrecoverable he might have added as utterly unfounded  on these grounds i do not blame the arrangement this day in question as a preference given to the debt of individuals over the companys debt in my eye it is no more than the preference of a fiction over a chimera but i blame the preference given to those fictitious private debts over the standing defense and the standing government it is there the public is robbed it is robbed in its army it is robbed in its civil administration it is robbed in its credit it is robbed in its investment which forms the commercial connection between that country and europe there is the robbery  but my principal objection lies a good deal deeper that debt to the company is the pretext under which all the other debts lurk and cover themselves that debt forms the foul putrid mucus in which are engendered the whole brood of creeping ascarides all the endless involutions the eternal knot added to a knot of those inexpugnable tapeworms which devour the nutriment and eat up the bowels of india proceedings at madras   th february      and throughout the correspondence on this subject particularly consultations october  th      and the creditors memorial  0th january    0  it is necessary sir you should recollect two things first that the nabobs debt to the company carries no interest in the next place you will observe that whenever the company has occasion to borrow she has always commanded whatever she thought fit at eight per cent carrying in your mind these two facts attend to the process with regard to the public and the private debt and with what little appearance of decency they play into each others hands a game of utter perdition to the unhappy natives of india the nabob falls into an arrear to the company the presidency presses for payment the nabobs answer is i have no money good but there are soucars who will supply you on the mortgage of your territories then steps forward some paul benfield and from his grateful compassion to the nabob and his filial regard to the company he unlocks the treasures of his virtuous industry and for a consideration of twentyfour or thirtysix per cent on a mortgage of the territorial revenue becomes security to the company for the nabobs arrear  all this intermediate usury thus becomes sanctified by the ultimate view to the companys payment in this case would not a plain man ask this plain question of the company if you know that the nabob must annually mortgage his territories to your servants to pay his annual arrear to you why is not the assignment or mortgage made directly to the company itself by this simple obvious operation the company would be relieved and the debt paid without the charge of a shilling interest to that prince but if that course should be thought too indulgent why do they not take that assignment with such interest to themselves as they pay to others that is eight per cent or if it were thought more advisable why it should i know not that he must borrow why do not the company lend their own credit to the nabob for their own payment that credit would not be weakened by the collateral security of his territorial mortgage the money might still be had at eight per cent instead of any of these honest and obvious methods the company has for years kept up a show of disinterestedness and moderation by suffering a debt to accumulate to them from the country powers without any interest at all and at the same time have seen before their eyes on a pretext of borrowing to pay that debt the revenues of the country charged with an usury of twenty twentyfour thirtysix and even eightandforty per cent with compound interest appendix e  for the benefit of their servants all this time they know that by having a debt subsisting without any interest which is to be paid by contracting a debt on the highest interest they manifestly render it necessary to the nabob of arcot to give the private demand a preference to the public and by binding him and their servants together in a common cause they enable him to form a party to the utter ruin of their own authority and their own affairs thus their false moderation and their affected purity by the natural operation of every thing false and every thing affected becomes pander and bawd to the unbridled debauchery and licentious lewdness of usury and extortion  in consequence of this double game all the territorial revenues have at one time or other been covered by those locusts the english soucars not one single foot of the carnatic has escaped them a territory as large as england during these operations what a scene has that country presented for some part of these usurious transactions see consultation   th january      and for the nabobs excusing his oppressions on account of these debts consultation   th november    0 still i undertook first the payment of the money belonging to the company who are my kind friends and by borrowing and mortgaging my jewels etc by taking from every one of my servants in proportion to their circumstances by fresh severities also on my country notwithstanding its distressed state as you know  the boards remark is as follows after controverting some of the facts they say that his countries are oppressed is most certain but not from real necessity his debts indeed have afforded him a constant pretense for using severities and cruel oppressions  the usurious european assignee supersedes the nabobs native farmer of the revenue the farmer flies to the nabobs presence to claim his bargain whilst his servants murmur for wages and his soldiers mutiny for pay the mortgage to the european assignee is then resumed and the native farmer replaced replaced again to be removed on the new clamor of the european assignee see consultation   th january      where it is asserted and not denied that the nabobs farmers of revenue seldom continue for three months together from this the state of the country may be easily judged of  every man of rank and landed fortune being long since extinguished the remaining miserable last cultivator who grows to the soil after having his back scored by the farmer has it again flayed by the whip of the assignee and is thus by a ravenous because a shortlived succession of claimants lashed from oppressor to oppressor whilst a single drop of blood is left as the means of extorting a single grain of corn do not think i paint far very far from it i do not reach the fact nor approach to it men of respectable condition men equal to your substantial english yeomen are daily tied up and scourged to answer the multiplied demands of various contending and contradictory titles all issuing from one and the same source tyrannous exaction brings on servile concealment and that again calls forth tyrannous coercion they move in a circle mutually producing and produced till at length nothing of humanity is left in the government no trace of integrity spirit or manliness in the people who drag out a precarious and degraded existence under this system of outrage upon human nature such is the effect of the establishment of a debt to the company as it has hitherto been managed and as it ever will remain until ideas are adopted totally different from those which prevail at this time  your worthy ministers supporting what they are obliged to condemn have thought fit to renew the companys old order against contracting private debts in future they begin by rewarding the violation of the ancient law and then they gravely reenact provisions of which they have given bounties for the breach this inconsistency has been well exposed in mr foxs speech  but what will you say to their having gone the length of giving positive directions for contracting the debt which they positively forbid  i will explain myself they order the nabob out of the revenues of the carnatic to allot four hundred and eighty thousand pounds a year as a fund for the debts before us for the punctual payment of this annuity they order him to give soucar security the amended letter appendix no   b  when a soucar that is a money dealer becomes security for any native prince the course is for the native prince to countersecure the money dealer by making over to him in mortgage a portion of his territory equal to the sum annually to be paid with an interest of at least twentyfour per cent the point fit for the house to know is who are these soucars to whom this security on the revenues in favor of the nabobs creditors is to be given the majority of the house unaccustomed to these transactions will hear with astonishment that these soucars are no other than the creditors themselves the minister not content with authorizing these transactions in a manner and to an extent unhoped for by the rapacious expectations of usury itself loads the broken back of the indian revenues in favor of his worthy friends the soucars with an additional twentyfour per cent for being security to themselves for their own claims for condescending to take the country in mortgage to pay to themselves the fruits of their own extortions  the interest to be paid for this security according to the most moderate strain of soucar demand comes to one hundred and eighteen thousand pounds a year which added to the l  0000 on which it is to accrue will make the whole charge on account of these debts on the carnatic revenues amount to l   000 a year as much as even a long peace will enable those revenues to produce can any one reflect for a moment on all those claims of debt which the minister exhausts himself in contrivances to augment with new usuries without lifting up his hands and eyes in astonishment of the impudence both of the claim and the adjudication services of some kind or other these servants of the company must have done so great and eminent that the chancellor of the exchequer cannot think that all they have brought home is half enough he halloos after them gentlemen you have forgot a large packet behind you in your hurry you have not sufficiently recovered yourselves you ought to have and you shall have interest upon interest upon a prohibited debt that is made up of interest upon interest even this is too little i have thought of another character for you by which you may add something to your gains you shall be security to yourselves and hence will rise a new usury which shall efface the memory of all the usuries suggested to you by your own dull inventions  i have done with the arrangement relative to the carnatic after this it is to little purpose to observe on what the ministers have done to tanjore your ministers have not observed even form and ceremony in their outrageous and insulting robbery of that country whose only crime has been its early and constant adherence to the power of this and the suffering of an uniform pillage in consequence of it the debt of the company from the rajah of tanjore is just of the same stuff with that of the nabob of arcot  the subsidy from tanjore on the arrear of which this pretended debt if any there be has accrued to the company is not like that paid by the nabob of arcot a compensation for vast countries obtained augmented and preserved for him not the price of pillaged treasuries ransacked houses and plundered territories  it is a large grant from a small kingdom not obtained by our arms robbed not protected by our power a grant for which no equivalent was ever given or pretended to be given the right honorable gentleman however bears witness in his reports to the punctuality of the payments of this grant of bounty or if you please of fear it amounts to one hundred and sixty thousand pound sterling net annual subsidy he bears witness to a further grant of a town and port with an annexed district of thirty thousand pound a year surrendered to the company since the first donation he has not borne witness but the fact is he will not deny it that in the midst of war and during the ruin and desolation of a considerable part of his territories this prince made many very large payments notwithstanding these merits and services the first regulation of ministry is to force from him a territory of an extent which they have not yet thought proper to ascertain for a military peace establishment the particulars of which they have not yet been pleased to settle  the next part of their arrangement is with regard to war as confessedly this prince had no share in stirring up any of the former wars so all future wars are completely out of his power for he has no troops whatever and is under a stipulation not so much as to correspond with any foreign state except through the company yet in case the companys servants should be again involved in war or should think proper again to provoke any enemy as in times past they have wantonly provoked all india he is to be subjected to a new penalty to what penalty  why to no less than the confiscation of all his revenues but this is to end with the war and they are to be faithfully returned  oh no nothing like it the country is to remain under confiscation until all the debt which the company shall think fit to incur in such war shall be discharged that is to say for ever his sole comfort is to find his old enemy the nabob of arcot placed in the very same condition  the revenues of that miserable country were before the invasion of hyder reduced to a gross annual receipt of three hundred and sixty thousand pound mr petries evidence before the select committee app  from this receipt the subsidy i have just stated is taken this again by payments in advance by extorting deposits of additional sums to a vast amount for the benefit of their soucars and by an endless variety of other extortions public and private is loaded with a debt the amount of which i never could ascertain but which is large undoubtedly generating an usury the most completely ruinous that probably was ever heard of that is fortyeight per cent payable monthly with compound interest appendix no     such is the state to which the companys servants have reduced that country now come the reformers restorers and comforters of india what have they done in addition to all these tyrannous exactions with all these ruinous debts in their train looking to one side of an agreement whilst they wilfully shut their eyes to the other they withdraw from tanjore all the benefits of the treaty of      and they subject that nation to a perpetual tribute of forty thousand a year to the nabob of arcot a tribute never due or pretended to be due to him even when he appeared to be something a tribute as things now stand not to a real potentate but to a shadow a dream an incubus of oppression after the company has accepted in subsidy in grant of territory in remission of rent as a compensation for their own protection at least two hundred thousand pound a year without discounting a shilling for that receipt the ministers condemn this harassed nation to be tributary to a person who is himself by their own arrangement deprived of the right of war or peace deprived of the power of the sword forbid to keep up a single regiment of soldiers and is therefore wholly disabled from all protection of the country which is the object of the pretended tribute tribute hangs on the sword it is an incident inseparable from real sovereign power in the present case to suppose its existence is as absurd as it is cruel and oppressive and here mr speaker you have a clear exemplification of the use of those false names and false colors which the gentlemen who have lately taken possession of india choose to lay on for the purpose of disguising their plan of oppression the nabob of arcot and rajah of tanjore have in truth and substance no more than a merely civil authority held in the most entire dependence on the company the nabob without military without federal capacity is extinguished as a potentate but then he is carefully kept alive as an independent and sovereign power for the purpose of rapine and extortion for the purpose of perpetuating the old intrigues animosities usuries and corruptions  it was not enough that this mockery of tribute was to be continued without the correspondent protection or any of the stipulated equivalents but ten years of arrear to the amount of l  00000 sterling is added to all the debts to the company and to individuals in order to create a new debt to be paid if at all possible to be paid in whole or in part only by new usuries and all this for the nabob of arcot or rather for mr benfield and the corpse of the nabobs creditors and their soucars thus these miserable indian princes are continued in their seats for no other purpose than to render them in the first instance objects of every species of extortion and in the second to force them to become for the sake of a momentary shadow of reduced authority a sort of subordinate tyrants the ruin and calamity not the fathers and cherishers of their people  but take this tribute only as a mere charge without title cause or equivalent on this people what one step has been taken to furnish grounds for a just calculation and estimate of the proportion of the burden and the ability none not an attempt at it they do not adapt the burden to the strength but they estimate the strength of the bearers by the burden they impose then what care is taken to leave a fund sufficient to the future reproduction of the revenues that are to bear all these loads every one but tolerably conversant in indian affairs must know that the existence of this little kingdom depends on its control over the river cavery the benefits of heaven to any community ought never to be connected with political arrangements or made to depend on the personal conduct of princes in which the mistake or error or neglect or distress or passion of a moment on either side may bring famine on millions and ruin an innocent nation perhaps for ages the means of the subsistence of mankind should be as immutable as the laws of nature let power and dominion take what course they may  observe what has been done with regard to this important concern the use of this river is indeed at length given to the rajah and a power provided for its enjoyment at his own charge but the means of furnishing that charge and a mighty one it is are wholly cut off this use of the water which ought to have no more connection than clouds and rains and sunshine with the politics of the rajah the nabob or the company is expressly contrived as a means of enforcing demands and arrears of tribute this horrid and unnatural instrument of extortion had been a distinguishing feature in the enormities of the carnatic politics that loudly called for reformation but the food of a whole people is by the reformers of india conditioned on payments from its prince at a moment that he is overpowered with a swarm of their demands without regard to the ability of either prince or people in fine by opening an avenue to the irruption of the nabob of arcots creditors and soucars whom every man who did not fall in love with oppression and corruption on an experience of the calamities they produced would have raised wall before wall and mound before mound to keep from a possibility of entrance a more destructive enemy than hyder ali is introduced into that kingdom by this part of their arrangement in which they establish a debt to the nabob of arcot in effect and substance they deliver over tanjore bound hand and foot to paul benfield the old betrayer insulter oppressor and scourge of a country which has for years been an object of an unremitted but unhappily an unequal struggle between the bounties of providence to renovate and the wickedness of mankind to destroy  the right honorable gentleman mr dundas talks of his fairness in determining the territorial dispute between the nabob of arcot and the prince of that country when he superseded the determination of the directors in whom the law had vested the decision of that controversy he is in this just as feeble as he is in every other part but it is not necessary to say a word in refutation of any part of his argument the mode of the proceeding sufficiently speaks the spirit of it it is enough to fix his character as a judge that he never heard the directors in defense of their adjudication nor either of the parties in support of their respective claims it is sufficient for me that he takes from the rajah of tanjore by this pretended adjudication or rather from his unhappy subjects l  0000 a year of his and their revenue and leaves upon his and their shoulders all the charges that can be made on the part of the nabob on the part of his creditors and on the part of the company without so much as hearing him as to right or to ability but what principally induces me to leave the affair of the territorial dispute between the nabob and the rajah to another day is this that both the parties being stripped of their all it little signifies under which of their names the unhappy undone people are delivered over to the merciless soucars the allies of that right honorable gentleman and the chancellor of the exchequer in them ends the account of this long dispute of the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore  the right honorable gentleman is of opinion that his judgment in this case can be censured by none but those who seem to act as if they were paid agents to one of the parties what does he think of his court of directors if they are paid by either of the parties by which of them does he think they are paid he knows that their decision has been directly contrary to his shall i believe that it does not enter into his heart to conceive that any person can steadily and actively interest himself in the protection of the injured and oppressed without being well paid for his service i have taken notice of this sort of discourse some days ago so far as it may be supposed to relate to me i then contented myself as i shall now do with giving it a cold though a very direct contradiction thus much i do from respect to truth if i did more it might be supposed by my anxiety to clear myself that i had imbibed the ideas which for obvious reasons the right honorable gentleman wishes to have received concerning all attempts to plead the cause of the natives of india as if it were a disreputable employment if he had not forgot in his present occupation every principle which ought to have guided him and i hope did guide him in his late profession he would have known that he who takes a fee for pleading the cause of distress against power and manfully performs the duty he has assumed receives an honorable recompense for a virtuous service but if the right honorable gentleman will have no regard to fact in his insinuations or to reason in his opinions i wish him at least to consider that if taking an earnest part with regard to the oppressions exercised in india and with regard to this most oppressive case of tanjore in particular can ground a presumption of interested motives he is himself the most mercenary man i know his conduct indeed is such that he is on all occasions the standing testimony against himself he it was that first called to that case the attention of the house the reports of his own committee are ample and affecting upon that subject see report iv committee of secrecy p    and    and appendix in sundry places  and as many of us as have escaped his massacre must remember the very pathetic picture he made of the sufferings of the tanjore country on the day when he moved the unwieldy code of his indian resolutions has he not stated over and over again in his reports the ill treatment of the rajah of tanjore a branch of the royal house of the marattas every injury to whom the marattas felt as offered to themselves as a main cause of the alienation of that people from the british power and does he now think that to betray his principles to contradict his declarations and to become himself an active instrument in those oppressions which he had so tragically lamented is the way to clear himself of having been actuated by a pecuniary interest at the time when he chose to appear full of tenderness to that ruined nation  the right honorable gentleman is fond of parading on the motives of others and on his own as to himself he despises the imputations of those who suppose that any thing corrupt could influence him in this his unexampled liberality of the public treasure i do not know that i am obliged to speak to the motives of ministry in the arrangements they have made of the pretended debts of arcot and tanjore if i prove fraud and collusion with regard to public money on those right honorable gentlemen i am not obliged to assign their motives because no good motives can be pleaded in favor of their conduct upon that case i stand we are at issue and i desire to go to trial this i am sure is not loose railing or mean insinuation according to their low and degenerate fashion when they make attacks on the measures of their adversaries it is a regular and juridical course and unless i choose it nothing can compel me to go further  but since these unhappy gentlemen have dared to hold a lofty tone about their motives and affect to despise suspicion instead of being careful not to give cause for it i shall beg leave to lay before you some general observations on what i conceive was their duty in so delicate a business  if i were worthy to suggest any line of prudence to that right honorable gentleman i would tell him that the way to avoid suspicion in the settlement of pecuniary transactions in which great frauds have been very strongly presumed is to attend to these few plain principles  first to hear all parties equally and not the managers for the suspected claimants only  not to proceed in the dark but to act with as much publicity as possible  not to precipitate decision  to be religious in following the rules prescribed in the commission under which we act and lastly and above all not to be fond of straining constructions to force a jurisdiction and to draw to ourselves the management of a trust in its nature invidious and obnoxious to suspicion where the plainest letter of the law does not compel it if these few plain rules are observed no corruption ought to be suspected if any of them are violated suspicion will attach in proportion if all of them are violated a corrupt motive of some kind or other will not only be suspected but must be violently presumed  the persons in whose favor all these rules have been violated and the conduct of ministers toward them will naturally call for your consideration and will serve to lead you through a series and combination of facts and characters if i do not mistake into the very inmost recesses of this mysterious business you will then be in possession of all the materials on which the principles of sound jurisprudence will found or will reject the presumption of corrupt motives or if such motives are indicated will point out to you of what particular nature the corruption is  our wonderful minister as you all know formed a new plan a plan insigne recens alio indictum ore a plan for supporting the freedom of our constitution by court intrigues and for removing its corruptions by indian delinquency to carry that bold paradoxical design into execution sufficient funds and apt instruments became necessary you are perfectly sensible that a parliamentary reform occupies his thoughts day and night as an essential member in this extraordinary project in his anxious researches upon this subjest natural instinct as well as sound policy would direct his eyes and settle his choice on paul benfield paul benfield is the grand parliamentary reformer the reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow and to whom even the right honorable gentleman himself must yield the palm for what region in the empire what city what borough what county what tribunal in this kingdom is not full of his labors others have been only speculators he is the grand practical reformer and whilst the chancellor of the exchequer pledges in vain the man and the minister to increase the provincial members mr benfield has auspiciously and practically begun it leaving far behind him even lord camelfords generous design of bestowing old sarum on the bank of england mr benfield has thrown in the borough of cricklade to reinforce the county representation not content with this in order tostation a steady phalanx for all future reforms this publicspirited usurer amidst his charitable toils for the relief of india did not forget the poor rotten constitution of his native country for her he did not disdain to stoop to the trade of a wholesale upholsterer for this house to furnish it not with the faded tapestry figures of antiquated merit such as decorate and may reproach some other houses but with real solid living patterns of true modern virtue paul benfield made reckoning himself no fewer than eight members in the last parliament what copious streams of pure blood must he not have transfused into the veins of the present  but what is even more striking than the real services of this newimported patriot is his modesty as soon as he had conferred this benefit on the constitution he withdrew himself from our applause he conceived that the duties of a member of parliament which with the elect faithful the true believers the islam of parliamentary reform are of little or no merit perhaps not much better than specious sins might be as well attended to in india as in england and the means of reformation to parliament itself be far better provided mr benfield was therefore no sooner elected than he set off for madras and defrauded the longing eyes of parliament we have never enjoyed in this house the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race and contemplating that visage which has so long reflected the happiness of nations  it was therefore not possible for the minister to consult personally with this great man what then was he to do through a sagacity that never failed him in these pursuits he found out in mr benfields representative his exact resemblance a specific attraction by which he gravitates toward all such characters soon brought our minister into a close connection with mr benfields agent and attorney that is with the grand contractor whom i name to honor mr richard atkinson a name that will be well remembered as long as the records of this house as long as the records of the british treasury as long as the monumental debt of england shall endure  this gentleman sir acts as attorney for mr paul benfield every one who hears me is well acquainted with the sacred friendship and the steady mutual attachment that subsists between him and the present minister as many members as chose to attend in the first session of this parliament can best tell their own feelings at the scenes which were then acted how much that honorable gentleman was consulted in the original frame and fabric of the bill commonly called mr pitts india bill is matter only of conjecture though by no means difficult to divine but the public was an indignant witness of the ostentation with which that measure was made his own and the authority with which he brought up clause after clause to stuff and fatten the rankness of that corrupt act as fast as the clauses were brought up to the table they were accepted no hesitation no discussion they were received by the new minister not with approbation but with implicit submission the reformation may be estimated by seeing who was the reformer paul benfields associate and agent was held up to the world as legislator of indostan but it was necessary to authenticate the coalition between the men of intrigue in india and the minister of intrigue in england by a studied display of the power of this their connecting link every trust every honor every distinction was to be heaped upon him he was at once made a director of the india company made an alderman of london and to be made if ministry could prevail and i am sorry to say how near how very near they were prevailing representative of the capital of this kingdom but to secure his services against all risque he was brought in for a ministerial borough on his part he was not wanting in zeal for the common cause his advertisements show his motives and the merits upon which he stood for your minister this wornout veteran submitted to enter into the dusty field of the london contest and you all remember that in the same virtuous cause he submitted to keep a sort of public office or counting house where the whole business of the last general election was managed it was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of benfield it was managed upon indian principles and for an indian interest this was the golden cup of abominations this the chalice of the fornications of rapine usury and oppression which was held out by the gorgeous eastern harlot which so many of the people so many of the nobles of this land had drained to the very dregs do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch that no payment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenness and national prostitution here you have it here before you the principal of the grand election manager must be indemnified accordingly the claims of benfield and his crew must be put above all enquiry  for several years benfield appeared as the chief proprietor as well as the chief agent director and controller of this system of debt the worthy chairman of the company has stated the claims of this single gentleman on the nabob of arcot as amounting to five hundred thousand pound mr smiths protest  possibly at the time of the chairmans state they might have been as high eight hundred thousand had been mentioned sometime before madras correspondence on this subject  and according to the practice of shifting the names of creditors in these transactions and reducing or raising the debt itself at pleasure i think it not impossible that at one period the name of benfield might have stood before those frightful figures but my best information goes to fix his share no higher than four hundred thousand pounds by the scheme of the present ministry for adding to the principal twelve per cent from the year      to the year      four hundred thousand pounds that smallest of the sums ever mentioned for mr benfield will form a capital of l    000 at six per cent thus besides the arrears of three years amounting to l  0  00 which as fast as received may be legally lent out at    per cent benfield has received by the ministerial grant before you an annuity of l     0 a year charged on the public revenues  our mirror of ministers of finance did not think this enough for the services of such a friend as benfield he found that lord macartney in order to frighten the court of directors from the project of obliging the nabob to give soucar security for his debt assured them that if they should take that step benfield appendix no   a would infallibly be the soucar and would thereby become the entire master of the carnatic what lord macartney thought sufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with benfield in his iniquities was the inducement to the two right honorable gentlemen to order this very soucar security to be given and to recall benfield to the city of madras from the sort of decent exile into which he had been relegated by lord macartney you must therefore consider benfield as soucar security for l   0000 a year which at twentyfour per cent supposing him contented with that profit will with the interest of his old debt produce an annual income of l      0 a year  here is a specimen of the new and pure aristocracy created by the right honorable gentleman right honorable william pit  as the support of the crown and constitution against the old corrupt refractory natural interests of this kingdom and this is the grand counterpoise against all odious coalitions of these interests a single benfield outweighs them all a criminal who long since ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal is by his majestys ministers enthroned in the government of a great kingdom and enfeoffed with an estate which in the comparison effaces the splendour of all the nobility of europe to bring a little more distinctly into view the true secret of this dark transaction i beg you particularly to advert to the circumstances which i am going to place before you  the general corpse of creditors as well as mr benfield himself not looking well into futurity nor presaging the minister of this day thought it not expedient for their common interest that such a name as his should stand at the head of their list it was therefore agreed amongst them that mr benfield should disappear by making over his debt to messrs tailor majendie and call and should in return be secured by their bond  the debt thus exonerated of so great a weight of its odium and otherwise reduced from its alarming bulk the agents thought they might venture to print a list of the creditors this was done for the first time in the year      during the duke of portlands administration in this list the name of benfield was not to be seen to this strong negative testimony was added the further testimony of the nabob of arcot that prince appendix no   or rather mr benfield for him writes to the court of directors a letter dated   th october for further illustration of the style in which these letters are written and the principles on which they proceed see letters from the nabob to the court of directors dated august   th and september  th      delivered by mr james macpherson minister to the nabob january   th      full of complaints and accusations against lord macartney conveyed in such terms as were natural for one of mr benfields habits and education to employ amongst the rest he is made to complain of his lordships endeavoring to prevent an intercourse of politeness and sentiment between him and mr benfield and to aggravate the affront he expressly declares mr benfields visits to be only on account of respect and of gratitude as no pecuniary transactions subsisted between them  such for a considerable space of time was the outward form of the loan of      in which mr benfield had no sort of concern at length intelligence arrived at madras that this debt which had always been renounced by the court of directors was rather like to become the subject of something more like a criminal enquiry than of any patronage or sanction from parliament every ship brought accounts one stronger than the other of the prevalence of the determined enemies of the indian system the public revenues became an object desperate to the hopes of mr benfield he therefore resolved to fall upon his associates and in violation of that faith which subsists among those who have abandoned all other commences a suit in the mayors court against tailor majendie and call for the bond given to him when he agreed to disappear for his own benefit as well as that of the common concern the assignees of his debt who little expected the springing of this mine even from such an engineer as mr benfield after recovering their first alarm thought it best to take ground on the real state of the transaction they divulged the whole mystery and were prepared to plead that they had never received from mr benfield any other consideration for the bond than a transfer in trust for himself of his demand on the nabob of arcot an universal indignation arose against the persidy of mr benfields proceeding the event of the suit was looked upon as so certain that benfield was compelled to retreat as precipitately as he had advanced boldly he gave up his bond and was reinstated in his original demand to wait the fortune of other claimants at that time and at madras this hope was dull indeed but at home another scene was preparing  it was long before any public account of this discovery at madras had arrived in england that the present minister and his board of control thought fit to determine on the debt of      the recorded proceedings at this time knew nothing of any debt to benfield there was his own testimony there was the testimony of the list there was the testimony of the nabob of arcot against it yet such was the ministers feeling of the true secret of this transaction that they thought proper in the teeth of all these testimonies to give him license to return to madras here the ministers were under some embarrassment confounded between their resolution of rewarding the good services of benfields friends and associates in england and the shame of sending that notorious incendiary to the court of the nabob of arcot to renew his intrigues against the british government at the time they authorize his return they forbid him under the severest penalties from any conversation with the nabob or his ministers that is they forbid his communication with the very person on account of his dealings with whom they permit his return to that city to overtop this contradiction there is not a word restraining him from the freest intercourse with the nabobs second sonthe real author of all that is done in the nabobs name who in conjunction with this very benfield has acquired an absolute dominion over that unhappy man is able to persuade him to put his signature to whatever paper they please and often without any communication of the contents this management was detailed to them at full length by lord macartney and they cannot pretend ignorance of it appendix f   i believe after this exposure of facts no man can entertain a doubt of the collusion of ministers with the corrupt interest of the delinquents in india whenever those in authority provide for the interest of any person on the real but concealed state of his affairs without regard to his avowed public and oftensible pretenses it must be presumed that they are in confederacy with him because they act for him on the same fraudulent principles on which he acts for himself it is plain that the ministers were fully apprised of benfields real situation which he had used means to conceal whilst concealment answered his purposes they were or the person on whom they relied was of the cabinet council of benfield in the very depth of all his mysteries an honest magistrate compels men to abide by one story an equitable judge would not hear of the claim of a man who had himself thought proper to renounce it with such a judge his shuffling and prevarication would have damned his claims such a judge never would have known but in order to animadvert upon proceedings of that character  i have thus laid before you mr speaker i think with sufficient clearness the connection of the ministers with mr atkinson at the general election i have laid open to you the connection of atkinson with benfield i have shown benfields employment of his wealth in creating a parliamentary interest to procure a ministerial protection i have set before your eyes his large concern in the debt his practices to hide that concern from the public eye and the liberal protection which he has received from the minister if this chain of circumstances do not lead you necessarily to conclude that the minister has paid to the avarice of benfield the services done by benfields connections to his ambition i do not know any thing short of the confession of the party that can persuade you of his guilt clandestine and collusive practice can only be traced by combination and comparison of circumstances to reject such combination and comparison is to reject the only means of detecting fraud it is indeed to give it a patent and free license to cheat with impunity  i confine myself to the connection of ministers mediately or immediately with only two persons concerned in this debt how many others who support their power and greatness within and without doors are concerned originally or by transfers of these debts must be left to general opinion i refer to the reports of the select committee for the proceedings of some of the agents in these affairs and their attempts at least to furnish ministers with the means of buying general courts and even whole parliaments in the gross second report of select general smiths committee   i know that the ministers will think it little less than acquittal that they are not charged with having taken to themselves some part of the money of which they have made so liberal a donation to their partisans though the charge may be indisputably fixed upon the corruption of their politics for my part i follow their crimes to that point to which legal presumptions and natural indications lead me without considering what species of evil motive tends most to aggravate or to extenuate the guilt of their conduct but if i am to speak my private sentiments i think that in a thousand cases for one it would be far less mischievous to the public and full as little dishonorable to themselves to be polluted with direct bribery than thus to become a standing auxiliary to the oppression usury and peculation of multitudes in order to obtain a corrupt support to their power it is by bribing not so often by being bribed that wicked politicians bring ruin on mankind avarice is a rival to the pursuits of many it finds a multitude of checks and many opposers in every walk of life but the objects of ambition are for the few and every person who aims at indirect profit and therefore wants other protection than innocence and law instead of its rival becomes its instrument there is a natural allegiance and fealty due to this domineering paramount evil from all the vassal vices which acknowledge its superiority and readily militate under its banners and it is under that discipline alone that avarice is able to spread to any considerable extent or to render itself a general public mischief it is therefore no apology for ministers that they have not been bought by the east india delinquents but that they have only formed an alliance with them for screening each other from justice according to the exigence of their several necessities that they have done so is evident and the junction of the power of office in england with the abuse of authority in the east has not only prevented even the appearance of redress to the grievances of india but i wish it may not be found to have dulled if not extinguished the honor the candor the generosity the goodnature which used formerly to characterise the people of england i confess i wish that some more feeling than i have yet observed for the sufferings of our fellow creatures and fellow subjects in that oppressed part of the world had manifested itself in any one quarter of the kingdom or in any one large description of men  that these oppressions exist is a fact no more denied than it is resented as it ought to be much evil has been done in india under the british authority what has been done to redress it we are no longer surprised at any thing we are above the unlearned and vulgar passion of admiration but it will astonish posterity when they read our opinions in our actions that after years of enquiry we have found out that the sole grievance of india consisted in this that the servants of the company there had not profited enough of their opportunities nor drained it sufficiently of its treasures when they shall hear that the very first and only important act of a commission specially named by act of parliament is to charge upon an undone country in favor of a handful of men in the humblest ranks of the public service the enormous sum of perhaps four millions of sterling money  it is difficult for the most wise and upright government to correct the abuses of remote delegated power productive of unmeasured wealth and protected by the boldness and strength of the same illgot riches these abuses full of their own wild native vigor will grow and flourish under mere neglect but where the supreme authority not content with winking at the rapacity of its inferior instruments is so shameless and corrupt as openly to give bounties and premiums for disobedience to its laws when it will not trust to the activity of avarice in the pursuit of its own gains when it secures public robbery by all the careful jealousy and attention with which it ought to protect property from such violence the commonwealth then is become totally perverted from its purposes neither god nor man will long endure it nor will it long endure itself in that case there is an unnatural infection a pestilential taint fermenting in the constitution of society which fever and convulsions of some kind or other must throw off or in which the vital powers worsted in an unequal struggle are pushed back upon themselves and by a reversal of their whole functions fester to gangrene to death and instead of what was but just now the delight and boast of the creation there will be cast out in the face of the sun a bloated putrid noisome carcass full of stench and poison an offense a horror a lesson to the world  in my opinion we ought not to wait for the fruitless instruction of calamity to enquire into the abuses which bring upon us ruin in the worst of its forms in the loss of our fame and virtue but the right honorable gentleman mr dundas says in answer to all the powerful arguments of my honorable friend  that this enquiry is of a delicate nature and that the state will suffer detriment by the exposure of this transaction but it is exposed it is perfectly known in every member in every particle and in every way except that which may lead to a remedy he knows that the papers of correspondence are printed and that they are in every hand  he and delicacy are a rare and a singular coalition he thinks that to divulge our indian politics may be highly dangerous he the mover the chairman the reporter of the committee of secrecy he that brought forth in the utmost detail in several vast printed folios the most recondite parts of the politics the military the revenues of the british empire in india with six great chopping bastards six reports of the committee of secrecy  each as lusty as an infant hercules this delicate creature blushes at the sight of his new bridegroom assumes a virgin delicacy or to use a more fit as well as a more poetic comparison the person so squeamish so timid so trembling lest the winds of heaven should visit too roughly is expanded to broad sunshine exposed like the sow of imperial augury lying in the mud with all the prodigies of her fertility about her as evidence of her delicate amors  triginta capitum foetus enixa jacebat alba solo recubans albi circum ubera nati  whilst discovery of the misgovernment of others led to his own power it was wise to enquire it was safe to publish there was then no delicacy there was then no danger but when his object is obtained and in his imitation he has outdone the crimes that he had reprobated in volumes of reports and in sheets of bills of pains and penalties then concealment becomes prudence and it concerns the safety of the state that we should not know in a mode of parliamentary cognizance what all the world knows but too well that is in what manner he chooses to dispose of the public revenues to the creatures of his politics  the debate has been long and as much so on my part at least as on the part of those who have spoken before me but long as it is the more material half of the subject has hardly been touched on that is the corrupt and destructive system to which this debt has been rendered subservient and which seems to be pursued with at least as much vigor and regularity as ever if i considered your ease or my own rather than the weight and importance of this question i ought to make some apology to you perhaps some apology to myself for having detained your attention so long i know on what ground i tread this subject at one time taken up with so much fervor and zeal is no longer a favorite in this house the house itself has undergone a great and signal revolution to some the subject is strange and uncouth to several harsh and distasteful to the relics of the last parliament it is a matter of fear and apprehension it is natural for those who have seen their friends sink in the tornado which raged during the late shift of the monsoon and have hardly escaped on the planks of the general wreck it is but too natural for them as soon as they make the rocks and quicksands of their former disasters to put about their newbuilt barks and as much as possible to keep aloof from this perilous lee shore  but let us do what we please to put india from our thoughts we can do nothing to separate it from our public interest and our national reputation our attempts to banish this importunate duty will only make it return upon us again and again and every time in a shape more unpleasant than the former a government has been fabricated for that great province the right honorable gentleman says that therefore you ought not to examine into its conduct heavens what an argument is this we are not to examine into the conduct of the direction because it is an old government we are not to examine into this board of control because it is a new one then we are only to examine into the conduct of those who have no conduct to account for unfortunately the basis of this new government has been laid on old condemned delinquents and its superstructure is raised out of prosecutors turned into protectors the event has been such as might be expected but if it had been otherwise constituted had it been constituted even as i wished and as the mover of this question had planned the better part of the proposed establishment was in the publicity of its proceedings in its perpetual responsibility to parliament without this check what is our government at home even awed as every european government is by an audience formed of the other states of europe by the applause or condemnation of the discerning and critical company before which it acts but if the scene on the other side of the globe which tempts invites almost compels to tyrannny and rapine be not inspected with the eye of a severe and unremitting vigilance shame and destruction must ensue for one the worst event of this day though it may deject shall not break or subdue me the call upon us is authoritative let who will shrink back i shall be found at my post baffled discountenanced subdued discredited as the cause of justice and humanity is it will be only the dearer to me whoever therefore shall at any time bring before you any thing toward the relief of our distressed fellowcitizens in india and toward a subversion of the present most corrupt and oppressive system for its government in me shall find a weak i am afraid but a steady earnest and faithful assistant

appendix no   referred to from p    nabob of arcots debts mr george smith being asked whether the debts of the nabob of arcot have increased since he knew madras he said yes they have he distinguishes his debts into two sorts those contracted before the year      and those contracted from that year to the year in which he left madras  being asked what he thinks is the original amount of the old debts he said between twentythree and twentyfour lacks of pagodas as well as he can recollect  being asked what was the amount of that debt when he left madras he said between   and   lacks of pagodas as he understood  being asked what was the amount of the new debt when he left madras he said in november      that debt amounted according to the nabobs own account and published at chipauk his place of residence to sixty lacks of pagodas independent of the old debt on which debt of  0 lacks of pagodas the nabob did agree to pay an interest of twelve per cent per annum  being asked whether this debt was approved of by the court of directors he said he does not know it was  being asked whether the old debt was recognized by the court of directors he said yes it has been and the court of directors have sent out repeated orders to the president and council of madras to enforce its recovery and payment  being asked if the interest upon the new debt is punctually paid he said it was not during his residence at madras from      to      in which period he thinks no more than five per cent interest was paid in different dividends of two and one per cent  being asked what is the usual course taken by the nabob concerning the arrears of interest he said not having ever lent him moneys himself he cannot fully answer as to the mode of settling the interest with him  being asked whether he has reason to believe the  0 lacks of pagodas was all principal money really and truly advanced to the nabob of arcot or a fictitious capital made up of obligations given by him where no money or goods were received or which was increased by the uniting into it a greater interest than the    per cent expressed to be due on the capital he said he has no reason to believe that the sum of  0 lacks of pagodas was lent in money or goods to the nabob because that sum he thinks is of more value than all the money goods and chattels in the settlement but he does not know in what mode or manner this debt of the nabobs was incurred or accumulated  being asked whether it was not a general and wellgrounded opinion at madras that a great part of this sum was accumulated by obligations and were for services performed or to be performed for the nabob he said he has heard that a part of this debt was given for the purposes mentioned in the above question but he does not know that it was so  being asked whether it was the general opinion of the settlement he said he cannot say that it was the general opinion but it was the opinion of a considerable part of the settlement  being asked whether it was the declared opinion of those that were concerned in the debt or those that were not he said it was the opinion of both parties at least such of them as he conversed with  being asked whether he has reason to believe that the interest really paid by the nabob upon obligations given or money lent did not frequently exceed    per cent he said prior to the first of august      he had had reason to believe that a higher interest than    per cent was paid by the nabob on moneys lent to him but from and after that period when the last act of parliament took place in india he does not know that more than    per cent had been paid by the nabob or received from him  being asked whether it is not his opinion that the nabob has paid more than    per cent for money due since the  st of august      he said he has heard that he has but he does not know it  being asked whether he has been told so by any considerable and weighty authority that was like to know he said he has been so informed by persons who he believes had a very good opportunity of knowing it  being asked whether he was ever told so by the nabob of arcot himself he said he does not recollect that the nabob of arcot directly told him so but from what he said he did infer that he paid a higher interest than    per cent  mr smith being asked whether in the course of trade he ever sold any thing to the nabob of arcot he said in the year      he did sell to the nabob of arcot pearls to the amount of    00 pagodas for which the nabob gave him an order or tankah on the country of tanjore payable in six months without interest  being asked whether at the time he asked the nabob his price for the pearls the nabob beat down that price as dealers commonly do he said no so far from it he offered him more than he asked by  000 pagodas and which he rejected  being asked whether in settling a transaction of discount with the nabobs agent he was not offered a greater discount than l    per cent he said in discounting a soucars bill for   0000 pagodas the nabobs agent did offer him a discount of l    per cent per annum saying that it was the usual rate of discount paid by the nabob but which he would not accept of thinking himself confined by the act of parliament limiting the interest of moneys to l    per cent and accordingly he discounted the bill at l    per cent per annum only  being asked whether he does not think those offers were made him because the nabob thought he was a person of some consequence in the settlement he said being only a private merchant he apprehends that the offer was made to him more from its being a general practice than from any opinion of his importance  appendix no   referred to from p    a bill for the better government of the territorial possessions and dependencies in india one of mr foxs india bills and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that the nabob of arcot the rajah of tanjore or any other protected native prince in india shall

to take or receive any such assignment mortgage or pledge and the same are hereby declared to be null and void and all payments or deliveries of produce or revenue under any such assignment shall and

copy   th may      letter from the committee of assigned revenue to the president and select committee dated   th may      with comparative statement and minute thereon to the right honorable lord macartney k b president and governor etc select committee of fort st george my lord and gentlemen although we have in obedience to your commands of the  th january regularly laid before you our proceedings at large and have occasionally addressed you upon such points as required your resolutions or orders for our guidance we still think it necessary to collect and digest in a summary report those transactions in the management of the assigned revenue which have principally engaged our attention and which upon the proceeding are too much intermixed with ordinary occurrences to be readily traced and understood  such a report may be formed with the greater propriety at this time when your lordship etc have been pleased to conclude your arrangements for the rent of several of the nabobs districts our aim in it is briefly to explain the state of the carnatic at the period of the nabobs assignment the particular causes which existed to the prejudice of that assignment after it was made and the measures which your lordship etc have upon our recommendation adopted for removing those causes and introducing a more regular and beneficial system of management in the country  hyder ally having entered the carnatic with his whole force about the middle of july    0 and employed fire and sword in its destruction for near eighteen months before the nabobs assignment took place it will not be difficult to conceive the state of the country at that period in those provinces which were fully exposed to the ravages of horse scarce a vestige remained either of population or agriculture such of the miserable inhabitants as escaped the fury of the sword were either carried into the mysore country or left to struggle under the horrors of famine the arcot and trichinopoly districts began early to feel the effects of this desolating war tinnevelly madura and ramnadaporum though little infested with hyders troops became a prey to the incursions of the polygars who stripped them of the greatest part of their revenues ongole nellore and palnaud the only remaining districts had suffered but in a small degree  the misfortunes of war however were not the only evils which the carnatic experienced the nabobs aumildars and other servants appear to have taken advantage of the general confusion to enrich themselves a very small part of the revenue was accounted for and so high were the ordinary expenses of every district that double the apparent produce of the whole country would not have satisfied them  in this state which we believe is no way exaggerated the company took charge of the assigned countries their prospect of relief from the heavy burdens of the war was indeed but little advanced by the nabobs concession and the revenues of the carnatic seemed in danger of being irrecoverably lost unless a speedy and entire change of system could be adopted  on our minutes of the   st january we treated the subject of the assignment at some length and pointed out the mischiefs which in addition to the effects of the war had arisen from what we conceived to be wrong and oppressive management  we used the freedom to suggest an entire alteration in the mode of realizing the revenues we proposed a considerable and immediate reduction of expenses and a total change of the principal aumildars who had been employed under the nabob  our ideas had the good fortune to receive your approbation but the removal of the nabobs servants being thought improper at that particular period of the collections we employed our attention chiefly in preserving what revenue was left the country and acquiring such materials as might lead to a more perfect knowledge of its former and present state  these pursuits as we apprehended met with great obstructions from the conduct of the nabobs servants the orders they received were evaded under various pretexts no attention was paid to the strong and repeated applications made to them for the accounts of their management and their attachment to the companys interest appeared in every instance so feeble that we saw no prospect whatever of success but in the appointment of renters under the companys sole authority  upon this principle we judged it expedient to recommend that such of the nabobs districts as were in a state to be farmed out might be immediately let by a public advertisement issued in the companys name and circulated through every province of the carnatic and with the view of encouraging bidders we proposed that the countries might be advertised for the whole period of the nabobs assignment and the security of the companys protection promised in the fullest manner to such persons as might become renters  this plan had the desired effect and the attempts which were secretly made to counteract it afforded an unequivocal proof of its necessity but the advantages resulting from it were more pleasingly evinced by the number of proposals that were delivered and by the terms which were in general offered for the districts intended to be farmed out  having so far attained the purposes of the assignment our attention was next turned to the heavy expenses entailed upon the different provinces and here we confess our astonishment was raised to the highest pitch in the trichinopoly country the standing disbursements appeared by the nabobs own accounts to be one lack of rupees more than the receipts in other districts the charges were not in so high a proportion but still rated on a most extravagant scale and we saw by every account that was brought before us the absolute necessity of retrenching considerably in all the articles of expense  our own reason aided by such enquiries as we were able to make suggested the alterations we have recommended to your lordship etc under this head you will observe that we have not acted sparingly but we chose rather in cases of doubt to incur the hazard of retrenching too much than too little because it would be easier after any stated allowance for expenses to add what might be necessary than to diminish we hope however there will be no material increase in the articles as they now stand  one considerable charge upon the nabobs country was for extraordinary sibbendies sepoys and horsemen who appeared to us to be a very unnecessary encumbrance on the revenue your lordship etc have determined to receive such of these people as will enlist into the companys service and discharge the rest this measure will not only relieve the country of a heavy burden but tend greatly to fix in the company that kind of authority which is requisite for the due collection of the revenues  in consequence of your determination respecting the nabobs sepoys etc every charge under that head has been struck out of our account of expenses if the whole number of these people be enlisted by the company there will probably be no more than sufficient to complete their ordinary military establishment but should the present reduction of the nabobs artillery render it expedient after the war to make any addition to the companys establishment for the purposes of the assigned countries the expense of such addition whatever it be must be deducted from the present account of savings  in considering the charges of the several districts in order to establish better regulations we were careful to discriminate those incurred for troops kept or supposed to be kept up for the defense of the country from those of the sibbendy servants etc for the cultivation of the lands and the collection of the revenues as well as to pay attention to such of the established customs of the country ancient privileges of the inhabitants and public charities as were necessarily allowed and appeared proper to be continued but which under the nabobs government were not only rated much higher but had been blended under one confused and almost unintelligible title of expenses of the districts so joined perhaps to afford pleas and means of secreting and appropriating great part of the revenues to other purposes than fairly appeared and certainly betraying the utmost neglect and mismanagement as giving latitude for every species of fraud and oppression such a system has in the few latter years of the nabobs necessities brought all his countries into that situation from which nothing but the most rigid economy strict observance of the conduct of managers and the most conciliating attention to the rights of the inhabitants can possibly recover them  it now only remains for us to lay before your lordship etc the enclosed statement of the sums at which the districts lately advertised have been let compared with the accounts of their produce delivered by the nabob and entered on our proceedings of the   st january likewise a comparative view of their former and present expenses  the nabobs accounts of the produce of these districts state as we have some reason to think the sums which former renters engaged to pay to him and which were seldom if ever made good and not the sums actually produced by the districts yet we have the satisfaction to observe that the present aggregate rents upon an average are equal to those accounts your lordship etc cannot indeed expect that in the midst of the danger invasion and distress which assail the carnatic on every side the renters now appointed will be able at present to fulfill the terms of their leases but we trust from the measures we have taken that very little if any of the actual collections will be lost even during the war and that on the return of peace and tranquillity the renters will have it in their power fully to perform their respective agreements  we much regret that the situation of the arcot province will not admit of the same settlement which has been made for the other districts but the enemy being in possession of the capital together with several other strong holds and having entirely desolated the country there is little room to hope for more from it than a bare subsistence to the few garrisons we have left there  we shall not fail to give our attention toward obtaining every information respecting this province that the present times will permit and to take the first opportunity to propose such arrangements for the management as we may think eligible  we have the honor to be your most obedient

the president and council of fort st george   th may      one of them the renters ram chunder raus was indeed one of those unfortunate rajahs whose country by being near to the territories of the nabob forfeited its title to independence and became the prey of ambition and cupidity this man though not able to resist the companys arms employed in such a deed at the nabobs instigagation had industry and ability he acquired by a series of services even the confidence of the nabob who suffered him to rent a part of the country of which he had deprived him of the property this man had afforded no motive for his rejection by the nabob but that of being ready to engage with the company a motive most powerful indeed but not to be avowed  this is the person whom the english instruments of the nabob of arcot have had the audacity to charge with a corrupt transaction with lord macartney and in support of that charge to produce a forged letter from his lordships steward the charge and letter the reader may see in this appendix under the proper head it is asserted by the unfortunate prince above mentioned that the company first settled on the coast of coromandel under the protection of one of his ancestors if this be true and it is far from unlikely the world must judge of the return the descendant has met with the case of another of the victims given up by the ministry though not altogether so striking as the former is worthy of attention it is that of the renter of the province of nellore  it is with a wantonness of falsehood and indifference to detection asserted to you in proof of the validity of the nabobs objections that this mans failures had already forced us to remove him though in fact he has continued invariably in office though our greatest supplies have been received from him and that in the disappointment of your remittances the remittances from bengal and of other resources the specie sent us from nellore alone has sometimes enabled us to carry on the public business and that the present expedition against the french must without this assistance from the assignment have been laid aside or delayed until it might have become too late  this man is by the ministry given over to the mercy of persons capable of making charges on him  with a wantonness of falsehood and indifference to detection what is likely to happen to him and the rest of the victims may appear by the following  letter to the governor general and council march   th      the speedy termination to which the people were taught to look of the companys interference in the revenues and the vengeance denounced against those who contrary to the mandate of the durbar should be connected with them as reported by mr sulivan may as much as the former exactions and oppressions of the nabob in the revenue as reported by the commander in chief have deterred some of the fittest men from offering to be concerned in it  the timid disposition of the hindoo natives of this country was not likely to be insensible to the specimen of that vengeance given by his excellency the amur who upon the mere rumor that a bramin of the name of appagee row had given proposals to the company for the rentership of vellore had the temerity to send for him and to put him in confinement  a man thus seized by the nabobs seapoys within the walls of madras gave a general alarm and government found it necessary to promise the protection of the company in order to calm the apprehensions of the people   appendix no   referred to from p    extract of a letter from the council and select committee at fort st george to the governor general and council dated   th may      in the prosecution of our duty we beseech you to consider as an act of strict and necessary justice previous to reiteration of your orders for the surrender of the assignment how far it would be likely to affect third persons who do not appear to have committed any breach of their engagements you command us to compel our aumils to deliver over their respective charges as shall be appointed by the nabob or to retain their trust under his sole authority if he shall choose to confirm them these aumils are really renters they were appointed in the room of the nabobs aumils and contrary to his wishes they have already been rejected by him and are therefore not likely to be confirmed by him they applied to this government in consequence of public advertisements in our name as possessing in this instance the joint authority of the nabob and the company and have entered into mutual and strict covenants with us and we with them relative to the certain districts not actually in the possession of the enemy by which covenants as they are bound to the punctual payment of their rents and due management of the country so we and our constituents and the public faith are in like manner bound to maintain them in the enjoyment of their leases during the continuance of the term that term was for five years agreeably to the words of the assignment which declare that the time of renting shall be for three or five years as the governor shall settle with the renters  their leases cannot be legally torn from them nothing but their previous breach of a part could justify our breach of the whole such a stretch and abuse of power would indeed not only favor of the assumption of sovereignty but of arbitrary and oppressive despotism in the present contest whether the nabob be guilty or we be guilty the renters are not guilty which ever of the contending parties has broken the condition of the assignment the renters have not broken the condition of their leases these men in conducting the business of the assignment have acted in opposition to the designs of the nabob in despite of the menaces denounced against all who should dare to oppose the mandates of the durbar justice gratitude and humanity require that provision should be made by you before you set the nabobs ministers loose on the country for the protection of the victims devoted to their vengeance  mr benfield to secure the permanency of his power and the perfection of his schemes thought it necessary to render the nabob an absolute stranger to the state of his affairs he assured his highness that full justice was not done to the strength of his sentiments and the keenness of his attacks in the translations that were made by the companys servants from the original persian of his letters he therefore proposed to him that they should for the future be transmitted in english  of the english language or writing his highness or the ameer cannot read one word though the latter can converse in it with sufficient fluency the persian language as the language of the mahommedan conquerors and of the court of delhi as an appendage or signal of authority was at all times particularly affected by the nabob  it is the language of all acts of state and all public transctions among the mussulman chiefs of indostan the nabob thought to have gained no inconsiderable point in procuring the correspondence from our predecessors to the rajah of tanjore to be changed from the marattah language which that hindoo prince understands to the persian which he disclaims understanding to force the rajah to the nabobs language was gratifying the latter with a new species of subserviency he had formerly contended with considerable anxiety and it was thought no inconsiderable cost for particular forms of address to be used toward him in that language but all of a sudden in favor of mr benfield he quits his former affections his habits his knowledge his curiosity the increasing mistrust of age to throw himself upon the generous candor the faithful interpretation the grateful return and eloquent organ of mr benfield  mr benfield relates and reads what he pleases to his excellency the ameerulomrah  his excellency communicates with the nabob his father in the language the latter understands through two channels so pure the truth must arrive at the nabob in perfect refinement through this double trust his highness receives whatever impression it may be convenient to make on him he abandons his signature to whatever paper they tell him contains in the english language the sentiments with which they had inspired him he thus is surrounded on every side he is totally at their mercy to believe what is not true and to subscribe to what he does not mean there is no system so new so foreign to his intentions that they may not pursue in his name without possibility of detection for they are cautious of who approach him and have thought prudent to decline for him the visits of the governor even upon the usual solemn and acceptable occasion of delivering to his highness the companys letters such is the complete ascendency gained by mr benfield it may be partly explained by the facts observed already some years ago by mr benfield himself in regard to the nabob of the infirmities natural to his advanced age joined to the decays of his constitution to this ascendency in proportion as it grew must chiefly be ascribed if not the origin at least the continuance and increase of the nabobs disunion with this presidency a disunion which creates the importance and subserves the resentments of mr benfield and an ascedency which if you effect the surrender of the assignment will entirely leave the exercise of power and accumulation of fortune at his boundless discretion to him and to the ameerulomrah and to syed assam cawn the assignment would in fact be surrendered he will if any be the soucar security and security in this country is countersecured by possession you would not choose to take the assignment from the company to give it to individuals of the impropriety of its returning to the nabob mr benfield would now again argue from his former observations that under his highnesss management his country declined his people emigrated his revenues decreased and his country was rapidly approaching to a state of political insolvency of syed assam cawn we judge only from the observations this letter already contains but of the other two persons ameerulomrah and mr benfield we undertake to declare not as parties in a cause or even as voluntary witnesses but as executive officers reporting to you in the discharge of our duty and under the impression of the sacred obligation which binds us to truth as well as to justice that from every observation of their principles and dispositions and every information of their character and conduct they have prosecuted projects to the injury and danger of the company and individuals that it would be improper to trust and dangerous to employ them in any public or important situation that the tranquillity of the carnatic requires a restraint to the power of the ameer and that the company whose service and protection mr benfield has repeatedly and recently forfeited would be more secure against danger and confusion if he were removed from their several presidencies after the above solemn declaration from so weighty an authority the principal object of that awful and deliberate warning instead of being removed from the several presidencies is licensed to return to one of the principal of those presidencies and the grand theater of the operations on account of which the presidency recommends his total removal the reason given is for the accommodation of that very debt which has been the chief instrument of his dangerous practices and the main cause of all the confusions in the companys government   appendix no   referred to from p    and p    extracts from the evidence of mr petrie late resident for the company at tanjore given to the select committee relative to the revenues and state of the country etc etc  th may      william petrie esquire attending according to order was asked in what station he was in the companys service he said he went to india in the year      a writer upon the madras establishment he was employed during the former war with hyder ali in the capacity of paymaster and commissary to part of the army and was afterward paymaster and commissary to the army in the first siege of tanjore and the subsequent campaigns then secretary to the secret department from      to      he came to england in      and returned again to madras the beginning of      he was resident at the durbar of the rajah of tanjore from that time to the month of may and from that time to january    0 was chief of nagore and carrecal the first of which was received from the rajah of tanjore and the second was taken from the french  being asked who sent him to tanjore he said sir thomas rumbold and the secret committee  being then asked upon what errand he said he went first up with a letter from the company to the rajah of tanjore he was directed to give the rajah the strongest assurances that he should be kept in possession of his country and every privilege to which he had been restored he was likewise directed to negociate with the rajah of tanjore for the cession of the seaports and district of nagore in lieu of the town and district of devicotta which he had promised to lord pigot these were the principal and to the best of his recollection at present the only objects in view when he was first sent up to tanjore in the course of his stay at tanjore other matters of business occurred between the company and the rajah which came under his management as resident at that durbar  being asked whether the rajah did deliver up to him the town and the annexed districts of nagore voluntarily or whether he was forced to it he said when he made the first proposition to the rajah agreeable to the directions he had received from the secret committee at madras in the most free open and liberal manner the rajah told him the seaport of nagore was entirely at the service of his benefactors the company and that he was happy in having that opportunity of testifying his gratitude to them these may be supposed to be words of course but from every experience which he had of the rajahs mind and conduct whilst he was at tanjore he has reason to believe that his declarations of gratitude to the company were perfectly sincere he speaks of the town of nagore at present and a certain district not of the districts to the amount of which they afterward received the rajah asked him to what amount he expected a jaghire to the company and the witness further said that he acknowledged to the committee that he was not instructed upon that head that he wrote for orders to madras and was directed to ask the rajah for a jaghire to a certain amount that this gave rise to a long negotiation the rajah representing to him his inability to make such a gift to the company as the secret committee at madras seemed to expect while he the witness on the other hand was directed to make as good a bargain as he could for the company from the view that he then took of the rajahs finances from the situation of his country and from the load of debt which pressed hard upon him he believes he at different times in his correspondence with the government represented the necessity of their being moderate in their demands and it was at last agreed to accept of the town of nagore valued at a certain annual revenue and a jaghire annexed to the town the whole amounting to   0000 rupees  being asked whether it did turn out so valuable he said he had not a doubt but it would turn out more as it was let for more than that to farmers at madras if they had managed the districts properly but they were strangers to the manners and customs of the people when they came down they oppressed the inhabitants and threw the whole district into confusion the inhabitants many of them left the country and deserted the cultivation of their lands of course the farmers were disappointed of their collections and they have since failed and the company have lost a considerable part of what the farmers were to pay for the jaghire  being asked who these farmers were he said one of them was the renter of the st thome district near madras and the other and the most responsible was a madras dubash  being asked who he was dubash to he said to mr cassmajor  being asked whether the lease was made upon higher terms than the district was rated to him by the rajah he said it was  being then asked what reason was assigned why the district was not kept under the former management by amildars or let to persons in the tanjore country acquainted with the district he said no reasons were assigned he was directed from madras to advertise them to be let to persons of the country but before he received any proposal he received accounts that they were let at madras in consequence of public advertisements which had been made there he believes indeed there were very few men in those districts responsible enough to have been entrusted with the management of those lands  being asked whether at the time he was authorized to negociate for nagore in the place of devicotta devicotta was given up to the rajah he said no  being asked whether the rajah of tanjore did not frequently desire that the districts of arne and hanymantygoode should be restored to him agreeable to treaty and the companys orders to lord pigot he said many a time and he transmitted his representations regularly to madras  being then asked whether those places were restored to him he said not while he was in india  being asked whether he was not authorized and required by the presidency at madras to demand a large sum of money over and above the four lacks of pagodas that were to be annually paid by a grant of the rajah made in the time of lord pigot he said he was to the amount he believes of four lacks of pagodas commonly known by the name of depositmoney  being asked whether the rajah did not frequently plead his inability to pay that money he said he did every time he mentioned it and complained loudly of the demand  being asked whether he thinks those complaints were well founded he says he thinks the rajah of tanjore was not only not in a state of ability to pay the depositmoney but that the annual payment of four lacks of pagodas was more than his revenues could afford  being asked whether he was not frequently obliged to borrow money in order to pay the instalments of the annual payments and such parts as he paid of the deposit he said yes he was  being asked where he borrowed the money he said he believes principally from soucars or native bankers and some at madras as he told him  being asked whether he told him that his credit was very good and that he borrowed upon moderate interest he said that he told him he found great difficulties in raising money and was obliged to borrow at a most exorbitant interest even some of it at    per cent and he believes not a great deal under it he desired him the witness to speak to one of the soucars or bankers at tanjore to accommodate him with a loan of money that man showed him an account between him and the rajah from which it appeared that he charged    per cent besides compound interest  being asked whether the sums due were large he said yes they were considerable though he does not recollect the amount  being asked whether the banker lent the money he said he would not unless the witness could procure him payment of his old arrears  being asked what notice did the government of madras take of the king of tanjores representations of the state of his affairs and his inability to pay he said he does not recollect that in their correspondence with him there was any reasoning upon the subject and in his correspondence with sir thomas rumbold upon the amount of the jaghire he seemed very desirous of adopting the demand of government to the rajahs circumstances but whilst he staid at tanjore the rajah was not exonerated from any part of his burdens  being asked whether they ever desired the rajah to make up a statement of his accounts disbursements debts and payments to the company in order to ascertain whether the country was able to pay the increasing demands upon it he said through him he is certain they never did  being then asked if he ever heard whether they did through any one else he said he never did  being asked whether the rajah is not bound to furnish the cultivators of land with seed for their crops according to the custom of the country he said the king of tanjore as proprietor of the land always makes advances of money for seed for the cultivation of the land  being then asked if money beyond his power of furnishing should be extorted from him might it not prevent in the first instance the means of cultivating the country he said it certainly does he knows it for a fact and he knows that when he left the country there were several districts which were uncultivated from that cause  being asked whether it is not necessary to be at a considerable expense in order to keep up the mounds and watercourse he said a very considerable one annually  being asked what would be the consequence if money should fail for that he said in the first instance the country would be partially supplied with water some districts would be overflowed and others would be parched  being asked whether there is not a considerable dam called the anicut on the keeping up of which the prosperity of the country greatly depends and which requires a great expense he said yes there is the whole of the tanjore country is admirably well supplied with water nor can he conceive any method could be fallen upon more happily adapted to the cultivation and prosperity of the country but as the anicut is the source of that prosperity any injury done to that must essentially affect all the other works in the country it is a most stupendous piece of masonry but from the very great floods frequently requiring repairs which if neglected not only the expense of repairing must be greatly increased but a general injury done to the whole country  being asked whether that dam has been kept in as good preservation since the prevalence of the english government as before he said from his own knowledge he cannot tell but from every thing he has read or heard of the former prosperity and opulence of the kings of tanjore he should suppose not  being asked whether he does not know of several attempts that have been made to prevent the repair and even to damage the work he said the rajah himself frequently complained of that to him and he has likewise heard it from others at tanjore  being asked who it was that attempted those acts of violence he said he was told it was the inhabitants of the nabobs country adjoining to the anicut  being asked whether they were not set on or instigated by the nabob he answered the rajah said so  and being asked what steps the president and council took to punish the authors and prevent those violences he said to the best of his recollection the governor told him he would make enquiries into it but he does not know that any enquiries were made that sir thomas rumbold the governor informed him that he had laid his representations with respect to the anicut before the nabob who denied that his people had given any interruption to the repairs of that work   0th may being asked what he thinks the real clear receipt of the revenues of tanjore were worth when he left it he said he cannot say what was the net amount as he does not know the expense of the rajahs collection but while he was at tanjore he understood from the rajah himself and from his ministers that the gross collection did not exceed   lacks of pagodas l   0000  being asked whether he thinks the country could pay the   lacks of pagodas which had been demanded to be paid in the course of one year he said clearly not  being asked whether there was not an attempt made to remove the rajahs minister upon some delay in payment of the deposit he said the governor of madras wrote to that effect which he represented to the rajah  being asked who was mentioned to succeed to the minister that then was in case he should be removed he said when sir hector munro came afterward to tanjore the old daubiere was mentioned and recommended to the rajah as successor to his then dewan  being asked of what age was the daubiere at that time he said of a very great age upwards of fourscore  being asked whether a person called kanonga saba pilla was not likewise named he said yes he was he was recommended by sir thomas rumbold and one recommendation as well as i can recollect went through me  being asked what was the reason of his being recommended he said he undertook to pay off the rajahs debts and to give security for the regular payment of the rajahs instalments to the company  being asked whether he offered to give any security for preserving the country from oppression and for supporting the dignity of the rajah and his people he said he does not know that he did or that it was asked of him  being asked whether he was a person agreeable to the rajah he said he was not  being asked whether he was not a person who had fled out of the country to avoid the resentment of the rajah he said he was  being asked whether he was not charged by the rajah with malpractices and breach of trust relative to his effects he said he was but he told the governor that he would account for his conduct and explain every thing to the satisfaction of the rajah  being asked whether the rajah did not consider this man as in the interest of his enemies and particularly of the nabob of arcot and mr benfield he said he does not recollect that he did mention that to him he remembers to have heard him complain of a transaction between kanonga saba pilla and mr benfield but he told him he had been guilty of a variety of malpractices in his administration that he had oppressed the people and defrauded him  being asked in what branch of business the rajah had formerly employed him he said he was at one time he believes renter of the whole country was supposed to have great influence with the rajah and was in fact dewan some time  being asked whether the nomination of that man was not particularly odious to the rajah he said he found the rajahs mind so exceedingly averse to that man that he believes he would almost as soon have submitted to his being deposed as to submit to the nomination of that man to be his prime minister     may mr petrie being asked whether he was informed by the rajah or by others at tanjore or madras that mr benfield whilst he managed the revenues at tanjore during the usurpation of the nabob did not treat the inhabitants with great rigor he said he did hear from the rajah that mr benfield did treat the inhabitants with rigor during the time he had any thing to do with the administration of the revenues of tanjore  being asked if he recollects in what particulars he said the rajah particularly complained that grain had been delivered out to the inhabitants for the purposes of cultivation at a higher price than the market price of grain in the country he cannot say the actual difference of price but it struck him at the time as something very considerable  being asked whether that money was all recovered from the inhabitants he said the rajah of tanjore told him that the money was all recovered from the inhabitants  being asked whether he did not hear that the nabob exacted from the country of tanjore whilst he was in possession of it he said from the accounts which he received at tanjore of the revenues for a number of years past it appeared that the nabob collected from the country while he was in possession rather more than    lacks of pagodas annually whereas when he was at tanjore it did not yield more than   lacks  being asked from whence that difference arose he said when tanjore was conquered for the nabob he has been told that many thousand of the native inhabitants fled from the country some into the southern provinces some into the country of mysore and others into the dominions of the marattas he understood from the same authority that while the nabob was in possession of the country many inhabitants from the carnatic allured by the superior fertility and opulence of tanjore and encouraged by the nabob took up their residence there which enabled the nabob to cultivate the whole country and upon the restoration of the rajah he has heard that the carnatic inhabitants were carried back to their own country which left a considerable blank in the population which was not replaced while he was there principally owing to an opinion which prevailed through the country that the rajahs government was not to be permanent but that another revolution was fast approaching during the nabobs government the price of grain was considerably higher owing to a very unusual scarcity in the carnatic than when he was in tanjore  being asked whether he was ever in the marawar country he said yes he was commissary to the army in that expedition  being asked whether that country was much wasted by the war he said plunder was not permitted to the army nor did the country suffer from its operations except in causing many thousands of the inhabitants who had been employed in the cultivation of the country to leave it  being asked whether he knows what is done with the palace and inhabitants of ramnaut he said the town was taken by storm but not plundered by the troops it was immediately delivered up to the nabobs eldest son  being asked whether great riches were not supposed to be in that palace and temple he said it was universally believed so  being asked what account was given of them he said he cannot tell every thing remained in the possession of the nabob  being asked what became of the children and women of the family of the prince of that country he said the rajah was a minor the government was in the hands of the ranny his mother from general report he has heard they were carried to trichinopoly and placed in confinement there  being asked whether he perceived any difference in the face of the carnatic when he first knew it and when he last knew it he said he thinks he did particularly in its population  being asked whether it was better or worse he said it was not so populous  being asked what is the condition of the nabobs eldest son he said he was in the black town of madras when he left the country  being asked whether he was entertained there in a manner suitable to his birth and expectations he said no he lived there without any of those exterior marks of splendour which princes of his rank in india are particularly fond of  being asked whether he has not heard that his appointments were poor and mean he said he has heard that they were not equal to his ank and expectations  being asked whether he had any share in the government he said he believes none for some years past the nabob has delegated most of the powers of government to his second son  being asked whether the rajah did not complain to him of the behavior of mr benfield to himself personally and what were the particulars he said he did so and related to him the following particulars about fifteen days after lord pigots confinement mr benfield came to tanjore and delivered the rajah two letters from the then governor mr stratton one public and the other private he demanded an immediate account of the presents which had been made to lord pigot payment of the tunkahs which he mr benfield had received from the nabob upon the country and that the rajah should only write such letters to the madras government as mr benfield should approve and give to him the rajah answered that he did not acknowledge the validity of any demands made by the nabob upon the country that those tunkahs related to accounts which he the rajah had no concern with that he never had given lord pigot any presents but lord pigot had given him many and that as to his correspondence with the madras government he would not trouble mr benfield because he would write his letters himself  that the rajah told the witness that by reason of this answer he was much threatened in consequence of which he desired colonel harper who then commanded at tanjore to be present at his next interview with mr benfield when mr benfield denied many parts of the preceding conversation and threw the blame upon his interpreter comroo when mr benfield found as the rajah informed him that he could not carry these points which had brought him to tanjore he prepared to set off for madras that the rajah sent him a letter which he had drawn out in answer to one which mr benfield had brought him that mr benfield disapproved of the answer and returned it by comroo to the durbar who did not deliver it into the rajahs hands but threw it upon the ground and expressed himself improperly to him  being asked whether it was at the king of tanjores desire that such persons as mr benfield and comroo had been brought into his presence  he said the rajah told him that when lord pigot came to tanjore to restore him to his dominions comroo without being sent for or desired to come to the palace had found means to get access to his person he made an offer of introducing mr benfield to the rajah which he declined  being asked whether the military officer commanding there protected the rajah from the intrusion of such people he said the rajah did not tell him that he called upon the military officer to prevent these intrusions but that he desired colonel harper to be present as a witness to what might pass between him and mr benfield  being asked if it is usual for persons of the conditions and occupations of mr benfield and comroo to intrude themselves into the presence of the princes of the country and to treat them with such freedom he said certainly it is not less there than in any other country  being asked whether the king of tanjore has no ministers to whom application might be made to transact such business as mr benfield and comroo had to do in the country he said undoubtedly his minister is the person whose province it is to transact that business  being asked before the invasion of the british troops into tanjore what would have been the consequence if mr benfield had intruded himself into the rajahs presence and behaved in that manner he said he could not say what would have been the consequence but the attempt would have been madness and could not have happened  being asked whether the rajah had not particular exceptions to comroo and thought he had betrayed him in very essential points he said yes he had  being asked whether the rajah has not been apprised that the company have made stipulations that their servants should not interfere in the concerns of his government he said he signified it to the rajah that it was the companys positive orders and that any of their servants so interfering would incur their highest displeasure  appendix no   referred to from p    etc commissioners amended clauses for the fort st george dispatch relative to the indeterminate rights and pretensions of the nabob of arcot and rajah of tanjore in our letter of the   th january last we stated the reasonableness of our expectation that certain contributions toward the expenses of the war should be made by the rajah of tanjore since writing that letter we have received one from the rajah of the   th of october last which contains at length his representations of his inability to make such further payment we think it unnecessary here to discuss whether these representations are or are not exaggerated because from the explanations we have given of our wishes for a new arrangement in future both with the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore and the directions we have given you to carry that arrangement into execution we think it impolitic to insist upon any demands upon the rajah for the expenses of the late war beyond the sum of four lacks of pagodas annually such a demand might tend to interrupt the harmony which should prevail between the company and the rajah and impede the great objects of the general system we have already so fully explained to you  but although it is not our opinion that any further claim should be made on the rajah for his share of the extraordinary expenses of the late war it is by no means our intention in any manner to affect the just claim which the nabob has on the rajah for the arrears due to him on account of peshcush for the regular payment of which we became guarantee by the treaty of      but we have already expressed to you our hopes that the nabob may be induced to allow these arrears and the growing payments when due to be received by the company and carried in discharge of his debt to us you are at the same time to use every means to convince him that when this debt shall be discharged it is our intention as we are bound by the above treaty to exert ourselves to the utmost of our power to insure the constant and regular payment of it into his own hands  we observe by the plan sent to us by our governor of fort st george on the  0th october      that an arrangement is there proposed for the receipt of those arrears from the rajah in three years  we are unable to decide how far this proposal may be consistent with the present state of the rajahs resources but we direct you to use all proper means to bring these arrears to account as soon as possible consistently with a due attention to this consideration  clauses h you will observe that by the   th section of the late act of parliament it is enacted that for settling upon a permanent foundation the present indeterminate rights of the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore with respect to each other we should take into our immediate consideration the said indeterminate rights and pretensions and take and pursue such measures as in our judgment and discretion shall be best calculated to ascertain and settle the same according to the principles and the terms and stipulations contained in the treaty of      between the said nabob and the said rajah  on a retrospect of the proceedings transmitted to us from your presidency on the subject of the disputes which have heretofore arisen between the nabob and the rajah we find the following points remain unadjusted viz   st whether the jaghire of arnee shall be enjoyed by the nabob or delivered up either to the rajah or the descendants tremaul row the late jaghiredar   d whether the fort and district of hanamantagoody which is admitted by both parties to be within the marawar ought to be possessed by the nabob or to be delivered up by him to the rajah   d to whom the government share of the crop of the tanjore country of the year       properly belongs  lastly whether the rajah has a right by usage and custom or ought from the necessity of the case to be permitted to repair such part of the annacut or dam and banks of the cavery as lie within the district of trichinopoly and to take earth and sand in the trichinopoly territory for the repairs of the dam and banks within either or both of those districts  in order to obtain a complete knowledge of the facts and circumstances relative to the several points in dispute and how far they are connected with the treaty of      we have with great circumspection examined into all the materials before us on these subjects and will proceed to state to you the result of our enquiries and deliberations  the objects of the treaty of      appear to be restricted to the arrears of tribute to be paid to the nabob for his past claims and to the quantum of the rajahs future tribute or peshcush the cancelling of a certain bond given by the rajahs father to the father of the nabob the confirmation to the rajah of the districts of coveladdy and elangaud and the restoration of tremaul row to his jaghire of arnee in condescension to the rajahs request upon certain stipulations viz that the fort of arnee and doby gudy should be retained by the nabob that tremaul row should not erect any fortress walled pagodas or other strong hold nor any wall round his dwelling house exceeding eight feet high or two feet thick and should in all things behave himself with due obedience to the government and that he should pay yearly in the month of july unto the nabob or his successors the sum of ten thousand rupees the rajah thereby becoming the security for tremaul row that he should in all things demean and behave himself accordingly and pay yearly the stipulated sum  upon a review of this treaty the only point now in dispute which appears to us to be so immediately connected with it as to bring it within the strict line of our duty to ascertain and settle according to the terms and stipulations of the treaty is that respecting arnee for although the other points enumerated may in some respects have a relation to that treaty yet as they are foreign to the purposes expressed in it and could not be in the contemplation of the contracting parties at the time of making it those disputes cannot in our comprehension fall within the line of description of rights and pretensions to be now ascertained and settled by us according to any of the terms and stipulations of it  in respect to the jaghire of arnee we do not find that our records afford us any satisfactory information by what title the rajah claims it or what degree of relationship or connection has subsisted between the rajah and the kelledar of arnee save only that by the treaty of      the former became the surety for tremaul rows performance of his engagements specified therein as the conditions for his restoration to that jaghire on the death of tremaul row we perceive that he was succeeded by his widow and after her death by his grandson seneevasorow both of whom were admitted to the jaghire by the nabob  from your minutes of consulation of the   st october    0 and the nabobs letter to the president of the   st march      and the two letters from rajah beerbur atchener punt who we presume was then the nabobs manager at arcot of the   th and   th march referred to in the nabobs letter and transmitted therewith to the president we observe that previous to the treaty of      mr pigot concurred in the expediency of the nabobs taking possession of this jaghire on account of the troublesome and refractory behavior of the arnee braminees by their affording protection to all disturbers who by reason of the little distance between arnee and arcot fled to the former and were there protected and not given up though demanded  that though the jaghire was restored in      it was done under such conditions and restrictions as were thought best calculated to preserve the peace and good order of the place and due obedience to government  that nevertheless the braminees quarrelling among themselves did afterward in express violation of the treaty enlist and assemble many thousand sepoys and other troops that they erected gaddies and other small forts provided themselves with wall pieces small guns and other warlike stores and raised troubles and disturbances in the neighborhood of the city of arcot and the forts of arnee and shaw gaddy and that finally they imprisoned the hircarrahs of the nabob sent with his letters and instructions in pursuance of the advice of your board to require certain of the braminees to repair to the nabob of chepauk and though peremptorily required to repair thither paid no regard to those or to any other orders from the circar  by the   th article contained in the instructions given by the nabob to mr dupre as the basis for negotiating the treaty made with the rajah in      the nabob required that the arnee district should be delivered up to the circar because the braminees had broken the conditions which they were to have observed in the answers given by the rajah to these propositions he says i am to give up to the circar the jaghire district of arnee and on the  th of november      the rajah by letter to seneewasorow who appears by your consultations and country correspondence to have been the grandson of tremaul row and to have been put in possession of the jaghire at your recommendation on the death of his grandmother writes acquainting him that he had given the arnee country then in his seneewasarows possession to the nabob to whose aumildars seneewasarow was to deliver up the possession of the country and in your letter to us of the   th february      you certified the district of arnee to be one of the countries acquired by this treaty and to be of the estimated value of two lacks of rupees per annum  in our orders dated the   th april      we declared our determination to replace the rajah upon the throne of his ancestors upon certain terms and conditions to be agreed upon for the mutual benefit of himself and the company without infringing the rights of the nabob we declared that our faith stood pledged by the treaty of      to obtain payment of the rajahs tribute to the nabob and that for the ensuring such payment the fort of tanjore should be garrisoned by our troops we directed that you should pay no regard to the article of the treaty of      which respected the alienation of part of the rajahs dominions and we declared that if the nabob had not a just title to those territories before the conclusion of the treaty we denied that he obtained any right thereby except such temporary sovereignty for securing the payment of his expenses as is therein mentioned  these instructions appear to have been executed in the month of april      and by your letter of the   th may following you certified to us that the rajah had been put into the possession of the whole country his father held in      when the treaty was concluded with the nabob but we do not find that you came to any resolution either antecedent or subsequent to this advice either for questioning or impeaching the right of the nabob to the sovereignty of arnee or expressive of any doubt of his title to it nevertheless we find that although the board passed no such resolution yet your president in his letter to the nabob of the  0th july and   th august called upon his highness to give up the possession of arnee to the rajah and the rajah himself in several letters to us particularly in those of   st october      and the  th of june      expressed his expectation of our orders for delivering up that fort and district to him and so recently as the   th of october      he reminds us of his former application and states that the country of arnee being guaranteed to him by the company it of course is his right but that it has not been given up to him and he therefore earnestly entreats our orders for putting him into the possession of it we also observe by your letter of the   th of october      that the rajah had not then accounted for the nabobs peshcush since his restoration but had assigned as a reason for his withdrawing it that the nabob had retained from him the district of arnee with a certain other district hanamantagoody which is made the subject of another part of our present dispatches  we have thus stated to you the result of our enquiry into the grounds of the dispute relative to arnee and as the research has offered no evidence in support of the rajahs claim nor even any lights whereby we can discover in what degree of relationship by consanginuity cast or other circumstances the rajah now stands or formerly stood with the killidar of arnee or the nature of his connection with or command over that district or the authority he exercised or assumed previous to the treaty of      we should think ourselves highly reprehensible in complying with the rajahs request and the more so as it is expressly stated in the treaty of      that this fort and district were then in the possession of the nabob as well as the person of the jaghiredar on account of his disobedience and were restored to him by the nabob in condescension to the rajahs request upon such terms and stipulations as could not in our judgment have been imposed by the one or submitted to by the other if the sovereignty of the one or the dependency of the other had been at that time a matter of doubt  although these materials have not furnished us with evidence in support of the rajahs claim they are far from satisfactory to evince the justice of or the political necessity for the nabobs continuing to withhold the jaghire from the descendants of tremaul row his hereditary right to that jaghire seems to us to have been fully recognized by the stipulations of the treaty of      and so little doubted that on his death his widow was admitted by the nabob to hold it on account as may be presumed of the nonage of his grandson and heir seneewasarow who appears to have been confirmed in the jaghire on her death by the nabob as the lineal heir and successor to his grandfather  with respect to seneewasarow it does not appear by any of the proceedings in our possession that he was concerned in the misconduct of the braminees complained of by the nabob in the year    0 which rendered it necessary for his highness to take the jaghire into his own hands or that he was privy to or could have prevented those disturbances  we therefore direct that if the heir of tremaul row is not at present in possession of the jaghire and has not by any violation of the treaty or act of disobedience incurred a forfeiture thereof he be forthwith restored to the possession of it according to the terms and stipulations of the treaty of      but if any powerful motive of regard to the peace and tranquillity of the carnatic shall in your judgment render it expedient to suspend the execution of these orders in that case you are with all convenient speed to transmit to us your proceedings thereupon with the full state of the facts and of the reasons which have actuated your conduct  we have before given it as our opinion that the stipulations of the treaty of      do not apply to the points remaining to be decided but the late act of parliament having from the nature of our connection with the two powers in the carnatic pointed out the expediency and even necessity of settling the several matters in dispute between them by a speedy and permanent arrangement we now proceed to give you our instructions upon the several other heads of disputes before enumerated  with respect to the fort and district of hanamantagoody we observe that on the restoration of the rajah in      you informed us in your letter of the   th of may  that the rajah had been put into possession of the whole of the country his father held in      when the treaty was concluded with the nabob and on the   th of june you came to the resolution of putting the rajah into posession of hanamantagoody on the ground of its appearing on reference to the nabobs instructions to mr dupre in june      to his reply and to the rajahs representations of   th march      that hanamantagoody was actually in the hands of the late rajah at the time of making the treaty of      we have referred as well to those papers as to all the other proceedings on this subject and must confess they fall very short of demonstrating to us the truth of that fact and we find by the secret consultations of fort william of the  th of august      that the same doubt was entertained by our governor general and council  but whether in point of fact the late rajah was or was not in possession of hanamantagoody in      it is notorious that the nabob had always claimed the dominion of the countries of which this fort and district are a part  we observe that the nabob is now in the actual possession of this fort and district and we are not warranted by any document we have seen to concur with the wishes of the rajah to dispossess him  with regard to the government share of the crop of       we observe by the dobeers memorandum recited in your consultations of the   th of may      that it was the established custom of the tanjore country to gather in the harvest and complete the collections within the month of march but that for the causes therein particularly stated the harvest and of course the collection of the government share of the crop was delayed till the month of march was over we also observe that the rajah was not restored to his kingdom until the   th of april      and from hence we infer that if the harvest and collection had been finished at the usual time the nabob being then sovereign of the country would have received the full benefit of that years crop  although the harvest and collection were delayed beyond the usual time yet we find by the proceedings of your government and particularly by mr mackays minute of the   th of may      and also by the dobeers account that the greatest part of the grain was cut down whilst the nabob remained in the government of the country  it is difficult from the contradictory allegations on the subject to ascertain what was the precise amount of the collections made after the nabob ceased to have the possession of the country but whatever it was it appears from general stuarts letter of the  d of april      that it had been asserted with good authority that the far greater part of the government share of the crop was plundered by individuals and never came to account in the rajahs treasury  under all the circumstances of this case we must be of opinion that the government share of the crop of      belonged to the nabob as the then reigning sovereign of the kingdom of tanjore he being de facto in the full and absolute possession of the government thereof and consequently that the assignments made by him of the government share of the crop were valid  nevertheless we would by no means be understood by this opinion to suggest that any further demands ought to be made upon the rajah in respect of such parts of the government share of the crop as were collected by his people  for on the contrary after so great a length of time as has elapsed we should think it highly unjust that the rajah should be now compelled either to pay the supposed balances whatever they may be or be called upon to render a specific account of the collection made by his people  the rajah has already in his letter to governor stratton of the   st of april      given his assurance that the produce of the preceding year accounted for to him was little more than one lack of pagodas and as you have acquainted us by your letter of the   th of october      that the rajah has actually paid into our treasury one lack of pagodas by way of deposit on account of the nabobs claims to the crop till our sentiments should be known we direct you to surcease any further demands from the rajah on that account  we learn by the proceedings and particularly by the nabobs letter to lord pigot of the  th of july      that the nabob previous to the restoration of the rajah actually made assignments or granted tuncaws of the whole of his share of the crop to his creditors and troops and that your government entertaining the same opinion as we do upon the question of right to that share by letter to the rajah of the  0th august      recommended to him to restore to mr benfield one of the principal assignees or tuncawholders of the nabob the grain of the last year which was in possession of his people and said to be forcibly taken from them and further to give mr benfield all reasonable assistance in recovering such debts as should appear to have been justly due to him from the inhabitants and acquainted the rajah that it had been judged by a majority of the council that it was the companys intention to let the nabob have the produce of the crop of      but that you had no intention that the rajah should be accountable for more than the government share whatever that might be and that you did not mean to do more than recommend to him to see justice done leaving the manner and time to himself subsequent representations appear to have been made to the rajah by your government on the same subject in favor of the nabobs mortgages  in answer to these applications the rajah in his letter to mr stratton of the   th january      acquainted you that he had given orders respecting the grain which mr benfield had heaped up in his country and with regard to the money due to him by the farmers that he had desired mr benfield to bring accounts of it that he might limit a time for the payment of it proportionably to their ability and that the necessary orders for stopping this money out of the inhabitants share of the crop had been sent to the ryots and aumildars that mr benfields gomastah was then present there and oversaw his affairs and that in every thing that was just he the rajah willingly obeyed our governor and council  our opinion being that the rajah ought to be answerable for no more than the amount of what he admits was collected by his people for the government share of the crop and the proceedings before us not sufficiently explaining whether in the sum which the rajah by his beforementioned letter of the   st april      admits to have collected are included those parts of the government share of the crop which were taken by his people from mr benfield or from any other of the assignees or tuncawholders and uninformed as we also are what compensation the rajah has or has not made to mr benfield or any other of the parties from whom the grain was taken by the rajahs people or whether by means of the rajahs refusal so to do or from any other circumstances any of the persons dispossessed of their grain may have had recourse to the nabob for satisfaction we are for these reasons incompetent to form a proper judgment what disposition ought in justice to be made of the one lack of pagodas deposited by the rajah but as our sentiments and intentions are so fully expressed upon the whole subject we presume you who are upon the spot can have no doubt or difficulty in making such an application of the deposit as will be consistent with those principles of justice whereon our sentiments are founded but should any such difficulty suggest itself you will suspend any application of the deposit until you have fully explained the same to us and have received our further orders  with respect to the repairs of annacut and banks of the cavery we have upon various occasions fully expressed to you our sentiments and in particular in our general letter of the  th july      we referred you to the investigation and correspondence on that subject of the year      and to the report made by mr james bourchier on his personal survey of the waters and to several letters of the year      and      we also by our said general letter acquainted you that it appeared to us perfectly reasonable that the rajah should be permitted to repair those banks and the annacut in the same manner as had been practiced in times past and we directed you to establish such regulations by reference to former usage for keeping the said banks in repair as would be effectual and remove all cause of complaint in future  notwithstanding such our instructions the rajah in his letter to us of the   th october      complains of the destruction of the annacut and as the cultivation of the tanjore country appears by all the surveys and reports of our engineers employed on that service to depend altogether on a supply of water by the cavery which can only be secured by keeping the annacut and banks in repair we think it necessary to repeat to you our orders of the  th july      on the subject of those repairs  and further as it appears by the survey and report of mr pringle that those repairs are attended with a much heavier expense when done with materials taken from the tanjore district than with those of trichinopoly and that the lastmentioned materials are far preferable to the other it is our order that if any occurrences should make it necessary or expedient you apply to the nabob in our name to desire that his highness will permit proper spots of ground to be set out and bounded by proper marks on the trichinopoly side where the rajah and his people may at all times take sand and earth sufficient for these repairs and that his highness will grant his lease of such spots of land for a certain term of years to the company at a reasonable annual rent to the intent that through you the cultivation of the tanjore country may be secured without infringing or impairing the rights of the nabob  if any attempts have been or shall be hereafter made to divert the water from the cavery into the coleroon by contracting the current of the upper or lower cavery by planting long grass as mentioned in mr pringles report or by any other means we have no doubt his highness on a proper representation to him in our name will prevent his people from taking any measures detrimental to the tanjore country in the prosperity of which his highness as well as the company is materially interested  should you succeed in reconciling the nabob to this measure we think it but just that the proposed lease shall remain no longer in force than whilst the rajah shall be punctual in the payment of the annual peshcush to the nabob as well as the rent to be reserved for the spots of ground and in order effectually to remove all future occasions of jealousy and complaint between the parties that the rajah on the one hand may be satisfied that all necessary works for the cultivation of his country will be made and kept in repair and that the nabob on the other hand may be satisfied that no encroachment on his rights can be made nor any works detrimental to the fertility of his country erected we think it proper that it should be recommended to the parties as a part of the adjustment of this very important point that skilful engineers appointed by the company be employed at the rajahs expense to conduct all the necessary works with the strictest attention to the respective rights and interests of both parties this will remove every probability of injury or dispute but should either party unexpectedly conceive themselves to be injured immediate redress might be obtained by application to the government of madras under whose appointment the engineer will act without any discussion between the parties which might disturb that harmony which it is so much the wish of the company to establish and preserve as essential to the prosperity and peace of the carnatic  having now in obedience to the directions of the act of parliament upon the fullest consideration of the indeterminate rights and pretensions of the nabob and rajah pointed out such measures and arrangements as in our judgment and discretion will be best calculated to ascertain and settle the same we hope that upon a candid consideration of the whole system although each of the parties may feel disappointed in our decision on particular points they will be convinced that we have been guided in our investigation by principles of strict justice and impartiality and that the most anxious attention has been paid to the substantial interests of both parties and such a general and comprehensive plan of arrangements proposed as will most effectually prevent all future dissatisfaction  approved by the board henry dundas walsingham w w grenville mulgrave  whitehall oct         appendix no   referred to from p    etc extract of a letter from the court of directors to the president and council of fort st george as amended and approved by the board of control we have taken into our consideration the several advices and papers received from india relative to the assignment of the revenues of the carnatic from the conclusion of the bengal treaty to the date of your letter in october      together with the representations of the nabob of the carnatic upon that subject and although we might contend that the agreement should subsist till we are fully reimbursed his highnesss proportion of the expenses of the war yet from a principle of moderation and personal attachment to our old ally his highness the nabob of the carnatic for whose dignity and happiness we are ever solicitous and to cement more strongly if possible that mutual harmony and confidence which our connection makes so essentially necessary for our reciprocal safety and welfare and for removing from his mind every idea of secret design on our part to lessen his authority over the internal government of the carnatic and the collection and administration of its revenues we have resolved that the assignment shall be surrendered and we do accordingly direct our president in whose name the assignment was taken without delay to surrender the same to his highness but while we have adopted this resolution we repose entire confidence in his highness that actuated by the same motives of liberality and feelings of old friendship and alliance he will cheerfully and instantly accede to such arrangements as are necessary to be adopted for our common safety and for preserving the respect rights and interests we enjoy in the carnatic the following are the heads and principles of such an arrangement as we are decisively of opinion must be adopted for these purposes viz  that for making a provision for discharging the nabobs just debts to the company and individuals for the payment of which his highness has so frequently expressed the greatest solicitude the nabob shall give soucar security for the punctual payment by instalments into the companys treasury of twelve lacks of pagodas per annum as voluntarily proposed by his highness until those debts with interest shall be discharged and shall also consent that the equitable provision lately made by the british legislature for the liquidation of those debts and such resolutions and determinations as we shall hereafter make under the authority of that provision for the liquidation and adjustment of the said debts bona fide incurred shall be carried into full force and effect  should any difficulty arise between his highness and our government of fort st george in respect to the responsibility of the soucar security or the times and terms of the instalments it is our pleasure that you pay obedience to the orders and resolutions of our governor general and council of bengal in respect thereto not doubting but the nabob will in such case consent to abide by the determination of our said supreme government  although from the great confidence we repose in the honor and integrity of the nabob and from an earnest desire not to subject him to any embarrassment on this occasion we have not proposed any specific assignment of territory or revenue for securing the payments aforesaid we nevertheless think it our duty as well to the private creditors whose interests in this respect have been so solemnly entrusted to us by the late act of parliament as from regard to the debt due to the company to insist on a declaration that in the event of the failure of the security proposed or in default of payment at the stipulated periods we reserve to ourselves full right to demand of the nabob such additional security by assignment on his country as shall be effectual for answering the purposes of the agreement  after having conciliated the mind of the nabob to this measure and adjusted the particulars you are to carry the same into execution by a formal deed between his highness and the company according to the tenor of these instructions  as the administration of the british interests and connections in india has in some respects assumed a new shape by the late act of parliament and a general peace in india has been happily accomplished the present appears to us to be the proper period and which cannot without great imprudence be omitted to settle and arrange by a just and equitable treaty a plan for the future defense and protection of the carnatic both in time of peace and war on a solid and lasting foundation  for the accomplishment of this great and necessary object we direct you in the name of the company to use your utmost endeavors to impress the expediency of and the good effects to be derived from this measure so strongly upon the minds of the nabob and the rajah of tanjore as to prevail upon them jointly or separately to enter into one or more treaty or treaties with the company grounded on this principle of equity that all the contracting parties shall be bound to contribute jointly to the support of the military force and garrisons as well in peace as in war  that the military peace establishment shall be forthwith settled and adjusted by the company in pursuance of the authority and directions given to them by the late act of parliament  as the payments of the troops and garrisons occasional expenses in the repairs and improvements of fortifications and other services incidental to a military establishment must of necessity be punctual and accurate no latitude of personal assurance or reciprocal confidence of either of the parties on the other be accepted or required but the nabob and rajah must of necessity specify particular districts and revenues for securing the due and regular payment of their contributions into the treasury of the company with whom the charge of the defense of the coast and of course the power of the sword must be exclusively entrusted with power for the company in case of failure or default of such payments at the stipulated times and seasons to enter upon and possess such districts and to let the same to renters to be confirmed by the nabob and the rajah respectively but trusting that in the execution of this part of the arrangement no undue obstruction will be given by either of those powers we direct that this part of the treaty be coupled with a most positive assurance on our part of our determination to support the dignity and authority of the nabob and rajah in the exclusive administration of the civil government and revenues of their respective countries and further that in case of any hostility committed against the territories of either of the contracting parties on the coast of coromandel the whole revenues of their respective territories shall be considered as one common stock to be appropriated in the common cause of their defense  that the company on their part shall engage to refrain during the war from the application of any part of their revenues to any commercial purposes whatsoever but apply the whole save only the ordinary charges of their civil government to the purposes of the war  that the nabob and the rajah shall in like manner engage on their parts to refrain during the war from the application of any part of their revenues save only what shall be actually necessary for the support of themselves and the civil government of their respective countries to any other purposes than that of defraying the expenses of such military operations as the company may find it necessary to carry on for the common safety of their interests on the coast of coromandel  and to obviate any difficulties or misunderstanding which might arise from leaving indeterminate the sum necessary to be appropriated for the civil establishment of each of the respective powers that the sum be now ascertained which is indispensably necessary to be applied to those purposes and which is to be held sacred under every emergency and set apart previous to the application of the rest of the revenues as hereby stipulated for the purposes of mutual or common defense against any enemy for clearing the encumbrance which may have become necessarily incurred in addition to the expenditure of those revenues which must be always deemed part of the war establishment this we think absolutely necessary as nothing can tend so much to the preservation of peace and to prevent the renewal of hostilities as the early putting the finances of the several powers upon a clear footing and the showing to all other powers that the company the nabob and the rajah are firmly united in one common cause and combined in one system of permanent and vigorous defense for the preservation of their respective territories and the general tranquillity  that the whole aggregate revenue of the contracting shall during the war be under the application of the company and shall continue as long after the war as shall be necessary to discharge the burdens contracted by it but it must be declared that this provision shall in no respect extend to deprive either the nabob or the rajah of the substantial authority necessary to the collection of the revenues of their respective countries but it is meant that they should faithfully perform the conditions of this arrangement and if a division of any part of the revenues to any other than the stipulated purposes shall take place the company shall be entitled to take upon themselves the collection of the revenue  the company are to engage during the time they shall administer the revenues to produce to the other contracting parties regular accounts of the application thereof to the purposes stipulated by the treaty and faithfully apply them in support of the war  and lastly as the defense of the carnatic is thus to rest with the company the nabob shall be satisfied of the propriety of avoiding all unnecessary expense and will therefore agree not to maintain a greater number of troops than shall be necessary for the support of his dignity and the splendor of the durbar which number shall be specified in the treaty and if any military aid is requisite for the security and collection of his revenues other than the fixed establishment employed to enforce the ordinary collections and preserve the police of the country the company must be bound to furnish him with such aid the rajah of tanjore must likewise become bound by similar engagements and be entitled to similar aid  as in virtue of the powers vested in lord macartney by the agreement of december      sundry leases of various periods have been granted to renters we direct that you apply to the nabob in our name for his consent that they may permitted to hold their leases to the end of the stipulated term for the ground of this great reliance see the papers in this appendix beginning p    as also the nabobs letters to the court of directors in this appendix  and we have great reliance on the liberality and spirit of accommodation manifested by the nabob on so many occasions that he will be disposed to acquiesce in a proposition so just and reasonable but if contrary to our expectations his highness should be impressed with any particular aversion to comply with this proposition we do not desire you to insist upon it as an essential part of the arrangement to take place between us but in that event you must take especial care to give such indemnification to the renters for any loss they may sustain as you judge to be reasonable  it equally concerns the honor of our government that such natives as may have been put in any degree of authority over the collections in consequence of the deed of assignment and who have proved faithful to their trust shall not suffer inconvenience on account of their fidelity  having thus given our sentiments at large as well for the surrender of the assignment as with regard to those arrangements which we think necessary to adopt in consequence thereof we cannot dismiss this subject without expressing our highest approbation of the ability moderation and command of temper with which our president at madras has conducted himself in the management of a very delicate and embarrassing situation his conduct and that of the select committee of fort st george in the execution of the trust delegated to lord macartney by the nabob mahomed ally has been vigorous and effectual for the purpose of realizing as great a revenue at a crisis of necessity as the nature of the case admitted and the imputation of corruption suggested in some of the proceedings appears to be totally groundless and unwarranted  while we find so much to applaud it is with regret we are induced to advert to any thing which may appear worthy of blame as the step of issuing the torana chits in lord macartneys own name can only be justified upon the ground of absolute necessity for the full proof of this necessity lord macartneys whole correspondence on the subject may be referred to without the act here condemned not one of the acts commended in the preceding paragraph could be performed by referring to the nabobs letters in this appendix it will be seen what sort of task a governor has on his hands who is to use according to the direction of this letter acts of address civility and conciliation and to pay upon all occasions the highest attention to persons who at the very time are falsely and in the grossest terms accusing him of peculation corruption treason and every species of malversation in office the recommendation under menaces of such behavior and under such circumstances conveys a lesson the tendency of which cannot be misunderstood  and as his lordship had every reason to believe that the demand when made would be irksome and disagreeable to the feelings of mahomed ally every precaution ought to have been used and more time allowed for proving that necessity by previous acts of address civility and conciliation applied for the purposes of obtaining his authority to such a measure it appears to us that more of this might have been used and therefore we cannot consider the omission of it as blameless consistent with our wishes of sanctifying no act contrary to the spirit of the agreement or derogatory to the authority of the nabob of the carnatic in the exercise of any of his just rights in the government of the people under his authority  we likewise observe the nabob has complained that no official communication was made to him of the peace for near a month after the cessation of arms took place this and every other mark of disrespect to the nabob will ever appear highly reprehensible in our eyes and we direct that you do upon all occasions pay the highest attention to him and his family  lord macartney in his minute of the  th of september last has been fully under our consideration we shall ever applaud the prudence and foresight of our servants which induces them to collect and communicate to us every opinion or even ground of suspicion they may entertain relative to any of the powers in india with whose conduct our interest and the safety of our settlements is essentially connected at the same time we earnestly recommend that those opinions and speculations be communicated to us with prudence discretion and all possible secrecy and the terms in which they are conveyed be expressed in a manner as little offensive as possible to the powers whom they may concern and into whose hands they may fall the delicacy here recommended in the expressions concerning conduct with which the safety of our settlements is essentially connected is a lesson of the same nature with the former dangerous designs if truly such ought to be expressed according to their nature and qualities and as for the secrecy recommended concerning the designs here alluded to nothing can be more absurd as they appear very fully and directly in the papers published by the authority of the court of directors in      and may be easily discerned from the propositions for the bengal treaty published in the reports of the committee of secrecy and in the reports of the select committee the keeping of such secrets too long has been one cause of the carnatic war and of the ruin of our affairs in india   we next proceed to give you our sentiments respecting the private debts of the nabob and we cannot but acknowledge that the origin and justice both of the loan of      and the loan of      commonly called the cavalry loan appear to us clear and indisputable agreeable to the true sense and spirit of the late act of parliament  in speaking of the loan of      we are to be understood as speaking of the debt as constituted by the original bonds of that year bearing interest at l 0 per cent and therefore if any of the nabobs creditors under a pretense that their debts made part of the consolidated debt of      although secured by bonds of a subsequent date carrying an interest exceeding l  0 per cent shall claim the benefit of the following orders we direct that you pay no regard to such claims without our further especial instructions for that purpose  with respect to the consolidated debt of      it certainly stands upon a less favorable footing so early as the   th of march      it was ordered by our then president and council of fort st george that for the preventing all persons living under the companys protection from having any dealings with any of the country powers or their ministers without the knowledge or consent of the board an advertisement should be published by fixing it up at the seagate and sending round a copy to the companys servants and inhabitants and to the different subordinates and our garrisons and giving it out in general orders stating therein that the president and council did consider the irreversible order of the court of directors of the year      whereby their people were prohibited from having any dealings with the country governments in money matters to be in full force and vigor and thereby expressly forbidding all servants of the company and other europeans under their jurisdiction to make loans or have any money transactions with any of the princes or states in india without special license and permission of the president and council for the time being except only in the particular cases there mentioned and declaring that any wilful deviation therefrom should be deemed a breach of orders and treated as such and on the  th of march      it was resolved by our president and council of fort st george that the consolidated debt of      was not on any respect whatever conducted under the auspices or protection of that government and on the circumstance of the consolidation of the said debt being made known to us we did on the   d of december      write to you in the following terms your account of the nabobs private debts is very alarming but from whatever cause or causes those debts have been contracted or increased we hereby repeat our orders that the sanction of the company be on no account given to any kind of security for the payment or liquidation of any part thereof except by the express authority of the court of directors on any account or pretense whatever  the loan of      therefore has no sanction or authority from us and in considering the situation and circumstances of this loan we cannot omit to observe that the creditors could not be ignorant how greatly the affairs of the nabob were at that time deranged and that his debt to the company was then very considerable the payment of which the parties took the most effectual means to postpone by procuring an assignment of such specific revenues for the discharge of their own debts as alone could have enabled the nabob to have discharged that of the company  under all these circumstances we should be warranted to refuse our aid or protection in the recovery of this loan but when we consider the inexpediency of keeping the subject of the nabobs debts longer afloat than is absolutely necessary when we consider how much the final conclusion of this business will tend to promote tranquillity credit and circulation of property in the carnatic and when we consider that the debtor concurs with the creditor in establishing the justice of those debts consolidated in      into gross sums for which bonds were given liable to be transferred to persons different from the original creditors and having no share or knowledge of the transactions in which the debts originated and of course how little ground there is to expect any substantial good to result from an unlimited investigation into them we have resolved so far to recognize the justice of those debts as to extend to them that protection which upon more forcible grounds we have seen cause to allow to the other two classes of debts but although we so far adopt the general presumption in their favor as to admit them to a participation in the manner hereafter directed we do not mean to debar you from receiving any complaints against those debts of      at the instance either of the nabob himself or of other creditors injured by their being so admitted or by any other persons having a proper interest or stating reasonable grounds of objection and if any complaints are offered we order that the grounds of all such be attentively examined by you and be transmitted to us together with the evidence adduced in support of them for our final decision and as we have before directed that the sum of twelve lacks of pagodas to be received annually from the nabob should be paid into our treasury it is our order that the same be distributed according to the following arrangement  that the debt be made up in the following manner viz  the debt consolidated in      to be made up to the end of the year      with the current interest at ten per cent  the cavalry loan to be made up to the same period with the current interest at    per cent  the debt consolidated in      to be made up to the same period with the current interest at    per cent to november      and from thence with the current interest at   per cent  the    lacks annually to be received are then to be applied    to the growing interest on the cavalry loan at    per cent    to the growing interest on the debt of      at   per cent  the remainder to be equally divided one half to be applied to the extinction of the companys debt the other half to be applied to the payment of growing interest at l 0 per cent and toward the discharge of the principal of the debt of       this arrangement to continue till the principal of the debt      is discharged  the application of the    lacks is then to be    to the interest of the debt      as above the remainder to be then equally divided one half toward the discharge of the current interest and principal of the cavalry loan and the other half toward the discharge of the companys debt  when the cavalry loan shall be thus discharged there shall then be paid toward the discharge of the companys debt seven lacks  to the growing interest and capital of the      loan   lacks  when the companys debt shall be discharged the whole is then to be applied in discharge of the debt       if the nabob shall be prevailed upon to apply the arrears and growing payments of the tanjore peishcush in further discharge of his debts over and above the    lacks of pagodas we direct that the whole of that payment when made shall be applied toward the reduction of the companys debt  we have laid down these general rules of distribution as appearing to us founded on justice and the relative circumstances of the different debts and therefore we give our authority and protection to them only on the supposition that they who ask our protection acquiesce in the condition upon which it is given and therefore we expressly order that if any creditor of the nabob a servant of the company or being under our protection shall refuse to express his acquiescence in these arrangements he shall not only be excluded from receiving any share of the fund under your distribution but shall be prohibited from taking any separate measures to recover his debt from the nabob it being one great inducement to our adopting this arrangement that the nabob shall be relieved from all further disquietude by the importunities of his individual creditors and he left at liberty to pursue those measures for the prosperity of his country which the embarrassments of his situation have hitherto deprived him of the means of exerting and we further direct that if any creditor shall be found refractory or disposed to disturb the arrangement we have suggested he shall be dismissed the service and sent home to england  the directions we have given only apply to the three classes of debts which have come under our observation it has been surmised that the nabob has of late contracted further debts if any of these are due to british subjects we forbid any countenance or protection whatever to be given to them until the debt is fully investigated the nature of it reported home and our special instructions upon it received  we cannot conclude this subject without adverting in the strongest terms to the prohibitions which have from time to time issued under the authority of different courts of directors against any of our servants or of those under our protection having any money transactions with any of the country powers without the knowledge and previous consent of our respective governments abroad we are happy to find that the nabob sensible of the great embarrassments both to his own and the companys affairs which the enormous amount of their private claims have occasioned is willing to engage not to incur any new debts with individuals and we think little difficulty will be found in persuading his highness into a positive stipulation for that purpose and though the legislature has thus humanely interfered in behalf of such individuals as might otherwise have been reduced to great distress by the past transactions we hereby in the most pointed and positive terms repeat our prohibition upon this subject and direct that no person being a servant of the company or being under our protection shall on any pretense whatever be concerned in any loan or other money transaction with any of the country powers unless with the knowledge and express permission of our respective governments and if any of our servants or others being under our protection shall be discovered in any respect counteracting these orders we strictly enjoin you to take the first opportunity of sending them home to england to be punished as guilty of disobedience of orders and no protection or assistance of the company shall be given for the recovery of any loans connected with such transactions your particular attention to this subject is strictly enjoined and any connivance on your parts to a breach of your orders upon it will incur our highest displeasure  in order to put an end to those intrigues which have been so successfully carried on at the nabobs durbar we repeat our prohibition in the strongest terms respecting any intercourse between british subjects and the nabob and his family as we are convinced that such an intercourse has been carried on greatly to the detriment and expense of the nabob and merely to the advantage of individuals we therefore direct that all persons who shall offend against the letter or spirit of this necessary order whether in the companys service or under their protection be forthwith sent to england  approved by the board henry dundas walsingham w w grenville mulgrave  whitehall   th oct      extract from the representation of the court of directors of the east india company my lords and gentlemen it is with extreme concern that we express a difference of opinion with your right honorable board in this early exercise of your controuling power but in so novel an institution it can scarce be thought extraordinary if the exact boundaries of our respective functions and duties should not at once on either side be precisely and familiarly understood and therefore confide in your justice and candor for believing that we have no wish to evade or frustrate the salutary purposes of your institution as we on our part are thoroughly satisfied that you have no wish to encroach on the legal powers of the east india company we shall proceed to state our objections to such of the amendments as appear to us to be either insufficient inexpedient or unwarranted   th concerning the private debts of the nabob of arcot and the application of the fund of    lacks of pagodas per annum under this head you are pleased in lieu of our paragraphs to substantiate at once the justice of all those demands which the act requires us to investigate subject only to a right reserved to the nabob or any other party concerned to question the justice of any debt falling within the last of the three classes we submit that at least the opportunity of questioning within the limited time the justice of any of the debts ought to have been fully preserved and supposing the first and second classes to stand free from imputation as we incline to believe they do no injury can result to individuals from such discussion and we further submit to your consideration how far the express direction of the act to examine the nature and origin of the debts has been by the amended paragraphs complied with and whether at least the rate of interest according to which the debts arising from soucar assignment of the land revenues to the servants of the company acting in the capacity of native bankers have been accumulated ought not to be enquired into as well as the reasonableness of the deduction of    per cent which the bengal government directed to be made from a great part of the debts on certain conditions but to your appropriation of the fund our duty requires that we should state our strongest dissent our right to be paid the arrears of those expenses by which almost to our own ruin we have preserved the country and all the property connected with it from falling a prey to a foreign conqueror surely stands paramount to all claims for former debts upon the revenues of a country so preserved even if the legislature had not expressly limited the assistance to be given the private creditors to be such as should be consistent with our own rights the nabob had long before passing the act by treaty with our bengal government agreed to pay us   lacks of pagodas as part of the    lacks in liquidation of those arrears of which   lacks the arrangement you have been pleased to lay down would take away from us more than the half and give it to private creditors of whose demands there are only about a sixth part which do not stand in a predicament that you declare would not entitle them to any aid or protection from us in the recovery thereof were it not upon grounds of expediency as will more particularly appear by the annexed estimate until our debt shall be discharged we can by no means consent to give up any part of the   lacks to the private creditors and we humbly apprehend that in this declaration we do not exceed the limits of the authority and rights vested in us  the right honorable the commissioners for the affairs of india the representation of the court of directors of the east india company my lords and gentlemen the court having duly attended to your reasonings and decisions on the subjects of arnee and hanamantagoody beg leave to observe with due deference to your judgment that the directions we had given in these paragraphs which did not obtain your approbation still appear to us to have been consistent with justice and agreeable to the late act of parliament which pointed out to us as we apprehended the treaty of      as our guide  signed by order of the said court those morton secy east india house the  d november      extract of letter from the commissioners for the affairs of india to the court of directors dated  d november      in answer to their remonstrance sixth article we think it proper considering the particular nature of the subject to state to you the following remarks on that part of your representation which relates to the plan for the discharge of the nabobs debts   st you compute the revenue which the carnatic may be expected to produce only at twenty lacks of pagodas if we concurred with you in this opinion we should certainly feel our hopes of advantage to all the parties from this arrangement considerably diminished but we trust that we are not too sanguine on this head when we place the greatest reliance on the estimate transmitted to you by your president of fort st george having there the best means of information upon the fact and stating it with a particular view to the subject matter of these paragraphs some allowance we are sensible must be made for the difference of collection in the nabobs hands but we trust not such as to reduce the receipt nearly to what you suppose   dly in making up the amount of the private debts you take in compound interest at the different rates specified in our paragraph this it was not our intention to allow and lest any misconception should arise on the spot we have added an express direction that the debts be made up with simple interest only from the time of their respective consolidation clause f f   dly we have also the strongest grounds to believe that the debts will be in other respects considerably less than they are now computed by you and consequently the companys annual proportion of the twelve lacks will be larger than it appears on your estimate but even on your own statement of it if we add to the l  0000 or    000 pagodas which you take as the annual proportion to be received by the company for five years to the end of      the annual amount of the tanjore peshcush for the same period and the arrears on the peshcush proposed by lord macartney to be received in three years the whole will make a sum not falling very short of pagodas   00000 the amount of pagodas  00000 per annum for the same period and if we carry our calculations farther it will appear that both by the plan proposed by the nabob and adopted in your paragraphs and by that which we transmitted to you the debt from the nabob if taken at l  000000 will be discharged nearly at the same period viz in the course of the eleventh year we cannot therefore be of opinion that there is the smallest ground for objecting to this arrangement as injurious to the interests of the company even if the measure were to be considered on the mere ground of expediency and with a view only to the wisdom of reestablishing credit and circulation in a commercial settlement without any consideration of those motives of attention to the feelings and honor of the nabob of humanity to individuals and of justice to persons in your service and living under your protection which have actuated the legislature and which afford not only justifiable but commendable grounds for your conduct  impressed with this conviction we have not made any alteration in the general outlines of the arrangement which we had before transmitted to you but as the amount of the nabobs revenue is matter of uncertain conjecture and as it does not appear just to us that any deficiency should fall wholly on any one class of these debts we have added a direction to your government of fort st george that if notwithstanding the provisions contained in our former paragraphs any deficiency should arise the payments of what shall be received shall be made in the same proportion which would have obtained in the division of the whole twelve lacks had they been paid  appendix no  0 referred to from p    the following extracts are subjoined to show the matter and the style of representation employed by those who have obtained that ascendency over the nabob of arcot which is described in the above letter and is so totally destructive of the authority and credit of the lawful british government at madras the charges made by these persons have been solemnly denied by lord macartney and to judge from the character of the parties accused and accusing they are probably void of all foundation but as the letters are in the name and under the signature of a person of great rank and consequence among the natives as they contain matter of the most serious nature as they charge the most enormous crimes and corruptions of the grossest kind on a british governor and as they refer to the nabobs minister in great britain for proof and further elucidation of the matters complained of common decency and common policy demanded an enquiry into their truth or falsehood the writing is obviously the product of some english pen if on enquiry these charges should be made good a thing very unlikely the party accused would become a just object of animadversion if they should be found as in all probability they would be found false and calumnious and supported by forgery then the censure would fall on the accuser at the same time the necessity would be manifest for proper measures toward the security of government against such infamous accusations it is as necessary to protect the honest fame of virtuous governors as it is to punish the corrupt and tyrannical but neither the court of directors nor the board of control have made any enquiry into the truth or falsehood of these charges they have covered over the accusers and accused with abundance of compliments they have insinuated some oblique censures and they have recommended perfect harmony between the chargers of corruption and peculation and the persons charged with these crimes    th october      extract of a translation of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the chairman of the court of directors of the east india company fatally for me and for the public interest the companys favor and my unbounded confidence have been lavished on a man totally unfit for the exalted station in which he has been placed and unworthy of the trusts that have been reposed in him when i speak of one who has so deeply stabbed my honor my wounds bleed afresh and i must be allowed that freedom of expression which the galling reflection of my injuries and my misfortunes naturally draw from me shall your servants unchecked unrestrained and unpunished gratify their private views and ambition at the expense of my honor my peace and my happiness and to the ruin of my country as well as of all your affairs no sooner had lord macartney obtained the favorite object of his ambition than he betrayed the greatest insolence toward me the most glaring neglect of the common civilities and attentions paid me by all former governors in the worst of times and even by the most inveterate of my enemies he insulted my servants endeavored to defame my character by unjustly censuring my administration and extended his boundless usurpation to the whole government of my dominions in all the branches of judicature and police and in violation of the express articles of the agreements proceeded to send renters into the countries unapproved of by me men of bad character and unequal to my management or responsibility though he is chargeable with the greatest acts of cruelty even to the shedding the blood and cutting off the noses and ears of my subjects by those exercising his authority in the countries and that even the duties of religion and public worship have been interrupted or prevented and though he carries on all his business by the arbitrary exertion of military force yet does he not collect from the countries one fourth of the revenue that should be produced the statement he pretends to hold forth of expected revenue is totally fallacious and can never be realized under the management of his lordship in the appointment of renters totally disqualified rapacious and irresponsible who are actually embezzling and dissipating the public revenues that should assist in the support of the war totally occupied by his private views and governed by his passions he has neglected or sacrificed all the essential objects of public good and by want of cooperation with sir air coote and refusal to furnish the army with the necessary supplies has rendered the glorious and repeated victories of the gallant general ineffectual to the expulsion of our cruel enemy to cover his insufficiency and veil the discredit attendant on his failure in every measure he throws out the most illiberal expressions and institutes unjust accusations against me and in aggravation of all the distresses imposed upon me he has abetted the meanest calumniators to bring forward false charges against me and my son ameerulomrah in order to create embarrassment and for the distress of my mind my papers and writings sent to you must testify to the whole world the malevolence of his designs and the means that have been used to forward them he has violently seized and opened all letters addressed to me and my servants on my public and private affairs my vackeel that attended him according to ancient custom has been ignominiously dismissed from his presence and not suffered to approach the governmenthouse he has in the meanest manner and as he thought in secret been tampering and intriguing with my family and relations for the worst of purposes and if i express the agonies of my mind under these most pointed injuries and oppressions and complain of the violence and injustice of lord macartney i am insulted by his affected construction that my communications are dictated by the insinuations of others at the same time that his conscious apprehensions for his misconduct have produced the most abject applications to me to smother my feelings and entreaties to write in his lordships favor to england and to submit all my affairs to his direction when his submissions have failed to mould me to his will he has endeavored to effect his purposes by menaces of his secret influence with those in power in england which he pretends to assert shall be effectual to confirm his usurpation and to deprive me and my family in succession of my rights of sovereignty and government for ever to such a length have his passions and violences carried him that all my family my dependants and even my friends and visitors are persecuted with the strongest marks of his displeasure every shadow of authority in my person is taken from me and respect to my name discouraged throughout the whole country when an officer of high rank in his majestys service was some time since introduced to me by lord macartney his lordship took occasion to show a personal derision and contempt of me mr richard sulivan who has attended my durbar under the commission of the governor general and council of bengal has experienced his resentment and mr benfield with whom i have no business and who as he has been accustomed to do for many years has continued to pay me his visits of respect has felt the weight of his lordships displeasure and has had every unmerited insinuation thrown out against him to prejudice him and deter him from paying me his compliments as usual  thus gentlemen have you delivered me over to a stranger to a man unacquainted with government and business and too opinionated to learn to a man whose ignorance and prejudices operate to the neglect of every good measure or the liberal cooperation with any that wish well to the public interests to a man who to pursue his own passions plans and designs will certainly ruin all mine as well as the companys affairs his mismanagement and obstinacy have caused the loss of many lacks of my revenues dissipated and embezzled and every public consideration sacrificed to his vanity and private views i beg to offer an instance in proof of my assertions and to justify the hope i have that you will cause to be made good to me all the losses i have sustained by the maladministration and bad practices of your servants according to all the account of receipts of former years and which i made known to lord macartney amongst other papers of information in the beginning of his management in the collections the district of ongole produced annually upon a medium of many years ninety thousand pagodas but lord macartney upon receiving a sum of money from ramchundry see tellinga letter at the end of this correspondence let it out to him in april last for the inadequate rent of  0000 pagodas per annum diminishing in this district alone near half the accustomed revenues after this manner has he exercised his powers over the countries to suit his own purposes and designs and this secret mode has he taken to reduce the collection   st november      copy of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the court of directors etc  received  th april      the distresses which i have set forth in my former letters are now increased to such an alarming pitch by the imprudent measures of your governor and by the arbitrary and impolitic conduct pursued with the merchants and importers of grain that the very existence of the fort of madras seems at stake and that of the inhabitants of the settlement appears to have been totally overlooked many thousands have died and continue hourly to perish of famine though the capacity of one of your youngest servants with diligence and attention by doing justice and giving reasonable encouragement to the merchants and by drawing the supplies of grain which the northern countries would have afforded might have secured us against all those dreadful calamities i had with much difficulty procured and purchased a small quantity of rice for the use of myself my family and attendants and with a view of sending off the greatest part of the latter to the northern countries with a little subsistence in their hands but what must your surprise be when you learn that even this rice was seized by lord macartney with a military force and thus am i unable to provide for the few people i have about me who are driven to such extremity and misery that it gives me pain to behold them i have desired permission to get a little rice from the northern countries for the subsistence of my people without its being liable to seizure by your sepoys this even has been refused me by lord macartney what must your feelings be on such wanton cruelty exercised toward me when you consider that of thousands of villages belonging to me a single one would have sufficed for my subsistence    d march      translation of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the chairman and directors of the east india company  received from mr james mpherson  st january      i am willing to attribute this continued usurpation to the fear of detection in lord macartney he dreads the awful day when the scene of his enormities will be laid open at my restoration to my country and when the tongues of my oppressed subjects will be unloosed and proclaim aloud the cruel tyrannies they have sustained these sentiments of his lordships designs are corroborated by his sending on the  0th instant two gentlemen to me and my son ameerulomrah and these gentlemen from lord macartney especially set forth to me and to my son that all dependence on the power of the superior government of bengal to enforce the intentions of the company to restore my country was vain and groundless that the company confided in his lordships judgment and discretion and upon his representations and that if i and my son ameerulomrah would enter into friendship with lord macartney and sign a paper declaring all my charges and complaints against him to be false that his lordship might be induced to write to england that all his allegations against me and my son were not well founded and notwithstanding his declarations to withold my country yet on these considerations it might be still restored to me  what must be your feelings for your ancient and faithful friend on his receiving such insults to his honor and understanding from your principal servant armed with your authority from these maneuvers amongst thousands i have experienced the truth must evidently appear to you that i have not been loaded with those injuries and oppressions from motives of public service but to answer the private views and interests of his lordship and his secret agents some papers to this point are enclosed others almost without number must be submitted to your justice when time and circumstances will enable me fully to investigate those transactions this opportunity will not permit the full representation of my load of injuries and distresses i beg leave to refer you to my minister mr macpherson for the papers according to the enclosed list which accompanied my last dispatches by the rodney which i fear have failed and my correspondence with lord macartney subsequent to that period such as i have been able to prepare for this opportunity are enclosed  notwithstanding all the violent acts and declarations of lord macartney yet a consciousness of his own misconduct was the sole incentive to the menaces and overtures he has held out in various shapes he has been insultingly lavish in his expressions of high respect for my person has had the insolence to say that all his measures flowed from his affectionate regard alone has presumed to say that all his enmity and oppression were levelled at my son ameerulomrah to whom he before acknowledged every aid and assistance and his lordship being without any just cause or foundation for complaint against us or a veil to cover his own violences he has now had recourse to the meanness and has dared to intimate of my son in order to intimidate me and to strengthen his own wicked purposes to be in league with our enemies the french you must doubtless be astonished no less at the assurance than at the absurdity of such a wicked suggestion  in the nabobs own hand p s in my own handwriting i acquainted mr hastings as i now do my ancient friends the company with the insult offered to my honor and understanding in the extraordinary propositions sent to me by lord macartney through two gentlemen on the  0th instant so artfully veiled with menaces hopes and promises but how can lord macartney add to his enormities after his wicked and calumniating insinuations so evidently directed against me and my family through my faithful my dutiful and beloved son ameerulomrah who you well know has been ever born and bred amongst the english whom i have studiously brought up in the warmest sentiments of affection and attachment to them sentiments that in his maturity have been his highest ambition to improve insomuch that he knows no happiness but in the faithful support of our alliance and connection with the english nation    th august and postscript of the   th august      translation of a letter to the chairman and directors of the east india company  received from mr james mpherson   th january      your astonishment and indignation will be equally raised with mine when you hear that your president has dared contrary to your intention to continue to usurp the privileges and hereditary powers of the nabob of the carnatic your old and unshaken friend and the declared ally of the king of great britain  i will not take up your time by enumerating the particular acts of lord macartneys violence cruelty and injustice they indeed occur too frequently and fall upon me and my devoted subjects and country too thick to be regularly related i refer you to my minister mr james mpherson for a more circumstantial account of the oppressions and enormities by which he has brought both mine and the companys affairs to the brink of destruction i trust that such flagrant violations of all justice honor and the faith of treaties will receive the severest marks of your displeasure and that lord macartneys conduct in making use of your name and authority as a sanction for the continuance of his usurpation will be disclaimed with the utmost indignation and followed by the severest punishment i conceive that his lordships arbitrary retention of my country and government can only originate in his insatiable cravings in his implacable malevolence against me and through fear of detection which must follow the surrender of the carnatic into my hands of those nefarious proceedings which are now suppressed by the arm of violence and power  i did not fail to represent to the supreme government of bengal the deplorable situation to which i was reduced and the unmerited persecutions i have unremittingly sustained from lord macartney and i earnestly implored them to stretch forth a saving arm and interpose that controuling power which was vested in them to check rapacity and presumption and preserve the honor and faith of the company from violation the governor general and council not only felt the cruelty and injustice i had suffered but were greatly alarmed for the fatal consequences that might result from the distrust of the country powers in the professions of the english when they saw the nabob of the carnatic the friend of the company and the ally of great britain thus stripped of his rights his dominions and his dignity by the most fraudulent means and under the mask of friendship the bengal government had already heard both the mharattas and the nizam urge as an objection to an alliance with the english the faithless behavior of lord macartney to a prince whose life had been devoted and whose treasures had been exhausted in their service and support and they did not hesitate to give positive orders to lord macartney for the restitution of my government and authority on such terms as were not only strictly honorable but equally advantageous to my friends the company for they justly thought that my honor and dignity and sovereign rights were the first objects of my wishes and ambition but how can i paint my astonishment at lord macartneys presumption in continuing his usurpation after their positive and reiterated mandates and as if nettled by their interference which he disdained in redoubling the fury of his violence and sacrificing the public and myself to his malice and ungovernable passions  i am gentlemen at a loss to conceive where his usurpation will stop and have an end has he not solemnly declared that the assignment was only made for the support of war and if neither your instructions nor the orders of his superiors at bengal were to be considered as effectual has not the treaty of peace virtually determined the period of his tyrannical administration but so far from surrendering the carnatic into my hands he has since that event affixed advertisements to the walls and gates of the black town for letting to the best bidder the various districts for the term of three years and has continued the committee of revenue which you positively ordered to be abolished to whom he has allowed enormous salaries from  000 to  000 pagodas per annum which each member has received from the time of his appointment though his lordship well knows that most of them are by your orders disqualified by being my principal creditors  if those acts of violence and outrage had been productive of public advantage i conceive his lordship might have held them forward in extenuation of his conduct but whilst he cloaks his justification under the veil of your secret records it is impossible to refute his assertions or to expose to you their fallacy and when he is no longer able to support his conduct by argument he refers to those records where i understand he has exercised all his sophistry and malicious insinuations to render me and my family obnoxious in the eyes of the company and the british nation and when the glorious victories of sir air coote have been rendered abortive by a constant deficiency of supplies and when since the departure of that excellent general to bengal whose loss i must ever regret a dreadful famine at the close of last year occasioned by his lordships neglect to lay up a sufficient stock of grain at a proper season and from his prohibitory orders to private merchants and when no exertion has been made nor advantage gained over the enemy when hyders death and tippoos return to his own dominions operated in no degree for the benefit of our affairs in short when all has been a continued series of disappointment and disgrace under lord macartneys management and in him alone has the management been vested i want words to convey those ideas of his insufficiency ignorance and obstinacy which i am convinced you would entertain had you been spectators of his ruinous and destructive conduct  but against me and my son ameerulomrah has his lordships vengeance chiefly been exerted even the companys own subordinate zemindars have found better treatment probably because they were more rich those of nizanagoram have been permitted contrary to your pointed orders to hold their rich zemindaries at the old disproportionate rate of little more than a sixth part of the real revenue and my zemindar of tanjore though he should have regarded himself equally concerned with us in the event of the war and from whose fertile country many valuable harvests have been gathered in which have sold at a vast price has i understand only contributed last year toward the public exigencies the very inconsiderable sum of one lack of pagodas and a few thousand pagodasworth of grain  i am much concerned to acquaint you that ever since the peace a dreadful famine has swept away many thousands of the followers and sepoys families of the army from lord macartneys neglect to send down grain to the camp though the roads are crowded with vessels but his lordship has been too intent upon his own disgraceful schemes to attend to the wants of the army the negotiation with tippoo which he has set on foot through the mediation of monsieur bussy has employed all his thoughts and to the attainment of that object he will sacrifice the dearest interests of the company to gratify his malevolence against me and for his own private advantages the endeavor to treat with tippoo through the means of the french must strike you gentlemen as highly improper and impolitic but it must raise your utmost indignation to hear that by intercepted letters from bussy to tippoo as well as from their respective vakeels and from various accounts from cudalore we have every reason to conclude that his lordships secretary mr staunton when at cudalore as his agent to settle the cessation of arms with the french was informed of all their operations and projects and consequently that lord macartney has secretly connived at monsieur bussys recommendation to tippoo to return into the carnatic as the means of procuring the most advantageous terms and furnishing lord macartney with the plea of necessity for concluding a peace after his own manner and what further confirms the truth of this fact is that repeated reports as well as the alarms of the inhabitants to the westward leave us no reason to doubt that tippoo is approaching toward us his lordship has issued public orders that the garrison store of rice for which we are indebted to the exertions of the bengal government should be immediately disposed of and has strictly forbid all private grain to be sold by which act he effectually prohibits all private importation of grain and may eventually cause as horrid a famine as that which we experienced at the close of last year from the same shortsighted policy and destructive prohibitions of lord macartney  but as he has the fabrication of the records in his own hands he trusts to those partial representations of his character and conduct because the signatures of those members of government whom he seldom consults are affixed as a public sanction but you may form a just idea of their correctness and propriety when you are informed that his lordship upon my noticing the heavy disbursements made for secret service money ordered the sums to be struck off and the accounts to be erased from the cashbook of the company and i think i cannot give you a better proof of his management of my country and revenues than by calling your attention to his conduct in the ongole province and by referring you to his lordships administration of your own jaghire from whence he has brought to the public account the sum of twelve hundred pagodas for the last years revenue yet blazons forth his vast merits and exertions and expects to receive the thanks of his committee and council  i will beg leave to refer you to my minister james macpherson esquire for a more particular account of my sufferings and miseries to whom i have transmitted copies of all papers that passed with his lordship  i cannot conclude without calling your attention to the situation of my different creditors whose claims are the claims of justice and whose demands i am bound by honor and every moral obligation to discharge it is not therefore without great concern i have heard insinuations tending to question the legality of their right to the payment of those just debts they proceeded from advances made by them openly and honorably for the support of my own and the public affairs but i hope the tongue of calumny will never drown the voice of truth and justice and while that is heard the wisdom of the english nation cannot fail to accede to an effectual remedy for their distresses by any arrangement in which their claims may be duly considered and equitably provided for and for this purpose my minister mr macpherson will readily subscribe in my name to any agreement you may think proper to adopt founded on the same principles with either of the engagements i entered into with the supreme government of bengal for our mutual interest and advantage  i always pray for your happiness and prosperity   th september and postscript of  th september      translation of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the chairman and directors of the east india company  received from mr james mpherson   th january      i refer you gentlemen to my enclosed duplicate as well as to my minister mr mpherson for the particulars of my sufferings there is no word or action of mine that is not perverted and though it was my intention to have sent my son ameerulomrah who is well versed in my affairs to bengal to impress those gentlemen with a full sense of my situation yet i find myself obliged to lay it aside from the insinuations of the calumniating tongue of lord macartney that takes every license to traduce every action of my life and that of my son i am informed that lord macartney at this late moment intends to write a letter i am ignorant of the subject but fully perceive that by delaying to send it till the very eve of the dispatch he means to deprive me of all possibility of communicating my reply and forwarding it for the information of my friends in england conscious of the weak ground on which he stands he is obliged to have recourse to these artifices to mislead the judgment and support for a time his unjustifiable measures by deceit and imposition i wish only to meet and combat his charges and allegations fairly and openly and i have repeatedly and urgently demanded to be furnished with copies of those parts of his fabricated records relative to myself but as he well knows i should refute his sophistry i cannot be surprised at his refusal though i lament that it prevents you gentlemen from a clear investigation of his conduct toward me  enclosed you have a translate of an arzee from the killidar of vellore i have thousands of the same kind but this just now received will serve to give you some idea of the miseries brought upon this my devoted country and the wretched inhabitants that remain in it by the oppressive hand of lord macartneys management nor will the embezzlements of collections thus obtained when brought before you in proof appear less extraordinary which shall certainly be done in due time  translation of an arzee in the persian language from uzzeem ul done cawn the killidar of vellore to the nabob dated  st september      enclosed in the nabobs letter to the court of directors september      i have repeatedly represented to your highness the violences and oppressions exercised by the present amildar collector of revenue of lord macartneys appointment over the few remaining inhabitants of the district of vellore ambore saulguda etc  the outrages and violences now committed are of that astonishing nature as were never known or heard of during the administration of the circar hyder naik the cruelest of tyrants used every kind of oppression in the circar countries but even his measures were not like those now pursued such of the inhabitants as had escaped the sword and pillage of hyder naik by taking refuge in the woods and within the walls of vellore etc on the arrival of lord macartneys amildar to vellore and in consequence of his cowle of protection and support they most cheerfully returned to the villages set about the cultivation of the lands and with great pains rebuilt their cottages  but now the amildar has imprisoned the wives and children of the inhabitants seized the few jewels that were on the bodies of the women and then before the faces of their husbands flogged them in order to make them produce other jewels and effects which he said they had buried somewhere under ground and to make the inhabitants bring him money notwithstanding there was yet no cultivation in the country  terrified with the flagellations some of them produced their jewels and wearing apparel of their women to the amount of ten or fifteen pagodas which they had hidden others who declared they had none the amildar flogged their women severely tied cords around their breasts and tore the sucking children from their teats and exposed them to the scorching heat of the sun those children died as did the wife of ramsoamy an inhabitant of bringpoor even this could not stir up compassion in the breast of the amildar some of the children that were somewhat large he exposed to sale in short the violences of the amildar are so astonishing that the people on seeing the present situation remember the loss of hyder with regret with whomsoever the amildar finds a single measure of natehinee or rice he takes it away from him and appropriates it to the expenses of the sibindy that he keeps up no revenues are collected from the countries but from the effects of the poor wretched inhabitants those ryotts yeomen who intended to return to their habitations and hearing of those violences have fled for refuge with their wives and children into hyders country every day is ushered in and closed with these violences and disturbances i have no power to do any thing and who will hear what i have to say my business is to inform your highness who are my master the people bring their complaints to me and i tell them i will write to your highness the above recited practices or practices similar to them have prevailed in almost every part of the miserable countries on the coast of coromandel for near twenty years past that they prevailed as strongly and generally as they could prevail under the administration of the nabob there can be no question notwithstanding the assertion in the beginning of the above petition  nor will it ever be otherwise whilst affairs are conducted upon the principles which influence the present system whether the particulars here asserted are true or false neither the court of directors nor their ministry have thought proper to enquire if they are true in order to bring them to affect lord macartney it ought to be proved that the complaint was made to him and that he had refused redress instead of this fair course the complaint is carried to the court of directors  the following is one of the documents transmitted by the nabob in proof of his charge of corruption against lord macartney if genuine it is conclusive at least against lord macartneys principal agent and manager if it be a forgery as in all likelihood it is it is conclusive against the nabob and his evil counselors and fully demonstrates if any thing further were necessary to demonstrate the necessity of the clause in mr foxs bill prohibiting the residence of the native princes in the companys principal settlements which clause was for obvious reasons not admitted into mr pitts it shows too the absolute necessity of a severe and exemplary punishment on certain of his english evil counselors and creditors by whom such practices are carried on   translation of a tellinga letter from veira permaul head dubash to

you and am very well here wishing to hear frequently of your welfare  your peasher vancatroyloo has brought the visseel bakees and delivered them to me as also what you sent him for me to deliver to my master which i have done my master at first refused to take it because he is unacquainted with your disposition or what kind of a person you are but after i made encomiums on your goodness and greatness of mind and took my oath to the same and that it would not become public but be held as precious as our lives my master accepted it you may remain satisfied that i will get the ongole business settled in your name i will cause the jamaubundee to be settled agreeable to your desire it was formerly the nabobs intention to give this business to you as the governor knows full well but did not at that time agree to it which you must be well acquainted with  your peasher vancatroyloo is a very careful good man  he is well experienced in business  he has bound me by an oath to keep all this business secret and that his own yours and my lives are responsible for it i write this letter to you with the greatest reluctance and i signified the same to your peasher and declared that i would not write to you by any means to this the peasher urged that if i did not write to his master how could he know to whom he the peasher delivered the money and what must his master think of it therefore i write you this letter and send it by my servant ramanah accompanied by the peashers servant and it will come safe to your hands after perusal you will send it back to me immediately  until i receive it i dont like to eat my victuals or take any sleep your peasher took his oath and urged me to write this for your satisfaction and has engaged to me that i shall have this letter returned to me in the space of twelve days  the present governor is not like the former governors  he is a very great man in europe  and all the great men of europe are much obliged to him for his condescension in accepting the government of this place it is his custom when he makes friendship with any one to continue it always and if he is at enmity with any one he never will desist till he has worked his destruction he is now exceedingly displeased with the nabob and you will understand by and by that the nabobs business cannot be carried on he the nabob will have no power to do any thing in his own affairs you have therefore no room to fear him you may remain with a contented mind  i desired the governor to write you a letter for your satisfaction the governor said he would do so when the business was settled this letter you must peruse as soon as possible and send it back with all speed by the bearer ramadoo accompanied by three or four of your people to the end that no accident may happen on the road these people must be ordered to march in the night only and to arrive here with the greatest dispatch you sent ten mangoes for my master and two for me which all i have delivered to my master thinking that ten was not sufficient to present him with i write this for your information and salute you with ten thousand respects  i muttu kistnah of madras patnam dubash
