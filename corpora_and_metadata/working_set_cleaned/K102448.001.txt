the babbler containing a careful selection from those entertaining and interesting essays which have given the public so much satisfaction under that title during a course of four years in owens weekly chronicle  vol i  london printed for j newbery in st pauls churchyard l hawes w clarke and r collins in paternoster row and j harrison opposite stationers hall m dcc lxvii  preface there is no subject in the world upon which an author speaks with a greater degree of latent pride or a deeper air of outward humility than his own productions  he is perfectly sensible that they are trifles  yet he is bold enough to publish them  and while he seems to relinquish every title to the favorable opinion of the world he returns his warmest thanks for past obligations and indirectly tells us he has obtained it  thus the public are reduced to the agreeable alternative either of acknowledging his merit or reflecting upon their own judgment  and the consequence generally is that through a fear of disparaging the credit of our taste or perspicuity we exalt him at once into a writer of consummate modesty and uncommon abilities  the author of the babbler however wishes to steer between the extremes of an ostentatious parade and an affected diffidence he would by no means presumptuously place his pieces upon a forum with the essays of some cotemporaries nor would he meanly sink them to the level of others  a firstrate reputation is no less beyond his hopes than his deserts yet if in the scale of honorable comparison he rises with no capital degree of merit he is satisfied that he cannot be the lowest in the balance of contempt  this declaration he is the more emboldened to make as during the course of his publication he constantly had the honor of being reprinted by the greatest number of his literary fellow laborers in the vineyard of the public and have been often happy enough to go through half a dozen editions in half the number of days  in the concluding number of these volumes the author has made some observations on the nature of essay writing in general and rendered it incontestibly evident that there is no walk of genius which lies under so many difficulties yet of all the various essayists the newspaper drudge is the most unfortunately circumstanced small as the boundaries of a spectator a rambler a world an adventurer or a connoisseur may seem the newspaper writer is under a necessity of moving in a still more contracted circle  the printer who on these occasions is a very great man does not so much consider the importance of a writers subject as the immediate profit of the partners it is not the improvement of the reader which he consults but the interest of the paper or the topic of the day and therefore often stints the essayist in room to advertise a parcel of stolen goods or to epitomize the trial of some remarkable murderer  i remember when the babbler was first undertaken i sent an essay to the press on which i had employed extraordinary pains and which i warmly imagined would have procured me at least a fortnights reputation  the subject of the essay was the absurdity of party distinctions but unhappily though i had endeavored to contract myself within the most moderate limits i had still exceeded the prudential bounds of the printer  he accordingly brought me back the manuscript and declared it could not possibly be inserted without undergoing some considerable amputations  it was in vain i argued with him on the importance of the subject the spirit of the writing and the credit it would certainly do his paper  the rogue was incorregibly dull and told me if i would have it in i must strike a pen through the king cut out lord bute and burn the people of england  these conditions were too hard to be complied with  and i rather chose to leave my admirable essay out entirely than mangle it to the taste of an unfeeling blockhead who appeared so glaringly callous to the beauties of a masterly production  circumscribed thus unhappily in my limits the reader of judgment will not be surprised at finding many subjects thrown frequently into little histories which otherwise situated i should have attempted to discuss on the methodical principles of a regular argument  as i had not room to enter into elaborate disquisitions it was my business to give the reader a little entertainment and my duty at least to amuse his fancy since i was unable to improve his understanding  the principal matter which the author thinks himself under a necessity of apologizing for is the similiarity which the reader will find in some of the subjects this was a circumstance which though the author was well aware it would expose him to the censure of the judicious he could not conveniently avoid as it was impossible to deliver himself fully on some points in a single paper he was under a necessity of resuming such as were most material to be discussed he flatters himself however that he will not be thought extremely reprehensible on this account since those who are satisfied with the mere superficials of a subject may easily escape the repetitions while those who expect any information by proceeding may as easily pardon the prolixity upon the whole there is nothing in the volumes now offered to the public for which the author could not urge some palliation but his excuses perhaps by trespasing on the readers patience at a time they cannot correct the minutest error in his performance will themselves stand in need of an apology he will therefore only add that tenderness in criticism is the next virtue to generosity and that he shall scarcely feel a greater share of gratitude for those who kindly discover any little merit in the following essays than for those who benevolently overlook their numerous imperfections  contents of the first volume numb i a general reflection on the choice of titles for a periodical essay and a description of bablers page   numb ii

babbler numb i saturday february    there is scarcely a little essayist nowadays who amuses the world under any particular title but gives himself airs of the greatest consequence and claims some degree of affinity with the tatler and spectator indeed where the itch of reading is nearly equal to the cacoethes scribendi a man has no great occasion to be possessed of either much genius or education to become a literary legislator and set himself up as a regulator of the public the most material article of all is the choice of a tolerable title to attract the attention of the reader and if this can be happily struck out learning and abilities are not so much as secondary considerations  in modern literature a motto is a matter of no little consequence and an author in the present anno domini can no more pretend to circulate his writings without a motto than without the assistance of the daily and evening papers many an industrious pedlar in the small wares of letters has got off an edition of his pamphlet without any other recommendation than the name and the motto and alarmed the world with a very terrible title page when the contents were as innocent as water gruel and insipid as a cold veal without either lemon or salt  in this universal pursuit after titles i do not esteem myself very unhapy in the choice of the babbler it is a character under which the generality of mankind are more or less distinguished and which is indiscriminately applicable to all orders and situations different people only differ in the manner but they are always sure of agreeing in essentials and the humble mechanic who harangues for the good of his country ever a solitary pint of porter is in fact no more a babbler than a personage of distinguished rank who talks about the national importance with all the usual ease and insipidity of distinction and importance  in reality the great business of mankind is babbling for if we place the principal happiness of society in conversation a very little regard to any company we may happen to sit with will convince us that the generality of our acquaintance are nothing more than bablers so very limited is the number which discourses nowadays with any inclination to improve or entertain that i dare say my readers will be surprised when i set down some of the most eminent names in the kingdom among the order of bablers  the word babbler being principally confined to verbal indiscretion and impertinence i shall employ the remaining part of this essay in giving my readers such particular description of the babbler that they can never be at a loss in the application of the term when they meet with any of my relations  whenever a person seems extremely earnest to engross the conversation of the company there can be no manner of doubt that he is a babbler  whenever a person is uncommonly liberal in the payment of unnecessary compliments the most extensive degree of goodnature cannot avoid setting him down a babbler  whenever a man is fond of remembering tedious and unentertaining stories and is apt to be put in mind of such and such a particular anecdote by some corresponding circumstance which may casually arise in conversation that man is by every manner of means a babbler  whenever we see a man making an unnecessary parade of his education and interlarding his discourse with technical terms or sentences not clearly understood in the language of dogberry set him down a  babbler  whenever we find a man fond of repeating his own jokes and desirous of telling the good thing he said to his friend jack such aone at such a time  down with him  a babbler  whenever we see any person ready to circulate the laugh at the expense of decency and good manners there is no occasion to hesitate in pronouncing him a babbler  whenever we meet with a man disposed to contradict for no other reason but to show the superiority of his own abilities  o a babbler a babbler and  when we hear him dispute upon a subject he is totally unacquainted with who can deny but he is a most consummate babbler  having thus given the outlines of a babbler any person with a very indifferent pencil may work up a striking likeness of the greatest number of his acquaintance for my own part like the rest of my brethren i shall speak of men and things as i find myself prompted by humor or inclination the only restriction i shall lay myself under is ever to have decency and candor in view and never entirely to lose sight of my little judgment and understanding  upon these principles i hope to entertain the public and should i fail in the attempt i must condole myself with a line of my friend horace  magnis tamen exidit ausis numb ii saturday february    in the variety of courses which the generality of mankind pursue for the attainment of happiness it is not a little surprising that they should be shamefully inattentive in one of the most material points that can possibly insure it  the point i mean is that union of the sexes which properly concluded is the foundation of felicity to individuals and of security to the public  nature has given every parent a power of directing the inclinations of their children but allows of no unreasonable authority to force them and such as have a sensible concern for the happiness of their offspring should be particularly careful that a reciprocal passion subsisted between the parties before they consented to an inviolable union  the illdirected tenderness of parental affection has often been productive of the most unhappy consequences and many a father has made his children miserable for life by a mistaken solicitude for their welfare and by making a provision for their happiness which was not in the least essential and for which they had not in all probability any manner of occasion  i am led naturally to this subject by a paper now lying before me the contents of which are here presented to the reader  to the babbler sir the wretch who is sentenced to die may escape and leave justice behind from his country perhaps he may fly but o  can he fly from his mind i am the most miserable of men and notwithstanding it might be more prudent to conceal the cause of my affliction i find an inclination to disclose it in this public manner too strongly to be resisted  i am a young fellow of five and twenty sir neither deformed in my person nor i hope unhappy in my temper my fortune is easy my education liberal and i suppose i am as well calculated to pass in a crowd as the generality of my acquaintance  about twelve months ago sir i fell passionately in love with a young lady whose beauty and merit entitled her to a rank much more exalted than what i could raise her to though she was much my inferior in point of fortune  she was at that time courted by a young gentleman in the law and matters had actually gone so far that a day was appointed for the solemnization of the nuptials  all this i was very well informed of yet impetuously hurried by the violence of my passion i disclosed it to the father  he was a man of the world  my circumstances were much better than his intended soninlaws and he paid a less attention to the happiness than he showed for the advancement of his daughter  why should i take up your time mr babbler marias match with her former lover was immediately broke off and the unhappy young lady who never presumed to disobey her fathers commands was torn from the man of her heart and married to one she could never love  i was in hope mr babbler that a little time and a tender behavior on my side as a man never loved more fondly than myself would have utterly erased mr bridgegrove from the bosom of my wife and placed me in his stead  but had i not been besotted with my love i might have easily known that a laudable impression upon the mind of a sensible woman is never to be eradicated  no mr babbler it is utterly impossible  when a young raw girl indeed entertains something like a regard for a man without knowing the reason of her esteem it is nothing but a struggle of desire or more properly speaking the wheyiness of inclination which in a little time she laughs at herself and as she grows in understanding easily skims off  but where a woman of sense has placed her affections on a man of merit the passion is never to be erased the more she ponders on his worth the more reason she has to love him and she can never cease to think of his perfections till she is wholly divested of thought  unhappily for me mr babbler this was the case mr bridgegrove possessed the whole heart of maria and in reality deserved it he is perhaps the most amiable of men and poor fellow loves her to distraction i have been now married mr babbler ten months and have i flatter myself expressed every act of tenderness proper for the lover or the husband but to no purpose my wife behaves with the utmost complaisance is uncommonly solicitous to please but this conduct is the effect of her good sense and not the consequence of her love the little endearing intercourses between husband and wife are suffered not enjoyed if i complain of her coldness she assumes an air more gay and affects to be pleased though i see the starting tear just bursting from her eye and know the grief that rankles at her heart nay the more i caress the more miserable she is made and i see her generously lamenting that she cannot place her heart upon the man that possesses her hand and is not utterly unworthy of her esteem o mr babbler he must have no delicay no feeling that can bear a circumstance like this unmoved how am i frequently torn to madness with reflection even when i have her fastened to my bosom to think her whole soul is at that very moment running on another man in her sleep she frequently throws one of her fine arms round my neck and pronounces the name of bridgegrove in a manner that distracts me our little boy for she is lately brought tobed instead of a blessing is another source of anxiety to us both i overheard her yesterday morning weeping over the child and crying my sweet boy poor bridgegrove should have been your father o mr babbler can any situation be so afflicting as mine  i have made the most amiable of women for ever wretched and torn a worthy young fellow from the mistress of his heart i have brought all my sorrows on myself with the distressful consideration of having no right to complain i deserve to be miserable the man who would meanly hope to be happy in marriage by sacrificing the inclination of the woman he loves and ungenerously loses every regard to her wishes while he endeavors to gratify his own has no pretension to felicity had i never obtained the possession of maria i should not have been half so wretched as i am now time and another object would perhaps have enabled me to bear her loss  but now master of her person to find another in possession of her heart and to know that there is one whom she holds considerably dearer than myself are considerations absolutely insupportable i cannot dwell any longer on the subject i shall therefore conclude with an advice to my own sex never to marry a woman whose heart they know is engaged nor to take a pitiful advantage of a fathers authority in opposition to her inclination if she be a good woman she can never forget her first choice and it she be bad will inevitably bring shame and scandal on the second  i am sir etc  numb iii saturday february    when i first commenced periodical essayist my fears presented a thousand difficulties to my imagination in the process of my design  i dreamed of incessant application to pen and ink and of continual visits from those very worthy gentlemen who are honored with the appellation of devils to the press but my apprehensions were entirely groundless  i no sooner appeared in print than a whole army of goodnatured persons instantly drew up in my favor amongst the rest the wife of a city man of fashion who writes to me after the following manner  to the babbler sir i am a haberdashers wife not very far from cornhill and though i never received any other education than what the english language could afford me or made a greater progress in my studies than the rule of three direct yet i can spell tolerably enough and though i say it know a sheeps head from a carrot as well as hodge in the new opera  but sir to the business of my letter  my husband and i sir are a young couple just set up in business and you know mr babbler as such ought to be extremely complaisant and respctful to our customers  in the way of trade every body who lays out a penny with us is to be considered as our superiors at least while they stay in our shop  but my husband who it seems is wiser than i am is quite of a contrary opinion  he never keeps his hat off a moment in the house  and behaves to every one as if he rather laid them under an obligation by the sale of his own commodities  if a lady steps in to buy a piece of ribband or a hat instead of showing her a variety of things that may fix her attention or induce her to make an additional purchase he talks to her about plays and about operas instead of saying these madam are the best pair of gloves in the kingdom he cries out to be sure mr garrick is the greatest actor in the world or to be sure miss brent is the finest singer in the universe  there is no bearing of him mr babbler  the fellow will prate a whole hour about shakespeare when he ought to be numbering up his threads and run himself out of breath in encomiums on otway when he ought to be busy in the praise of his handkerchiefs  but these are trifles mr babbler when compared to some other instances of his behavior  why sir he would not rise from dinner to serve the lady mayoress  at dinner time if he is told any person wants him about business  d  n it do they think he will get up from his dinner can they find no other time to come but when he is just sat down at table let them wait or call again which ever they think proper  ah mr babbler people that are in trade should get up from breakfast dinner and supper to attend the necessary duties of their profession  those who have no other dependence should think themselves happy in being called to their business at dinner time since it is by that means they are enabled to have any dinner at all  no later than wednesday last sir this attention to his stomach lost him a country order for a hundred pounds and even the deputy of our ward was kept waiting yesterday above ten minutes in the shop though he came to discharge a little account which was due for his wise and two daughters  as i am resolved now i have begun mr babbler to let you know all his faults i must inform you he has lately bought a horse and paid thirty guineas for this hopeful bargain  this horse he is to ride out every sunday if the weather be fine and he happens to have no engagement  it is odds mr babbler that he does not find a ride convenient once a month  or that something does not prevent his excursion even at the end of that period  but however let us suppose that the weather and accidental engagements will permit him to go out one sunday in four the stabling and provinder for his horse will at least amount to seven shillings a week  so that every time he takes a ride out horse hire will cost him eight and twenty shillings not to say any thing of the original purchase and for half the money be might get a hackney coach for the whole day to carry all his family  and here i cannot help reflecting mr babbler upon this injudicious practice of riding out even sunday which seems so much in fashion among the generality of our polite citizens  if a tradesman buys a horse and does not ride out every sunday his purchase becomes useless and his money thrown away  if he does he debars himself of every other enjoyment and cuts himself off from the only opportunity he has of attending the public worship of god  he is lost to his family and friends one day in seven and is an alien to his creator on the most sacred of them all  pray mr babbler print this letter  your writings are much read in our neighborhood and my husband himself condescends to say you are a very sensible sort of a fellow  if you should have any opportunity i beg you would speak something about the dress of tradesmen for i have some reason to think my husband has actually be spoke a laced hat and given the tailor directions to put vellum holes in his next suit of clothes  do oblige me dear mr babbler and i shall always acknowledge myself much  your humble servant winifred tapely  numb iv saturday march   of all the enemies to society there is none which should be held in a greater abhorrence than a man of gallantry professed and yet in this fashionable age it is a character which the generality of our young fellows and but too many of our old ones are uncommonly solicitous to obtain but the strongest invectives against this infamous disposition may not perhaps be half so serviceable as a little story which a very worthy gentleman of my acquaintance favored me with last night for which reason i shall lay aside declaration and proceed to my narrative  not many weeks ago at the first reduction of our forces among many other officers who were dismissed a young lieutenant one mr fransham received his discharge as the income of this gentlemans commission during his continuance in the army could not suffer him to lay by any mighty matters for an emergency his half pay would have been but a slender subsistence had not an old schoolfellow of his one mr harold a country gentleman made him a cordial offer of his house and table till he should be fortunately provided for in some reputable employ mr harold was the most amiable of men he had a handsome person a fine understanding an affluent fortune and a benevolent heart he had been but newly married to a young lady of whom he was passionately fond and who if wit and beauty were capable of constituting matrimonial felicity could not fail of making him the most happy of men  mr fransham was one of those people who professed a covent garden sort of knowledge and like a maggot in a cheese knew no part of the world but the rotten his conversation was lively but not improving and he carried the appearance of much understanding though in reality he had but little sense his company however was entertaining enough he talked of the polite diversions told a story tolerably well and sung with some voice and much taste as the flashiness of his conversation carried the appearance of wit mrs harold was not a little pleased with her new visitant and mr fransham from the first moment he came into the house had formed a design of rendering himself as agreeable as possible to her and without either being confined by the rules of friendship or the principles of gratitude he thought he could not be in reality a fine gentleman without endeavoring to alienate her affections from her husband  to dwell upon the circumstances is unnecessary he left no art unessayed to gain his point and in an evil hour too fatally succeeded  poor mr harold not in the least suspecting the nature of their intimacy was really pleased at the countenance shown to mr fransham by his wife every mark of complacency shown to that gentleman he looked upon as a particular instance of her affection for himself  but one evening returning from a visit which he had paid alone to a gentleman in his neighborhood considerably sooner than he was expected upon going up to mrs harolds chamber he found the door locked and fancied he heard her voice and mr franshams in a very familiar sort of conversation an instinctive kind of terror struck instantly to his heart  he knocked at the door which not being immediately unlocked he burst it open and just as he entered saw his perfidious friend escape out of the window into the garden frantic at this sight the violence of his passion prevented him from pursuing the infamous villain by whom he had been so barbarously wronged he gazed in a violent sit of horror for some time upon his wife who sat trembling on the bedside then running to a case of pistols which were kept generally in the bedchamber he snapt one of them at mrs harold and ran immediately after to find the partner of her crime but mr fransham knowing mr harolds temper too well to stay within his reach made such good use of his time that he was quite out of danger before the other began the pursuit  happily for mrs harold the pistol was not charged which was directed at her though the fright threw her into a swoon  but recovering and finding herself entirely safe she thought it most prudent to retire to a friends house for a little time till a reconciliation could be effected with her husband here she remained for about a month and tried every means of obtaining his forgiveness but to no purpose and the following letter which he wrote to her in his cooler moments put a total stop to any future attempts of that nature  by what name shall i distinguish you  or how shall i be able to write to a woman with any degree of temper whom i am born everlastingly to curse and detest  can you maria be mean enough to think of living with a man whom you have covered with disgrace or bear the eternal memento which his presence must give you of your own  that i did love  but wherefore do i dwell upon a circumstance which i must endeavor to obliterate for ever or mention the sincerity of my passion when i think upon the reward it has met  if i expect to be forgiven myself in the next world maria you conjure me to pardon your offenses in this  what a wretch must the man be who excuses a crime which the eye of all acquitting mercy cannot look upon without horror  if there are particular crimes which we are taught to believe heaven itself will not pardon can we suppose that there are not injuries which it is impossible for human nature ever to overlook  forgive you maria  oh that i could  my anguish would not be of that poignant nature which it is could the baseness of your conduct ever be forgot  see me  no  fly me as far as earth can part us for should we once meet i will not answer but that moment may be our last  as for the villain i cannot name him  to the most distant corner of the world i will pursue him he shall be an eternity a dying and yet if he feels half of what i suffer hell itself cannot possibly afflict him more  distraction choaks me i cannot proceed  if adultery if the violation of the most solemn vows given in the immediate presence of the living god is pardonable above i will not pray for your perdition  but should you again urge my temper by an insolent application for my pity  in some bitter moment of my soul perhaps i may be provoked to supplicate that the divine goodness may be as far from you as the compassion  of the wretched francis harold   the sequel of the story is  mrs harold through shame and remorse is pining at the house of a relation in the country and supposed to be in a very declining situation  as for fransham he escaped over into france but falling into a number of excesses reduced himself to the necessity of the road but being apprehended in his first robbery will in all probability if he escapes death be confined during life to the galleys mr harold is grown more composed and all his friends are busied in keeping up his spirits and with such success that it is hoped in a little time his tranquillity will be restored especially as they all carefully avoid mentioning a single syllable of mrs harold  we may conclude our little narrative with a few lines from rowes fair penitent  by these examples are we taught to prove what sad affects attend unlawful love death or some worse mischance will soon divide the wretched bridegroom from his guilty bride if you would have the nuptial union last let virtue be the bond that ties it fast numb v saturday march    it was a common expression of the late bolingbrokes that if he was but an hour in the company of a stranger and heard him speak but fifty words he could tell the particular turn or bias of his temper  when i consider the general propensry of mankind to enhance the idea of their own characters and reflect that there is a particular something in the opinion of every man which gives him an advantage over the rest of the world i am inclined to belive that his lordships declaration is not altogether so extraordinary as a person at first might possibly imagine it  in people of understanding the particular quality upon which they principally value themselves is rather easier to be discovered than in those of ordinary capacities because conversation taking a more liberal turn furnishes a greater number of opportunities to draw it out i was last night sitting with two or three friends who are not a little esteemed in the literary world when i immediately reflected upon lord bolingbrokes observation   one of them opened the discourse with a compliment to the abilities of mr pope and seemed intent to make that celebrated author the subject of conversation poetry he talked of as the first of all the sciences and consequently hinted that such as excelled in this were superior to the most eminent professors of any other it is almost needless to tell that my friend has himself published some pieces in this way of writing which are universally admired and that while he was expatiating on the merit of mr pope he had a secret intention of reminding us of his own character  this gentleman though a very sensible man carries his zeal for the poetical muse a little too far he looks upon every one with an eye of indifference who has not received some marks of that ladys favor and very lately refused a woman of ten thousand pounds who was passionately in love with him for no other reason in life than because she left the room about some domestic occurrence while he was reading an imitation of one of hraces odes which he had written it seems that morning  my poetical friend entertained us for some time when a mathematical acquaintance turned the discourse upon sir isaac newton in a little time my good friend dr nettletop beat sir isaac out of the field with boerhaave mr longwind the historian however quickly conquered boerhaave with rapin and the wide field of history itself was not long after covered by mr choleric the politician with the triumphs of his immortal king of prussia  but if so great a fondness of showing the particular qualification wherein we excel though it be a meritorious one is deserving of our censure how much more to be condemned are those sort of people who build their reputation upon trifles of the most ridiculous nature and are constantly taking up the time of every company they are admitted into with recitals of no consequence to themselves and no entertainment to any body else my cousin jack babbler gives me great offense this way jack particularly piques himself upon a very small stomach and an unconquerable aversion to a buttock of beef hence wherever he goes we are always sure of a dissertation upon eating the smallness of his appetite is a neverfailing source of conversation and i have known him to take up two hours and a half to convince a large company that he has not eat a pound of meat in a fortnight if by a revolution in his habit of body my poor cousin should unfortunately get a good stomach he must resign all pretension to merit and banish himself from society for the want of common conversation  but the most extraordinary character i ever know that was not absolutely vicious is my friend sir harry whimseys  sir harry has understanding and yet he only uses it to be a fool he has a fortune capable of providing all the pleasures of life and yet he is never happy till he is completely miserable  sir harry if he happens to be indisposed is a little easy in his mind but if he be really ill it is then he experiences the highest satisfaction his friends are all summoned and with an air of the utmost consequence told of his melancholy situation how the pain in his head has torn him to pieces and how he has not had a wink of sleep for three nights when he finds any concern expressed for his condition his pride begins to swell and the notion of his own importance increases in proportion to the pity of his friends and the danger of his disorder  he has been a man of very little merit however these three years for being naturally of a good constitution and not much addicted to intemperance of any nature he has unhappily escaped the smallest indisposition  the knowledge of these foibles in other people is of no advantage to us unless they teach us to correct whatever may be amiss of the same nature in ourselves the best of us have our little absurdities for which reason when we laugh at the peculiarities of our acquaintance we should by no means neglect an examination into our own  numb vi saturday march    at a time when the whole kingdom is running mad with political disquisitions it would be something hard if the babbler was not allowed to dwell upon the subject but as he is very unlike the generality of his namesakes and dreads nothing so much as offending he declares himself publicly a lover of truth yet an advocate of no party and sets up for the title of a good englishman without being either a whig or a tory party distinctions are to him the most disgusting circumstances imaginable and an intemperate zeal in the support of any faction not only the most ridiculous commotion in society but the most dangerous  sir robert walpole who knew human nature as well as most people has been very open and very honest upon this subject i have a letter of his this moment before me which has never yet appeared in print and which will i dare say be no less a curiosity than an instruction to my readers  sir robert i need not observe had been for a long time the idol of the people and was even committed to the tower for too strenuous an assertion of their liberties  after his interest had got the better of his patriotism and that the fondness of fame had yielded to a passion for power sir robert wrote the following letter to an intimate friend who had reproached him for deserting the welfare of the public  my dear friend i received your last with much satisfaction though it contained some little acrimony on my conduct and easily discovered the greatness of your esteem notwithstanding it was blended so frequently with reproof  indeed my dear friend whatever color my change of principles may wear or however it may be considered by the generality of people i have done nothing which every other man in the world would not have done in my situation  the very best of us are fond of greatness and power in our hearts and however we may seem to despise either the contempt never lasts a moment longer than the incapacity to obtain them  the friendship of a king the command of his revenues an opportunity of promoting our friends and triumphing over our enemies let me tell you are considerations of no very trifling nature and the man in my opinion must be something more or less than human wherever they are resisted  as i have not vanity sufficient to pretend to the first i have sense enough to avoid the imputation of the latter and am content with being nothing more than mortal provided there are no malicious endeavors to make me any thing less  popularity my dear friend is nothing more than a stepladder for ambition to reach the summit of place and preferment we all have our prices and if it is asked why i continued so long in an opposition to the court my answer is this they did not come up to mine there is scarcely a member whose price i do not know to a single sixpence and whose very foul i could not almost purchase at the first offer  the reason former ministers have been deceived in this matter is evident they never considered the tempers of the people they had to deal with i have known ministers so weak as to offer an avaritious rascal a star and garter and to think of bribing a profuse young rogue who set no value upon money with a lucrative employment  i pursue methods as opposite as the poles and consequently my administration must be attended with very different effects  the people of england are in general a set of hotheaded fools a parcel of sensible coxcombs who though perfectly able to examine the bottom of things never judge farther than the surface  they know their rights and privileges inviolably safe and yet they are never easy unless they think them in danger  it is no way difficult therefore for an aspiring commoner to take an advantage of this disposition and to convert their ignorant solicitude for the public emolument entirely to the promotion of his own  a staunch opposition on two or three questions right or wrong to the court gets him a name half a dozen impudent unmeaning speeches the admiration and a treasonable pamphlet the very souls of the people  patriotic barbers toast him in alehouses publicspirited shoemakers harangue for him in the streets and freeborn chairmen and housebreakers sing forth his praises in every nightcellar within the bills of mortality  to quiet the minds of the mob he gets a place his own interest then obliges him to join the measures of the court upon this the golden idol turns instantly to a calf and leaves the field of preferment to somebody else who is next to share the admiration and in due time the curses of the vulgar  i remember i never thought my point completely carried till they clapped me in the tower  i looked upon myself then as a made man and the event fully justified the warmth of my expectations in reality i know no better friends to the constitution of this country was it any way in danger than this set of imaginary patriots  they struggle very heartily while they are at it and the moment they are bought off their preferment inspires others with a view of following their example in order by the same means to attain the same ends and thus we always find a succession of zealous patriots who constantly advance the good of their country by being so very strenuous about their own but to drop this subject know my dear friend that the constitution of this country is so critically founded that whatever effects the privileges of the people will in a little time endanger the prerogative of the crown there is no separate interest for either to consult and in such a case no man of sense will dream that the court can have the least notion of encroaching on the liberties of the subject  you see my dear friend how freely i deal with myself but with me patriotism goes for nothing there is not this moment one patriot in the house nor indeed is there the least necessity that there should  do not deprive me of your good opinion for my candor but go on to esteem me and be assured i shall ever remain  your most faithful friend r walpole  numb vii saturday march    the subject of my correspondents letter in a former number has procured me a very sensible complaint from an honest bucklemaker near cornhill and as it may serve by way of supplement i think it most proper not to postpone the publication of it  to the babbler sir the remarks which were made upon the dress of tradesmen especially those of the younger fort in your paper from a correspondent i cannot help admiring very much and the more so as they come home to an instance in my own family which has for a long time given me no little uneasiness  you must know mr babbler that i am a plain pains taking man and neither more or less than a bucklemaker near cornhill i have kept shop these twenty years and brought up my family consisting of a wife one son and a daughter decently enough though i say it myself and may be have saved a trifle or so in my business but that does not signify  as every thing i have has been made by a close application to trade i do not choose appearing grander mr babbler than what becomes a person of my station so that i confine myself to a suit or two of modest clothes and never put on my largest wig or my best ruffled shirt but of a sunday  my wife however who had been formerly a ladys maid in the city has higher notions and as i do not choose to quarrel with her indulges herself in the gratification of them to as ridiculous a degree as my circumstances can allow  she would not come into the shop for the world without a sack or a french night cap and is sometimes so loaded with powder and pomatum that the very smell is enough to take away the breath of my customers i am never suffered to walk with her of a working day because i am not sufficiently fine nay i am to esteem it as no trifling favor if i am permitted to accompany her to the white conduit house or islington fields of a sunday you may be sure mr babbler that so hopeful an example has not escaped my children without imitation my daughter who is about nineteen will put up with no less an appellation than a young lady and my son of course thinks himself equally justified in supporting the title of a young gentleman he quarrelled with my eldest apprentice the other morning for calling him by the familiar name of andrew and my daughter insisted upon turning away our last maid because in speaking of her to a third person she did not say miss dolly my wifes foolish indulgence is a still greater means of spoiling them  my daughter is always dressed out in a manner that renders her above doing any necessary article in the economy of a house and superior to the condescension of serving in the shop  if a customer comes in instead of asking what he wants she orders the boy to call his master for she would not stoop to send for her father to haggle about a twelvepenny knife or a twoshilling pair of buckles  if she sits behind the counter it is with a look of dignity and importance and to every new comer in puts on a new air in order to enhance the idea of her consequence my wife has lately bought her a pair of stone shoebuckles and i am hourly teazed to death about purchasing her a metal watch my son mr babbler is not a whit less affected than my daughter i cannot see in what respect he is any way my superior and yet through his mothers means he appears in a manner i never durst assume without being laughed at by all my acquaintance he has his ruffled shirt on every day his clean white stockings has actually got a silk waistcoat with vellum buttonholes and a goldlaced hat for sundays is there any bearing this mr babbler but this is not the worst of it as he improves in dress the more he decreases in his manners and the better he is supplied with the articles of finery the less respectful he grows to those who provide him with the means lord sir he considers me in no better light than a sort of an upper servant who is obliged to consult the gratification of his pleasures and to humor every turn and whim of his inclination he scarce ever takes his hat off before me and is so far from thinking that there is any thing out of character in his dress that he is always exclaiming against the poverty of mine in this he is supported both by his mother and his sister the former always declaring i shame them with my nasty way of appearing and my dutiful daughter wondering how her papa can dress in so shabby and pitiful a manner  we are talked of all over the neighborhood mr babbler and i am for ever rated at the blue posts for submitting to my wifes dominion

to preserve it from destruction  numb ix saturday april   i do not know any thing in the present age which has done such essential disservice to the cause of virtue and morality as the ridiculous affectation of wit which prevails in almost every order of the people under a pretension to this quality the most blameable levities become universally admired and what is much worse the most dangerous of all our vices are set up as a standard for public imitation to destroy the tranquillity of a deserving friend by some occasional stroke of impertinence is nowadays sufficient foundation for the character of a wit and we frequently reckon that person as possessed of extraordinary abilities who bids defiance to the mandates of his god  there is one great unhappiness attending this propensity to fashionable wit which is that men of the best sense very often think themselves obliged to give in to the general opinion of their acquaintance and in order to merit the esteem of the world submit to the very errors which their own understanding must naturally lead them to condemn  among the number of my own friends who are unhappily victims to the world in this respect i cannot without the utmost concern reflect upon poor ned froilby  when ned came from the university which was at the age of nineteen he had a doting old grandmother who supplied him plentifully with money and by whose fondness he was enabled to indulge all the luxurious depravities incident to his years upon his first coming to town he was introduced as a hopeful young fellow at a society of wits who frequented a fashionable coffeehouse in the neighborhood of covent garden unacquainted with the world their manners were perfectly new to our young adventurer and it was not without an infinite pain he heard obscenity and execration form the principle part of the first nights discourse notwithstanding this there was a something in the company which produced an involuntary attachment and he was overheard whispering to the friend who introduced him that it was a pity such and such gentlemen were not less immoral for he looked upon them as excessively agreeable  there is in the human mind a natural promptitude of imitating manners wherever we happen to like a man this was poor neds case in less than a week an oath was not altogether so shocking and it was rather too reserved for a young fellow to banish an innocent freedom in talking of women that suited with his years and constitution there is no necessity for circumstantial particularities suffice it that ned before the month was over grew passionately fond of the character of a wit and showed that in purchasing so honorable an appellation he was utterly regardless of the means  the first stroke of wit that procured him any reputation was the overturning of his grandmothers coach in a little excursion to richmond where he insisted on mounting the coachbox and commencing driver our phaeton unable to manage the horses drove against a milestone upon which the carriage instantly gave a violent jerk and pitched him headlong into a cucumber bed on the road side where he was miserably cut with the glasses the good old lady had her arm broke by the accident and what with the acuteness of the pain and her terrors for her neddy a fever ensued which carried her off in a fortnight when he was able to come abroad his next sally of wit was upon an unfortunate waiter whose eye he knocked out with the head of a tobaccopipe this cost him two hundred pounds to suppress a prosecution exclusive of a twenty pound annuity during the life of the sufferer  a duel with a highland officer for some reflections on brimstone was his next exploit after which he successively bred four riots at the playhouse and carried off seven milliners apprentices within the purlieus of covent garden it is remarkable that when our modern men of wit endeavor at a character they generally employ themselves in proving their spirit and the moment they arrive at the pitch of doing what they think proper the itch of heroism naturally disappears and they content themselves with saying what they please  this is exactly neds case finding the reputation of his courage sufficiently established he rests satisfied with disturbing every conversation he over hears and has humility enough to be no more than very impertinent whenever he engages in an argument at the playhouse i have heard him affect a horse laugh in the most distressing passage of a tragedy and at a concert i never knew him pleased with the performers till he had put them entirely out fatigued with this insipid round his wit has taken a different turn religion and it is members are now the objects of his ridicule and possibly from some passages in his life having reason to fear that there is another world after this he always endeavors to convince his acquaintance that there is not  unhappy ned frailby setting out a fashionable wit he has sunk into a real infidel and to gain the admiration of a blockhead he should despise has forfeited the favor of his god the people who wish him best can only pity him but where he is not personally known he is looked upon as what he is yet ned has a thousand good qualities his ear is never turned from the complaint of sorrow nor his bounty withheld from the tear of distress he is the best of masters the kindest of landlords and the warmest of friends he has a fine fancy a sound understanding and a benevolent heart but a passion for admiration has undone him and he is an amiable reprobate at best  to such a picture there needs no comment let any man of wit clap his hand upon his heart and examine if he has not all of neds bad qualitries and then let him try how far they are extenuated by the good if upon examination he should appear to have a great deal of the first and very little of the latter he is really a very wretched being and we may very fairly cry out with the poet  hic niger est hunc tu roman caveto numb x saturday april    the following letter which has been communicated by a personage of the first distinction having something in it so applicable to the present times we fancy our readers will for that reason readily accept it for the entertainment of the day were they even to pay no regard to the extraordinary merit and uncommon reputation of the author  original letter from dean swift to mr pope never before made public dear pope i am wonderfully pleased with the publication of your ethic epistles not only on account of their poetical and moral excellence but on account of that hearty aversion to ministers and courts which breathes through several of the passages perhaps i am the more taken with your sentiments on this head because they are a sufficient authority for some opinions advanced by myself and you know we are always certain of allowing other peoples notions to be of weight and importance when they bear any conformity to our own  i do not know how it is but i never liked a minister in all my day our friends oxford and bolingbroke i had a sincere value for in their private stations but in their public capacities i looked up on them both and you know i have said it to their faces as little better than a couple of r  ls this regard to their abstracted merit as individuals has frequently led me to support tenets diametrically opposite to my principles and i have often engaged as a champion for the conduct of the ministers because i had a cordial affection for the integrity of the men there is such an honest openness in harley and so apparent an ingenuousness in st john that i am attached to their interest in spite of my teeth and left while i labor to rescue them from the name of scoundrels in their offices to sink under the weight of the damned appellation myself  in fact pope i believe it impossible for any minister to be an honest man there are fifty thousand trap doors from the very nature of his office in which it is next to impossible but his integrity must tumble  one right honorable r  l or other has eternally some strumpet to provide for or some cuckold to recommend in preference to the claims of real worth and the pretensions of the truly deserving not to mention any thing of a ministers own friends his implements and dependants who all naturally expect to be provided for in course thus situated a man at the head of affairs is obliged very frequently to overlook the solicitations of services and merit as i have this moment observed and exposes himself to the resentment of many disappointed levee danglers from an utter impossibility to provide for all hence a number of enemies are certain of attacking him at every quarter and as the battery in some places may be justly enough levelled the report must be heard without end  but as wealth and power are always sure of finding advocates we never see a minister without a number of literary mercenaries employed in his defense to refute the arguments of malice or to evade the accusations of truth to knock on the head with the hammer of plump contradiction or to puzzle by a fallacious representation of facts these worthy gentlemen did they really consider the true interest of the minister would never endeavor at any thing like a fair dispute a round lie ought to be given to every assertion prejudicial to his reputation and this would produce such a number of replies that the public would soon give up the discussion of a point which saddled them with a heavy expense a swarm of pamphlets the lower orders have not the ability to purchase and the higher have not the leisure to read hence a debate that occasions a number of publications must insensibly die away and the principal sufferer be the unfortunate bookseller for seldom very seldom has the proprietoryship of a sixpenny touch fallen to the share of any regularly bred author  people may talk what they will of the infringment which ministerial artificers have made upon the liberty of the subject but in my opinion the stampoffice is the most dangerous the duty laid there upon all publications is a flagrant attack upon the liberty of the press and by choking up the only channel which the public have of setting forth their grievances cuts off the most probable mean of having them redressed it is in fact he most masterly stroke of ministerial cunning which i can remember for let a sretary be never so bad a man one half of his villainy passes the notice of the world because few people are willing to buy a knowledge of it at an exorbitant price  the general plea which is used by ministerial advocates and a plea which i myself have used with success is that an attack upon the minister is an affront upon the crown and that there is no accusation laid at the door of a secretary that is not an indirect reflection upon the king this is a pleasant way of reasoning to be sure for by the express declaration of our laws an english prince is a piece of royal infallibility incapable of doing wrong as this position is universally admitted it must consequently follow that let us spatter as we please not a bit of dirt can stick upon the monarch or even if it could would the monarch be an honest or a sensible man to be offended if it was apparently evident he was in the wrong duty and reverence is all stuff pope the prince who is offended at censure ought never to furnish a cause for it and the king who would exact the obedience ought to deserve the affection of his people this is the voice of reason and the prince who is above listening to it may possibly be feared but i will stake my salvation that he never can be loved  the position that a king can do no wrong pope must either tax the english nation with great injustice or great inconsistency if a king can do no wrong why was king james the second banished and if a king can do wrong why the plague are we constantly affirming that he cannot either way we stand self condemned in the first place we must be very wicked men if the possition holds and very foolish ones in the second if it does not but inconsistency is our prevailing characteristic and if we are not set down as a nation of scoundrels we must think ourselves pretty easy under the appellation of fools  i am dear pope etc j swift  numb xi saturday april    among the variety of correspondents who favor me with their pieces

position which the whole world has been intimate with since it is first creation yet what is not a little odd a position that one half of our modern authors think as necessary to discuss three or four times a week as if we were under the greatest doubt of it is truth or utterly unacquainted with its rectitude this position sir is neither more nor less than the imperfection of all human enjoyments and the just disregard which should be shown to every possession of this life by such as have a proper solicitude for the happiness of the next  i am an old fellow master babbler very near sixtyfive and when i look back upon the various occurrences of my life and recollect the objects which principally attracted my attention from the cradle to the present hour i cannot help crying out with the poet  a phantom of pleasure like happiness dressed from the cradle we are taught to pursue yet our hope is but vanity take it at best and our wisdom but vanity too when i was about ten years of age sir the summum bonum of all worldly felicity was a holiday from school and a pennyworth of marbles  how have i envyed a chimneysweepers apprentice basking in the sun in all the amplitude of idleness and rags when i considered him as unrestrained by the tyranny of some surly pedagogue or enabled to cry fair up at a game of slap  as i grew up sir my attention was imperceptibly engaged to amusements rather more manly but however less innocent many a good time have i been diverted by fastening a rope across our street in a dark night to tumble unsuspecting passengers in the dirt and many a cat have i tied to the knocker of a street door to throw the first servant wench into fits by whom it might be occasionally opened  the more mischief on these pretty little frolicks the better the amusement and i remember never to have received so much real satisfaction as being the cause in one night of an old womans eye scratched half out and a mans breaking his leg  at seventeen however i began to look on amusements of this nature with an eye of disgust my time was now wholly taken up with an attendance upon every little girl in our neighborhood and between that age and twentyfive i had the happiness of ruining nineteen you can by no means conceive the transports i felt mr babbler to survey so many victims to my personal merit and address often has my heart exulted at the tears of some poor deluded innocent my satisfaction being always good naturedly proportioned to the distress which i caused and once i looked upon myself as the happiest of all human beings three young ladies with whom i had been particular being fortunately discarded on that account by their friends and turned out of doors  at thirty sir i was married to a woman whose person was far from being agreeable but whose fortune had too many charms to be withstood my ambition now was directed to the purchase of a fine stud of cattle and a magnificent country house my wishes were gratified but in less than three months i sold off the one and seldom put my foot into the other unless some very extraordinary circumstance indeed made my appearance absolutely necessary on the spot  the mutability of my pleasures still continuing sir i was successively fond of the reputation of a hard drinker the character of a desperate rider the same of a good marksman the glory of a billiard player and once was miserable a whole twelvemonth on account of losing a rubber at dutch pins  i have eat a raw beef stake out of pride whistled for a wager with a very honest butcher in newgatemarket and thought it a piece of heroism to be locked up all night with the remains of a murderer dissected by the surgeons in short sir there is scarcely a fashionable article of reputation that i have not acquired but the hey day of the spirits being long since over and reason beginning to reflect upon pursuits which nature is no longer able to continue i look upon every former object of my admiration with a real concern and an insuperable contempt  and yet sir at this age i have my enjoyments which i cannot help pursuing with an avidity truly ridiculous i pique myself not a little on smoking half a dozen pipes of an evening and have lately contended for the honor of being the best politician at our club in a long argument with doctor dozely the parson about magna charta and the natural rights of a freeborn englishman  yet sir is all this blaze of reputation worth living for  i blush to be diverted by such trifles but can by no means throw them off  i am in short a convincing proof sir of solomons sensible observation that all is vanity and vexation of spirit being perfectly sensible that no happiness or enjoyment of this life can be at all equal to conscious satisfaction of preparing for the unutterable transports of the next  i am sir thomas giddy  numb xii saturday april  0 universal soever as the spirit of amor may be and great soever as the countenance may be which it receives from the polite world there is no one source from which such a number of calamities are produced nor any one spring which pours in such a variety of misfortunes upon society unhappily in this gay age the depravity of manners has arisen to so enormous a degree that it is in some measure necessary for a young fellow to give into the fashionable follies and practice vices to which he has a real abhorrence if he would establish the character of a man of taste or show himself tolerably well acquainted with the world  in the prosecution of modern amor more than in any other vice there are allurements which very few think themselves capable of resisting or even choose to resist if they could a man finds his vanity tickled as well as his inclination gratified in the seduction of unwary innocence and abstracted from the transport resulting from possession itself the generality of our sex think with an infinity of satisfaction upon their own accomplishments and suppose they must be possessed of some extraordinary qualifications when a woman shows her sensibility of them at no less a price than her everlasting disgrace  the same vanity which impels the one sex to a pursuit of unwarrantable amor is the very reason why the other is so seldom offended when they even know that a mans design is repugnant to honor and virtue the pleasure arising from the adoration paid to a pretty face casts a veil over the infamous intention of him who offers it and the generality of women are content to be addressed upon the footing of strumpets provided the offense which is offered to the purity of their hearts is mingled with a wellturnd compliment to the beauty of their persons hence actuated by vanity and perhaps rendered weak from constitution the amiable idiot of the softer sex is immediately undone and the remorseless libertine of ours feels no compunction in the ruin of her character since the monstrous depravity of general opinion induces him to consider it as an enhancement of his own nay this vanity on the side of the ladies has sometimes been so unaccountably absurb that two sisters have quarrelled about the adresses of an agreeable spoiler and contended with an inflexible sedulity for the honor of sacrificing their peace of mind in this world and endangering their everlasting happiness in the next  independent of the lamentable consequences in point of character which on the womans part most commonly attend a deviation from virtue the effects which such a deviation has upon her spirits is generally fatal there is a softness in the female mind so very susceptible of tender impressions that it is next to impossible the idea of a favored lover should ever be erased and as it is equally impossible that the libertine professed can confine himself to any single attachment the woman must necessarily be wretched when she knows that those vows and protestations are indiscriminately paid to the whole sex which she once vainly imagined were engrossed by herself besides this there is an ungrateful sort of indolence in the temper of the man which renders him indifferent in proportion to the study taken to please him and a spaniellike kind of fondness in the disposition of the woman which increases her tenderness in proportion as she experiences his indifference or abuse i seldom or never heard of a man who behaved commonly civil to a woman who had granted him all she could grant nor knew a woman one forget a man by whom she was destroyed i have an elegy before me in which a lady ruined and forsaken paints the general situation of the sex in such circumstances with no little sensibility and as the performance has much merit i shall make no excuse for transcribing a stanza or two and submiting them to the judgment of my readers  o that no virgin would incline an ear to wild professions from inconstant youth but nobly scorn a sentiment to hear that seems to laugh at innocence and truth for if no just displeasure she reveals time will convince her dearly to her cost that step by step the sweet delusion steals till fame and honor are for ever lost the female mind may bid it is terrors cease who never made her softer feelings known nor fear a thought destructive to her peace while prudence tells her to conceal her own but if alas in some unguarded hour from this advice she madly should depart she gives her lover an unbounded power to wound her honor and to break her heart in vain the fair to such a crisis drove in sense or soul superior will confide for when has reason triumph over love or inclination been subdued by pride say heaven to whom my prayer is now addressed why are we subject to so hard a fate that though the easy fondness of our breast be still abused we never wish to hate for even this moment when my grief has stole the aching tribute of a falling tear i feel a foolish something round my soul declare the soft betrayer is too dear alas the anguish i am doomed to prove from real passion only can begin for this sad drop proceeds from slighted love and pardon heaven no sorrow for the sin but o ye powers remove each softer trace that calls his faithless image to my eyes for as i know him infamous and base it is but just i hate him and despise i shall conclude this paper with a letter sent by a young fellow of my acquaintance lately married to a most amiable woman to a lady who officiated as bridemaid to his wife and who was weak enough to make him some overtures in a little time after the wedding day  madam unfashionable soever as it may be for a gentleman to have any notion of his moral duties and inelegant soever as it may be in a husband to pay the least attention to his word as a man i must take the liberty of informing you that i have too just a regard for the vows of which i have lately given to an excellent woman in the presence of the living god to think of violating them by listening to any insinuation of tenderness in others of the sex and suffer me madam to add that i have not such a cruelty of temper as to destroy the eternal quiet of a deserving lady which must inevitably be the case in her moments of reflection let the passions tell her what they will when the reason is more off it is guard i have such an opinion of you madam as to suppose an intercourse of an illicit kind would plant daggers in your bosom when that fine sense of which you are mistress had leave to exert itself and that however the guilty commerce might be secreted from the knowledge of the world that recollection would harrow up your soul when you whispered it to your own  think madam of your inexpressible beauty your exalted merit and your elevated rank nor suffer an unhappy prepossession to lead you into any error repugnant to the regard which is due to your own reputation the honor of your sex and the happiness of your friends and believe me that an attention to this advice whatever you may think of my behavior at present will one day oblige you to confess that i am very much your real friend and most obedient servant  should any husband be in my friends situation the advice i give him will be a line from an old fashioned book called the

embracing every opportunity to return them  honcur an idle regard to the dictates of friendship and benevolence and a paltry adherence to the minutest law of order and morality  honesty a foolish regard to the sanctity of our words upon every occasion and a servile abhorrence to the smallest trespass upon the property of our neighbors  courage a lowminded aversion of brutality to such as from situation in life must not presume to resent a horse whipping or complain at the loss of an eye and a silly desire of avoiding all quarrels but such as relate to the honor of our king or the glory of

humanity or his oath but drove the principal officers of the adverse party in their own defense to sit in trial upon their sovereign and sentence him to death  truly a very blessed martyr  had this

total excuse for his crimes   numb xiv saturday may    i am never more diverted than when i see your grave important set of gentlemen who would pass upon the world as men of extraordinary sagacity running into a number of little petulancies which they imagine themselves to be considerably above and fretting at the veriest trifles we can think of when they affect a superiority of resolution which the most striking calamities of life are not sufficiently powerful to disturb  this species of philosophers is generally composed of men who have much pride or little understanding and who through a contemptible sort of vanity make themselves not a little less than human that they may have an opportunity of appearing in the eyes of the injudicious to be infinitely more of this cast was the elder brutus who passed sentence of death upon his own sons without the shadow of a pang yet at another time knocked one of his servants down for putting a grain of salt too much in his broth  but without going so very far back for instances of this extraordinary class of mankind my old friend frank surly is one of the most remarkable which it has ever produced  frank and i were bred together at westminster and before he was twelve years of age he was distinguished from every other boy in the school by the uncommon moroseness of his temper and his contempt of those punishments which the generality of his age and standing always held in the greatest dread  there were few lads in the whole school superior to frank either in application or abilities yet i have known him frequently inattentive and careless about his lessons that we might see with how much fortitude he could bear to be flogged  nay if any of his intimates had been guilty of any roguish prank which deserved the discipline of the rod he would often desire them to lay the blame on him and suffer with all the compusure in the world a hearty flagellation in their stead  unhappily however upon one of these occasions when frank was going to be punished for some petty crime which he begged might be laid to his charge the lad who was really guilty of the fact struck with his behavior went up to the master and without disguise related the affair acknowledged the fault and declared he would rather be cut to pieces than see another suffer for an action which he had committed himself  the lads generosity had an effect upon the master nor was he without some surprise at the behavior of frank  he dismissed them both to their seats and to the inexpressible concern of the latter never flogged him after  frank finding he could have no opportunity of showing his stoicism any longer through downright pride paid an application to his studies that in a little time made him the best scholar in the whole school and resolving to be remarkable for the extremities of his behavior the moment the master had declared he would never gratify him with another whipping he grew remarkably well behaved and piqued himself upon keeping up a consequence and dignity in his actions to prove that the fear of punishment had nothing to do in the reformation of his manners  the same disposition which distinguished frank in his earlier years has all along rendered him conspicuous since his reach to maturity  as he and i still hold up an intimacy whenever i go down into oxfordshire i pass a week at his house  the last time i was there he was laid up with a very violent fit of the gout and whenever the pain was at an extremity he would converse with unusual cheerfulness or divert himself with one of the songs which was in vogue when he and i were younkers  if any body pitied him he instantly flew into a passion but if you seemed to make slight of bodily anguish and infirmity he shook you by the hand and told you you were a man of understanding  about ten years ago my old friend married a most valuable woman of whom he was passionately fond and who returned his affection almost to madness  as their circumstances were affluent this reciprocal regard one would imagine should have produced their mutual felicity  but far on the contrary  frank was too proud to be happy and as his love for mrs surly was universally known to be excessive he was never satisfied unless he treated her as the object of his hate  he only lived in her looks and yet he has torn himself from her presence for three whole weeks and so unaccountably headlong was he hurried by this ridiculous stoicism that upon her death which happened in childbed though his soul was tortured with all the anguish of consummate pity and distracted love he went to the assembly an hour after her decease and sat up  a tear now and then straying down his cheek  along with colonel tierce major piquet and sir oliver ombre at a party of whist  a person so apparently steeled against the calamities of life we should reasonably expect would hold the little impertinencies or interruptions of it in the greatest contempt but this is far from being the case with my friend frank  a plait more or less in his shirt sleeve will set him raving for an hour and i remember that he shot a favorite dog one day in the stableyard for leaping accidentally up and dirtying the skirt of his coat  it is impossible to enumerate the various inconsistencies of my poor friends character  i once knew him set up a careless drunken fellow of a coachman who overturned him in a ditch in a very handsome inn three weeks after and at another time discharge his footman at a moments warning for wearing too little powder in his wig  were we to make an essay into human nature and examine the lives of our modern philosophers with any degree of circumspection we should find the principal number approach so very near the standard of frank surly that the account given of him will serve as no improper description of them all  the ridiculous light in which one of the most sensible is set will i hope serve for as good an admonition as i can possibly give to this tribe of very important beings and i shall think myself particularly happy if the foregoing picture is attended with any salutary effect  numb xv saturday may    i did myself the pleasure a few evenings ago to call at the house of an old friend with whom i have been intimate these thirty years and for whom i have infinitely more than a common respect an affair of arbitration had however called him abroad and i found nobody at home but miss maria his younger daughter who is now the most lively picture of innocence and beauty which i ever saw and closely bordering upon twentyone as i always avoid stiffning my conversation with the starch of antiquity and constantly endeavor at appearing more ready to be instructed than to instruct the young people are very fond of admitting me into their company and there is scarcely a day that i have not an invitation or two from some of the most sprightly teatables in town which is more i fancy than can be said by any other old fellow of sixty within the weekly bills  on my enquiring for her papa miss maria stepped out of the parlour and seizing one of my hands cried o mr babbler is it you i insist upon your coming in few entreaties are necessary to make a man do what he likes i immediately assented sat down and passed two of the most agreeable hours i ever experienced in my whole life  our conversation after turning upon a variety of topics at last fell upon that divine part of our churchworship in which the congregation sing praises to the most high if it is proper says maria for a person of my years to speak of so important a subject as religion and not too presumptuous for the petticoats to comment upon the worship of the church i should think mr babbler that this part of our liturgy might be very much improved great complaints have been often made that so small a number of the congregation join in the singing of psalms and though i admit the neglect is highly unpardonable and the censure extremely just yet reformation would in my opinion be infinitely superior to reprehension and i think every room for complaint might be removed by a proper suppression of the cause  the end of poetry and music if i am right in my information is to actuate upon the passions and in all religious composition to raise the mind to an elevated desire of acknowledging the wonderful mercy and goodness of the divine being how far the hymns used in the established church for this purpose are from answering so salutary an end it is no less painful than unnecessary to observe in the versification of the very best psalms all the rapture of the original text is lost and in that the music should be no way superior to the poetry there is hardly any one tune which can create the least emotion but sleep in fact sir the most triffling compositions which are formed for the business of amusement have twenty times more merit than those set apart for the service of religion and infinitely greater pains are taken in the writing or setting of a ranelagh ballad than in a hymn to the honor of the living god  from what i have said mr babbler i would by no means infer that either the poetical or musical part of our hymns should be light trifling or airy but surely sir the spirit of devotion would breathe considerably stronger in these pieces and have a much greater effect if an author of reputation should give us a fine versification of the psalms and a master of eminence should receive proper encouragement to see them exquisitely set we have a number of tunes plaintive solemn and enchanting to a miracle which are nevertheless as familiar as they are charming and calculated to bewitch the careless and inattentive to a sense to a passion for that duty which they now treat with a lifeless indifference or an insupportable neglect religion sir by this means would become fashionable and it would be deemed no longer inelegant for a fine lady or a fine gentleman to join in the praises of their god  lord mr babbler how can you have patience to hear me chatter so much but i shall not trespass on your patience much longer mr wellworth who you know visits us every day and i were talking on this very subject a few evenings ago and as he has a really sweet taste for poetry i took the liberty of requesting he would write me a hymn whether penitential or thanksgiving i left to himself he called on me this morning and brought it in his hand i think it mighty pretty and shall be very happy if my opinion should receive such a sanction as yours mr babbler mr wellworth read it to me with great sensibility and i own i thought he never looked so well in all his life  some how or other my eye encountered with miss marias at the end of this speech she seemed conscious and on my observing that mr wellworth was an excellent young man she reddened excessively and seemed at a stand for words as i would not confuse her by any means i shifted the conversation but she resumed it immediately and said well mr babbler you must give me your sentiments on this little production here it is continued she taking it out of her pocketbook  and here no not here but in the next number i shall present it with something else of consequence which it occasioned to my readers  numb xvi saturday may    in my last i promised my readers a hymn and as i would by no means be worse than my word or delay their expectations i give it without further introduction  hymn the lark now high soaring in air salutes the first blush of the morn and the roses new incense prepare to breathe on the dewdropping thorn fresh feelings instinctively spring in the steer as he turns up the clod and creation itself seems to sing in the honor and glory of god ii in what sensual mazes withheld is man now unhappily lost in the rage of what passion impelled on the sea of what vice is he tossed o instantly let him proclaim what the herbage all tells on the sod and if gratitude cannot let shame awake to the praises of god iii the eye of some maid in despair does his perjury fatally dim or some breast does he cruelly tear that beats and beats only for him all swift as the lightnings keen blaze let him humble before the dread rod nor join so unhallowed in praise to the honor and glory of god iv some law does he madly defy which the being of beings commands the bolt ready lifted on high shall dash him to dust as he stands in thunder omnipotence breaks fall prostrate o wretch at his nod see earth to her center deep shakes all dismayed at the voice of her god v lifes road let me cautiously view and no longer disdain to be wise but redden such paths to pursue as my reason should hate or despise to crown both my age and my youth let me mark where religion has trod since nothing but virtue and truth can reach to the throne of my god when i had done reading miss maria demanded my opinion of this performance which i could not but praise very much  i told her however that the thought of concluding every stanza with the name of the deity was borrowed from eves hymn in the death of abel though i could not think of making any comparison pretty as that hymn was with this of mr wellworths  the young lady seemed vastly delighted at my commendation and was beginning to make a verbal acknowledgment of her satisfaction when her fathers rap was heard at the door  my old friend entered the parlour with an air of mingled anger and dejection and instead of taking any notice of me began at once upon his daughter  so madam this is fine information i have received  what you are under an engagement to mr wellworth are you o maria maria  the secret was now out and i found my suspicions of miss marias attachment had considerably more than a tolerable ground the poor girl stood quite confounded and seemed utterly incapable of making a reply as i saw nothing culpable in her regard for a worthy young fellow i took upon me to intercede in her behalf and at last reduced her father to the temper i could wish i found a disparity of fortune was the only objection which the old gentleman had to his daughters choice for though my friend has as benevolent a heart as any man alive yet he has the caution of all old fellows and keeps a strict eye on the main chance when i had brought him to some degree of good humor i took an opportunity of turning the conversation and read him the foregoing hymn he was charmed with it and asked me if i knew the author yes says i mr wellworth fore god returned he though i do not approve of his connection with my daughter i am mightily taken with his works this was all i wanted and pray my good sir answered i which is it more for your credit and your childs happiness to bestow her on a deserving young man whom she loves and you cannot but admire or to run the precarious issue of matching her with one who though he may have twice mr wellworths fortune either may not have sense or inclination to reward either her merit or your goodness as he ought  you can settle them both if not splendidly at least elegantly in the world and my life for it in a year or two you would not change your son inlaw for the indies i saw my old friend was struck with the justice of the case yet still he seemed desirous of being persuaded to act as he knew he ought  i indulged him and saturday last he and i obtained a special license and to the inexpressible happiness of the young folks got them married that morning  numb xvii saturday june   to the babbler sir as i find it so very customary for people of all denominations to give a sketch of their lives and to publish any particular instances of folly or extraordinary turns of fortune to the world i take the liberty of sending you a portrait of myself in which abstracted from it is being a striking likeness i shall claim no merit unless it be allowed a general one  i am the only son of a tradesman who died about five years ago in the city mr babbler and left me in very handsome circumstances my father had a common council sort of pride about him which aspired at bringing up his son a gentleman and an ambition of making him carry an air of profusion while the most rigid economy was observed in his expense i have been tricked out sir in the very pink of city finery a laced waistcoat and a bag wig at a time that i was scarcely allowed a sufficiency to pay my club at the horseshoe and magpie and talked about tavern bills and supper when half a guinea has been the extent of my finances for a whole week  upon the death of old squaretoes mr babbler i found myself possessed of ten thousand pounds and scarcely got a wink of sleep during a whole month my imagination was so perpetually haunted by the recollection of the sum habituated however to the sight of the money i soon began to entertain a notion of laying a few hundreds elegantly out with this view a carriage was instantly bespoke an everlasting leave taken of all the streets between temple bar and whitechapel and a handsome apartment furnished at the other end of the town the three formidable letters of e s and q were quickly added to my name and having a strong inclinaton to be thought i fancied in reality that i was a fine gentleman  the first six weeks after it came home i spent at least fourteen hours a day in my coach i appeared every where saw every thing and upon addressing days frequently invited some of the aldermen to a dish of chocolate indeed one accident happened at my first going to court which made me not a little taken notice of i never before had presumed to put on a sword and being in the circle making my bow it unfortunately got between my legs and threw me on my face in order to save myself from falling i laid hold of an officers skirt who was just near me and held it with such a force that i dragged him with me down the whole drawing room was in a roar the ladies tittered the men burst into a horselaugh and even the face of majesty itself relaxed into a smile as soon as possible i picked myself up and retired the officer did the same and as i had been the cause of his disgrace i made him a number of apologies and took him home to dine before we parted a reciprocal esteem was cordially expressed and my new acquaintance talking something about a scarcity of money he did me the favor to borrow fifty pieces and gave me a positive assurance of coming to breakfast the next morning  he was better than his word he came and brought half a dozen brother officers in his hand we dined at almacks drank burgundy till we were blind  scoured the streets and beat the watch the frolic was new to me mr babbler i was charmed with it and behaved so well that my companions honored me with the name of a very honest fellow and swore it was a damned pity i was so awkward with my sword  these being the first gentlemen i ever had acquaintance with it is no wonder i treated them with extraordinary respect bred up to an intercourse with none but sellers of linen and dealers in packthread i considered every man with a laced coat and cockade as infinitely my superior and endeavored with a sedulity of an uncommon nature to imitate what i so passionately admired happily my endeavors succeeded so well that in a little time i swore got drunk broke windows kicked waiters and insulted modest women with as good a grace as if i had been colonel of a regiment  in these fashionable amusements i wasted away above half my fortune in two or three years with no other character than that of a very honest fellow when a spirited rape on the daughter of my tailor took away two thousand pounds to hush a prosecution and make it up the action increased my reputation but hurt my circumstances much i had not now as much more left in the world  i was disclaimed by my relations and despised by my fathers sober friends one half of my companions had died and the other half were in danger of a jail the same misfortune stared me in the face my debts were numerous my creditors pressing discharged they were obliged to be and accordingly were and when every thing was finally settled i found myself instead of having increased my ten thousand to have no more than seven hundred and fifty pounds left  what was to be done i could not bear the thoughts of going back into the city and understood no business if i did a lieutenancy offering i purchased it as the last resource and am now starving upon the half pay a striking example of ignorant pride and underbred prodigality at once the warning and contempt of our shewy little citizens  my letter

numb xviii saturday june    unfashionable soever as it may be to enter upon religious subjects in such an age as the present there are some who i flatter myself will nevertheless pay a little attention to a topic of such importance without a blush and think it no disgrace either to their gentility or their understanding to employ a few moments in the consideration of some points for which at the awful period of their dissolution eternities upon eternities will hardly seem too much  when we consider the differences which daily subsist in the various modes or systems of the christian religion and think upon the inflexible partiality which every man entertains in favor of his own we ought to be absolutely certain that the particular form which each of us glories to possess is perfectly conformable to our notions of the deity and consistent in the minutest degree with those divine lessons which were inculcated by the savior of the world in his mysterious mission to man  if we are not positive in this let our belief be distinguished by what name soever we think proper let us be protestants or papists quakers or presbyterians i can take upon me to aver that we have no right to the name of christians and may with equal propriety take a lesson from the alcoran as the gospel  it is not the ceremony used at baptism the sprinkling of water nor the promises of our parents in the presence of god which constitute the christian no it is an actual conformity to the precepts of our blessed lord and an undeviating obedience to the tenets which are laid down in the history of his life and miracles  nothing can be more absurd nor in reality more criminal than for a man to aspire at the glorious title of a christian who is regardless of the duties which that appellation renders indispensibly necessary or a stranger to the obligations which are particularly enjoined by the name it is at once a fatal deception of his own most important expectations an insult to his savior and a defiance of his god  with what propriety shall i beg leave to ask can the various sects of religion in this kingdom call themselves christians when in the unremitting hatred which they constantly entertain toward one another they utterly destroy that universal principle of charity which ought to be the foundation nay the very essence of their belief  with what propriety can he who is blessed with unbounded affluence style himself a christian if his ear is turned away from the sight of affliction or his heart unaffected with the tear of distress  christianity obliges him to a constant relief of the wretched and without a behavior entirely consonant to the duties of this belief what possible pretention can he have to a name that exalts him to a fellowship with angels and lifts him above the stars  will a constant attendance on the public place of his worship exculpate the oppressor of the widow and the fatherless or give the name of christian to the villain who infamously lifts a dagger to the breast of his benefactor or basely strives to murder the reputation of his friend  can the betrayer of unsuspecting innocence think on the pangs of some violated virgin left without assistance without comfort without bread exposed to all the upbraidings of a relentless world to aggravate the severity of her own reflections and possibly plunged in the additional misery of having a helpless little innocent and an unalterable affection for the monster by whom she is so cruelly undone i say can the perpetrator of an act like this sit down calmly satisfied with the rectitude of his behavior and think himself as a christian sincerely acquitted to his god alas if any man thus culpable can be so presumptuously daring as to think himself a christian it is doubtful whether he is most a reprobate or an idiot or whether he is most regardless or ignorant of his crimes  in every profession of the christian faith there is a number of good natured people who are always uneasy about the fate of the mahometans and terribly afflicted lest the ignorant savages of america should not at the last day be received into the favor of the supreme being  these people entertain strange notions of the deity if they can suppose that a power allwise allmerciful and alljust will require at the hands of such ignorant nations a knowledge which he has not thought proper to bestow a supposition of such a nature is highly derogatory to the divine essence it is a tacit implication that the great father of the universe exercises a severity which would be cruel in his creatures but to think of and a palpable insinuation that the being of beings is capable of a tyranny which would utterly degrade the meanest in the human race among the wonders of his hand  no from such only as have received much much is expected and perhaps at the last day myriads of our nominal christians who look upon the american savage with pity or contempt would give a hecatomb of worlds had they power to change situations to see so little to answer for as him conformable to what he knows he invariably regulates the tenor of his conduct maintains an unalterable reverence for some great object which he looks upon as his god and pays an implicit obedience to his laws whatever his system of belief may be he endeavors to do it all the honor in his power and shudders at nothing so much as the thought of bringing it into disgrace  who amongst us can honestly say the same enlightened with the lamp of science and the sun of true religion our actions are a perpetual stigma on our belief we acknowledge the wonderful merceies of a suffering redeemer yet are continually uttering blasphemies against his name we own the infinite merits of his gospel and yet act in manifest contradiction to every precept it contains the deity we are sensible can think us into ashes for the enormity of our crimes and yet we continue to behave in open disobedience to his will in short both hoping and fearing the existence of another world we sacrifice every valuable opportunity in this and constantly boasting the advantages accruing from our religion we are always acting as if we had no religion at all  let us therefore instead of condemning the errors of our neighbors begin with correcting whatever is amiss in ourselves and instead of finding fault with the religion of other people be satisfied that real christianity is the basis of our own  the whole mystery both of religion and government will be found in these admirable lines of mr pope  for forms of

the tear from the eye of the fatherless nor did the mourning of the widow ever pass unregarded at his gate  to sum up his character at once complacency and benevolence were always seated on his brow and humanity was a virtue so natural to his heart that it formed the very core and twisted round the strings thus amiable it was no wonder that by all who saw him he should be instantly admired and thus deserving no way strange that by all who knew him he should be cordially respected and beloved  among a variety of virgins who languished for orasmin almira a damsel of balsora newly arrived at bagdad was the only person blessed with a reciprocal esteem the blush of the morning was less rosy than her cheek and the diamond of golconda not so brilliant as her eye her bosom was as white as the swan upon the waters and gentle as the midsummer murmur of the stream  how often o ye groves of balsora have ye echoed with the same of her beauty how often o ye valleys of bagdad have ye resounded with her praise you know that her voice would chain the tiger of the desert and unnerve the wild stag as he darted from the hill you know that the spices of ormus could not equal her in breath nor the daughters of paradise excel her in dignity and grace  orasmin and almira were not more distinguished for their merit than remarkable for their loves and as neither had any parent living to oppose their wishes a day was appointed for the celebration of their nuptials to the universal satisfaction of their friends  orasmin all impatient for possessing the only object that had ever engrossed his heart longed for the happy hour with the utmost anxiety and feasted his imagination continually with the raptures he was to experience in the arms of almira she not less impatient though more confined in her expressions of the approaching felicity painted equally warm to her fancy the uninterrupted enjoyment of all she held dear and counted over the weeks the months and the years she had a probable expectation of passing in the tenderest intercourse with her adored orasmin  but alas while our lovers were thus enhancing the present by reflecting on the future an order arrived for almira to attend the caliph who had for some time been entertained with various reports of her unparallelled beauty and wanted to see if the encomiums lavished so frequently upon her were just neither her religion nor her allegiance could allow her to form any excuse for not attending the commander of the faithful much less admit of a resolution to disobey he was worshipped with an implicit reverence as a successor of the holy mahomet by all his people and his word was ever looked upon as the irrevocable voice of fate almira therefore was immediately carried with a bleeding heart to the palace and the moment she was beheld by the caliph declared the most favorite of his queens  it is not in language to tell the distraction of the two lovers at being thus unexpectedly torn for ever from each others arms the moment orasmin heard that his almira had captivated the caliph he looked upon the business of life to be entirely over and unable to support the inexpressible agonies of his own mind considered the angel of death as the only minister of repose for two whole days and nights he wandered through the various rooms of his house in an absolute state of phrenzy calling out at every interval in the most passionate tone on the name of his ravished almira on the third day growing somewhat calmer he began to reflect on all the circumstances of his past life in order to find out in what particular he had given mahomet such unpardonable offense as to meet with so severe a chastisement at his hands after revolving a long time and finding nothing but some youthful indiscretions to answer for which were infinitely overballanced by a number of meritorious actions he insensibly dropped upon one knee and began to expostulate in the following manner with his god  thou great creator of the universe who sitst enthroned above the seven heavens where even the conception of no prophet but the holy mahomet can dare to soar look down in mercy on a wretch who numbers himself with the most unhappy of human beings though he has constantly maintained the deepest reverence for thy laws tell him o thou infinitely high inform him o thou inexpressibly just why he who has ever made it his unalterable study to deserve thy awful sanction on his deeds is deemed to suffer what the most impious prophaner of thy divine will would look upon as a severity and confidently exclaim was too great a punishment for the most enormous of his crimes  orasmin had scarcely ended when a clap of thunder shook the house and an unusual brightness lightened the room where he still continued on his knee astonished at this apparent message from the deity  when he recovered himself a little a voice as awful as the trumpet of heaven desired him carefully to attend and thus went on  cease o mistaken man to doubt the mercy and justice of the supreme being who though he acts by unknown springs and seeming severities is ever watchful for the happiness of the virtuous and perfectly consistent in all his laws  consider orasmin that this world is a transitory bubble which must shortly burst upon the ocean of time that it is at best but a short voyage in which every passenger must meet with some disgreeable gales in order to prove his dependence on the hand of infinite goodness and show that he is worthy of entering into an everlasting port  without some adverse storms to ruffle the sea of life the tide of prosperity would frequently swell the creature into a forgetfulness of the creator and reduce him to a more dangerous situation than the bitterest blast he can experience will ever bring him to a total indifference of his god out of mercy therefore a variety of shoals and quicksands are thrown in his way which keeping the sense of his dependence on the divine being constantly alive in this world puts him in a capacity of steering his bark in the proper channel and enables him to arrive at endless happiness in the next  but abstracted from this general order in the state of things know orasmin that because thou were a particular favorite of heaven it was decreed to snatch almira from thy arms she was o man thy sister  ibrahim thy father journeying to balsora was admitted to the cades wife and the product of their guilty commerce was almira here again observe the kindness of heaven in it is very severities which in order to deter the parent from the commission of enormities denounces a judgment against what he values more highly than worlds his race  orasmin be comforted i have visited almira and informed her of these things she is at ease remain thou so too and remember never again to doubt the goodness of providence which in it is own time will reward those who place their confidence in it is hands orasmin after this lived many years in happiness and left many children who succeeded to his virtues and fortune the eldest of whom was grand vizier to the caliph haroun alraschid and ordered these matters to be recorded in the histories of bagdad  numb xx saturday june    to the babbler sir fortitude and constancy of mind are qualities to which every nation in proportion as it is civilized lays a formidable claim and to which however very few were we to examine the matter thoroughly can have any tolerable pretension besides the compliment which on those occasions each is so extremely liberal in paying to itself in fact it might not be difficult to prove from every days experience that the propagation of the sciences while they improve generally enervate the mind and that true fortitude and constancy of soul are more the result of a selfapproving conscience than the effect of an excellent understanding  a number of philosophers who have astonished the world with the greatness of their genius and the extent of their reading might talk very prettily on this subject but when they came once to put any of their own lessons into practice this boasted resolution of which they imagined themselves possessed disappeared in an instant and from deserving the universal admiration of mankind they became entitled to nothing but an absolute contempt cicero in his orations might express the greatest disregard of death he pleased and tell us that a man should not hesitate a moment in sacrificing his life for the good of his country but the orator found the practice infinitely harder than the precept and leagued himself with the enemies of the public after all in hope of saving the life which he affected so highly to despise  who could talk better upon the virtues or give more excellent lessons of morality than our own countryman my lord saint albans yet who when he fell from the pinnacle of honor and preferment ever showed a greater servility of mind or took more infamous methods to repair his shattered fortune  the most scandalous adulation that could be paid at court he was constantly paying and notwithstanding after his disgrace he was writing a book which confers an honor on human nature yet his intervals were taken up in defending every pernicious measure of the crown and employed in destroying the liberty of his country need the cause of his disgrace be mentioned here to prove that notwithstanding his wonderful abilities he wanted fortitude to resist the force of a trifling sum of money and honesty to discharge the important duties of his trust or what shall we say of a man who while he was establishing the highest testimony of human genius for two or three hundred pounds erected an everlasting monument of human baseness too in reality science and understanding can do nothing more than teach our constancy and fortitude a nobler way of appearing the qualities themselves must proceed from a firmer foundation than both  the wisdom of socrates gave a manner to his fortitude which left an irresistible charm in his death but the fortitude itself proceeded not from the excellence of his understanding but the goodness of his heart  but to prove beyond a possibility of dispute that a knowledge of the sciences has nothing to do in the qualities under consideration let us only refer to the behavior of a poor indian as related by lafitaw taken in battle by his enemies and condemned as a sacrifice to the manes of such as either he himself or his countrymen destroyed in the field  the moment he is condemned he opens his death song and is fastened to a stake the chiefs of the nation which has taken him sitting round a fire and smoking all the time  such as choose to be concerned in the execution begin with torturing at the extremities of his body till by degrees they approach the trunk one pulls off all his nails from the roots another takes a finger and tears off the flesh with his teeth a third takes the finger thus mangled and thrusts it into the bowl of a pipe made red hot and smoaks it like tobacco others cut and slash the fleshy parts of his body and sear the wounds immediately up with burning irons some strip the skin off his head and pour boiling lead upon it others tear the flesh entirely from his arms and twist the bare tendrils and sinews round red hot irons twisting and snapping at the same time some pound his fingers and toes to pieces between two stones others all the while distending and stretching every limb and joint to increase the inconceivable horror of his pains during this the miserable sufferer sometimes rendered insensible by the torture falls into so profound a sleep that they are obliged to apply the fire to recover him and untie him to give a breathing to the fury of their own revenge  again he is tied and his teeth drawn one by one his eyes beat out and no one trace of humanity left in his visage in this situation all over one continued mummy one inexpressible wound they beat him from one to another with clubs the wretch now up now down falling in their fires at every step till at last wearied out with cruelty some of their chiefs put an end with a dagger to his sufferings and terminates the execution which often lasts five or six hours by ordering on the kettle and making a feast as horrid and barbarous as their revenge  but what renders this more surprising is a contest which subsists all the time between the sufferer and them whether he has most fortitude in bearing or they ingenuity in aggravating his pangs at every interval they give him he smokes unconcerned with the rest without one murmur or shadow of a groan recounts what exploits he has done and tells them how many of their countrymen he has killed in order to increase their fury nay he reproaches them with an ignorance of torturing and points out such parts of his body himself as are more exquisitely sensible of pain  the women have this part of courage with the men and incredible soever as such an astonishing constancy of mind may appear it would be as odd to see one of these people suffer in another manner as it would be to find an european who could suffer with any thing like their fortitude an inflexible uniformity to the principles in which they are bred is the occasion of this fortitude and without one spark of learning occasions a behavior which distances the most celebrated stories of antiquity and baffles the profoundest lessons of all the philosophers  t b  numb xxi saturday july   few of the nobler qualifications are so generally pretented to as friendship or a capacity of entertaining so cordial a regard for the interest of another person as to make it equally an object of importance with our own  i was talking last night with my old acquaintance will threadbare on this very subject at the queens arms in st pauls churchyard when will related over the history of his friendships to me for the ninetyninth time and concluded with his usual invective against all the world and the little confidence which is to be placed in the honor or honesty of any man  to save him the trouble of repeating his narrative again i shall take take liberty of making it the subject of the present paper more especially as i know the publication can be no way disagreeable to him and may probably prove of some entertainment to my readers  from my very infancy up mr babbler says will i found that all those attachments which we are weak enough to distinguish by the name of friendship were nothing more than the effects of our folly or the consequence of our design  a parity of sentiments always created an intimacy between a couple of rascals who willing to believe that they were capable of feeling the exalted glow of a virtuous friendship imagined they really did feel it and having once flattered themselves with this opinion rested wonderfully pleased with the superstructure without ever examining the foundation upon which it was built  when i was at eaton no two in the world could be more intimate that is in the language of the world entertain a greater friendship for each other than a fellow who now possesses one of the most valuable employments in the kingdom and your humble servant how often have we swore that nothing should ever separate us when we came into the great theater of life as actors for ourselves  this regard we carried to such an excess that we have frequently boxed one anothers battles and always looked upon the least affront offered to either as an unpardonable injury to both  but alas mr babbler one whitsunmonday the provost who was an old acquaintance of my fathers took me out in a chaise with him to a neighboring gentlemans house and as my friend was not treated with the same distinction he grew envious of his pylades behaved intolerably cold at our next meeting which i could not but observe and being perhaps a little too tart in my reproaches he took an occasion to quarrel with me the consequence of which was that he and i never spoke a word together after this lads esteem for me commenced first of all from my dexterity in robbing orchards an amusement of which he was particularly fond and therefore could not help esteeming a temper that bore so strong a resemblance to his own but as the basis of our regard was so very trivial in itself our friendship must be supposed to have but a slender support and therefore a misunderstanding was but a matter of course  at oxford i commenced an everlasting friendship to be sure with ned guzzle because i was unalterably attached to the bottle myself and he was reckoned the hardest drinker in the university our everlasting friendship however continued but six weeks for a couple of unlucky rogues pitted us against one another to drink for a rump of beef and a dozen of maderia in which it being my fortune to swallow half a pint more than my antagonist he wrote me a letter when he got up next evening desiring that all manner of correspondence might be dropped between us for the future  when i came up to town and got possession of my little fortune dick wildman and i were inseparable we lodged in the same house spent every evening at the same tavern together and retired every morning with a strumpet to the same bagnio under the piazza  we were always coupled in our amors and never attacked a milliners apprentice or a tradesmans wife unless there were two to find us both employment in the same family  this was not all i once fought a duel for him behind montaguehouse and ran the double chance both of the gallows and cold iron yet see the fatality attending all sublunary things dick surprised me one morning in bed with one of the maids where we lodged whom he had been soliciting for some time though unknown to me and was so offended at the unpardonable preference which the hussy gave me that he instantly ordered his man to pack up his things and decamped next day without saying a single syllable  i could recount a variety of instances where my friendships were equally unsuccessful though i never refused either my sword or my purse to any of those partners of my heart but finding by fatal experience that no friendship is lasting which is not founded on virtue and believing in my soul that there is not a spark of virtue in any man alive  i am absolutely determined never to have another friendship but to starve as decently as i can upon my seventy pounds a year and to repeat that admirable sentiment of swift when any wellbehaved behaved scoundrel makes me the smallest declaration of his esteem  when ever a prating rascal cries he is your dearest friend  he lies to lose a guinea at picquet would make him rave blaspheme and sweat bring from his heart sincerer groans than if he heard you broke your bones numb xxii saturday july   i do not know any one circumstance so productive of disorder and confusion as the general propensity among all ranks of people when they meet in company to be joyous as it is called nor any thing where in the pursuit of pleasure and the hope of spending an agreeable evening they are so utterly mistaken in the means  i am led into this reflection as well from the experience of my own younger days as the universal confession of all my juvenal acquaintance of the present times with whom i very frequently that half an hour upon the subject and as a discussion of this point may perhaps prove as pleasing to my readers as a discourse upon any other topic i shall make a little narrative which i had yesterday from my nephew harry rattle the substance of the ensuing paper  i have often told my subscribers that though considerably on the wrong side of fifty an unassuming air of gaiety and freedom still renders me tolerable to the society of the young people and that there is seldom a day in which i have not a visit or an invitation from several to whom i might almost be a grandfather  among the many by whom i am thus favorably distinguished my sister rattles youngest son harry treats me with a cheerful familiarity without ever transgressing the smallest bound of respect  there is a something in this young fellow which abstracted from his affinity to me i cannot help admiring  an open ingenuity of carriage mixed with a fund of excellent sense are not the least of his accomplishments he has read a great deal and what is infinitely more he never took up an author without perfectly understanding him  as well as a complete scholar harry is really a pretty gentleman and possesses no less a good heart than a fine understanding  as my nephews qualifications are very well known it is impossible but every body must be fond of his company this sometimes leads him into foibles and in spite of his good sense an easiness of temper that cannot resist the solicitations of his friends frequently runs him into errors which with all my partiality for him i can by no means approve notwithstanding the rogue would make any body overlook them by the self accusing honest and readiness of his own reflections whenever i get harry for a subject of discourse i scarce know how to end i am so fond of dwelling upon what i cordially esteem but not to trespass upon the patience of my readers who are no way interested in his qualities it is high time i should proceed to the purpose i set out with and assume the matter instead of preaching on the man  well then yesterday morning harry called upon me about eleven his face spiritless and pale his lips livid and swollen a visible fatigue spread all over his features and his eyes sunk in his head i began instantly to open at the young rogue guessing justly enough the cause of his rueful appearance when he flopped into my great chair and prevented all the severity i intended to treat him with by being considerably more severe upon himself  my dear sir says he i am not worth your anger advice is thrown away upon me i sin against the conviction of my own reason and am no less an obstinate puppy than a ridiculous fool why last night again notwithstanding all my late resolutions dick bumper only asked me a second time to sup with a few friends at his house and though i was very sensible what the consequence must inevitably prove do you know that i had not fortitue enough to refuse him at four this morning we broke up after the usual manner heartily weary of each other fatigued to death with our entertainment and utterly dissatisfied with ourselves  i wish sir you would say something on this subject and point out the monstrous absurdity which generally prevails in a joyous evening when a few friends meet together instead of indulging a rational conversation you hear of nothing but a toast and a song the chairman calls in turn upon every one for his toast and frequently puts us to a stand for the want of something spirited or new in this dilemma obscenity or profanation is but too general a resource and it is no uncommon thing to hear men of reputed understanding extol the name of some public prostitute and ridicule the precepts of their god  the custom of every mans singing in turn is still considerably more ridiculous and commonly as profane at any of these joyous meetings even i who have a voice more disagreeable than the grating of a gate upon hinges and know no more of music than a hottentot can never get excused but must make myself ridiculous in attempting what i am utterly incapable of and disturb the very people who drive me most importunately on how often have i been teized to sing by a number of my intimate acquaintance and yet the moment i began there was no possibility of concealing their disgust they whispered one another gave a forced attention or lolled insipidly in their chairs stroking the pleats of their ruffles or playing with the chain of their watch then longing impatiently till i had finished gave a faint bravo and called out for a toast from the next member in rotation whilst i sat frying the whole time from a conscious incapacity to please and a strange necessity of giving a general dissatisfaction  perhaps sir no custom in the world is so very dangerous or unpardonable as toasting it levels all distinction in constitutions and obliges a man in an indifferent state of health to drink as much as him that is blessed with the strength of a hercules it is the immediate parent of noise and intoxication and amongst people of the best sense answers no other purpose but to leave them without any sense at all  how preposterous a notion is it my dear sir to suppose our joyous societies stimulated by the principles of true benevolence or real esteem when every man has a design upon the weakness or constitution of his friend and pushes the glass about for no other purpose but to prejudice his health and destroy his understanding nay when we make it our chiefest glory to have drank him out of all knowledge of order all regard for himself and all veneration for his god when we reduce him to a state of absolute phrenzy or stupefaction and either expose him to the numberless quarrels attending the first or the multitude of accidents peculiar to the last of these situations but sir i want to acquaint you with an affair of some consequence here harry hesitated and here i postpone the account of this affair till my next paper  numb xxiii saturday july    i shall now resume the subject of my foregoing paper and show one of the many thousand ill consequences which proceed from the modern method of being joyous and the illiberal indulgence of the glass at the most friendly of our general entertainments  the matter of consequence which my nephew harry wanted to acquaint me with was the following note which he received from mr bumber at whose house he had spent the preceding evening just as he was stepping out to chat half an hour with me at my chambers  to h rattle esquire sir last night you refused drinking kitty edwards who was my toast and on that occasion offered several newfashioned arguments in support of your behavior which testified nothing more than a peculiarity of temper but did no very great credit to the acknowledged goodness of your understanding  after you had refused my toast no gentleman in company once asked you to drink his though all took notice of your unaccountable singularity  the regard i must entertain for my own honor and the respect which is due to my friends oblige me to request an interview at the bedford by one to demand an explanation of this affair which i was last night hindered from enquiring into by my fears of disturbing the company and the consideration of my own house  i am sir your humble servant richard bumper   i had no sooner read the letter than harry cried out you see sir the consequence of being an advocate for common sense  here i must have my throat cut for refusing to drink the health of an infamous strumpet or in vindication of my conduct cut the throat of my friend  what would you advise me to the time draws on and i would not have mr bumper wait a moment for the universe why harry says i go instantly and hear what the gentleman has to say but be sure remember that your life is not to be set at stake for a glass of wine or an abandoned woman little regard soever as mr bumper may entertain for his and let matters turn out as they will come back as soon as possible and tell me the consequence of your interview  harry promised a punctual observance of my advice and request and accordingly came back in a couple of hours after and related the substance of his conversation with mr bumper which for the greater ease of my readers i shall set down as it was spoken inserting the name of the speaker at the same time in the margin   rattle mr bumper your most obedient i am come pursuant to a note you have honored me with this morning written in a very unexpected as well as extraordinary style to know in what manner i have been unhappy enough to give you the least offense   bumper the question is utterly unnecessary mr rattle the manner of offending me is plainly enough declared in my letter and nothing remains now to be discussed but the motive   rattle this will not take us up much time sir for be assured i had not the least motive for offending you at all   bumper this is very odd mr rattle why then did you refuse my toast   rattle because i saw no reason why if mr bumper would disgrace his understanding that i should offer a palpable indignity to mine  i have been too long the slave of company and custom but for the future am determined never to testify so public a mark of respect as a toast for any man or woman who are justly the universal objects of detestation or contempt  to drink the health of a rascal is an approbation of his conduct and a toast to the name of an infamous woman destroys any merit that can dwell upon a glass in compliment to a valuable one   bumper these with a sneer cynical sentiments may do very well in speculation mr rattle but give me leave to assert with all possible deference to the superiority of your boasted understanding that the practice will be somewhat difficult and further more let me add that you will be frequently liable to explain this ridiculous deviation from the general rules of company or reduced to a necessity of keeping no company at all   rattle briskly and be assured mr bumper i never shall regret the loss of that company which looks upon common sense as an enemy to it is mirth or institution   bumper but dont you think sir that the refusal of a toast may be justly considered an actual disrespect to the giver and that upon that occasion he has a right by the rules of custom to call the refuser to an account   rattle sir you may call any man to an account when you will  but consider whether reason justifies or condemns the proceeding  come come mr bumper it is not for you and i to make a serious affair of a trifle i again repeat that i had no notion of offending you and i fancy you can recollect instances enough where my veracity has not admitted of a dispute  i am sorry to see you so warm upon this occasion but let me ask your heart if it thinks the refusal of drinking a strumpets health a crime that deserves the murder of your friend   bumper sir it is not the disrespect offered to her but to myself   rattle interrupting then you own that she is not worth quarrelling for and yet make yourself so much a part of her as to run the most extravagant lengths in her defense  my dear bumper you may see from this the impropriety of all toasting for you might as well run me through the body for not falling in love with any woman you think proper to mention as be offended at my refusing to drink her health  the question is not to be decided by the laws of custom but by the rules of reason and what a figure must a man make in any argument where he denies truth and understanding a liberty to judge  upon the whole dick if you are determined to cut my throat you must but do not commit an unnecessary murder to convince me of what i am already convinced that you have spirit enough to resent a real injury nor seek out imaginary provocations to show how ready you would be in chastising an absolute affront   here the affair happily terminated much to the honor of both parties who are now warmer friends than ever and afford by the propriety of their reconciliation a sensible lesson to the giddily spirited part of the public  numb xxiv saturday july    to the babbler sir great an opposition as there seems between vanity and meanness yet if we take but ever so cursory a view of the world we shall find them to be pretty general companions and scarcely meet a single instance in which there can be discovered any shadow of exception  among my own sex particulary mr babbler vanity is the parent of so many meannesses that i am actually surprised when we endeavor to give ourselves most consequence that we never perceive how we forfeit all the dignity we just before possessed and in the ridiculous attempt of arrogating our own importance leave ourselves in short without any real importance at all  this is never more the case sir than when we listen to the solicitations of your sex and for the sake of a despicable compliment to our teeth or our complexion overlook the unpardonable affront which it generally conveys and take no notice of the very poor opinion it insinuates both for the purity of our hearts and the rectitude of our understandings  we suffer the most illiberal addresses to be paid us if they are but softened with the words angel and goddess and admit a designing villain as often as he pleases into our presence though we know our ruin and disgrace are the only objects of his pursuit if he but praises the color of our hair and tells us we are possessed of finer eyes than the rest of our acquaintance  in short sir we are willing a man should think there is a probability of our launching into infamy and prostitution for the sake of hearing our persons commended and perfectly reconciled while he treats us on a footing with the handsomest women he may know to his thinking that in time he shall number us with the very worst  a woman sir whenever she is told of her beauty with a grave face should first of all consider the purpose for which she may be addressed in this manner and reflect upon the motive which may actuate the person who professes himself so sensible of her perfections  nothing is more dangerous than to suffer continued repetitions of this style it gradually becomes more and more pleasing to the ear and there is besides too natural a promptitude in the female mind to think favorably of those who seem to think passionately of us  a language of this nature therefore should be highly alarming to our ears for many a woman who thought herself impregnable has in a length of time grown so enamoured of her own praise that she could not possibly exist without the person who administered it and has at last made a surrender at discretion when had she first of all capitulated on terms she might have insisted on the very best  let us only reduce the general tendency of modern addresses into plain english mr babbler and ask the most indiscreet of the sex if they can in their conscience discover them to be a jot better than this  madam i look upon you as a fool and one whom i have a strong inclination to make a strumpet for which reason i intend to talk continually of your charms and by sacrificing in that manner to your vanity i have no doubt but in a few days i shall bring you to an utter disregard of morality and virtue to an absolute contempt of all the laudable sentiments which you have been imbibing so many years and a total indifference for your own reputation and the honor of your sex as i think your wickedness equal to your folly i beg when i mention the word beauty that you will prefer the gratification of the man who is your greatest enemy to the peace of those who are your unalterable friends nor hesitate a moment to break the heart of a parent that tenderly loves you to please an infamous scoundrel who labors for your everlasting disgrace  in short madam i expect in return for a paltry compliment to your person that you scruple not to endure continual shame in this world nor shrink at hazarding your eternal happiness in the next but run at once to plunge a dagger into the breast of your father and hurl an impious defiance at the very throne of your god  i had myself mr babbler lately two or three lovers who kindly said very pretty things to my person and would you believe it that one of them was a married man  this gentleman came one day with all the easy impudence in life and with as much composure as if he had been really performing a meritorious action threw himself at my feet and swore he could not live unless i pitied him  had i a dagger i believe i should have stuck it in the villains heart however assuming all the anger i possibly could in a face not naturally the most placid i mentioned some thoughts of paying a visit to his wife which effectually banished him from my presence without doing the smallest injury to his health or disturbing in the least the usual serenity of his temper  a lord next told me i was the most angelic piece of flesh and blood he had ever beheld and solicited in good earnest that i would bless him with my favorable opinion but i had no sooner talked of coronets on my coach than the truly honorable earl sneaked instantly off excusing himself on account of a treaty then in agitation with lady betty squander  what you men think of us mr babbler i know not nor indeed can i conceive what we women in general think of ourselves but of this i am absolutely certain that while we continue so intolerably vain we must be liable to an infinity of meannesses and that the surest way for any woman to be undone is to think there is nobody comparable to herself  sophia  numb xxv saturday july  0 of all the requisites essentially necessary to form a matrimonial felicity a parity of ages may possibly be the very first and if we were to take a nice survey of the various disproportioned matches which unhappily might be found within the weekly bills the endless anxieties subsisting between each would be sufficient to frighten any prudent parent from bestowing his daughters hand where there was not some equality of years and at least a probability that her reason would in time reconcile her to a husband who perhaps might not at first be the object of her choice  i am very well aware that many a careful father and antiquated lover will be apt to exclaim against this assertion the first from an oeconomical consideration of the main chance and the latter from a natural insensibility which every man entertains for his own imperfections and infirmities but could the one be brought to a belief that wealth at the best of times is a very precarious foundation for happiness and the other be only prevailed upon to throw self aside for a moment or two extraordinary as the position may seem on a partial consideration both would nevertheless allow it to be of no little force  casual aversions may be lessened in time by an invariable tenderness and an unexceptionable conduct in a husband personal defects by being habitual to the eye gradually lessen on the imagination and by an uninterrupted familiarity very frequently cease to be disagreeable much more continue to give perpetual disgust but a disparity of years is an obstacle never to be surmounted every day gives it an additional force and contrary to the general nature of all other evils for in this case we must inevitably call it an evil instead of being mitigated by the lenient hand of time it becomes every moment more and more incapable of alleviation or cure  but besides the long train of disagreeable reflections which the bare circumstance of age is of itself capable of exciting in the bosom of any young woman the innumerable list of diseases which are it is inseparable attendants occasion still stronger aversion and in reality a young lady has but too much ground for anxiety and distress when she considers herself as a sacrifice to same venerable dotard and instead of the reasonable pleasures she might justly promise herself upon entering the world as a wife sees nothing before her but the gloomy prospect of becoming a nurse to an emaciated wretch worn away with the consequences of juvenile intemperance and absolutely dying with gouts palsies rheumatisms coughs and catarrhs  contradictions so very opposite as extreme youth and age there is hardly a possibility of reconciling  a fine sprightly girl of nineteen or twenty must naturally wish for amusements adapted to her time of life and languish for such enjoyments as are naturally repugnant to the sentiments as well as the infirmities of crazy fourscore the situation of such a couple is easily imagined the lady must be continually unhappy at being thus debarred after the sacrifice she has made from every entertainment suitable to her temper and her years and the gentleman as constantly miserable at possessing an impotent authority productive of nothing but eternal suspicions of her conduct and the sharpest reflections on his own  it is in vain to expect that the rectitude of a womans education thus circumstanced or the excellence of her understanding will be a means of procuring even a tolerable tranquillity or content the more understanding she possesses the more she must despise the selfinterested dotard who was utterly regardless of her inclinations who in all probability used his utmost influence with a misguided and inexorable parent to tear her from some deserving young fellow on whom her soul was unalterably fixed and perhaps had her dragged to the bridal bed like another niobe stiffning into horror or dissolving in her tears  in a situation of this nature how a man can be weak enough to look for tenderness or affection from any young lady is to me a miracle nor am i less surprised how he can think of exciting her gratitude by indulging her in trivial points when he has so infamously injured her in the most capital of all her everlasting hatred and abhorrence are the only returns he can reasonably look for and if there is a possibility for her to view him with less than an insuperable contempt i am satisfied he must look upon her as a creature utterly divested of sensibility and soul and view her with an absolute contempt himself  an infinity of reasons might be urged against the disparity of age in matrimonial connections but as i have lately received a story on this subject which will set this affair in a stronger light than a volume of declamatory arguments i shall conclude the subject for the present with this observation that he who marries a woman whom he knows has an attachment for another man must look for wretchedness and he that marries a woman contrary to her inclination in reality deserves it  numb xxvi saturday august   to the babbler sir i am one of those unhappy old blockheads whose passions outlive the power of indulgence and are perpetually dreaming of a marriage bed instead of thinking seriously about the purchase of a winding sheet  i am turned of sixtyfive worn away to a skeleton by a variety of diseases the consequence of my youthful indiscretion and am almost six months married to an amiable unhappy woman just bordering on twentytwo  being last easter sir at my sons in the country i accidentally saw a young lady who was intimately acquainted with my granddaughter sally and whom on enquiry i found to be the daughter of a curate lately settled in those parts who had nothing to maintain a wife and four children but a slender forty pounds a year  maria the young ladys name in question was the eldest and had no other fortune than a most engaging person an irresistible face a good heart and a fine understanding  these however had procured her the addresses of one mr markham a very worthy young fellow in the neighborhood who had newly set up in the grocery trade with a capital of  000l and who by her fathers permission and the consent of his own friends was to be married to her on the sunday fortnight following  there was a something so engaging about maria mr babbler as strangely affected me and made me at once both very uneasy and very much ashamed all thoughts of an intercourse with the sex at my time of life i was sensible should have totally subsided yet notwithstanding a conviction of that nature i was determined if there was a possibility or my succeeding to have her  in vain my son pointed out the ridicule i should incur by so disproportioned a match in vain did my daughter nay my granddaughter too endeavor to laugh me out of so preposterous a design and in vain did my own reflection dwell upon the striking disparity of years and the greatness of my infirmities  my authority silenced the remonstrances of my children and my vanity turned a deaf ear to the selfconvicted poignancy of my own  the circumstance of years i thought my generosity would sufficiently counterballance and as for my disorders i fancied my cough was considerably abated and that under a proper regimen my gout might be rendered less troublesome and the rheum of my eyes totally removed  i sent for an empiric to make me a handsome set of teeth exchanged my venerable tie for a smart fashionable bob affected to read without spectacles and threw by my crutch headed stick  not to trouble you sir mr grasply marias father the moment i proposed a jointure was in a transport a promise of providing for his other children threw him into an ecstacy and the reversion of a good living on my own estate rendered him incapable of speaking a single word  maria after a thousand entreaties and as many floods of tears not to be sacrificed as she called it and a vain attempt of escaping to her dear mr markham was dragged to church in three days after and came home mrs totterly  having thus fortunately secured her for my wife i thought my felicity almost completed and that the moment her tears were a little dried up i should be the happiest of men  but alas mr babbler i found a great difference betwixt the possession of an unwilling hand and the enjoyment of a warm reciprocally beating heart it required but small penetration to discover that i was the object of her unalterable aversion and that the violence i had done to her real inclinations would plant perpetual thorns on her pillow and fix everlasting anxiety on mine  i will not trouble you mr babbler with a repetition of particular circumstances suffice it that notwithstanding i have used every method i could possibly devise to excite her gratitude or engage her esteem in the calmest of her moments she looks upon me with a rooted hatred or a contemptuous disgust  i in vain tempt her with equipage and dress if the carriage is ordered to the door she has the head ach and if i order home a fresh piece of silk it is thrown neglected on the floor  instead of mixing with society she shuts herself up the principal part of the day in her closet and if i chance by accident to break in i surprise her in tears  if my infirmities oblige me to the use of a separate bed i am uneasy at being from her and yet i am miserable by the horror she expresses in her looks if they do not if she chances to doze the heaviness of her sighs distract me to the last degree and if she mentions the word markham in her dreams as she frequently does it is a scorpion of the most deadly nature and stings me to the heart  upon the whole mr babbler asleep or awake at bed or at board i am the most miserable of men and what like a ridiculous dotard i fancied would prove the greatest blessing of my life by a just dispensation of providence turns out my unalterable curse  o sir to a man not altogether destitute of sensibility what situation can be so truly wretched as mine without a friend to whom i can vent my griefs without a bosom which i dare beg to pity my distress to be despised by the woman i dote upon to madness and to be a real object of contempt to myself is too much  to be loaded with years and so born down with infirmities as to stand one continued mummy of emacation one complicated hoard of disease is a dreadful reflection for a new married man  a man totally incapable of inspiring a passion of the least tender nature and as totally incapable of gratifying it if he could  from my story let other dotards beware of following my example for be assured mr babbler wherever there is a striking disparity of years and the odds against the man a very little time will convince him of his error and make him wish with me that he had sent for an undertaker and been buried fifty fathom quick before he made so preposterous a choice of a wife  i am sir etc charles totterly  numb xxvii saturday august    i supped last night at my sister rattles where the discourse turning upon the edudation of children my favorite harry related a little story with which i was prodigiously affected and as it conveys a very pretty moral i shall make no apology for presenting it to my readers  a worthy old gentleman who had by an inflexible industry acquired a large fortune with great reputation at length declining business devoted his sole attention to the settlement of an only son of whom he was uncommonly fond  in a little time he married him to a woman of family and judging of the sons affection by his own made over every shilling he was worth to the young gentleman desiring nothing more than to be a witness of his happiness in the same house and depending upon his gratitude for any cursory trifle he might want for the private use of his purse  the son had not been married however above six weeks before he was under the sole dominion of his wife and prevailed upon to treat the old gentleman with the most mortifying neglect  if he wanted the carriage for an airing why truly my lady has engaged it if he desired to mix in any little party of pleasure they were quite full he was suffered to sit whole evenings without being once spoken to at table he was obliged to call three or four times for a glass of wine or a bit of bread and if he ever entered into a narrative of any transaction which occurred in his youth his obliging daughter inlaw immediately broke in upon him and politely introduced a conversation upon something else  this unpardonable contempt was at last carried to such a degree that his cough was complained of as troublesome and under a pretense that his tobacco box was insupportable he was requested to eat in his own room  four or five years passed on in this manner which were rendered a little tolerable by the birth of a grandson a most engaging boy who from the moment he was capable of distinguishing seemed to be very fond of the old gentleman and by an almost instinctive attachment appeared as if providentially designed to atone for the unnatural ingratitude of it is father  he was now turned of four when one day some persons of fashion dining at the house the old gentleman who knew nothing of the company came down into the back parlour to enquire for his little favorite who had been two whole hours out of his apartment he had no sooner opened the door than his dutiful son before a room full of people asked him how he dare break in upon him without leave and desired him to get instantly up about his business  the old gentleman withdrew according to order returned to his own room and gave a very hearty freedom to his tears  little tommy who could not bear to hear his grandpapa chided at such a rate followed him instantly and observing how heartily he sobbed came roaring down to the parlour and before the whole company bawled out papa has made poor grandpapa break his heart he will cry his eyes out above stairs  the son who was really shamed of his conduct especially as he saw no sign of approbation in the faces of his friends endeavored to put an easy appearance on the affair and brazen it out turning round therefore to the child he desired him to carry a blanket to grandpapa and bid him go beg  ay but i will not give him all the blanket returned the child  why so my dear says the father because answered he i shall want half for you when i grow up to be a man and turn you out of doors  the childs reproof stung the father to the soul and held up at once both the cruelty and ingratitude of his conduct in their proper dies nay the wise seemed affected and wanted words a good natured tear dropped from more than one of the company who seized this opportunity of condemning in a very candid manner their behavior to so effectionate a father and so bountiful a friend and in short made them so heartily ashamed of themselves that the old gentleman was immediately sent for by both who in the presence of all most humbly entreated his forgiveness for every thing past and promised the business of their lives would be to oblige him for the future  the poor old gentlemans joy threatened now to be much more fatal than his affliction a little before  he looked upon his son and daughter for some time with a mute astonishment mixed with a tenderness impossible to be described and then fixing his eyes upon the company with a wildness of inconceivable rapture snatched up his little tommy to his bosom who joined him in a hearty flood of tears  there is nothing in reality where people are so very wrong as the education of children though there is nothing in which they ought to be more absolutely certain of being right if we seriously reflect upon the customary method in which children are brought up we must almost imagine that the generality of parents inculcate principles of religion and virtue into their offspring for the mere satisfaction of bringing both religion and virtue into contempt and paint the precepts of morality in the most engaging colors to show by their practice how much these precepts are to be despised  my friend ned headstrong is a parent of this cast he is continually preaching up a rectitude of conduct to a very sensible young fellow his son and yet as continually destroying by his example what he labors to effect by his advice ned expatiates largely about patience under the dispensations of providence and yet will fly into a passion of the most ungovernable nature if a leg of mutton is boiled a minute too much  i have heard him launch forth in the praise of fortitude while he has not been able to overcome the chagrin occasioned by spilling a drop of port upon the tablecoth and very frequently listened to a lecture against a profligate mention of the divine name interspersed with a variety of horrid execrations  the same preposterous inconsistency in the education of an only daughter is a distinguishing peculiar of lady dye dawd e  her ladyship is no great gadabout for she lies in bed all the day and plays at cards all night she cannot be accused of misbehaviour in church for i am not suppose she has been once at a place of public worship these twenty years  a tradesman can never call twice at her house for a bill for there is not one who has the least acquaintance with her character that would trust her with a yard of ribbon or a row of pins  her reputation has never been suspected for there is not a man in england who would think it worth his while to accept of the highest favor she should possibly grant and as for her veracity that can by no means admit of a debate for it is a question with me if she spoke a syllable of truth since her arrival at maturity  yet notwithstanding all these negative perfections she is continually prescribing a contrary practice to her daughter and perpetually condemning the young lady for the least imitation of what she is unceasing practisingly herself  i shall conclude this paper with a bit of advice addressed to every order of my readers  if a parent in reality would have his son a good man let him teach by his practice as much as by his precept and never through a doting partiality overlook those actions in a child which he would inevitably condemn in any body else finally let all parents from the introductory part of this paper consider that it is no disgrace for a son to be dependant on a fathers bounty but that nothing can be more dangerous than for a father to be dependant on a sons  numb xxviii saturday august  0 there is no set of men to whom i have a greater aversion than your professed sayers of bon mots or sputterers of good things who go into company for no other reason in nature but to catch at every little opportunity of being smart and build a reputation of wit and vivacity upon the harmless peculiarities or casual indiscretions of their acquaintance this species of impertinents if we properly examine the principles upon which they act are not more to be despised for the continual air of selfsufficiency they assume than for the malevolence of their dispositions in wishing to disconcert where real goodnature and true politeness should be studious to oblige yet notwithstanding the greatest number of these worthy gentlemen affect a superiority of understanding above the rest of the world a sensible observer will find that the very best is seldom more than a squirt charged with the trite relations of despicable jest books and commonplace remarks to be let off as occasion may arise in whatever company it may be their fortune to be introduced  as the vanity of being admired engrosses their whole ambition a wit of this class is not less a disagreeable acquaintance than a dangerous friend he is incapable of confidence and wherever a secret of the most important nature with which he is trusted may unhappily interfere with an opportunity of gratifying his natural propensity his discretion is in an instant kicked down stairs by his pride and the peace of a whole family in all probability sacrificed to an indelicate repartee or an ignorant joke nay no consideration either moral or religious is able to restrain the torrent of his impertinence and is it not too common a circumstance that where human obligations afford him no subject of exercising his talents that he bursts at once through the most awful of the divine and circulates a daring laugh at the mandates of his god in short the most bearable of this fraternity is always a plague to society and not very seldom a disgrace  should we carry our speculations on this subject still farther it might probably be found that one half of our modern infidels is produced by the absurd affection of saying a good thing and the desire of being thought uncommonly shrewd by the generality of the world in order to effect this a singularity of opinion is first of all adopted and the more dangerous this opinion is the more it answers the purpose of being talked of and renders the person who adopts it pointed out from the ordinary classes of mankind this singularity of sentiment of course occasions a singularity of expression and the consequence at last is that the unhappy wretch who thus aims at universal admiration jests himself out of every sensible and worthy mans esteem here and laughs away his hopes of hereafter too  an old schoolfellow of mine poor dick brazen is one of those men whose principal study is to attract the attention of their acquaintance by a smartness of repartee and a poignancy of satire in the application of a joke dicks whole labor these forty years has been to make himself a very disagreeable companion and i cannot help saying he has been no way disappointed in his end the moment he enters a room and makes his bow he sits with the utmost patience to catch at any expression which may admit of a sarcasm and is sure without any regard to the condition or sex of the speaker to use his best endeavors to turn it into ridicule or contempt if nothing of this kind happens he make himself the hero of some little tale and perhaps tells a hundred impertinent stories for the sake of relating what he said upon such and such a circumstance how he put lady thisthing out of countenance with an observation upon a pincushion and cut up sir john the other with a stroke upon a snuff box the worst of all is the same observation which that celebrated reprobate the earl of rochester made on charles the second for the continual repetition of his stories may with all imaginable justice be applied to mr brazen that monarch had a custom of telling every day in the circle a thousand trifling occurrences of his youth and would constantly repeat them over and over again without the smallest variation so that such of his courtiers as were acquainted with his majestys foible would instantly retreat whenever he began any of his narrations  my lord rochester being with him one day took the liberty of being very severe upon that head your majesty says he has undoubtedly the best memory in the world i have heard you repeat the same story without the variation of a syllable every day these ten years but what i think extraordinary is that you never recollect you generally tell it to the same set of auditors  this is mr brazens fault and indeed the fault of ever worthy member of his brotherhood they are very happy in remembering every good thing they have said but constantly forget they have retailed it perhaps five hundred times upon the same company  i shall conclude this paper with an anecdote of the identical mr brazen whom i have thus taken the liberty of introducing to my readers and which i think is a general picture of all the clever fellows of this class within the bills of mortality being carried to sup one night by a friend with a company of very sensible people whom he had never seen before dick was so very much pleased that he was extremely mortified or in other words found no opportunity of exercising his talent for bon mots  being asked to the same party a second time no no says he i have been disappointed already and will never sit twice in a company which i cannot laugh

which he both despises and abhors and is reduced to the dreadful alternative of intailing infamy on his name for life or bursting at once through the laws of his country and violating the commands of his god  you will easily apprehend that i intend to trouble you on the fatal consequences of duelling  i do sir and have a tale to unfold that must drench your humanity in tears  i am the wretched relict of the most amiable of men  three months ago i was the happiest of my sex  what am i now  but you shall hear sir  i am a young woman of twenty three and about five years ago married a most deserving young man of fortune equal to my own by whom i have four children every one if the doting fondness of a mother may be credited the little emblem of it is ever to be regretted father  during the little space of our marriage mr wellworth seemed to live for no other purpose but to oblige me and i hope it will not be looked upon as vanity if i say my everlasting study was to make every thing agreeable to him  in short sir i scarcely imagined a hereafter could add to my felicity nor formed a single wish beyond the approbation of my husband  one evening sir mr wellworth supped abroad with a party of friends and came home with a good humor which was visibly constrained  however as he repeatedly assured me that nothing was the matter i rather accused myself of unnecessary apprehension than supposed he was really disturbed  that evening he was more than usually tender to me and paid an extraordinary attention to the children he went up to the nursery kissed each separately three or four times and blessed them with an uncommon energy of expression  we retired in a little time after and judge my distraction mr babbler when my woman woke me in the morning with the following letter  my adorable maria before this reaches your hands i am no more last night colonel melmoth and i had a difference about political opinions  he challenged and laid me under the disagreeable necessity of giving him the meeting  pity me my only love  what could i do  shame disgrace and infamy hung upon my name if i refused though now that the awful prospect of eternity opens upon my imagination i could with the circumstance undone  an allgracious an allforgiving deity will i humbly hope however prove more merciful than a relentless world and therefore a crime which from the weakness of humanity and the unhappy custom of my country i was in a manner forced to may possibly meet with forgiveness above  but must i leave my children  must i be torn for ever from my wife  o maria is it possible to imagine how i have loved  in life you were the only mistress of my heart in death you possess it wholly too  my strength fails  colonel melmoth lies dead  o maria take care of our helpless little innocents and be sure when charley grows up to inculcate such principles in his mind as may make him avoid the rashness of his father and sacrifice every consideration to the mandates of his god  and now an everlasting adieu  and may the eternal father of mercy shower down his choicest blessings on you and my poor babes is the dying prayer of your own  charles wellworth   what became of me for a whole fortnight after the receipt of this dreadful letter mr babbler i cannot pretend to tell  my mother says i was in a state of absolute distraction and frequently made attempts upon my own life  however by degrees they reduced me to something like tranquillity and argued me into a resolution to live through a consideration for my children  such sir are the consequences of duelling from being the most fortunate wife in the universe i have nothing in my imagination now but a slaughtered husband and from being the happiest mother in the world i cannot see my little orphans without inconceivable anguish and distress  o sir is this false this ridiculous punctilio of honor to be supported not only with the loss of the parties lives but with the ruin of their families why will not gentlemen consider that their rashness not only exposes their own breasts to the sword of their adversaries but plants it in the bosom of their friends a man with a wife and children sir abstracted from any consideration of a religious nature has no right to be lavish of his safety his life is the property of his family and is absolutely necessary for their defense  i wish sir the legislative power would take some steps to prevent this horrid custom and make it an object of their contempt as well as the mark of their resentment till this is done punishment will be ineffectual and o that it may be speedily done is the hearty wish of  yours etc maria wellworth  numb xxx saturday september   there is nothing at which i am more offended than the unpardonable vein of ignorance and brutality so generally introduced in our drinking songs nor any thing in my opinion which throws a greater reflection upon the understanding of a sensible society if we examine the principal number of these pretty compositions we shall find that absolute intoxication is recommended as the highest felicity in the world and receive the most positive assurances of being upon an equality with angels the very moment we sink ourselves into a situation considerably lower than men  to look back to the original design of all poetical composition is needless since every body knows that it was to praise and honor the supreme being with a fervency of devotion which could not be found in the common form of words  this glorification of the deity and the instruction of his creatures appearing therefore to be the grand view of poetry how much is it to be lamented that a science of so sublime a nature should be prostituted to such infamous ends and instead of being applied to the purposes of religion and virtue be directed to the support of a vice productive of innumerable ills  it has been justly observed that every nation in proportion as it is civilized has abolished intemperance in wine and consequently must be barbarous in proportion as it is addicted to excess  the remark i am rather apprehensive will be found no very great compliment to the people of this kingdom we are apt to place good fellowship in riot and have but too natural a promptitude in imagining that the happiness of an evening is promoted by an extravagant circulation of the glass hence are our songs of festivity as i have already taken notice fraught with continual encomiums on the pleasures of intoxication and the whole tribe of bacchanalian lyrics perpetually telling us how wonderfully sensible it is to destroy our senses and how nothing can be more rational in a human creature than to drink till he has not left himself a single glimmer of reason at all  but if abstracted from the brutal intention of our drinking songs in general we should come to consider their merit as literary performances how very few of them should we find worth a station on a coblers stall or deserving the attention of an auditory at billingsgate  the best are but so many despicable strings of unmeaning puns and illimagined conceits and betray not more the ignorance of their encouragers than the barrenness of their authors  let me only ask the warmest advocate for this species of composition what upon a cool reflection he thinks of the following song  by the gaily cirling glass we can see how minutes pass by the hollow cask we are told how the waining night grows old soon too soon the busy day calls us from our sports away what have we with day to do sons of care twas made for you the foregoing little song though one of the least offensive in the whole round of a bon vivant collection has neither thought nor expression to recommend it and can when sung be termed no more than an agreeable piece of impertinence calculated to supply a want of understanding in a company i forbear to mention the bigbellied bottle and a variety of similar productions which are universally known and deserve to be as universally despicable but i shall conclude this paper however with a song which i would recommend as an example to such gentlemen as are fond of celebrating the grape though no way ambitious to do it at the expense of good sense and morality  the judicious bacchanal while the bottle to humor and social delight the smallest assistance can lend while it happily keeps up the laugh of the night or enlivens the mind of a friend o let me enjoy it ye bountiful powers that my time may deliciously pass and should care ever think to intrude on my hours scare the haggard away with a glass but instead of a rational feast of the sense should discord preside over the bowl and folly debate or contention commence from too great an expansion of soul should the man i esteem or the friend of my breast in the ivy feel naught but the rod should i make sweet religion a profligate jest and daringly sport with my god from my lips dash the poison o merciful fate where the madness or blasphemy hung and let every accent which virtue should hate parch quick on my infamous tongue from my sight let the curse be eternally driven where my reason so fatally strayed that no more i may offer an insult to heaven or give man a cause to upbraid numb xxxi saturday september  0 an easiness of behavior through the common occurrences of life is a point in which almost every person thinks himself an admirable proficient yet it is nevertheless a matter in which almost every person is very widely deceived we are all of us too apt to mistake the grossest extremities for the criterion of perfection and seldom imagine that we have reached the necessary goal of goodbreeding till we have left it at an astonishing distance behind  an endeavor at an extraordinary degree of politeness is a rock upon which numbers are perpetually splitting and what is most surprising the variety of examples instead of deterring us from n imitation of the practice are rather additional incentives for the continuation of the pursuit naturally prompt to think we ourselves possess more abilities than our neighbors we are perpetually solicitous for their being displayed and confining our observations for ever to the agreeable side of things we absolutely forget that they have the smallest reverse  mrs notable an old widow cousin of my own is the very quintescence of modern politeness and good nature once every christmas i have the honor of an invitation among a great number of other relations and then have a perfect opportunity of contemplating the elaborate ease of this obliging gentlewoman the moment we enter she makes it a particular rule to enquire after the health of the whole company and the instant we are seated comes regularly round to every individual and demands a circumstantial account of the minutest occurrence since she had last the happiness of seeing us if any one by accident has labored under a slight cold all the recipes in the complete housewife are thundered about our ears and an infinity of lamentations poured out for so irreparable a misfortune unhappily indeed at our last meeting none of us had the least complaint to mention which i found was a mortification of no trifling kind to my cousin however she would not be robbed of an opportunity of showing both her knowledge and politeness and therefore introduced her favorite topic with the greatest facility good naturedly lamenting a second time for a sore throat which my sister rattle had been laid up with the preceding twelvemonth  but if this preparatory account of mrs notables politeness has given the reader a high opinion of her character what will he say when i carry him through the ceremony of dinner and touch upon the unremitting solicitude which she manifests for the accommodation of the company notwithstanding her table is generally as well supplied as any womans in the kingdom and notwithstanding she does not a little pique herself upon the elegance of this annual entertainment yet the moment it is brought up we have a thousand excuses made for the poverty of our dinner  well lord i dont believe you can touch a bit on it  but you are so good  though i wonder how you come a second time to a place so utterly unprovided  this we understand as a proper cue to praise every thing before us and then are obliged to stand a whole volley of encomiums on our extraordinary goodness till at last when we have in a manner half burst ourselves and are told how very little we have eat a fresh concern for the badness of our entertainment concludes the feast and relieves us a little from the fatigue of such extraordinary politeness  how widely different is the conduct of sir harry downright  from an utter aversion to ceremony he becomes actually the rudest fellow alive and when he borders upon a brutality of behavior calls it an easiness arising from goodnature and friendly familiarity in the company of the ladies he sits constantly covered never helps a soul at his own table though he has an absolute stranger at dinner nor ever makes any scruple to tell a woman she lies in plain english as sir harry would not be thought a coxcomb for the universe he carefully avoids the smallest indication of that character in his appearance he seldom shaves above once a week scarcely ever combs his hair chews an enormous quantity of tobacco and makes a point of going into well dressed companies with a dirty shirt upon the whole to escape the imputation of ceremonious he becomes in all places offensive and for fear of deviating into an effeminate puppy as he calls it he throws off all pretension to decency and sinks into an absolute brute  the extremes of behavior are what every person of sense should cautiously study to avoid since an excess of ceremony cannot fail of subjecting us to ridicule and a total risregard of politeness must naturally expose us to contempt difficult however as the proper system of conduct may appear i shall be bold enough to lay down one rule which will in my opinion entirely comprize it and serve as a just conclusion to the present paper in all companies let a man endeavor to please rather than expect to be pleased and if this does not gain him many friends i shall not scruple to affirm that it will never procure him a single enemy  numb xxxii saturday september    filial piety is a flower of so delicate a nature that we meet but very few places which can produce it and though we frequently hear of parents who ruin themselves for the sake of their children yet we seldom or ever hear of children who do any extraordinary acts of kindness to their parents  perhaps nature has formed the parental sensibility infinitely more exquisite than the filial and for some wise purpose implanted a much greater fondness on our minds for those we beget and educate than for those by whom we are begotten and educated ourselves at least custom has firmly established such different sentiments relative to the behavior of parent and child that it is thought a matter of the highest praise in a wealthy son to settle a paltry fifty pound for life on a distressed and worthy father but an action of little or no merit in a father to settle twenty times the sum upon an indigent son i supped last night at my sister rattles where i generally hear something new and was entertained by my nephew harry with the following exception to the foregoing position which i flatter myself will prove no disagreeable relation to my readers  an eminent merchant whose name i think necessary to conceal under that of webley married a most amiable woman with whom he received a considerable fortune and by whom he was blessed in the first year with a daughter called maria mrs webley however unhappily catching a cold during the time of her lyingin did not long survive the birth of her child but died in about three months after with her last breath conjuring her husband to be particularly attentive to the welfare of the unfortunate little maria  mr webley for two years before his marriage had been connected with a subtle designing woman by whom he also had a daughter nor did his having a wife put an end to the guilty intercourse under pretense of important business he frequently staid in town with her a night or two in the week while mrs webley was down at the country house in hertfordshire and as frequently carried her into the country with him whenever he knew his lady could not conveniently leave town  his marriage in fact was rather an engagement of interest than a union of inclination and mrs webleys fortune enabling him to live up to the summit of his wishes the moment she was interred he thought there was no farther necessity for restraint or disguise  in short six weeks had scarcely elapsed when he married the abandoned woman we have been speaking of and pitched upon the most profligate of her sex to supply the place of the very best  we shall pass over the time of marias infancy when she experienced little more than the diminitive cruelty of a narrowminded mother inlaw and come at once to that period which may be justly reckoned the most important of her life she had just entered on her eighteenth year and was blooming into all the perfections of her sex when mrs webley began to think of executing a scheme which she had long in agitation  she saw maria treated by every body with the greatest respect and beheld her own daughter though dressed out in all the fashionable foppery of the times and infinitely more attended to received with a degree of insipid civility that bordered upon contempt  the shameful neglect which maria experienced at home gave a constant luster to her merit when abroad and if she found no kind of countenance in her own family she met with the highest in every other place  this was a circumstance which galled mrs webley to the very soul and being more over fearful that the regard so universally shown to maria would be a means of obstructing any favorable addresses which might be made to her own daughter she took a speedy opportunity of quarrelling with that unhappy young lady and being as the generality of those of her principles most commonly are both master and mistress of the house very fairly turned her out of doors  maria was not however destitute of a protector though she had lost a father  a young fellow with a good understanding and a splendid estate who had long solicited her favorable opinion and gained it took that opportunity of pressing for her hand and was made the happiest of men  maria was married about five years during which time though she had often entreated for a reconciliation she never could be admitted to the presence of her father when taking up the gazette one saturday evening she met with his name amongst the list of bankrupts and instantly fainted on the floor she was however soon brought to herself when forgetting in a moment how she had been turned out upon the charity of an inhospitable world and exposed to the most pinching poverty and disgrace how for a series of years she had been treated as an alien to her fathers family and even denied the most trivial necessaries while strangers were riotting on her mothers fortune she flew to her husband whose happiness was centred in obliging her and painting out the miserable situation of her father obtained his consent to settle three hundred a year out of a sum which he would allow her for pin money on him to alleviate so distressing an incident with this she immediately took coach and proceeded to her fathers the door was now thrown open at her approach and being introduced to the old gentlemans presence they gazed upon one another for some moments and then burst into a mutual flood of tears  mr webleys misfortunes had opened his eyes to the strangeness of his conduct and nobody could be more ready to condemn it than hmself what then must we judge his emotions to be when a daughter whom he had left destitute of bread came to offer him a genteel allowance for life and the same eyes which he had steeped in tears of the keenest distress came to fill his with drops of unutterable joy his gratitude as a man his feelings as a father instantly rushed upon his soul he dried his eyes looked full in his daughters face for some moments then capering about the room with the phrenzy of a bedlamite burst afresh into tears suffice it however that after his affairs were settled he retired into the country upon this yearly allowance but did not live long enough to enjoy the first quarter the mortification of being a bankrupt the consciousness of his family errors and finally the very generosity of his daughter which was intended to sweeten the remainder of his life proved a means of hurrying him to his end the agitation of his mind threw the gout in his stomach and he died in marias arms in the fiftieth year of his age his wife and daughter now thought themselves utterly undone but maria with a greatness of mind peculiar to herself in an instant dispelled their apprehensions by a continuation of two hundred a year during her life and without ever stooping to hint any thing of their former behavior told them that they must consider it as no compliment since she looked upon it as an indispensible duty which she ought to pay to the memory of her father  numb xxxiii saturday september    to the babbler sir i am a constant reader of your productions and have conceived such an opinion of your regard for the poor women that i am resolved to trouble you with an account of my situation especially as it is possible that several of my sex are laboring under the same anxieties and that this letter may be productive of some happy consequences to them however it may fail in being any way advantageous to me  you must know sir that about three years ago i was married to a man of distinguished understanding as well as considerable fortune and therefore looked upon by all my friends to be very happily settled for life  my husbands known good sense sir and the affluence of his circumstances were considered by every body as indubitable securities for my felicity and there was scarcely a young lady of my acquaintance who did not envy me so favorable a match  i had not however been married above a month sir before i found myself treated with a palpable indifference and cut off from all those rational enjoyments which i flattered myself with possessing in the continual society of so sensible a husband  instead of entertaining me as he was formerly accustomed with instructive relations of men and things he grew silent and reserved and instead of the continual vivacity with which his looks had before been animated nothing now appeared upon his brow but a settled air of the most perfect disregard or a supercilious smile of centempt  i was for a long time at a loss to account for so surprising an alteration of temper and you may be sure as i passionately loved mr highmore such a change must have given me many an uneasy moment particularly as i studied with all possible care to keep my anxiety concealed  it was a mortifying circumstance mr babbler if i asked a tender question to be answered with a blunt yes or no to be told i teized him if i enquired after his health and to have my hand tossed away with an illnatured pshaw if i presumed to take hold of his or attempted to regulate any little article of his dress  at last sir the mystery was unravelled i overheard him one day talking to an intimate friend of his about the follies of the fair sex declaring that the very best were a most contemptible pack of creatures much below the notice of a man of understanding  for my part says he i suppose myself as happily married as any body of my acquaintance but still a wife is no more than a woman and as such though a necessary animal she is consequently below the regard of a man of common speculation  having thus discovered the occasion of mr highmores indifference i resolved to render myself as worthy of his attention as i could by conversing on the most important subjects i was able for this purpose i would occasionly cite a passage from our celebrated writers and deliver my opinion on historical events poetical composition and such other parts of literature as i thought would be most agreeable to the temper i saw him in  but alas sir instead of finding his humor abated by this solicitude to please i had the misfortune to see it visibly increased  if i quoted a passage from any author he smiled  if i pretended to judge he tittered  but if i was insolent enough to differ from the minutest opinion of his he either flew out of the house or politely laughed in my face  every casual impropriety of accent he was sure to ridicule and those little grammatical inaccuracies which women cannot always avoid were everlasting object of contempt  failing in my endeavors here i attempted to engage him in a variety of amusements but in vain  if i proposed the play  women only diverted his attention from the business of the performance  if i proposed a walk in the park  women truly were pretty companions to dangle with in public  if i mentioned a game at cards fools only had recourse to diversions of that kind  in short sir let me start what i would either the meanness of my understanding or the greatness of his own was sure of defeating all my views and nothing was happy enough to merit his approbation but what immediately proceeded from himself  for this last twelvemonth sir mr highmore has commenced bon vivant and sat till three or four oclock every morning with a select party of friends who are eminent in the world for their literary abilities as it is a fundamental principle with these extraordinary gentlemen never to part while they are able to sit together irregularity and intemperance have so impaired the constitution of my poor mr highmore that i am terrified to death at the bare supposition of the consequences  his employment all day is to recover from the excesses of the preceding evening and his business all night to provide an indisposition for the next day  for gods sake mr babbler say something about those men of sense who look upon women to be idiots and yet are guilty of actions that would make the meanest of us ashamed  is this superiority of understanding sir upon which the generality of your sex so highly pique themselves to be pleaded as an eternal excuse for indiscretions and errors and no allowance to be made for the little failings of the poor women though we are treated continually as fools  i could say a great deal sir on this subject but fearing to trespass too much upon your leisure i shall take my leave  and am your humble servant arabella highmore  numb xxxiv saturday october   to the babbler sir singularity is so much the affectation of the present era that there is scarely an individual but what strikes out a plan of operation for himself and exhibits a particular something in his character that marks him in a distinct manner from every body else this endeavor at singularity let the circumstance be what it will in which we display it is always the result of much pride and little understanding it proceeds from a despicable ambition to be talked of and like the ephesian youth so we hear our name bandied about from mouth to mouth it becomes a matter of indifference how we are mentioned whether for erecting a temple to the deity or for setting one in flames  among many instances which i have remarked of subaltern singularity in the course of my own acquaintance the foundation of poor ned totters fame is one of the most extraordinary ned for these last twenty years has not touched a morsel of butchers meat his diet consisting chiefly of fish fowl and vegetables and this bare circumstance has been a constant source of selfexultation ever since when he comes into company he watches for every opportunity of relating this meritorious acts of abstinence and is particularly pleased if any strangers happen to be present to bless him with a stare of astonishment which he looks upon as the highest indication of applause i have frequently known him run about from coffeehouse to coffeehouse in order to meet with a fresh admirer and engage a whole table of politicians with a discourse upon the pecullarities of all the crowned heads in europe that he might turn the conversation of his auditory at last upon the strangeness of his own a very sensible young fellow who has studied his ruling passion takes every occasion of indulging it and leads him with a preparatory discourse to a constant mention of his favorite subject this has made the young fellow so extremely agreeable to my old friend that upon a fit of illness sometime ago he set him down very handsomely in his will and appointed him one of his executors various are the circumstances i could tell of this affected singularity  tom steady has made it a point every day since the last rebellion to take a view of temple bar and indulge himself with a sight of the heads this extraordinary mark of his affection for the government has answered his wishes it has been talked of a thousand times among his acquaintance and tom is at once the truest subject and the happiest man in the kingdom  frank loiter has rendered himself immortal for lounging about westminster hall during term time  will careless is universally celebrated for having his stockings hanging continually about his heels and my ingenious friend mr thomas clough of drury lane theater is talked of by all the world for never missing an execution at tyburn  but if singularity in trivial occurrences is so certain of making us ridiculous an affection of particular vices through a desire of appearing singular cannot surely sail of rendering us odious as well as despicable in the eyes of the world and occasion every rational person to view us with abhorrence as well as contempt yet notwithstanding the consequences are so evident and positive what numbers do we not continually observe establishing their character upon a foundation like this what myriads does not every days experience point out who are ambitious to be thought rascals as well as fools and seek the public admiration in some singularity of behavior for which they ought to be hanged  of this number is that celebrated libertine sir charles riot sir charles is possessed of a handsome figure an extensive understanding and a plentiful estate yet with all these advantages to gain an honest reputation his whole study is to acquire a character from the destruction of every family he is admitted in and his only ambition to become conspicuous from the number and blackness of his crimes in one house he has ruined two sisters the daughters of a most intimate friend in another he has debauched the wife of a man to whom he is indebted for no less than his life  the actions are universally spoken of but so far from being ashamed our hopeful baronet thinks the mention of them a compliment to his personal qualifications and always makes gallantry the subject of his conversation that somebody may take notice of the laurels he has won in that extensive field of real infamy and imaginary applause  singularity mr babbler unfortunate for us is to be met with in every thing but the virtues and these being so very rare to be met with themselves to talk of it further than as it concerns our follies and our vices would be unnecessary for which reason i shall drop the subject here and style myself  yours etc sam speculist  numb xxxv saturday october   to the babbler sir you seem a friendly goodnatured sort of a man and i have often heard my grandson repeat with a great deal of satisfaction many pretty things out of your writings and tom though i say it is a very sensible lad has been three years at a latin school and is moreover as dutiful a child as any in england but to the purpose  you must know mr babbler i am and have been a long time offended with the custom of keeping holidays at particular festivals because it is productive of many evils and cannot possibly do any good  it is merely an encouragement to the vicious and the profligate instead of exciting any principle of morality or religion and perhaps it would not be going too far if i asserted that there are more enormities committed at christmas easter and whitsuntide than can be expiated by the virtues of the whole year besides  i am led to this subject from some domestic occurrences during the course of the two holidays in the whitsweek with which since i have taken the liberty for troubling you i shall endeavor to make amends for trespassing on the patience of your readers  breakfast was no sooner over whitmonday than my maid hannah came up stairs and begged leave to pass the remainder of the day with some relations of here is who had made a party for fulham  as the girl was a very good servant i not only granted the request but made her a present of half a crown toward defraying the expenses of the excursion  she thanked me promised to return early in the evening and set out  about nine oclock i expexted her home but no hannah came mr babbler  ten struck and still there was no sign of her appearance  eleven struck but no hannah sir i cannot say but i was terrified least some accident should have happened to the poor girl and therefore sent my tom with the other maid nanny to her sisters a discreet sober sort of a young woman who keeps a chandlers shop within two or three streets all that this produced was new uneasiness  the sister knew nothing of her heard of no party she was engaged in and seemed to be frighted out of her wits  on this report i went to bed but desired nanny to wait up till twelve oclock she did but o no purpose  hannah never came near the house since sir and we have lately discovered that she went out with a footman belonging to an officer that day instead of going with any relations that she dined with this sorry fellow at chelsea where after dinner he persuaded her to drink a glass or two of punoh which had such an effect upon her being utterly unused to strong liquors as rendered it absolutely necessary for her to be put to bed no doubt the whole was a design of the artful villains for she was no sooner under the blankets than he stepped without any ceremony into bed too and destroyed in one moment that reputation which the unhappy creature had preserved unsuspected for a whole life when she had recovered the use of her reason shame and distraction prevented her from coming home and thinking the worst that could had now happened she retired with her betrayer to a little room in a hedge alehouse where she continued with him ever since refusing either to see her sister or return to her place though i sent her word i should take her back again if she left the villain and would give an absolute promise never to have any intercourse with him for the future  such mr babbler is the consequence of holidaymaking and now suffer an old woman to make two or three cursory remarks  i remember my first husband and as honest a man he was as ver broke the worlds bread used to say poor man that the church by the institution of holidays perverted its own design and laid in reality a snare to destroy where it meant to improve the morals of the people indeed sir i am perfectly of opinion with mr robinson holidays were originally instituted to inspire a solemn sense of religious duties and to give those a favorable opportunity of prosecuting their devotions at particular seasons whose necessary avocations might prevent them from so constant an attendance as they might possibly wish at other times but let me ask sir if the end of the church is answered in the least do our young people go to church on holidays alas sir they consider a holiday as an absolute exemtion from every concern of a religious kind and a sort of license to indulge every depravity of their sentiments do our old people go to church on holidays very few sir they are employed in cards and festivity and so far is the verge of that eternity upon which they totter from making any salutary impressions on their minds that though i have not missed church a single day these thirty years yet at the three grand festivals i have observed it to be worse attended than at any other season in the year a few superannuated women like myself have composed the whole congregation and even the clergyman has run over the service in such a preposterous hurry that i have often thought he was impatient to mix in the customary riots of his parishoners  seeing therefore mr babbler that holidays so far from answering rather defeat the purposes of religion and knowing also how destructive they are to the community by encouraging a shameful idleness among all ranks of people the lower order particularly whose families must be material sufferers by the smallest neglect i think that every consideration both divine and human should induce us to lay them aside since nothing can be more scandalous than to set a season apart for the support both of idleness and irreligion and nothing more repugnant to wisdom or virtue than to sanctify as one may say a time for prejudicing the fortunes and corrupting the morals of the people  i am mr babbler your humble servant rachael redman  numb xxxvi saturday october    an excess of sensibility though nothing can be more amiable than a feeling heart is perhaps one the greatest misfortunes which the human mind can labor under because there is an everlasting source of objects to interest it is tenderness and a constant round of accidents to work upon it is fears  happily indeed we are not overstocked with people who possess this quality to any extraordinary degree but the few who do might possibly for their own sakes as well as the happiness of others be much better if they were endued with no sensibility at all  poor tom frankly is a striking proof of this observation at one and twenty he stepped into an estate of fifteen hundred pounds a year and was looked upon by every body as a very promising young fellow before the year was out however toms excessive sensibility made him find out all the necessitous and whether their poverty was the fault of their illfortune or the consequence of their crimes whether they were to be pitied or condemned he was indifferent in his relief indigence was a neverfailing recommendation and the villain professed tasted equally of his bounty with the worthiest of men his character once known the parasite and the gambler were continually at his table and working on his humanity with unceasing repetitions of penury and want fraud was perpetually pestering him with letters of supplication and the loosest prostitutes of the town teazed his ears forever with imaginary amendments and artificial distress his hand was still open to all and though his friends very frequently remonstrated on the injudicious distribution of his fortune his answer was eternally that he could not bear to see any bosom swelled with affliction nor any eye reddening with wretchedness and despair in less than ten years however his estate was reduced to a fifteenth part of its worth the great decay of his own circumstances now obliged him to be less attentive to the affairs of other people and seeing that nothing but beggary was before him if he went on much farther he bound himself under a large penalty never to give away above a tenth part of the pitiful little hundred a year which was left this he constantly disposes of in halfpence and pence to the common beggars and the moment it is expended locks himself up in his room to avoid both the sight and the importunity of these vagrant mendicants till the receipt of his next years supply  lady catherine nettleworth is another instance of excessive sensibily but it is however entirely confined to her children and her lapdogs if one of the young gentlemen goes abroad she is under the most violent agitation lest some accident should happen in the shortest excursion if he goes in the coach she is in a continual uneasness for fear it should overset if he rides her apprehension is equally alive lest the horse should unhappily take fright if he walks she dreads the consequence of the fatigue and let the day be either wet or dry she trembles alike with a terror of his catching cold or being parched to death with the sun in order to quiet herself in all these different respects she sometimes keeps the young gentlemen within doors for a whole week but then she is miserable in the other extreme she sickens lest they should suffer for want of exercise and dies for fear they should be stifled for want of air at table if they eat hearty she dreads their being surfeited and is wretched from a supposition of being indisposed if they do not in fact whatever they do she seldom has a moments peace for thinking about their welfare and wherever she goes rarely suffers any body else to enjoy a moments satisfaction for talking about their various accomplishments  her concern for her lapdogs is no less remarkable than her solicitude about her children if the maid neglects to comb them twice a day she flies into the vapors or suffers them to go into a damp room she falls into fits in short there is scarcely a circumstance in which her sensibility is not creating her a new source of disquiets nor a friend in the world whom she does not render unhappy with her endless apprehensions and complaints upon the whole i may with certainty enough conclude this paper as i set out with affirming that an excess of sensibility amiable soever as it is to have a feeling heart is productive of so many uneasinesses to ourselves and so many inquietudes to our friends that it would in reality be much better for those who labor under it to be unacquainted with the finer feelings and to have little or no sensibility at all  numb xxxvii saturday october    to the babbler sir i am a plain young fellow near the monument and have been courting a most agreeable girl in the neighborhood for above six months but what surprises me is that though she receives the visits of no other suitor as i can discover and is generally upon some little party of pleasure with myself i can by no means bring her to a candid declaration of her sentiments nor find out whether or no she designs me for a husband  every question that has a tendency to explain matters she avoids with the greatest address and flies out into a violent passion if i press it with any degree of earnestness or importunity  all this time sir i am spending my money losing my time and neglecting my business  i have been obliged to squire her to vauxhall or ranelagh two or three times a week and because i would do matters genteely have kept the coach in waiting at each of those places the whole evening this and the other necessary expenses bear a little heavy on the pocket of a tradesman mr babbler who has no ambition to appear in the london gazette though accompanied or ushered in with the truly respectable name of robert earl of northington  when i first commenced an humble servant of my adorables i thought it abundantly sufficient to propose a walk in the park or a dish of tea at the whiteconduithouse and imagined a prudent consideration for the main chance would recommend me to her good opinion especially as she had but a very small fortune of her own and knew upon that account the necessity there was for a little economy  but lackaday sir the whiteconduithouse was resorted by nothing but barbers boys or mantuamakers apprentices and for a walk in the park she never could be able to crawl so far  she hated draggling through the streets and could not bear to be tossed about at the discretion of every clumsy porter or odious irish chairman  this was a broad hint and therefore hoping to bring her to an immediate compliance by the appearance of generosity i gave into her humor and coached it about so unceasingly that she now looks upon it as an indispensible compliment which i am obliged to pay and never stirs without a carriage out of doors  this is not all mr babbler she has lately got a knack of stopping at goldsmiths shops and at milliners of her acquaintance  there she has fallen in love with a variety of little knickknacks which like a blockhead i have foolishly complimented her with and no later than last week sir it cost me sixteen guineas for a diamond hoop ring and five for some little paltry article in her head dress  these expenses and the uncertainty i am in with respect to her inclinations have made me very serious sir for though i love her with the utmost sincerity and would marry her tomorrow without a sixpence still i must have some regard for myself too and prevent in time the destruction of my little fortune and the laughter of the world into the bargain i have therefore taken the liberty sir of troubling you with a few questions by the advice of my friend tom watkinson as he constantly takes in your entertaining paper and speaks in the handsomest manner of your goodnature and abilities  be so good then to tell me if it is not very culpable in any woman who intends to marry an admirer to drive him on expenses considerably beyond what she knows can be afforded by his circumstances  ans yes  q is it not to the last degree scandalous for a woman if she does not intend to marry an admirer to saddle him with continual parties of pleasure and to receive presents of value from him at every opportunity  a yes  q is not the woman who does the first a wife utterly improper for any man that has a fortune to lose  a yes  q and is not the woman who does the second a wife too despicable for any man at all  a yes  q would you advise me at the next interview with my goddess in spite of every frown of disdain or toss of resentment to demand a peremptory answer whether she is willing to have me or no  a yes  q if she should happen to consent would you advise me to marry her  a this question is useless being sufficiently answered by the first and third queries  q would you marry a woman yourself mr babbler who had acted like my adorable  a by no manner of means  numb xxxviii saturday october    the following complaint is so just and general that i shall make no apology for laying it before my readers  to the babbler sir i am an unhappy poor rascal and have to my unspeakable mortification been married these three years to a woman of extraordinary piety and virtue  dont be surprised  i am neither angry with her piety nor offended with her virtue on the contrary i revere her for both the qualifications but they are attended with consequences so vary disagreeable that i frequently wish when provoked beyond all bounds that she had been indebted to billingsgate or bowstreet for the rudiments of her education  i am you must know sir a haberdasher just set up at the polite end of the town where with a little industry i have a very reasonable prospect of making a pretty tolerable fortune  i am very assiduous in business myself and wish i could say as much for my wife  but lackaday instead of minding the duties of the shop when i am trotting up and down with a parcel of goods her ladyship runs out to her devotions to some neighboring church or chapel and trusts the care of every thing to an ignorant apprentice or a giddy headed journey woman what is worse upon these occasions sir her sanctity renders her commonly as cross as the very devil and if i say a single syllable i am sure to hear a volley of charitable ejaculations for the welfare of my poor soul and to be treated the remainder of the whole day like a downright reprobate  you would imagine however sir that when she does come home she might be kind enough to favor me with a little of her assistance and to cast an eye over the regulation of my family  far different is the case the moment she comes in she retires to her room and there wastes away the time till dinner over some stupid compilation of enthusiastic prayers or some ignorant rhapsody made use of at her conventicles there profoundly wrapped in dirt and meditation she imagines herself discharging the great employment of her life and never casts a single thought upon the miserable poor dog her husband or the unhappy little wretches her children  i have spoke of her mr babbler as being wrapped up in dirt and meditation  i said no more than the truth for the filthiness of her person is equal to the piety of her sentiments  looking down with disdain upon every sublunary enjoyment she thinks it beneath her to pay the least attention to her dress and upon this decent principle it is that hardly once in three months she puts on either a clean cap or a lightcoloured apron  a rusty old cardinal serves her for a coverslut as often as she goes out and as for her appearance at home she kindly imagines that any thing is good enough to wear before her husband nay sir sometimes she will not wash her hands or face in a whole fortnight and you shall judge what a condition her arms were in upon one of these occasions when a surgeon in the neighborhood who came to bleed her mistook the dirt for an antiquated kidskin and desired she would take off her gloves  from the preceding little sketch of my amiable helpmate mr babbler you must judge that her conduct has as great an effect upon my mind as an impression on my circumstances and consequently that i am never easy without being abroad though i know the absolute necessity for my attendance at home upon business  i am cut off in my own house from every little comfort of society and of course must have an inclination of seeking it somewhere else  i cannot ask a friend to breakfast dine or sup with me my own stomach is constantly turned when i sit down to table and that i think abundantly sufficient without striving to disgust my acquaintance  besides from an utter neglect of the most domestic concern let me say what i will i can never get a joint of meat properly dressed but have it brought up without being heated half through or else entirely done to rags  thus situated as i said before i take every opportunity of going abroad and this opens a fresh source of inconvenience and anxiety  my wife to crown my misfortunes is uncommonly fond of me and if i either dine or sup from home is sure of being constantly in tears  yet sir this home she makes intolerable for even after shop hours if i oblige her by staying within i meet fresh instances of mortification  mirth and good humor are banished from my doors a harmless joke is considered as a sinful levity and an innocent laugh prohibited as wholly antichristian the case is not mended neither if in conformity to her humor i wear a grave aspect for then sir she either teazes me to death with unnecessary apprehensions about my health or reproaches me with being illnatured because i am confined to her company any way she is sure of finding fault and any way i am equally certain of being rendered miserable  is there no means mr babbler of curing this unaccountable malady of being righteous overmuch is there no means of convincing these narrow minded women that a moroseness of temper or a disregard of rational enjoyments are in no manner encouraged by the sentiments of religion but that on the contrary a sweetness of disposition and an endeavor to discharge the necessary duties of wife and mother are particularly some of it is most beautiful characteristics  i do not think this subject would be unworthy the pen of our most eminent divines  suffer me through your paper to beg some of them will consider it since it is more likely that a lesson on this matter will come with more weight from the pulpit than any other quarter  your most humble servant an unfortunate husband  numb xxxix saturday november   the impressions which are made upon the human mind during its earliest states being seldom if ever to be entirely eradicated there is nothing in which we ought to be more careful than the education of our children particularly in their infancy when habits in the strictest sense of the term become an absolute part of our nature and prejudices not only find a reuge in the heart but twist themselves imperceptibly round it is very strings  i remember when i was about four or five years of age my grandmother took me entirely under her own care and as the good woman like the generality of her sex at that period had a firm belief in witches spirits and hobgobblins she frequently entertained me with a variety of their pretty performances and if i happened to be any ways untoward constantly threatened to send me to robin greenway  this mr robin greenway was formerly a journeyman tailor in the neighborhood who had gone distracted for love as the people said and in one of his desperate fits cut his throat in the parsons garden  various were the tricks related of this unhappy enamorato sometimes he came in a storm and threw a parcel of bricks down his sweethearts chimney at other times he assumed the figure of a gray mare and at others that of a spotted spaniel but his most favorite mode of appearance was the form of an overgrown calf  ridiculous as these accounts must have been inevitably considered on the smallest reflection yet my poor grandmother believed them all with the most religious certainty and thought it an indispensible part of her duty to make me believe them too  in this she succeeded to the utmost most of her wishes i was ten years old before i would venture to sleep alone fourteen before i had courage enough to go to bed in the dark and to this very hour if i happen to be by myself the clock never strikes twelve at night but i think of robin greenway or some other worshipful member of the same community to whom the blessing of an untimely death has granted a privilege of taking what form and playing what tricks he pleases till the cock crows next morning  it would be unnecessary for me to observe that nine out of every ten who may be turned of fifty have like myself in their infancy been trained up in the greatest dread of spirits and that the utmost exertion of their reason upon arriving at years of maturity has not been sufficient to erase the impressions which have then been unhappily made upon their imagination  fortunately however the good sense of the present era has provided the most effectual spells for our ghosts and specter and laid so many of them successfully in the red sea that harmless little boys may for the future sleep in the most perfect security and the honest country people traverse the remotest church yard after midnight without the smallest apprehension  but notwithstanding we have in a great measure got the better of our ghosts there are yet some prejudices and those of a very dangerous tendency which we have in a manner substituted in their room and which it would be much to our honor in this life and to our happiness in the next if we could get the better of too  these are the shameful indulgencies to which we think ourselves entitled on sundays  in the days of specter and hobgobblins we thought ourselves under an indispensible necessity of paying some regard to the sabbath and every man was obliged to pay a fine who omitted going to church that day unless he could palliate his conduct by some very feasible excuse but nowadays sunday is the time particularly set apart for riot and festivity and the day rendered holy by the express appointment of omnipotence the day peculiarly appropriated for the greatest violation of it is laws  has a great man a journey to make or a company to invite sunday is an idle day and he sixes either upon that  has a woman of fashion an inclination to strip her best friends of the money which ought to pay a tradesmans bill she sends cards for sunday evening  and has a petty little mechanic a mind to cut a figure why he hires his horse takes out his strumpet and gets drunk on sunday evening too  in the inferior orders of life there is a notion generally prevalent that cards are very monstrous on a sunday and there are many wellmeaning people who would not upon any consideration sit down to a party of whist  none of my readers will imagine i dare say that i want from this to extenuate the infamous custom of cardplaying on the sabbath of god  all that i want is to show the lower classes of the people that leaping in the fields playing at cricket riding horse matches on the roads and getting drunk on that day is every whit as criminal as the propensity to cards which they so highly censure in their superiors that any of those exercises which they think allowable is rather more indecent because more publicly practiced and may in reality be attended with infinitely worse effects  let them therefore if it be in vain to preach to the politer world first of all reform in these points of behavior on sundays themselves before they pretend to arraign the conduct of the great and instead of discovering the mote in the eye of their neighbor sit attentively down to pluck the beam out of their own  numb xl saturday november    i have been strongly solicited to give the following letter a place which i have unwillingly complied with notwithstanding the apparent utility of it is intention as i am fearful it will affect rather too many of my readers among the venerable part of the fair sex who have been in the decline of life unhappily too susceptible of tender impressions though they have lost the power of creating any impressions of such a nature themselves  to the babbler sir in what manner to tell you my unfortunate story i know not shame and confusion forbid me to whisper it to the very winds but a just concern for the happiness of others has worked upon my humanity and wrings the melancholy secret from my heart  you must know mr babbler i am a woman of some birth had once a little beauty and what was infinitely more important in the eye of the world a very affluent fortune at the age of twentyone i married the most amiable of men with whom i lived in an uninterrupted round of felicity for six and thirty years during that period we had four sons and three daughters who are all provided for both splendidly and fortunately in the world and enjoy the fullest sweets of opulence

mentioned i shall be suspected of disingenuity if i say i was concerned at it at all but believe me i felt every thing a woman endued with a most exquisite sensibility could possibly experience on so tender and afflicting an occasion and was reduced so low by the conflict which my mind had undergone that when the physicians prescribed the bath waters it was universally thought i should not hold out to the journeys end  providence however which designed that i should stand a warning to my sex to the surprise of my whole family worked a miracle almost in favor of my health and in about three months i was so perfectly recovered that i came up to town and seemed not only to have left every trace of my indisposition behind but the principal marks of my age too in short every body complimented me on the life of my looks and raked the latent embers of vanity which had a long long time lain smothered in my heart with so much success together that upon a secret consultation with my own wishes i could not absolutely conclude but i might be yet prevailed upon to change my condition and make a second venture on the smooth ocean of that state which rendered my life such a blessing in the first  the moment a thought of this nature comes into the breast of an old woman it clings like cleopatras asps and most commonly stings her to death  for my own part sir though i felt a secret repugnance at the notion of another husband yet the idea stuck close to my imagination and i even sometimes endeavored to persuade myself that this honest aversion which in spite of me my conscience would retain was nothing but a prejudice of education or custom which it was highly meritorious to subdue my memory was ransacked for instances where women in my circumstances had married a second time with handsome young fellows too yet lived extremely happy notwithstanding the vulgar and abominable supposition that nobody body could entertain a passion for a woman in years nay mr babbler i found texts of scripture in support of my favorite opinion and absolutely forced myself to believe that i was obliged by the very principles of religion to make another choice  while i was thus debating sir my son edward who is a colonel in the army brought a young fellow of his acquaintance to sup at my house  i do not know how it was but i fancied he was the most handsome man i had ever seen in my life his conversation too was so elegant and he paid so profound a deference to my opinion that i did not sleep  shame upon my antiquated eyelids  a single wink the whole night what need i trespass on your patience major ravage repeated his visits began to find he was far from disagreeable and in short made an offer of his hand in such terms as i was wholly unable to resist without ever enquiring into his character or his circumstances i consented to be his at an age that would become me to wait upon my grandchildren and flattered myself that his affection might be engaged to my person at the very moment i knew it to be entirely created by my purse my poor first husband imagining that as i had been a faithful wife to him i should be a tender mother to his children left me in possession of fifty thousand pounds and a jointure of three thousand a year every sixpence of which as far as i could i nevertheless unnaturally settled on the villain who had taken the advantage of my second childhood the morning after the celebration of our nuptials  my children you may be sure would be justly offended at this preposterous match and they were but to be rid of upbraidings  which cut me to the soul  i quarrelled with them in turn and forbad them ever to enter into my sight but alas i had too soon an occasion for their assistance and relief a fortnight had scarcely passed when major ravage without saying a single syllable set off for bath with a tradesmans wife in the city and about an hour after his departure an upholsterer came in demanding the possession of my house and goods having bought every thing that morning from my husband  i will not attempt to paint my astonishment my fury and my distress it was too much for nature to support and i fell lifeless on the floor  not to tire your patience sir  upon examining into every thing and sending to the major he flatly refused either to send me a shilling or ever to cohabit again with so stale a parcel of mortality  that was his decent expression in this situation my eldest daughter came and conduced me to her house generously soothing me in the tenderest manner but wounding me however a thousand times more by her goodness than she could possibly do by seizing the opportunity to load me with complaints i am now going to sue for a separate maintenance and shall convince the greyheaded sucklings of my sex that an old woman who marries a young fellow if she even should meet with a worthy one can never expect to be treated with any tenderness or regard and that on the other hand if she consents to wed a villain she can look for nothing but an endless scene of poverty and contempt where she is most fortunate in her choice neglect and ridicule must be her portion and where she happens to be otherwise the public scorn of the world will be aggravated by a continual round of private wretchedness and distress  i am sir yours etc lavinia ravage  numb xli saturday november    to the babbler sir seeing a variety of letters in your entertaining paper from husbands and wives i have taken the liberty of adding to the number of your matrimonial correspondents and doubt not but if you favor my complaint with a place but what it will be attended with very salutary effects  you must know sir i am married to one of the most agreeable women in england have an unabating passion for my wife and every reason to imagine her sentiments are equally tender for me there is nothing of consequence but what we continually study to oblige each other in yet at the same time there are a thousand little trifles in which we are always sure to disagree and which are not only an endless source of disquiet to ourselves but of uneasiness to our whole family  last night for instance sir after supper i acquainted nancy that a vintner who owed me a hundred pounds for some lisbons for you must know i am a winemerchant mr babbler had failed and that there was but little probability of expecting two and sixpence from the sale of all his effects i furthermore informed her that i was much to blame in the affair and that i had trusted this man contrary to the advice of an intimate friend who was perfectly conversant with his circumstances my wife instead of reprehending me for indiscretion as the generality of her sex would have done in the same case made use of every argument in her power to dissipate my chagrin told me the most careful were unable now and then to avoid an error and bid me console myself under my loss by thanking providence that i had not been a sufferer in double the sum i was greatly charmed with this disposition in mrs mountain sir and expressed my sensibility of it in a manner with which she seemed infinitely pleased well after all this would you imagine mr babbler that a most trivial circumstance should make us part beds for that night my favorite liquor is a glass of punch and it happens to be my wifes too making a little as we were alone i unluckily squeezed the pulp of the lemon into the bowl upon which she immediately exclaimed with some warmth lord my dear you have spoiled the punch  no my love replied i the pulp gives it a fine flavor and besides you know i am very fond of it   ay but says she you are sensible i cannot abide it  then my dear retutned i it is an easy matter to avoid putting any in your glass  lord mr mountain i have spoke to you a thousand times about this very circumstance i believe in my conscience you do it on purpose to give me disgust  here mr babbler we began a contest severity produced severity till at last i ordered a bed to be made for myself and poor nancy retired to her own with her eyes smimming in tears  for the whole night neither of us for i judge of her by myself had a single wink of sleep we tumbled and tossed canvassed the matter fifty ways in our minds and at last concluded like lockit and peachum in the beggars opera that we were both in the wrong yet notwithstanding all this when we met at breakfast but an hour ago neither of us would condescend to speak first we affected a resentment of countenance that was utterly sovereign to our hearts and endeavored to keep up the appearance of an unremitting anger when we both of us longed to be reconciled and had the most passionate inclination to be pleased breakfast was over before we exchanged a syllable when the servant had left the room prepared to go out and had just got to the parlour door when poor nancy unable to hold it out any longer cried in a tone of irresistible softness and will you go without speaking a word here our whole ridiculous quarrel was at an end i turned to her with all the fondness i could possibly assume and held her in my arms for some moments while she returning the fervor of the embrace burst into a flood of tears  it is inconceivable to think mr babbler how contemptible these little differences have made us in the eyes of our own servants whenever they see us cool toward one another they titter and laugh and say the poor things will soon kiss and make it up again it was no later ago than last week that i overheard my rascal of a coachman tell one of his fellow servants that his master and mistress were nothing better than an overgrown boy and girl and that he fancied a little of his horsewhip would be of great service to both of them it is very odd mr babbler that people who really love one another and are not wholly destitute of understanding should give way to such resentment in the merest trifles who in the most important circumstances of life are above feeling the smallest resentment or entertaining the minutest disesteem many is the time sir i have found fault with my wife for stirring the fire when her spending five hundred pound has not given me the least uneasiness and many a time has she fallen out with me if in cutting up a fowl i happened to splash ever so small a drop of gravy on the table cloth though she has felt no discomposure in life if i spoiled a rich silk or dirtied a fine headdress this morning however we have agreed as a means of keeping ourselves from passions of this nature for the future to send you the foregoing account and if it should turn out any way serviceable to others as i hope it will i shall have a double reason to sign myself  your most humble servant robert mountain  numb lxii saturday november    there is a very sensible saying among the women when any of their acquaintance happen to be brought to bed of a boy and this is that mrs suchaone has got one of the right sort in reality there are so many dangers attending the education of a young lady to years of maturity and there are such a variety of circumstances to destroy her reputation which through the fashionable depravity of the times are considered as so many excellencies in the other sex that i am no way surprised to find people particularly rejoiced at having one of the right sort as it is emphatically expressed since the satisfaction of the parent is considerably less exposed as well as the happiness of the child to say nothing of the infinitely greater ease with which the infant can be brought up  when i seriously consider the customary mode of educating the fair sex instead of being surprised to find so many turn out an affliction to their friends or a disgrace to society i am in fact astonished that we do not find a multitude more nowadays instead of being attentive to the cultivation of a young ladys mind our regard is entirely engrossed by the accomplishments of her person and the generality of our mothers are totally unconcerned whether or no their daughters are acquainted with the most necessary duties of religion provided they can make a tolerable figure at a party of whist and turn out their toes  from the first moment little miss is sent to school she is provided with a doll perhaps as large again as herself and is instructed in the necessary manner of dressing it properly and sending it quietly to bed thus in the earliest stage her mind receives a turn for gallantry and dress which imperceptibly strengthens with her years and being accustomed to nothing but compliments on her beauty she becomes utterly indifferent to everything else the little reading she is mistress of is rather a prejudice than a benefit for as it is principally composed of novels it constantly warms her imagination with sentiments of intrigue and adds to the opinion which she entertained of her own person and understanding hence she fancies herself the heroine of every extravagant romance till at last from an admiration of the character she really takes it up and runs off if in high life with some amadis of a subaltern officer and if in low with a strolling player or a barbers boy  the scandalous neglect of female education may however be put down to the account of the other sex by a custom no less arbitrary than unreasonable we cut them off from a liberal instruction yet at the very time that we lay a manacle on their understandings affect to despise them for fools  as if they were beings totally opposite by nature to ourselves we fancy that the same enlargement of mind which is so absolutely necessary for us is utterly improper for them and suppose that the better capable they are of acting in life the worse they must behave of course such are the sentiments entertained by the high and mighty lords of the creation relative to the education of the ladies what wonder therefore or what pity is it that we are so frequently unhappy in our daughters and our wives are we not in fact answerable for every error resulting from their ignorance since that ignorance is principally occasioned by ourselves and should we not consequently instead of throwing the whole blame at their doors remove it entirely to our own  i shall conclude this paper with a few memorandums written by an excellent young lady lately deceased who was brought up in a very different manner from the generality of her sex they were communicated to me yesterday by her father with tears in his eyes and shall stand as a lasting monument of so deserving a daughters virtue and understanding  mem being now eighteen years of age and hasting to that period of life in which i am to prove my gratitude to the best of parents let me always make it a rule to prefer the gratification of their wishes to the enjoyment of my own  mem a parent is entitled to the first place in every childs esteem and she that can be deficient in a point of duty here ought justly to be suspected of infidelity in the discharge of every other  mem by all means to be strictly attentive in the worship of my creator as i can never expect a future blessing without showing a becoming gratitude for a past  mem always to believe a man has the basest designs who wants me to conceal his addresses from my father  mem never to hear the protestations of any man who has behaved

happy alteration in their circumstances and to save this article out of unnecessary expenses in housekeeping and clothes  sir john blandford a man of much merit whom i fear has some sentiments in my favor i must avoid with the nicest circumspection for as i cannot return his esteem it would be infamous to mislead him with chimerical notions and inhuman to treat him with derision or disrespect  mem to send the hackney coachmans wife as much as my papa got the fellow fined in for behaving insolently last tuesday when we were suddently caught in a shower and coming from the park  mem mr

of conduct there is no light in which the character of a man can possibly appear so amiable as in a hearty concern for his errors especially those which are more the consequence of human infirmity than the effect of a mean premeditation  in proportion to the repentance or atonement we are apt to raise him in our esteem and it is not the least part of his merit that libertines themselves are lost in an admiration of his behavior however slow through a ridiculous fear of public contempt they may be to imitate an action which they cannot in spite of fashion or education forbear to love  my nephew harry rattle called upon me this morning and after the usual how do you do of the day pulled out a letter from the identical mr bumper whom in a former paper i mentioned as having sent harry a challenge for refusing to drink a strumpet he had toasted one night after supper at his own house  mr bumper is a young man of nine and twenty who has received a liberal education is in possession of twelve hundred pounds a year and though he has launched pretty freely into the customary excesses of the times has been dissolute rather from fashion than inclination  for a few weeks past he has been at a tenants in berkshire from whence two days ago he sent the following letter to harry with permission to communicate it through my means to the notice of the public  to harry rattle esquire dear harry in my last letter i told you how deeply i was struck with the person of sally poplar my tenants daughter and expressed an intention of setting out immediately for london for fear i should succeed in any design prejudicial to her innocence and virtue  yet notwithstanding i was perfectly convinced how necessary a step of that nature would be i could not work myself up to a sufficient resolution of quitting the place  i flattered myself i should be able to resist every temptation yet indulge myself a few days longer under the same roof with the bewitching rustic and though i knew it would be impossible to possess this happiness without saying some tender things to her i nevertheless thought i should avoid carrying matters to any critical length by a criminal importunity  from my example however the unthinking part of our acquaintance may be instructed that it is infinitely wiser to fly from a temptation than to combat with an opportunity  the moment a man is alone with a woman he admires and from whom he has received some indications of reciprocal esteem human nature must not be human nature if he does not endeavor to improve so fair an occasion of gratifying his wishes he may fancy he will go to such and such lengths and no further but passion will hurry him imperceptibly from liberty to liberty and he will find it utterly impossible to retain the least consideration for the unhappy girl when he has totally loft all consideration for himself  such was my case the night before last sally and i lay on the same floor and she had promised to let me chat half an hour with her before she went to bed  this half hour was productive of another and another till at last the poor girl was worked up to such a pitch of tenderness that she could refuse nothing and then it was i found in spite of all my humanity that there was no possibility of getting off  it would have been very strange after pressing three hours for the last favor which all the time i was in hopes would have been refused if i had withdrawn the moment it was granted the consequence therefore was that after i had been rascal enough to deprive her of her reason i was villain enough to seize the opportunity which that suspension gave me and for a moments guilt destroyed a life of spotless fame   we had scarcely fallen asleep do not laugh rattle we slept upon my soul but old mrs poplar having as she imagined forgot to see that the kitchen fire was out a piece of care which she never omitted came down stairs and passing by sallys door which in the confusion of affairs we had neglected to lock turned the bolt and came in  i need not attempt to paint her astonishment  nor upon being waked our own surprise  sally shrieked and hid beneath the clothes mrs poplar wrung her hands in a fit of unutterable distraction and desired her husband to come instantly down the good man terrified out of his wits for fear his desk had been broke open or his house set on flames made what haste he could but never was distress or consternation so great as when he found out the real situation of affairs and beheld the destruction of his only child for a moment he was petrified till at last recovering the use of his recollection he cast a look at me that cut me to the very soul and crying o sir burst into a violent flood of tears  in my life i never was so much affected i felt myself truly despicable and was at once torn with shame and remorse  to a man not utterly destitute of humanity and reflection harry no circumstances could be so mortifying instead of gratitude for the cordial welcome which i had received in the house of my friend i had violated the hospitality of his roof and robbed the darling of his age of what ought to be infinitely dearer than her life  the girl i doated on to death seemed absorbed in distraction and her worthy parents were almost lost in despair  what could i do harry the torture of the damned was an elysium to what i suffered and without reparation of what service was it to repent thus situated i begged mr poplar and his wife to withdraw till i was dressed and then i would endeavor to satisfy them they did so and went down to the parlour i followed them in a few minutes and summoning all the fortitude i could delivered myself to the following purport i will not my good mr and mrs poplar go about to excuse the transactions of tonight but own myself a very dirty scoundrel however as there is no possibility of recalling what is past i shall readily make all the atonement in my power and if i have your consent will marry sally tomorrow morning  the transport of the worthy old couple was now as violent as their sorrow had been but a moment before  mr poplar looked at me for some time with a fixed attention then broke into an excessive laugh which possibly might have proved fatal had he not thrown himself into his great chair and found a seasonable relief in a flood of tears  well harry what say you to my behavior i have been married a week and am convinced that virtue is it is own reward for in my days i never tasted felicity till now every eye beams on me with gratitude and esteem and when i enter into an examination of my own heart all is approbation and joy  i am satisfied of your concurrence my dear harry and as for fools and rascals their opinions is what a man of speculation must both despise and detest it is not for the satisfaction of others we are to live but our own therefore those actions which secure that satisfaction since it must always be founded on a rectitude of principle are the best tests both of the goodness of our hearts and the soundness of our understandings  yours most affectionately richard bumper  numb xliv saturday december  0 it was an admirable reply which socrates once made to an impertinent coxcomb who demanded what he would do if there was no other world after this i need not inform the intelligent reader that this celebrated philosopher was as eminent for the rectitude of his life as the greatness of his understanding and that upon all occasions he maintained the certainty of a future state where every man was to be rewarded according to his deserts  what shall i do returned socrates if there is not another world after this why at any rate i shall be as well off as you are  but what will you do if there is  it is really surprising that the force of this excellent answer is not always present to the minds of those people who either take upon them absolutely to deny the existence of another world or act in such a manner as if they looked upon a belief of it to be utterly ridiculous and absurd common policy one would imagine should incline them to a uniform rectitude of life if they were not actuated by real goodness and inspire if totally insensible of gratitude to the great author of their being something like a reasonable concern for themselves  when we consider though ever so slightly on the nature of man and reflect on the important something which is continually deciding upon every action in the human bosom we can scarcely think it possible that there is one man in the whole circuit of creation who is dead to the belief of a future state or is really of opinion that there is no such being as a god his own heart must be an evidence against him and he must feel the certainty of another existence though he may be apt to cry out with cato when or where  but however if there is even a possibility to suppose such a class of creatures as atheists in being yet every days experience will point out millions to our view whose situation is infinitely more terrible and who are more entitled to the abhorrence of the world as well as more exposed to the vengeance of their god a disordered mind or a weak understanding may be advanced as some little mitigation of the wretchs infidelity who denies the existence of his creator but what excuse can he have who acknowleges the power the wisdom and the goodness of the deity yet lives as if he believed there was no deity at all what plea can be urged for those who while they confess themselves indebted for every blessing to the unbuned beneficence of the supreme being act in one constant round of disobedience to his will and trample while they own the necessity of an implicit obedience to his ordinances in the most infamous manner upon the greatest of his laws  the atheist if we suppose any rational creature can be an atheist lives consistent with himself he looks upon this world as the final stage of his existence and consequently has no occasion to act like those who are in a positive expectation of future punishments and rewards hence he is justified in making the most of the present world and has a kind of title to follow every pursuit that has a tendency to promote his interest or gratify his inclinations without any regard to the means  but surely the man who kneels down reverently at the throne of the divine being pours out his soul in thankfulness for past blessings or in solicitations for future benefits is to the last degree inexcusable as well as inconsistent when he runs from the immediate temple and presence of his god to some licentious scene of immorality the participation of some criminal enjoyment or the prosecution of some infamous pursuit yet alas what numbers have we who after endeavoring to obtain a reconciliation with the father of mercies fly while the awful benediction of the church is quite fresh and warm upon their heads and plunge into all the vices which but the very moment before they were supplicating the goodness of omnipotence to obliterate and forgive  it is to me astonishing what men who believe the certainty of a divine being can think of themselves or what idea they can entertain of their god one moment they are all devotion and penitence the next we find them steeped in the most glaring contradictions and crimes one moment they are imploring the king of heaven and earth with a rapture of gratitude and reverence yet the very next as if all their supplications were so many absolute designs of turning him into ridicule or contempt they circulate an audacious laugh at his institutions and make a daring mockery of his laws nay more they frequently go into his very temple as if they wanted to aggravate the unparallelled impiety of their conduct and there in the very place immediately dedicated to his service they prosecute the most shameless violation of his commands there they very frequently go under the sacred mask of religion and virtue to seduce unsuspecting innocence to shame to lodge scorpions in the breast of some unhappy father and drench a mothers pillow in misery and tears  let me calmly ask the believers of a future state if absolute atheism is a crime more unpardonable than this of what service is our expectation of another life if we only employ our knowledge to have that life marked out to everlasting torments and despair of what advantage is our religion if we act in such a manner as to make that religion at once our condemnation and disgrace or of what utility is our acknowledgment of a god if the acknowledgment of such a being must harrow up the soul and goad it with unutterable stings atheism is almost a refuge in such a case and it is much more consistent to cry out with the most abandoned profligate our imgagination can form that there is no existence after this than exclaim in the language of the divine socrates what shall we do if there is  numb xlv saturday december    there is a certain mode of behavior in the world which is entirely founded upon self and proceeds from nothing but a passionate desire of gratifying our own inclinations yet which upon all occasions lays claim to the title of unbounded benevolence and generosity and puts in for the universal admiration in numberless instances where it ought to meet with nothing but the universal contempt  a letter however which i have lately received from a lady who signs herself a miserable woman of quality will elucidate this matter perhaps better than the most elaborate discussion which i could possibly enter into and therefore i shall make no apology for laying it before my readers  to the babbler sir as you seem goodnaturedly ready to pay greater regard to the circumstances than the compliments of your correspondents i shall begin with as little ceremony as i intend taking leave and neither trespass on your leisure with a fulsome encomium nor an unnecessary excuse  you must know sir i am the daughter of a private gentleman in oxfordshire who had a large family to provide for upon a very moderate estate there were six of us and but three hundred a year to answer all contingencies  happily indeed i was the only girl amongst them so that with a little interest as my father was generally beloved four of my brothers were fortunate enough to be preferred in the navy the army and public offices the eldest and myself were the only remaining children at home and my poor papa whose favorites we particularly seemed to be resolved to compensate by an unwearied attention to our education for the apparent narrowness of our fortunes  as for me before i was fifteen besides all the customary needleworks peculiar to my sex i spoke french and italian pretty tollerably danced an easy minuet enough sung an agreeable little song and played a lesson at sight on my harpsichord what was however infinitely more essential though now seldom considered as any part of a young womans education i could never sleep without saying my prayers and at church was no way ashamed of repeating the ten commandments or raising a psalm with the rest of the congregation  my person was not in the least tortured into any fashionable form by strait laicing and as for my face it was rather more wholesome than lovely and not so much distinguished by any surprising delicacy of complexion as by a certain air of complacency and cheerfulness which i flatter myself bespoke neither a corrupt heart nor a total want of understanding  excuse me mr babbler for being thus tediously and perhaps vainly circumstantial about either my acquired or personal qualifications but as they were the only causes of my great i must not say my good fortune i thought there might be some necessity for more than a cursory description of both  between the age of fifteen and twenty such as my little attractions were they procured me no inconsiderable share of admirers and i had more than one opportunity of marrying very advantageously no person however engaging my inclination my father never offered to press me on the subject but always tenderly declared his poor girl should choose for herself in a case where she was the most principally interested  when i was just turned of twenty an occasion for such a choice occured and he readily consented to the solicitations of a young gentleman who had been left an estate of eight hundred a year in our neighborhood by the will of a relation at that time about six months deceased  but alas sir see the uncertainty of all human expectations three or four days before the intended solemnization of our nuptials a certain noble earl of an immense fortune had his carriage accidentally broke down within a few yards of my fathers  mr bilson my lover and i were looking out of the window at that instant and immediately ran out to offer the civilities of the house to his lordship who frankly accepted the invitation and staid there the whole night  my father made every thing as agreeable as could be to his illustrious guest and was not a little surprised the next morning when the nobleman told him i had made an impression on his heart and offered a settlement so very large that my poor papa dazzled with that and the desire of seeing his favorite nancy a countess immediately forgot all his former resolutions to allow me a liberty of choosing for myself and declared his lordship should be put in possession of my hand whenever he thought proper to mention a day for that purpose  why need i trespass on your patience mr babbler to paint either my own distraction or the frantic behavior of mr bilson  suffice it sir that in a week after i was dragged half dead to the altar and torn from the only man i ever could love to be wedded to one whom i never can  the subject of my complaint sir now comes to be mentioned  i have been married three years and endeavored to make the most of my wretched circumstances by compensating with the strictest discharge of my duty for an apparent want of love  this is not sufficient for his lordship mortified that he can engage no return of his affection he is perpetually reproaching me with a want of gratitude and always telling me of his prodigious condescension in raising me to the rank of a countess from the former obscurity of my situation  thus sir he thinks i am obliged to him for making me miserable and imagines i ought to study nothing but the continual repose of his bosom because he has generously planted everlasting daggers in mine  there are many women mr babbler alike unhappily circumstanced it would therefore be kind if you desired our disinterested husbands to remember for whose sake they have thus graciously honored us with their names and to consider it was not out of any regard for the promotion of our wishes but through a mean and very often an illiberal desire of gratifying their own  your paper is left at our house once a week and if you will insert this my lord will perhaps be convinced he is more entitled to my aversion than my esteem and be fully satisfied he has made me  a miserable woman of quality  numb xlvi saturday december    there are few professions so critically situated i believe as that of an authors the generality of the world are always disposed to turn his productions into ridicule and the principal number of the remaining part but too much inclined to treat his person with contempt the first are offended that any body should presume to be wiser than themselves and the latter look upon it as something very clever to treat a man of superior abilities with disrespect the contracted circle in which it is his fortune to be esteemed is most commonly made up of those who either are not adequate judges of his merit or in no condition to reward it if they are thus as few gentlemen of the quill are ever possessed of any extraordinary fortunes they are in a manner set apart to combat with indigence and obscurity and their genius being naturally depressed by the melancholy state of their circumstances they become in a little time incapable of reflecting any honor on their country or of acquiring any comfortable dependence for themselves the reader by perusing the following letter will easily see why i have been induced to take up the pen upon this head  to the babbler sir at a little snug retirement in derbyshire i am always favored with your paper once a week and as i think it no less instructive than entertaining i heartily wish for the benefit of the world that all our authors were as easy in their minds as from the apparent facility of his productions i conclude the agreeable writer of the babbler if i may deliver my sentiments i am really of opinion that the decline of literature arises more from a want of encouragement than a want of genius in the kingdom and though i shall not presume to rank myself among men of real abilities yet i believe the principal prt of those who can have more than once experienced some of the mortifications which i am about to relate an found them not a little prejudicial to that force of imagination so indispensibly requisite for a writer of any character  you must know mr babbler i was sent very early to the university in order to get myself qualified for a living which a certain nobleman had in his gift and which he repeatedly assured my father should be at my service on the death of the incumbent if it was thought worth while on that account to educate me for the church unfortunately however before i was at oxford three years his lordship who had sat up all night was taken off by an unexpected accident for mounting a strange hunter the next morning at a gentlemans seat where he was then upon a visit he pursued the game with too incautious a resolution and broke his neck in taking a five barred gate with him perished my expectations and i was taken from the college directly  during my stay at the university i made several little essays in the various walks of literature merely for my amusement which were so favorably received by those exalted geniuses the compilers of magazines that they generally honored them with the appellation of elegant and requested the continuation of my correspondence this gave me a strong propensity to writing and as i looked upon an author to be the greatest of all sublunary characters i was ambitious of gaining so honorable a title and through this unaccountable infatuation neglected every necessary means of promoting my future interest and fortune it is true my father bound me to an eminent attorney but alas sir homer and virgil were consulted infinitely more than either littleton or coke and instead of replies rejoinders or demurrers i was in the midst of term engaged in writing some poetical whimsies of my own or in commenting on those of other people the little all that came to me on my fathers decease was soon expended and i found myself in an instant left to bustle through an inhospitable world without either money business or bread in this dilemma necessity obliged me to have recourse to the booksellers i was accordingly enlisted into the army of literary mercenaries and like the humblest class of soldiers obliged for the most pitiful pittance to run a frequent risque of my reputation and sometimes a dangerous hazard of my life fame indeed came in tollerably fast but still i ran deeper and deeper into debt i was totally unacquainted with the customs of the trade and the booksellers having me in their power conscientiously treated me as they pleased i was confined to my regular hours of work as if i was a shoemaker or a tailor and very often ordered to do a particular quantity in a particular time sometimes sir i have been obliged to write a philosophical essay on contentment when my heart was bursting with anguish and at others ordered to produce a poem on liberty while the bailiffs were waiting at the door but the severest mortification of all was the impertinent freedom with which i was treated by every ragamuffin of the press the printer would criticize on my performances to my face and the very devils themselves would talk to me of mistakes and propose what they were modestly pleased to consider as amendments nay sometimes they have invited me to club for a pot of porter or asked me to take a game at allfours at the goose and gridiron for fourteen years mr babbler did i continue this comfortable life when last winter but one having written a political treatise which occasioned some noise a nobleman of great eminence kindly enquired for the author found me out generously paid my debts and assigned me an apartment in his own house i now thought myself made for ever but i had scarcely been a month in the house when my lords admiration of my abilities began to abate a little he expected as an author that i should support every absurdity he advanced in an argument and as a man of genius that i should always be comical with this view he introduced me into all companies but when he saw i would neither be his parasite nor his buffoon his friendship very visibly declined at table i was insulted with the proposal of a wager wherever i presumed to dissent in opinion and then it was instantly recollected with a loud laugh that authors were but seldom overburthened with money in the largest circle of his acquaintance my lord by an affected compliment of condolence would paint out my former distress and then insinuate the merit of his own generosity in relieving it at other times he used me with an intolerable insolence of superiority and then affected to be displeased when he put me out of countenance in short i almost determined to go back to my old profession again as thinking it better to suffer a secret affront than to be thus publicly contemptible i was soon settled in my resolution for the dining room jests on my profession and circumstances began to be bandied about in the kitchen and the butler under a pretened air of simplicity and ignorance came one day up to my apartment and begged me to raise the devil that he might enquire after one or two of his silver spoons providence however took pity on me at last a worthy gentleman whose memory i shall ever revere that had seen me two or three times at my lords table thought of me so kindly as to set me down a hundred a year for life in his will and as he was very old and infirm scarcely survived his generous donation ten days i heard of it but the very morning i took my leave of his lordship and though i dropped a tear to the memory of my benefactor i could not help rejoicing at so fortunate an alteration in my circumstances i have now lived a twelvemonth in derbyshire quite happy in myself and respected by every body and have sent you this letter to point out the real cause of that decline in literature which has of late years been so universally complained of in this kingdom my story requires no animadversion as every man of sense must exclaim with the poet alas what chance have authors to be read whose daily writings earn their daily bread   i am mr babbler yours etc crito  numb xlvii saturday december    to the babbler sir it was a very wise saying of an old philosopher that happiness was infinitely sweeter in the expectation than in the possession since the generality of mankind are rather apt to overvalue what they have not and to set too small an estimation upon what they actually have i remember sir about thirty years ago when my circumstances were a little contracted i fancied no man could be miserable who was master of a great estate it is inconceivable how i used to lie in bed of a morning building castles in the air and chalking out future plans of generosity and magnificence if my stars should ever kindly indulge me with this ne plus ultra of human felicity  i have been a member of parliament have drawn up an impeachment against sir robert  harangued the house like a cherubim  received gold boxes from every corporation in the kingdom  refused a peerage  and married a woman of exquisite beauty and immense fortune in the space of half an hour when oh dreadful catastrophe all these golden fantasies have been in an instant swept from my imaginations by the milkwomans yell at the door the falling of the tongs or the accidental jump of our old black cat  yet sir though my finances were moderate enough at the time i am speaking of still i found more satisfaction in indulging those imaginary objects of felicity than ever i experienced since i came by the death of a very distant relation to the possession of two thousand pounds a year i flatter myself i am no more of the miser than the generality of my neighbors and if know my own heart it is as likely to feel for the distresses of the unfortunate and as willing to relieve them as some whom i know to pique themselves mightily on the humanity of their tempers but this is not the point  my fortune has i may almost say unhinged the system upon which i formerly built my happiness and the actual possession cuts off every pleasure which originally resulted from a chimerical expectation  this you will probably look upon as a very extraordinary circumstance but it is nevertheless literally true instead of being able to reap any great pleasure from an estate i find it productive of nothing but uneasiness and anxiety my wants are very limited and soon gratified and the very superflux of fortune which to any other man might possibly be a matter of the highest satisfaction is to me a constant source of vexation and regret in the first place i have no child to enjoy my possessions after i am gone and i am nothing more than amassing for people who envy me when living and will in all likelihood despise me when dead the very man to whom i leave my estate will perhaps be the first to d  n the old curmudgeon for not tipping off half a dozen years sooner and those for whom i am continually doing a great deal the readiest to execrate my memory because i have not done a great deal more  but though a sensibility of this nature might in some measure render me regardless to the care of my affairs i look upon it as an indispensible part of my duty to prevent as much as possible the least disadvantage from my negligence and inattention and am less fearful of the probable contempt i may meet from my relations than the certain ridicule i must suffer from my tenants and dependants was i to wink at a continual plunder of my property and to permit them indiscriminately to grow opulent at my expense thus any way sir whether i exert a commendable prudence or throw it entirely aside this unfortunate estate clings like a detested sin to my rememberance and poisons every comfort which i once was weak enough to imagine it would have produced if it rains for any time i am fearful my corn will be washed away if the weather is uncommonly fine i am apprehensive of its being parched up if it freezes with severity alas for my poor flowergarden if the wind happens to be high my appletrees are destroyed and if it shows i am in an absolute ague about my little lambs and eternally scolding john and thomas for not taking sufficient care to preserve them from the inclemency of the weather thus again in whatever manner the wisdom of the deity thinks proper to direct the seasons i am sure to show an impious dissatisfaction at his decrees and to use the emphatical words of mr pope with a little alteration snatch from his hand the balance and the rod rejudge his laws and am the god of god   from my situation mr babbler let those in the lower classes of life who murmur at the dispensations of providence and think it uncommonly hard to toil for a precarious subsistence while their neighbors are rolling it away in coaches and six learn to consider that it is not the dignity of rank or the affluence of fortune which is the source of real felicity but a mans own mind let them learn to consider that this very rank and this very opulence for which they continually languish are very often the causes of the most severe affliction and that the swelling dome of courtly magnificence undergoes many a storm which the humility of the villagers situation keeps from breaking on his little shed  i am yours etc infelix  numb xlviii saturday january   to the babbler sir the goodnatured readiness with which i see you insert a variety of letters upon domestic occurrences has induced me to trouble you with a complaint against my husband in hopes that his error may be avoided by others at least though it should fail of the intended reformation in himself  you must know sir my good man is a shopkeeper near cripplegate and as honest a painstaking young fellow as any of his business but his notions are rather too elevated for his circumstances so that neither the strictest industry nor the most rigid integrity are likely to carry him prosperously through life unless i can prevail upon him to change the present frame of his inclination as the principal part of his acquaintance are tradesmen of eminence and have their snug little country houses to retire to of a sunday my husband determined to make as genteel a figure as the best of them and accordingly took a handsome box enough last summer near stratford it was in vain that i represented the inconveniences which it would inevitably produce or mentioned a word about the prodigious expense i was told that mr refine the goldsmith our next door neighbor was as little able to afford such a circumstance as ourselves it was observed that sir richard steel somewhere said the surest method of making a good fortune was to carry the appearance of an easy one and that surely it was very hard if we could not have a place where we might enjoy a little peace and quietness one day in the week to crown the whole my husband like many other people when they have a favorite point to carry was resolved to find reasons enough to support not only the propriety but the absolute necessity of his behavior and brought one which was unanswerable he complained his health was considerably impaired by a constant residence in town and insisted that nothing but a change of air was able to recover it this silenced me at once and a house of twentysix pounds a year with a neat pretty garden behind it was taken immediately contiguous to the road side for the greater facility of taking the stage coach and seeing the various rounds of company that passed by  as our house has a very reputable appearance without my husband was resolved that a correspondence should be kept up within and therefore furnished it very genteelly laying out no less than three hundred pounds for this purpose so large a sum expended as i may say upon an unnecessary account was not a little inconvenient to a young couple scarcely four years in trade and whose capital at first was rather moderate in fact sir we soon felt it and were under the disagreeable exigence of borrowing the same sum at an interest of five per cent to keep up our business with a proper degree of consequence and punctuality well sir every thing being in order at our new habitation we entered upon it to enjoy a mouthful of fresh air and a little repose from the fatigues of the week but see the uncertainty of all human expectations the fairer the weather the more we were deprived of the air for being situated so immediately on the road we were choked with a cloud of dust if the window was kept open but a single moment and had no other prospect but what was furnished by a lifeless stare through an humble pain of glass if we retired backwards we lost the variety which company afforded and stood a chance of being serenaded with the music of half a hundred hogs which our next door neighbor had constantly breeding in his yard  this circumstance was very disagreeable but still a material consolation remained that of enjoying our sundays wholly uninterrupted but here also mr babbler we were quickly undeceived the moment we entered our acquaintance formed parties to dine at our house and any three or four who were at a loss to kill a sunday agreed without any hesitation to go and eat a bit of mutton with their friend will sheffield the hardwareman by this means sir instead of retiring to tranquillity and repose we opened a new scene of bustle and confusion and kept a house for no other purpose but to bring on an everlasting round of drudgery and a very heavy expense those who know any thing of housekeeping mr babbler are sensible how small a way a guinea goes in providing a decent entertainment for half a dozen people i therefore leave you to judge how agreeably i must be situated when forced to wear a constant appearance of the utmost satisfaction to the very people whom in my heart i could have wished in a horsepond or scoldedout of the house  disappointed in all his expectation mr babbler and the charm of novelty being also worn away my husband is heartily sick of his villa yet is both ashamed and afraid to throw it off his hands he is fearful his friends will circulate the laugh against him and is apprehensive his enemies will make use of it to prejudice him in his trade i have told him over and over it is better for him to be thought a blockhead than to prove himself one and much more to his interest to bear a casual reflection on his circumstances than to be a beggar at once i have pointed out a variety of tradesmen whose ruin originally proceeded from the vanity of keeping a country house but all to no purpose for though he acknowledges the justice of my observation he remains incorrigible and therefore i have thought it better to print his name in your paper than suffer it to appear in the london gazette  we have now three children sir and this cursed country house which we have not set a foot in but twice during the whole winter runs away with as much as would maintain my whole family  let me only present you with a cursory estimate  l s d rent    0 0 taxes say   0 0 an additional servant who is to take care of it wages board and lodging  0 0 0 interest for  00 l to furnish it    0 0 accidents and repairs   0 0 coachhire backward and forward   0 0 l    0 0  this sir not to say a word of the additional charge of housekeeping for there must be meat drink and fire for our apprentice shopman and maid in town visitors and unavoidable neglect of business is a considerable sum and in a course of twenty years with a little management and the blessing of providence would prove a pretty provision for my poor children pray sir print my letter that london tradesmen may first get fortunes before they entertain a notion of spending them and not for the vanity of occupying a country house twenty or thirty days in a whole year throw away what would purchase a handsome independence for their whole lives  i am sir your most humble servant sarah sheffield  numb xlix saturday january    to the babbler sir i dont know a more prevailing error at present among all ranks of people than an endeavor to disguise their real situation in life by an appearance totally inconsistant with their character and circumstances this reflection i am naturally led into by a visit which i paid the other morning to my old friend sir timothy trotter who has been many years in a declining way with the gout but who nevertheless like another lord chalkstone is all life and spirits in the lucid intervals as i may say of his distemper  when i was showed up stairs it did not a little surprise me to see two fellows dressed like grooms sitting very familiarly by sir timothys elbowchair with jockeywhips in their hands talking in a careless indolent manner of hot mashes long stirrups currycombs and curbs as my old friend had always been remarkable for keeping the best company i was the more amazed at so odd a couple of visitors i remember to have dined with him at the square when there have been half a dozen stars in the room besides the two archbishops and three of the foreign ambassadors however as it was no business of mine i sat down and in a little time to my inexpressible astonishment heard that these two despicable looking things were no less than two noblemen of very great fortune the earl of snaffle worth and my lord donefirst  struck as i was at that time i could not help reflecting how unworthy a nobleman of great britain a man born to be a legislator in the most generous country of the universe and honored with so great a degree of political sanctity that his bare affirmation was considered as important as an oath should be dressed in a dirty pair of boots greasy leather breeches a striped flannel waistcoat a threadbare drabcoat and a little round hat like a watermans no wonder thought i that the french should look upon us as a nation of paltryminded people when we study to appear contemptible and our very nobility who ought to glory in keeping up the consequence of their characters are ashamed to look like what they are and sneak from the dignity of titles into the high and mighty quality of grooms  while i was thus reflecting the servant came up and told sir thomas that doctor styptic and mr skirts the tailor were below stairs upon which he was ordered without much compliment i thought to the doctor to send them both up he did so and a welllooking man of about fifty first entered dressed in a very handsome suit of fulltrimmd black a large deepbottomd wig and every necessary article requisite for the seriousness of the faculty  ay thinks i this gentleman is perfectly in character and is i dare say a sensible person by so close an adherence to propriety i had scarcely made the reflection however when sir thomas cried out so skirts have you brought the breeches home to which having received an answer in the affirmative he returned well that is an hones fellow  go about your business  being so much disappointed in the tailor i wished for the doctors appearance and wondered what the deuce could detain him so long at last the door opened and a gentleman entered in a suit of spotted silk his hair nicely dressed and baggd and nothing about him but what bespoke the very meridian of parisian elegance  thinks i if this should be the doctor  my conjecture was not illfounded this was the identical son of galen whom if i had not seen actually writing a recipe i should have positively taken for a french man of fashion or a figuredancer at the theater  when i was just going away sir thomass nephew who has been lately called to the bar came in from westminster in his gown and tyewig well says i to myself thank heaven here is one man who is not ashamed of appearing in character but the young gentleman was not seated above three minutes before he pulled off his wig in the presence of the whole company and showed as smart a head of hair in the tyburn taste as could be found within the bills of mortality  i stared and saw the uncle was not a little diverted with my astonishment he thought the transformation a very capital circumstance and seemed proud of a nephew who could alternately put on the gravity of the council and the pertness of the footman i was however disgusted extremely and took my leave heartily convinced that nothing but a very great weakness of the mind could occasion so many improprieties in the embellishment of the person  yours etc senex  numb l saturday january    it was a customary answer with the celebrated dean swift when any body asked his opinion of a great man stay till i see him in distress for my own part though i think the reply according to the general sense of the world extremely significant yet i can by no means imagine that distress is the true touchstone of fortitude so far on the contrary it has been my positive belief for a long time that he who can best stand the shock as i may say of prosperity gives the best proof of an even mind and shows the firmest stability of soul notwithstanding what has been said by our most celebrated philosophers on the other side of the question adversity has been justly called the school of wisdom by a variety of writers because there is nothing which is so expeditious in bringing a man to a knowledge of himself when reduced to a narrowness of circumstances or confined to the anxieties of a sick bed the mind naturally turns her eye on those objects which are most likely to afford her consolation and relief religion in a moment tells her the uncertainty of all human expectations and bids her depend alone on those blissful assurances of happiness in another world which experience has convinced her are so extremely precarious in this hence she learns a proper mode of thinking shows an implicit submission to the correcting hand of providence and becomes perfectly acquainted with what is due to others from a just sensibility of what is necessary for herself  prosperity on the other hand may be considered the school of selfsufficience and the almost perpetual parent of pride whenever the sun of prosperity sheds a ray upon mankind they are apt to grow important in their own opinions and to think rather contemptibly of those very people who were formerly on the list of their intimate friends the goodness of the deity they imagine to be the consequence of particular merit and look upon that as the result of their own immediate sagacity which is nothing but the unbounded benignity of their god for these reasons therefore i cannot help imagining but what true fortitude or equanimity is best seen in prosperity we admire the tranquillity of a socrates going to die but are ravished with the unswelling moderation of a caesar when master of an empire and still retaining all the complacency of a private citizen  i am naturally led into these reflections by a visit which i paid the other morning to my old friend ned blaze to congratulate him on an estate of three thousand pounds a year which lately fell into his possession by the will of an uncle who goodnaturedly left him every thing at his death but who while living would not part with a sixpenny piece to save him from destruction ned for many years past has struggled with all the difficulties of a high spirit a large family and a very narrow fortune sometimes he has been obliged to stay at home for months and at others has been months in jail yet still he kept up his resolution with all the fortitude of a stoic and behaved with a degree of decency and manliness which procured him the universal esteem and not seldom the universal assistance of his acquaintance  as i had always a regard for ned and if i may be excused the egotism had proved this regard upon more occasions than one i was sincerely rejoiced at his good fortune and the moment i heard of it set out to tell him so when i came to his house instead of being instantly shown up stairs by the maid as had been the custom formerly a fellow with a bag to his hair long ruffles and a laced livery desired me in broken english to rest myself in the parlour and he would carry my name immediately to his master well i went into the parlour sat down and amused myself aabove an hour with the elegant essays of my worthy and ingenious friend dr goldsmith which were accidentally lying in the window my entertainment was too agreeable for me to think the time long and i perhaps should not have thought about it at all if the clock had not alarmed me with the stroke of two surprised at this unexpected delay i touched the bell and asked the servant if he had told his master of my being below he replied in the affirmative and added that he would wait on me immediately  in about a quarter of an hour i heard the dining room door opened and was informed of mr blazes approach by a slow heavy consequential stamp on the stairs the servant threw open the parlour door for him as he descended and my friend entered with all the gravity and importance of a very great man as i fancied he might think it necessary to assume this seriousness of appearance on such an occasion as the recent death of a near relation i ran to him with my usual freedom gave him a hearty shake by the hand and said dear ned i am sincerely rejoiced at this happy alteration in your circumstances but i had no longer honest ned blaze to deal with my familiarity i saw was infinitely disgusting mr blaze stole his hand out of mine as soon as he could and making me a low bow replied mr babbler i thank you we then sat down but our conversation lost all that spirit and good humor which we formerly thought it possessed before mr blazes unlucky acquisition of fortune we were as ceremonious in an instant as if we had never seen each other before and every observation upon the fineness of the weather was introduced and concluded with a sir  of perfect good breeding and gentility mr blaze however being resolved to show all his consequence rang and enquired after the footmen by name that i might judge the number of his domestics he then ordered one with a card to my lord and another with a compliment to his grace asked if the goldsmith had sent home the new service of plate or if the vis a vis was yet finished at the coach makers this conversation with the servant was kept up with as much indolence and tediousness as if no such person as myself had been in the room i therefore thought it but just to show a proper degree of resentment by immediately taking my leave i did so after receiving a cool invitation to dinner and being told there was nothing provided but ten or a dozen things and no company but the earl of sharpset and the countess of ombre when i went home i thought this little narrative would make a tolerable paper as it served to rivet me in my belief that the most difficult shock which any man can possibly stand is that of prosperity  numb li saturday january    to the babbler sir though every body must allow the character of a coquette to be truly despicable even among the women yet when we find it in the other sex there is something in it so unmanly that we feel a detestation equal to our contempt and look upon the object to be as much an enemy as he is a disgrace to society to prove my assertion however mr babbler give me leave to relate a circumstance which lately happened in my own family and which if properly attended to may be of real use to many of your fair readers  i am a merchant in the city and have been above five years married to a most deserving woman who as she studies every thing to promote my happiness obliges me to show a grateful sensibility for the establishment of here is and even warms me with a continual wish of anticipating the most distant of her inclinations about six months ago i took her younger sister home as i knew it would give her a satisfaction intending to supply the loss of a father lately deceased and to omit no opportunity of advancing her fortune  my attention could not have been placed on a more deserving object harriot sir possesses every beauty of person and every virtue of mind that can render her either beloved or respected and is in one word as accomplished a young woman as any in the kingdom her circumstances besides are no way inconsiderable she has ten thousand pounds in the funds and if she marries to my liking shall not want for a thousand or two more  but that does not signify  among the number of people who visited at our house mr babbler the son of a very eminent citizen frequently obliged us with his company a circumstance that pleased me not a little as he was far from a disagreeable man his person was remarkably genteel and his face possessed of a more than ordinary degree of sensibility he conversed with much ease was perfectly acquainted with men and things and what rendered him a still greater favorite he sung with an infinity of taste and played with a considerable share of judgment on a variety of instruments  this gentleman had not long commenced an intimacy in my family before he showed a very visible attachment for harriot hung upon every thing she said and approved of every thing she did but at the same time seemed rather more ambitious to deserve her esteem than to solicit it this i naturally attributed to his modesty and it rather more confirmed me in the opinion which i entertained of his affection had he treated her with the customary round of common place gallantry i should never have believed him serious but when i saw him assume a continual appearance of the most settled veneration and esteem when i saw him unremittingly studious to catch the smallest opportunity of obliging i was satisfied there was no affectation in the case and convinced that every look was the spontaneous effusion of his heart  the amiable harriot unacquainted with art suspected none and being of a temper the most generous herself naturally entertained a favorable opinion of every body else mr selby in particular possessed the highest place in her regard the winning softness of his manners the uncommon delicacy of his sentiments and his profound respect for her to say nothing of his personal attractions all united to make an impression on her bosom and to inspire her with the tenderest emotions of a reciprocal love she made her sister her confident upon this occasion about a week ago and maria very properly told the matter immediately to me finding harriots repose was seriously concerned i determined to give mr selby a fair opportunity of declaring himself the next evening that there might be no possibility of a mistake in the case and that my poor girl might be certain she had a heart in exchange for her own with this view i engaged him on a tete a tete party to vauxhall and while he was lamenting that my wife and sister was not with us to participate in the amusement i said gaily egad tom i have a strange notion that harriot has done your business you are eternally talking of her when she is absent and as eternally languishing at her when she is by how is all this come own have i been right in my guess and treat me with the confidence of a friend  this question quite disconcerted him he blushed stammered and with a good deal of pressing at last drawled out that miss harriot to be sure was a most deserving young lady and that was he inclined to alter his condition there was not a woman in the world he would be so proud of having for a wife but though he was extremely sensible of her merit he had never considered her in any light but that of a friend and was to the last degree concerned if any little assiduities the natural result of his esteem had once been misinterpreted and placed to a different account  the whole affair was now out the mans character was immediately before me and though i could have sacrificed him on the spot for the meanness and barbarity of his conduct yet i bridled my resentment and would not indulge him with a triumph over harriot by letting him see i considered his late declaration as a matter of any consequence i therefore assumed a gaiety which was quite a stranger to my heart and replied i am excessively glad tom to hear you talk in this manner faith i was afraid all had been over with you and my friendship for you was the only reason of my enquiry as i shrewdly suspect the young baggage has already made a disposal of her inclinations  after passing a joyless evening we returned to town quite sick of one anothers company and pretty confidently determined to have no intercourse for the future when i had set mr selby down i went to maria and told her how things had turned out and desired her to break them with all the delicacy she was mistress of to her unfortunate sister she did so but the shock is likely to prove fatal harriot has ever since kept her bed and for the three last days has been quite delirous she raves continually on the villain who has murdered her peace of mind and my everengaging maria sits rivetted to the bedside as continually drenched in tears in spite of all my endeavors to keep the matter private the tattling of nurses and servants has made it but too public and denied us even the happiness of being secretly miserable the moment i heard it talked of i called upon mr selby and demanded satisfaction but could i expect a man to be brave who was capable of acting such a part as his to a woman of honor and virtue no sir he called his servants about me in his own house and after my departure went and swore the peace before a magistrate this is the only method which i have now left to punish him and the only one also of exhorting parents and guardians to require an instant explanation from any man who seems remarkably assiduous about a young lady and yet declines to make a positive declaration of his sentiments  i am mr babbler with much respect your humble servant charles torrington  numb lii saturday january    coquetry or a passion for exercising the most unlimited authority of affectation or caprice on a lover is a foible which renders the ladies so extremely ridiculous in the opinion of the world that it is astonishing how such a number of the fairsex can possibly give into it and for the mere sake of making another uneasy become absolutely contemptible themselves abstracted however from the ridicule to which such a character is always exposed there is a degree of meanness and cruelty in the composition of a coquette which throws the greatest reflection imaginable upon the benevolence of a ladys temper and does not more depreciate the goodness of her heart than lessen the opinion we might entertain of her understanding to delight in rendering a worthy man wretched for the sake of showing a little power is surely what the giddiest creature in the universe must condemn upon a moments reflection and when she moreover considers that his wretchedness must always be proportioned to his tenderness for her gratitude as well as humanity must show her behavior in a very culpable light and tell her that every pang which she lodges in his bosom is an absolute dishonor to her own  the generality of the ladies have a want of candor to answer for which is too often a source of the severest anxiety to others as well as a spring of the greatest embarrassment to themselves  ravished with the enchanting breath of admiration they lend a greedy ear to the ardent language of protesting love though at the same time it is a thousand to one but they look upon the lover with the most insuperable contempt hence though they never intend to bless him with a riciprocal return they never can prevail upon themselves to give him a final discharge and the poor man is in all probability kept dangling for two or three years till either avarice or inclination a large estate or a red coat makes a conquest of the heart and to use the emphatic words of the celebrated doctor young  amply gives though treated long amiss the man of merit his revenge in this for the honor of the ladies however i shall introduce a little narrative to the public observation which i hope will serve as an example to my fair readers and at the same time convince those infidels who are averse to believing any thing laudable of the sex that they are to the full as capable of the most exalted actions as ourselves however we may erect the crest upon the superior dignity of manhood or swell upon the acquired advantages of education and knowledge of the world  about ten years ago a gentleman of considerable family in ireland whom i shall distinguish by the name of butler being over on an excursion to this metropolis he accidentally dined at a friends house in pall mall where he fell passionately in love with a young lady whom i must be equally free in concealing under the name of lambton  mr butler communicated his sentiments to his friend who happened to be a relation of miss lambtons and requested his good offices with the lady  the friend who knew mr butler to be a most deserving young fellow and was sensible that in point of birth and fortune he had considerable advantages over his fair relation was overjoyed at the proposal and communicating it to her father next morning poor miss lambton received positive orders to prepare for mr butlers visit that very afternoon  mr butler came dressed and a finer figure perhaps was not to be found within the bills of mortality he wanted but half an inch of six foot and was made in a manner remarkably manly without running into any thing unweildily clumsy or awkwardly robust his face was distinguished with a set of strong marking lines each feature to use the poets expression was expanded with soul and breathed the inexpressible somewhat which discovers the man of fashion at the first glance add to this that there was something uncommonly interesting in his very tone of voice which no less engaged the general attention than commanded the universal respect he came in a suit of pompadour velvet richly embroidered with silver and seemed as well calculated in fact to succeed with a fine lady as the most celebrated of his countrymen  being left designedly alone with miss lambton after tea time he began in a very sensible and polite manner to make a declaration of his sentiments but had scarcely uttered a sentence when the young lady interrupted him and begged his attention for a few words he made a low bow and she addressed him to the following purport i am but too apprehensive sir on what account i am honored with this visit my father this morning made me acquainted with your partiality in my favor and to be candid from the little i have seen of you i do not know a man in the world was my heart disengaged who should sooner command a place in my esteem but sir it is impossible for me ever to return your sentiments as you could wish my affections have for a considerable time been engrossed by a gentleman whom i have been many years acquainted with and i should think it an unpardonable injury to his tenderness as well as to your worth was i to keep this circumstance a moment from your knowledge after you have indicated the smallest degree of a particular respect  it is easy to guess mr butlers astonishment during this speech he blushed excessively played with his ruffles and gave no other interruption than a madam or two pronounced with the strongest emphasis of surprise miss lambton seizing the opportunity which his silence afforded thought it best to disembosem herself entirely and thus went on  from the opinion which i entertain of your generosity mr butler i flatter myself you will not use my fathers authority to tear me from the only man i ever can be happy with nor make any attempts to gain a hand which on account of my prior attachment can never be worthy of yours let me conjure you therefore dear sir to decline your addresses and if you can have the additional goodness to give such a measure any motive but this declaration through my whole life i shall be bound to wish you that felicity with some more deserving woman which it is utterly impossible you should ever enjoy with me  i will not trespass upon the readers patience with an account of what further passed upon this occasion suffice it however that mr butler not only discontinued his addresses from that minute but interested himself so effectually in favor of miss lambton and her lover mr seymour that old mr lambton gave his consent to their marriage and mr butler himself stood godfather to a fine boy about ten months after  in the course of a few years mr seymour by some lucky hits accumulated a prodigious fortune and died leaving the sum of thirty thousand pounds at the sole disposal of his lady the rest he divided among his children mrs seymour whose affection for her husband was uncommonly tender did not long survive so great a loss she fell into a languishing disorder that carried her off in about eighteen months universally regretted by all who had the pleasure of her acquaintance a little before her decease however she made a strict enquiry after mr butler of whom she had not heard a syllable for the space of seven years she at last found out that he had retired to the south of france upon an annuity of a hundred pounds his fine estate having been entirely destroyed chiefly through the perfidy of his younger brother for whom he had been bound in immense sums and several ineffectual schemes to retrieve the shattered situation of his affairs  the generous heart of mrs seymour overflowed with pity at his distress his exalted conduct in relation to her and mr seymour rushed at once upon her recollection and in her will which she ordered to be made without delay she inserted this particular clause with her her own hand i give and bequeath to the hon charles butler the sum of ten thousand pounds on account of his great generosity in withdrawing his addresss when i was unmarried and using his good offices toward my union with my dear mr seymour  this legacy was paid immediately after mrs seymours decease and the story was last night told me by a gentleman of undoubted veracity who received it himself from mr butler  numb liii saturday february   to the babbler sir as you have kindly taken the poor women under your protection give me leave to complain through your muchadmired paper of two young fellows relations of my own indeed who constantly visit at our house the first sir is a templar lately called to the bar who thinks the essence of every thing either amiable or polite is entirely confined to his profession and is continually teazing us with pleas replications rejoinders and demurrers the other is possessed of an independent fortune and is what the unthinking part of the world calls a man of the town a person of great humor and a keen sensible fellow  as there are three or four girls of us generally together and both mr brief and mr brazen are men of professed gallantry they are always sure of joining us at the teatable to make the best display play of their respective abilities yet instead of conversing upon those topics which we can cheerfully join in they talk continually on those subjects which are either totally impossible or utterly improper for us to understand my cousin brief retails all the causes that are determined in westminster hall with the most insufferable minuteness and insipidity and after he has taken up our attention for two hours together looks round with an air of such prodigious importance that i have been often more provoked at this consequential demand of our approbation for fatiguing us with his impertinence than even with the impertinence itself though nothing can be so disgusting contemptible and absurd  but what if possible aggravates the error in this worthy cousin of mine is a custom which he has of putting cases to us and asking us the meaning of subpaena latitat capias certiorari and a thousand other technical terms in the law which he considers as matters of the greatest importance and then sir when he has entirely nonplussed us you would laugh to see how he plumes himself upon the triumph he has acquired and with how significant a wink he looks round on his friend mr brazen as much as to bid him observe what a despicable figure he has made of the foolish giddyheaded girls of the company  mr brazen does not indeed take mr briefs method of destroying our patience or insulting our understandings with what we cannot comprehend for on the contrary sir he piques himself upon being a remarkably plain speaker and will not hesitate to pronounce the most apparent indelicacies in the most offensive words he looks upon it as frankness to be gross and thinks it a certain sign of wit to be unpardonably rude and unmannerly he told my sister sally no later than yesterday that she was an ignorant little puss and when i took him up for the familiarity laughed directly in my face and said i had a prodigious deal of impudence then sir he swears so horridly he terrifies us to death and scarcely mentions any thing without one of these shocking execrations from an opinion that indelicacy is a sign of great sense and a belief that it is very spirited to be blasphemous he is continually showing his parts at the expense of common decency and always making a parade of his courage by flying in the face of his god many is the time sir he has sent me sinking with shame out of the room and made me shudder with the earnest pronounciation of some newinvented oath which he has picked up in the licentious circle of his miserable acquaintance  i am the more concerned mr babbler for this culpable conduct in my two cousins because they are both very honest wellmeaning young fellows and are far from being destitute either of real benevolence or true generosity i wish therefore sir you would tell them that nothing can be a greater insult to a womans understanding than to converse with her about matters with which it is impossible she should be acquainted and that nothing can be a grosser affront to the rectitude of her heart than the iliberal practice of those indecencies and execrations which are generally confined to the most profligate of her sex  i am far very far mr babbler from preaching up an unnecessary preciseness or severity of behavior on the contrary i think freedom while it is confined within the limits of goodbreeding one of the most amiable essentials to the pleasure of every rational company but sir where this freedom infringes so far upon the bounds of politeness that a woman is either treated as an idiot or something infinitely worse that moment i think the man is entitled to the heaviest censure who forgets the dignity of her sex and acts as if she was utterly unworthy either of sensible converse or common civility  you men mr babbler are in general very severe upon the women you laugh at us for talking about our caps our ribbands or our lapdogs i would advise your lordly sex however to look at home and before they think of plucking the mote out of our eyes to be pretty certain there are no beams in their own  yours etc amanda  numb live saturday february    as my fair correspondent amandas letter inserted in my last paper has given i am told a general satisfaction it will not i hope be disagreeable to my readers if i resume the subject especially as i want to introduce a little journal to their observation which was lately presented to me with the papers of a deceased man of quality who was unhappily a man of gallantry also and indulged a licentiousness of thinking in some cases that reflected no great honor either upon his humanity or understanding  i have frequently remarked what a degree of nicety is requisite in the education of young women and delivered it as my opinion that those parents were very fortunate who from the sex of their children had none of the various consequences to apprehend which the least indiscretion in the ladies is constantly sure of bringing on a family i have said that the same levity of conduct which would steep a woman in the grossest lees of infamy is entirely over looked if not publicly approved in a man and that the mere circumstance of sex gives him a kind of privilege to practice a number of irregularities that would render an uncultivated female the scandal of society  but at the same time that the depravity of custom has given this unhappy superiority to the men at the time that our lordly sex is invested by the world with a prescriptive title of violating the most sacred of the divine ordinances neither reason nor religion has given us the least exemption from undergoing that dreadful examination in another life which is so fatally disregarded in this when we see the most triumphant libertine in his moments of illness or his hours of reflection it is then we find that this boasted right of doing wrong is nothing more than a glittering gewgaw that leads us into a certain destruction and ought to be lamented as the greatest of all misfortunes instead of being considered as a matter of consolation or looked upon with an eye of appetite or joy to speak in the language of the poet when we behold him languidly oppressed on deaths pale couch all ghastly and declined or dragged before the godhead of his breast and damned to all the hells within

round of masculine errors may be envied by the ignorant or coveted by the profligate i ask the greatest libertine existing who is not utterly destitute of common understanding how he would upon a cool consideration choose to be thought the author of the following journal though i shall give him a bit of encouragement into the bargain which is that few people in the gay world were ever better

memorandums which can be applicable to themselves if a similitude should be found to any of their acquaintance let not the privilege of the sex a moment extenuate the baseness of the man but let every body exclaim in the language of horace hic niger est hunc tu roman caveto  numb lv saturday february    to the babbler sir i here send you a remark or two upon a very celebrated performance which in its particular walk of genius has been mentioned as a masterpiece and possibly produced more imitators than any other poem in this age and kingdom i need scarcely tell you mr babbler that this piece is grays elegy in a country churchyard a piece sir which though i much admire i can by no means imagine to be so extremely perfect a work as it has been generally considered and the following are some of the reasons why i differ from the public opinion in this respect  the very first line sir which begins this elegy is an unsuccessful attempt at metaphor palpably repugnant to the rules of poetry and universal experience  the curfeu tolls the knell of parting day visibly alluding to the ringing of a bell at the death of somebody the author should have recollected however that this bell is never rung till somebody is actually dead and that therefore the term parting is consequently a false metaphor had he said indeed that the curfeu tolls the knell of parted day there could be no possibility of objection but parting is every whit as incongruous here as it would be in real life to toll a passing bell for a man before he had positively given up the ghost  in the course of the reflective part we come to the following stanzas perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands which the reigns of empire might have swayed and waked to exstacy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unrol chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of their soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste it is sweetness in the desert air some village hampden who with dauntless breast the little tyrants of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood   you see mr babbler notwithstanding both the thought and versification in those stanzas are extremely beautiful yet there is a lapse of no trifling nature in the execution the author in the very moment that he intended to lash cromwell with the greatest severity introduces him in the same company with hampden and milton the objects of his highest admiration and laments in the same introductory passage that chill penury repressed his noble rage and froze the genial current of his soul   it is odd that a noble rage should ever be a guilty one and somewhat surprising that a person of our authors extensive abilities could find no happier mode of conveying his censure and his applause indeed in the two subsequent stanzas he has endeavored to explain himself a little but as lady townly aptly expresses it it is nothing more than darning an old ruffle to make it the worse for mending  the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind  here mr babbler in the second line of the last stanza cromwell is allowed his share of virtue as well as hampden or milton and they in the pronoun plural their are dragged in for their share of vices as well as that celebrated usurper so that upon the whole though we guess the authors meaning well enough the stanzas are nevertheless a strange huddle of inconsistency and not a little injurious to the perspicuity of their elegant author  in the epitaph we are told here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melancholy marked him for her own    now for my own part i can by no means see any merit in being marked out by melancholy for her own though the conjunction and at the beginning of the last line seems to hint pretty strongly that melancholy is a necessary concomitant of science i shall be bold enough to affirm that if the word but was substituted for and the reading would be much improved and occasion a much stronger idea of tenderness than what can possibly be excited by the present word the epitaph was written on purpose to spread a tenderness through the mind of the reader but the word and making it as i said before a matter of merit to be melancholy the passage naturally fails of it is intended effect whereas had it been thus fair science frowned not on his humble birth but melancholy marked him for her own we should have then lamented that a worthy youth enriched with the gifts of science had the smallest reason for despondency and shed a generous tear in sympathy with his misfortunes  the last stanza in my opinion is either extremely perplexed or extremely indefensible  no farther seek his merits to disclose nor draw his frailties from their dread abode there they alike in trembling hope repose the bosom of his father and his god this stanza if it has any meaning at all can mean nothing but this that it is improper to examine either the merits or frailties of the person deceased since they are both alike reposed in one dread abode the bosom of his father and his god this is the first time i ever heard of a human creature making the bosom of his deity a repository for his errors and in the present case i think the fault still more inexcusable because the violence offered to reason and religion has no way assisted the poetry this being perhaps as lame a passage as any in the whole piece  from the foregoing cursory hints which i have thrown out with no illnatured design mr babbler i hope your readers will see there is a possibility of discovering motes in the sun and be a little cautious for the future how they mention any thing as the criterion of merit without first of all making a candid enquiry to see whether it has not some imperfections  yours misery mustard  numb lvi saturday february    my nephew harry called on me this morning and mentioned one of my papers which was prodigiously commended by several of his acquaintance particularly by miss cornelia marchmont who desired him in very strong terms to give me her compliments for the masterly rules which i had there laid down for the service of the ladies i dont known how it was but i received a considerable share of satisfaction from this compliment miss marchmont is a young lady of twentyone mistress of every polite accomplishment and every shining virtue and carries in an exquisite sweetness of countenance the most expressive indications of her fine understanding and her excellent heart my young rogue has i fancy a months mind to her and if i am at all acquainted with the language of the eyes cornelia is no way displeased at that circumstance harry as yet has told me nothing but i believe it will be a match if it should i intend taking up my residence with them for the remainder of my days and shall leave my little all to them and their children  the reader may possibly suspect that i am more than commonly sensible of this young ladys merit through a principle of vanity for the flattering encomium with which she has favored my productions i shall heartily acknowledge that it made me somewhat vain but i hope i shall be also believed when i say her complaisance no way enhanced my opinion of her accomplishments and now i am talking of vanity i cannot help observing how universally subject the human mind is to the attacks of this dangerous enemy for my own part though an old fellow when i have written any thing which i conceive may be useful worthy or done any thing which i fancy may be praise worthy i strut alone in my study with a degree of consequence scarcely credible till recollecting how ridiculous a figure i make in the eye of my own examination i blush at my selfsufficienc and immediately turn my thoughts upon some object which can be considered with a greater share of credit both to my modesty and my understanding  but to return   in the course of harrys conversation with me he said that miss marchmont had given him a letter for the use of the babbler which she requested might be inserted in the present number this letter says harry she lately wrote in answer to a very passionate epistle from a young fellow who has a company in the guards and who thinking her to be like the generality of the sex imagined a few fine expressions and a red coat were sufficient to render her insensible to all the duties which she owed to herself and her family  to colonel  sir i have just this moment received a letter from you in so very extraordinary a style that should i hesitate an instant to answer it the integrity of my own heart might be called into question or i might at least be supposed inclinable to encourage your wishes by the appearance of a tacit approbation to prevent the possibility of this alternative i must take the liberty of examining your sentiments pretty closely and i flatter myself that for your own sakes you will pay some little attention to the following arguments lightly soever as you might be led to consider them through any solicitude for mine  you set out with saying how tender an affection you have conceived for me and what a very high opinion you entertain both of my heart and my understanding  upon my word sir you have an uncommon share of penetration for you were never in my company above half an hour in your days and during that time you yourself made so conspicuous a figure in the conversation that i had not an opportunity of saying twenty syllables to be sure your subsequent entreaty is rather unhappy when my amazing qualifications come to be considered for the proof you desire me to give of a good disposition is to violate all the dignity and decorum of my sex by entering into a correspondence with an absolute stranger and the testimony you want of my good sense is to keep your delicate declaration of love from the knowledge of the only people in the world to whom it ought to be first of all revealed  my father and the rest of my family  in the name of wonder sir who are you that you should presume to think me capable either of such a meanness or such an absurdity what mighty merit are you possessed of that you should imagine half a dozen lines are powerful enough to destroy all the principles which i have been imbibing for the course of a whole life or what extraordinary obligations have you conferred upon me that i must in an instant sacrifice my own peace and the tranquillity of my family for no other end but that of gratifying your inclinations  o but you love me and therefore gratitude should oblige me to return you a favorable answer admitting the possibility even of such a circumstance pray sir let me ask you for whose sake do you love me mine or your own if it be for your own of course i am under no manner of obligation and if it should turn out as i am very much inclined to believe that you do not love me can thse fine speeches of yours do you imagine protect you from my honest indignation and contempt surely if your pretensions were of a nature that merited any bodys encouragement there could be no occasion for this sinister method of urging them but i see through your ridiculous drift sir you are positive that your fulsome declaration of a passion will charm me into an utter disregard for the sentiments of honor and filial affection and render my consummate wisdomship totally incapable of acting with the least degree of prudence or common understanding  o but you mean honorably and aspire at the happiness of my hand a pretty method you take indeed of soliciting my good opinion by supposing me not only an undutiful daughter but an absolute fool be assured sir if i ever alter my condition a fathers approbation must first of all countenance my choice and a perfect acquaintance with my lovers temper and principles confirm it but to put an end at once to your solicitations give me leave to inform you that it is by my fathers command i write this letter and that the disingenuous part you have acted on the present occasion renders it utterly impossible for you ever to obtain a favorable sentiment either from him or from  cornelia marchmont   i shall make no comment on this letter but recommend the example to the imitation of those among my fair readers who shall ever be in the same circumstances with the amiable writer  numb lvii saturday march   i was sitting at home the other morning ruminating on a subject for my next paper when the pennypostman rapped at the door and gave thomas the following epistle which i here present to the reader without the alteration of a syllable  to the babbler sir i am a constant reader of your paper and am very often entertained with the easy and familiar manner in which to use my lord bacons expression you bring home things to mens business and bosoms some time ago i remember myself particularly struck with the journal of a libertine and thought it an excellent way of lashing the vices of our men of gallantry who claim an indisputable right of destroying the happiness of every family into which they are admitted the mode of journalizing brought to my remembrance a little paper which i had written myself about seven years ago and called the journal of an author at that time mr babbler some youthful indiscretions deprived me of a fathers protection and i was reduced to the most miserable of all distresses that of writing for bread but whether i had too much pride or too little merit or both i shall not take upon me to say but my situation affected me so much that i once drew up the following state of it for a week and thought of inserting it in a magazine with which i happened to be connected the printer however refused it a place and my father becoming reconciled to me in a little time after it has since lain by and is now at your service for publication  monday morning  rose at seven to write an eastern tale against eight  finished it in time but going down stairs the maid who came up to light the fire thrust it in the grate and consumed what was to maintain me for the whole day  being nettled i spoke in pretty severe terms about her negligence when unluckily her mistress who happened to be coming up stairs told me i should wake mr fustian the actor who lived in the two pair of stairs room under me and desired i would think of getting her some money for i was no less than a fortnight in arrear  silenced  and sat down to perform my task a second time but the printer coming for copy and being chagrined at the disappointment some words ensued between us and he swore to look out directly for another hand  three oclock  too proud to make an apology to mr type  i sauntered to the park and accidentally fell into chat with a young fellow on one of the seats  in the course of the conversation i learned that he was a writer too  so guessing his business in the park to be much the same with my own  i took my leave of him for fear of entering into any disagreeable explanation in regard to circumstances  eight oclok got sixpence upon my clean shirt at the pawnbrokers  and dined upon a mutton chop and a pint of beer at the black lion in russel street  an unexpected misfortune  upon coming to pay my reckoning found the sixpence had slipped through a hole in my pocket which i had never before discovered  in the utmost confusion  insulted before the whole company by the waiter with the aggravating circumstance of hearing several infamous jests upon my black coat  relieved at last by the humanity of the landlord who happened to overhear the matter  threatened to turn the waiter off for his insolence  and calling me out of the room  slipped half a guinea in my hand  but when i was going about to thank him turned away and pulling out his handkerchief complained of very sore eyes  tuesday paid my landlady three shillings for her fortnights lodging  redeemed my shirt  and bought a pair of breeches for three and sixpence at a cellar in monmouthstreet  lived very comfortably on eighteenpence this day and the following  thursday  called upon by a printer who wanted me to write something on the plan of clelands mulier voluptatis  assuring me it would have a prodigious sale  declined his offer  talked to about assisting in a commentary on the bible and offered five shillings a week for every number of my notes  accepted the proposal  having no other prospect of existence  proceeded immediately on the task  and finished a number to my unspeakable disgrace in a night cellar that very evening  friday  mr compose came for copy and insisted upon my taking a pint of purl with him at the cat and bagpipes  advanced me half a guinea upon account and passed his word to a civil welllooking man one mr heelpiece with whom he happened to be in company for a pair of shoes  charmed with his goodnature i made him a present of four odes which he was kind enough to praise prodigiously and which i had afterward the pleasure of hearing he sold for a couple of guineas to a bookseller in the row  saturday  invited to dine by my landlord at the black lion  insisted upon paying him his half guinea  but he had not yet got the better of his sore eyes  being a tailor as well as a publican he took me up stairs and made me a present of a handsome suit of clothes  which he had made for me on purpose  saying with a careless air whenever you come to a chariot mr spondee it will be time enough to think of returning the compliment  my eyes excessively sore at that instant  sunday  quite smart  walked in the park  and was applied to by several booksellers who probably judged of my abilities by my appearance  undertook business for several and after got money enough to live decently though with an aching heart  the wives of some would criticize on my performances and one goodnatured lady who was suspected of assisting her husband in a certain review would insist that i should submit my pieces to her correction  this was so extremely irksome that i at last determined to try my fortune in a distant quarter of the world  when my father sent his steward with the blissful tidings of reconciliation to my lodgings since when i have entirely dropped my acquaintance with the muses and taken many an agreeable tour with my landlord of the black lion in my own coach to the different villas about this metropolis i am sir your most humble servant  sebastian spondee  numb lviii saturday march    greatly as the degeneracy of the present age may be talked of or highly soever as we may imagine the people of ancient times to surpass us either in morality or understanding i am nevertheless perfectly satisfied that there is as much good sense and as much real virtue to be met with in our own days as ever was found in the days of our forefathers notwithstanding the meritorious cobwebs of antiquity have happily concealed a number of their follies and their faults and thrown a friendly veil of oblivion over no inconsiderable share of their imperfections  the writers of the present times are not indeed burdened with the monstrous affectation which was so commonly met with among the philosophers of antiquity and therefore are probably held in a less consequential light both with regard to their principles and their abilities this however if properly considered is one reason why they may have a greater share of the latter though it does not in the remotest manner insinuate an inference of their being any way inferior in the first many of the ancient sages owed the greatest part of their reputation to circumstances which would entitle a modern to a dark room and a truss of straw or excite the general contempt at least against his folly and impertinence what would we think of a philosopher nowadays if instead of arguing the world by the force of sound reasoning out of their vices and absurdities he should be in continual tears about the former and in a perpetual fit of laughing at the last what would we say to any moralist who would search the public streets at noon with a candle and lanthorn and tell every body he met that he was endeavoring to find an honest man or what would we say to a cynic who by way of exhorting his countrymen against the allurements of luxury would make use of no other persuasives than bidding a total adieu to every social enjoyment and taking up his residence in a tub  the writers of a later date look with a just disdain upon such despicable instances of affectation and do not address themselves to the weakness but to the understanding of their countrymen it is not the passions which they want to work upon but the understanding which they want to convince and are infinitely more solicitous to establish a respectable opinion of their judgment and their integrity than ambitious to purchase an immortality by the practice of any illustrious absurdity which however it may dazzle a moment upon the imagination the cooler reflections of reason must consider with the most insuperable contempt far be it from me to pluck the smallest bay from the brow of antiquity i sincerely venerate many lessons inculcated by several of the philosophers but at the same time i cannot be totally insensible to the imperfections of their times or palpably blind to the merits of our own for this reason i must stand up for the character of modern understanding and declare it as my opinion that i think no two philosophers in the whole compass of antiquity have surpassed bacon and newton either in the extent or importance of their works and however i may incur the censure of classical readers i will go farther and venture to assert that shakespeare and milton are poets of as much excellence as either homer or virgil and possibly if the english language was but half so universally studied as the greek or latin i should find thousands who would not hesitate to give a more exalted forum of reputation to the two illustrious moderns than to the two celebrated names of antiquity who have for so many ages been considered as a sort of ne plus ultra to human genius in every performance of a poetical tendency  having said thus much in defense of modern understanding i shall say a few words in support of modern virtue against the heavy accusations of degeneracy which some inconsiderate writers are but too apt to lay at our door and but too ready to fasten on the credulity of the public  it must be readily granted that the history of modern times affords sufficient instances of vices which reduce human nature to the basest of all levels and throw the blackest stigma not only upon the dignity but upon the very name of man yet if we take a review of more distant ages we shall find equal examples of rapine perjury and blood the civilized states of greece produced as many scenes of ambition tyranny and murder as can possibly be found among the most barbarous nations and the virtuous romans themselves at the very moment they were affecting an uncommon sanctity of manners were robbing all the world to inculcate maxims of justice and cutting whole nations to pieces to teach them lessons of benevolence and humanity greece had it is phillip and it is alexander if france had her louis the xivth and rome had her caesar if england had her cromwell she also has a caligula and a nero to blacken everlastingly upon her annals if ours are stigmatized with an arbitrary charles or a bigoted james when i mention louis the xivth i by no means design to compare him with philip or alexander in any thing but his ambition and his rapacity they are in every other respect so infinitely the more exalted murderers that the sensible reader will readily perceive in this respect i intended a very limited parallel  seeing therefore that the most celebrated of the ancient eras cannot produce greater poets and philosophers than what appears upon the modern list i should be glad to ask what reasonable opinion can be assigned for our supposed depravity in understanding and i should be also glad to know how the charge of a depravity in manners can be supported when upon a candid review of the ancient annals they appear to be covered with at least an equal share of absurdities and crimes that the modern era is bad enough we have too many lamentable testimonies but there is no necessity to aggravate either our weakness or our guilt by making us worse than former times which wherever we examine were in the general a compound of the greatest villains and the grossest fools  numb lix saturday march    when the celebrated voltaire was in england he paid a visit to the famous mr congreve though he was utterly unacquainted with him and with that happy violation of ceremony which is the characteristic of elevated genius introduced himself upon the mere account of their respective literary reputations the englishman was however disconcerted and instead of looking upon the frankness of voltaires behavior as the greatest compliment that could be paid him he said he would be glad of being visited by mr voltaire as a private gentleman but could not think of cultivating a friendship with any body barely on the account of being an author the frenchman disgusted at this untimely instance of affectation turned upon his heel and replied with severity that had not mr congreve been somewhat more than a private gentleman he never would have suffered the trouble of that interview  the slightest survey of mankind will convince a rational enquirer that the generality of people are influenced by as injudicious a principle in their actions as mr congreve in the present circumstance to avoid the imputation of one extremity they insensibly run into another and let the character be what it will which they are fearful of incurring an excessive solicitude to avoid it exposes them frequently to one equally absurd and excites while they imagine themselves perfectly secure from ridicule or censure the universal laugh or disesteem of their acquaintance i am naturally led into these reflections by a letter from a correspondent whose favors i shall be always proud of receiving and whose good opinion i shall always study to deserve while my leisure and my inclination allow me to scribble for the amusement of the public  to the babbler sir though the world seldom holds any set of people in a more ridiculous light than your pretty delicate race of beings who are unceasingly employed in the decoration of their persons yet for my own part i think the eternal sloven to the full as contemptible a character as the coxcomb professed nay if possible i consider him as the worst of the two since though the latter may provoke your mirth he does not turn your stomach and is at most but an object of laughter without giving any occasion for disgust i lately spent a few weeks near whitehaven in cumberland mr babbler where i had frequent opportunities of conversing with a very worthy clergyman who formerly was my schoolmaster and who has as good a heart and as clear an understanding as any man in the kingdom as we kept company on the most unreserved terms of friendship my powdered head of hair and white coat was a continual source of entertainment to him and he would often call me a young coxcomb if in walking through a wet field or a dirty road i seemed to take the smallest pains about my stockings or expressed a casual wish that i had not come abroad without my boots a very trifling concern about the accumulating sableness of a shirt would procure me a lecture of half an hour and a clean handkerchief once a day was a piece of unpardonable foppery that merited the discipline of a horsewhip in short sir being barely decent in my externals was sure of drawing an imputation upon the little share of understanding i possess and in proportion as i was tolerably dressed i was certain of being told i had an intolerable degree of vanity  the goodhumoured liberties thus taken with my appearance i constantly retorted upon my reverend friend for running into the most disagreeable negligence imaginable if my powdered head and smooth chin afforded him a laugh i was no less merry with his antiquated grizzel and long beard and for every sarcasm thrown out against my white cotton stockings i never failed to be witty on his coarse yarn ones which through an absolute piece of affectation he continually wore half way about his heels in this manner we used to joke when at a loss for conversation and it generally proved a matter of no little entertainment to the honest country people to hear us rating one another so heartily  this perpetual negligence in the appearance of my worthy friend very often led me to reflect upon the motive which could induce so many people of excellent understandings to be so extremely regardless of their persons and i never could imagine but what it was some strange kind of vanity which in general produced this unaccountable slovenliness notwithstanding to avoid every imputation of vanity is the universal plea of all the slovens of my acquaintance looking upon any remarkable attachment to dress as a proof of a weak mind your men of sense affect to be entirely above it and willing to enhance their own consequence by depending solely on the force of intellectual merit they run to studied indecencies of appearance and very often carry not only a dirty shirt but an unsavory effluvia into the politest companies  people of sense should however consider that a cleanliness in dress is not a little conducive to health and that it can be no derogation from their understandings to make use of an occasional basin of water in the scowering of their hands and face all extremes are an imputation upon our judgments and the best proof which men of abilities can give of their superior wisdom on ordinary occasions is to avoid the smallest appearance of singularity wherever we see men running into singularities of any kind we may safely conclude that the judgment is not perfectly right but when we see these singularities have a tendency only to occasion universal disgust we may be satisfied that whoever is guilty of them is possessed of an uncommon share of pride at the bottom and thinks that the accomplishments of his mind sufficiently atone for any egregious disregard of his person  every man owes something to the satisfaction of his friends notwithstanding so many people absurdly imagine they are entirely formed for themselves a philosopher or a poet may challenge our admiration on the score of his abilities yet if he sacrifices all consideration to a decency in his appearance it is impossible he should ever be beloved converse with him we may but we can neither choose to sit near him at table nor pledge him out of the same glass and however we may despise a coxcomb for his vanity and want of understanding we shall be always inclined to give him the preference to a notorious sloven both in every public place and at every social entertainment  i am sir etc verax  numb lx saturday march    though no man can be a greater admirer of english hospitality than myself i have nevertheless been frequently offended at seeing this hospitality carried to a ridiculous excess and have always imagined where i saw the master of a house running into a large expense merely for the entertainment of two or three intimate friends that he must entertain either a very improper opinion of himself or a strange idea of his company  i dined yesterday with my old friend ned grumble the council at graysinn with whom i went to school and who notwithstanding the smart air which an occasional queue wig gives him is at least eight and fifty and ought to know a little more of the world than what he manifested in his entertainment there were but three of us ned dr system the naturalist and myself yet we had dinner enough from the tavern to serve twenty and such a profusion of luxuries that the bare eatables must at least have amounted to six or seven pounds to be sure ned is a man of fortune and can afford to treat his friends very genteelly but for my own part i never form my notions of gentility by the standard of extravagance i dont love to see money unnecessarily thrown away and always wish that people of condition would apply the superfluities of their income either to the relief of merit in distress or to those objects which must promote the general welfare of their country  as the various courses came in i observed ned was secretly pleased with the air of surprise which i naturally put on and seemed to rise in his own opinion in proportion to the elegance of his table with a look of indifference he pressed the doctor and i to eat hearty and with a very ridiculous kind of an affectation lamented that there was nothing which we could possibly like he wished the dinner had been to our tastes and with the long list of customary excuses which usually pass for good breeding in secondrate companies he promised the next time we favored him with a visit we should be accommodated in a manner infinitely more to our satisfaction  when i returned home i could not help reflecting on the pernicious prevalence of customs in the generality of our convivial entertainments the eternal endeavor at parade and magnificence i considered as the natural result of vanity and saw that by much the principal part of the world was considerably more studious to arrogate the opinion of their own importance than to promote the satisfaction of their friends every dish which was added to a table i found was looked upon as an addition to the merit of the entertainer and he that was a clever fellow with a turbot was still clever if he could furnish a john dory or provide any other article of luxury equally expensive and unnecessary  if however we examine this matter properly we shall always find that an excess of preparation instead of being a real compliment is nothing better than indirect offense it is a tacit insinuation either that our guests are not generaly used to such delicacies as we have provided for them or that it is absolutely necessary to bribe the depravity of their pallates when we would desire the favor of their company the great art of entertaining with elegance is to entertain with reason to do this we must consult the nature of our circumstances and the rank of our friends if the first are narrow we expose ourselves to the severest censure as well as the keenest ridicule by aping the luxurious abundance of a lord mayors table and let the latter be what will we should endeavor to treat them after the customary manner in which they treat themselves in their own families for this reason we should never insult a poor man with all the magnificence of fifty covers nor invite a lord to an humble shin of beef a decent supply of good dishes should always be in readiness but nothing ever studied for unnecessary parade plenty and not profusion should be the characteristic of our board and we should constantly recollect that those are utterly unworthy the appellation of friends who could wish us to squander a parced of valuable pounds for the mere sake of making an empty display of our opulence when the sum thus extravagantly laid out might be applied to a number of very salutary purposes  there are several people however who are hurried away by an unaccountable desire of appearing extremely splendid in their entertainments and make it a sort of point to keep a table considerably above their circumstances i remember poor dick thornton would frequently invite people to dinner and treat with champagne and burgundy though he borrowed the money which paid the bill of fare but the evening before from some of his guests or pitifully begged a fortnights credit at the mitre in fleet street  hospitality to be sure requires every man to receive his acquaintance with the utmost cordiality and warmth but it by no means desires people of small fortune to be constantly impoverishing themselves for the sake of keeping an extensive circuit of company neither does it dictate that those with full purses should ever run into extravagance none however mistake the matter more than young fellows who are just entering in the world and have no other prospect of supporting themselves than the success of their respective avocations betrayed by too great a generosity of temper they imagine they never can show a sufficient welcome to their friends and hence they inconsiderately provide twenty or thirty dishes for those very men whose general round of living they know to be a plain simple joint or a frugal beef stake at a tavern for my own part whenever it has been my lot to dine with persons of this cast the uncommon excellence of my entertainment has entirely spoiled my stomach and i have lost all relish to eating merely from recollecting what a considerable sum a goodnatured young fellow must have idly thrown away through a desire of manifesting an extraordinary respect for his company  the publication of this little stricture will i hope in some measure remove so great an absurdity people of good sense want little more than a bare mention of their errors to produce an amendment and by the reformation which i may hear occasioned by the present hint i shall immediately judge the understanding of my readers  numb lxi saturday april   in the course of my little strictures i have frequently endeavored to discountenance the scandalous propensity which i have observed in a number of old fellows for an obscenity of conversation a propensity which even in the thoughtless and giddyheaded state of youth is extremely culpable and no lss disgraces the politeness of the gentleman than lessens the understanding of the man in the present paper i shall lay a picture before my readers which though really drawn for a particular person will i fear prove much too general a resemblance but which if it should fortunately prove a means of reforming a single individual will make me think my time very well bestowed and induce me perhaps to take up the subject again at another opportunity  last night having received a most pressing invitation from an old relation of mine i went and supped at his house the company consisted of his lady his son and his two daughters a very eminent clergymen in the city and myself my friend is one of those people who having formerly cut a very gay figure in the world is still ambitious of spreading the maybloom of twentyfive upon the winter of threescore and desirous of displaying in the fullness of his spirits that sprightliness and vivacity which time has relentlessly taken from his person with this view he is everlastingly aiming at double entendres and will not even hesitate to crack his indelicate ambiguities upon his children on the contrary he often attacks his daughters with a vein of the most culpable levity and tells them when the poor young ladies are ready to sink with shame and mortification that they know very well what he means and that he is perfectly sensible they are both languishing for husbands  as my old friend suffers me to take more liberties with him than he can bear from any body else i always endeavor to keep him in a little order and this renders my visits uncommonly welcome to his family last night i managed him pretty well and we had not above ten or a dozen indelicacies during supper time but the cloth was no sooner removed than he cried come mr babbler i will give you a toast this was what the ladies extremely apprehended and they all instantly rose up from table with an abruptness that would have astonished a stranger prodigiously and darted out of the room upon this he burst into a loud laugh and slapping me on the shoulder with an air of extraordinary satisfaction exclaimed well my boy you see i am still old truepenny and though to the full as heavily laden with years as yourself have fifty times your spirits and can set the women a going whenever i think proper then turning round to the clergyman and pointing to his son he asked with an arch significance of countenance do you think doctor that fellow will be a quarter the man i am when he comes to my age  hey  what say you petticoats the gentleman replied he believed not and my friend ordered us to fill a bumper directly for he still piques himself upon being able to drink a couple of bottles of an evening  when our glasses were charged now says he i will give you a toast he did so with a witness and totally forgetting the presence of his son the profession of the clergyman and the sobriety of my character gave what would scarcely have issued from the underbred intoxication of an irish chairman in a night cellar for my own part i turned round in disgust the clergyman wiped his face and the son stooped to buckle his shoe in order to avoid the disagreeable necessity of blushing for his father whose behavior was no less illtimed than it was illiberal i was in hopes the visible dissatisfaction which we all manifested on this occasion would have kept my antiquated buck in a little order for the remainder of the evening but here sir i was miserably mistaken every glass brought on a new instance of obscenity and produced a fresh question whether he was not the heartiest cock of his years in the universe the lowest amors of his youthful days were raked up with the most paltry degree of ostentation and he seemed to gain a new share of life from the mere repetition of those circumstances which should have made him sorry that he ever lived at all  youth is but a poor excuse for a mans playing the fool but no palliation can possibly be offered where a gray head is striving to reexist in the remembrance of former vices and is ambitious of preserving the same reputation for extravagancies in the deepening vale of years which rendered him contemptible to the thinking part of the world when a boy of nineteen if a man is really desirous of being respected in the decline of life he must act in such a manner as to deserve the universal esteem of his acquaintance instead of deviating into ribaldry he must make an absolute display of his good sense and build his applause upon the rectitude of his own sentiments instead of applying to the depravity of ours a debauchee of sixty is no less a scandal to nature than a disgrace to morality and we cannot help feeling a secret kind of horror when we see a father profligately jesting with his children and taking every opportunity to steel them against the nicer sensations of delicacy and virtue the parent who acts in this manner has not only his own errors to answer for but in a great measure the crimes of his posterity the human mind has a natural promptitude to err and we are all of us but too fond of copying the examples of those whom we have been taught to reverence and love for the sake of the rising generation therefore let me earnestly exhort the old hearty cocks of the present age to pay some little regard to this reflection since the reputation and welfare of their families ought to engage a considerable share of their attention however indifferent they may be about their own  numb lxii saturday april   notwithstanding a number of writers have very judiciously employed their pens in exposing the ridiculous partiality which the generality of parents feel in favor of their own children yet there is one species of this partiality which though the most fatal in it is effects has however engaged but the smallest part of their notice for which reason i propose to make it the subject of my present discussion and flatter myself that it will be received on account of it is importance with a particular share of indulgence by the public  the prejudice upon which i intend to animadvert is the opinion absurdly entertained by every body that the beauty of their daughters will be always certain of making their fortunes this unhappy prepossession is now so universally adopted that few parents attend to more than the mere superficials of a young ladys education a mother nowadays instead of inculcating lessons of prudence and morality is only solicitous about the personal accomplishments of her rising angel instead of teaching her to be humble modest and unaffected she lays down no rules but those of pride no precepts but those of arrogance and no documents but those of affectation before miss is out of her hanging sleeves she is accustomed to the most extravagant praises of her own beauty and is instructed in a belief that so the delicacy of her complexion is attended to there is no necessity whatsoever to pay the least regard to the cultivation of her mind hence she can argue upon the excellence of naples dew before she knows a single commandment in the decalogue and descant upon the smartness of a ribband before she is acquainted with a letter in the alphabet  the natural consequence of such an education is that she becomes intollerably vain and in supportably ignorant the first of these amiable qualifications her vanity renders her totally blind to every merit in the character of another person and the latter renders her as totally insensible of the grossest absurdity in her own calculated merely for show her only study is to attract a crowd of fools to the standard of her beauty and taught that a woman with so exquisite a face has a just pretension to the first offers in the kingdom she is continually aspiring above the level of her circumstances by this means she most commonly withers in contempt upon the stalk of an antiquated virginity or sacrifices her reputation to some debauchee of fashion whom she vainly imagines to draw in for a husband it is below a beauty ever to think of marrying with a man of her own rank her charms are to procure something infinitely superior and there is scarcely a tradesmans daughter with a passable face in the weekly bills but what now and then thinks of an equipage with a tolerable degree of confidence and imagines herself pretty certain at least of a gentleman or a knight though she should even fail of gaining a helpmate with a coronet  the strangest thing however in this unaccountable notion with which people are deluded of a daughters making a fortune with her face is that every one supposes the world will look through the magnifying glass of parental prepossession and conceive just such an opinion of the girls personal attractions as they are silly enough to entertain themselves without ever recollecting that others have no natural interest in the young lady either to be blind to her defects or sensible of her perfections they are astonished that we should differ from their idea of her merit and absolutely demand that tribute of admiration from our justice which is nothing but the ridiculous result of their own partiality  how often i appeal to my readers have they heard a mother extolling the face of some halfbegotten thing to the skies as a miracle of excellence and in the fullness of her heart exclaiming my beauty my queen and my angel where the poor little wretch had actually the features of a jacknapes for my own part i have seen such things a thousand times and among my own relations too my cousin suke has a little girl of about ten years old who is blind of an eye and seamed with the small pox like a savoycabbage yet suke imagines that her daughter will one time or other make a conquest of a nobleman and has been known to praise the ineffable sweetness of her pattys face though the company were at that very moment talking about lady sarah bunbury or the duchess of hamilton  were parents however to act with prudence they might easily judge from what they themselves think of other peoples children how other people are affected at the sight of theirs this single mode of judging would in a moment unbind the charm which fascinates the heart of so many fathers and mothers and convince them that there were a number of requisites necessary to form a complete woman besides the possession of a smooth face and an agreeable person they would then see that a wellcultivated mind had an infinite superiority over the most rosy cheek in the universe and discover that something more than a bare knowledge in fixing a headdress or pinning a handkerchief was indispensibly proper for the mistress of a family  in fact the men are not such fools as they may be generally imagined a young fellow if he wants to make an occasional connection with a lady scarcely ever looks for more than figure or make by the same rule that he buys a horse he chooses his mistress but the case is widely different when he comes to think of a wise however he may laugh at prudence and discretion in himself he always requires it in her and thinks he is infinitely more liable to suffer in the public opinion through the minutest foible of here is than through the greatest error of his own for this reason the wildest libertine when he thinks of marrying generally looks out for a woman of virtue and understanding experience has taught him how small a share the mere attractions of a fine face have in the formation of real happiness and if he even chooses a person that wants a fortune yet his choice is most commonly a person that can save one hence matrimony is the only thing in which he seldom suffers himself to be duped and he hardly ever dreams of asking the hand of a mere beauty while there is a possibility for him to gain a woman of real beauty and merit too  numb lxiii saturday april    to the babbler sir the strictures in your last paper on the ridiculous propensity which the generality of people have to suppose the beauty of their daughters will at any time be sufficient to make their fortunes are so very much in point that i cannot resist a desire of troubling you with my little story especially as it may perhaps be a means of preventing some other parents from following the unhappy example of my poor father and mother whose illjudged tenderness in this respect was the original source of all my misfortunes  my father you must know mr babbler was the youngest son of a good family but had however no other dependence than an employment under the government which brought him in about five hundred pounds a year as he was naturally of a generous disposition he never thought of mending his circumstances by marrying a woman with money though he had a person and an address which rendered it no way difficult for him to succeed with the ladies on the contrary sir he followed the implicit direction of his inclinations and before he was five and twenty married my mother the daughter of a gloucestershire baronet whose whole fortune consisted of a long line of ancestors a high notion of gentility and a very agreeable face  with a disposition on both sides to make every thing wear the most elegant appearance it is not to be wondered at if on either there were no extraordinary notions of economy i was born in about a twelvemonth after their union and i have heard my mother say the bare preparations for her lying in amounted to near a hundred and fifty pounds being the only product of their affections i was treated as if i was something more than mortal in my earliest infancy i was discovered to have some irresistible attractions my mother before my eyes were well open declared them a pair of the tight killing kind and if i happened but to cry for a little bread and milk my father found out in every squall some indications of a wonderful sagacity in short i was looked upon as an absolute olio or salmongundy of perfections to use the words of a fashionable author and was almost in danger of being devoured through the insatiable fondness as i may call it of my poor father and mother  when i grew toward seven or eight and had passed the ordeal of a fiery smallpox with pretty good success i was pronounced a perfect beauty and my friends all concluded that it was impossible but what such a woman as i promised to turn out must make her fortune by her personal attractions infatuated by this unaccountable prepossession my mothers sole attention was confined to those accomplishments which were rather engaging than necessary and rendered a woman superficially agreeable without being of any intrinsic use thus sir when other girls of my age were advancing pretty fast in the progress of french italian and english authors i was studying how to play at quadrille or exercising the whole army of my little graces before the looking glass instead of growing a mistress at my needle and assisting to make up the linen of the family i was instructed to laugh at industry and told that poring on a piece of work would inevitably injure my eyes or endanger my constitution going to church they as good as told me was extremely vulgar and it was hinted that i should show my spirit by taking care to rate the servants very soundly whenever they grew either familiar or impertinent in short sir in this hopeful manner i reached my sixteenth year and knew nothing in nature but how to make a cap play a game at cards turn out my toes a little tollerably and play a lesson or two on the harpsichord  as i was now bordering on the age when my mother expected my person would work miracles she took uncommon pains to tell me that those who were my equals only were infinitely beneath me and that none but those who were considerably my superiors could possibly be as good as myself  vanity and indiscretion the characteristics of my years were open to every document of this nature and i looked upon it as a derogation from my consequence to be seen in less than honorable company for this purpose i even condescended to be treated with indifference put up with an insult from the daughter of a man of fashion for the sake of numbering her amongst my acquaintance and permitted some familiarities not criminal however from her brother to purchase the honor of his attending on me in public  the consequence of this behavior was however fatal  before i was eighteen i refused two or three very considerable offers from people of my own rank and before i was nineteen fell a victim to the illiberal machinations of a villain with an earldom who visited on my account at my fathers and flattered him with a notion of spedily becoming my husband  not to dwell upon this unhappy circumstance suffice it that shame and disappointment quickly broke the heart of my poor father who died lamenting with his last breath his error in my education and was followed by his miserable relict in less than six weeks with my father died all my hopes of subsistence and what i should have done for bread god only knows had not a most excellent lady who was compelled into a marriage with my betrayer a little after i was undone by him purchased me out of her pinmoney an annuity of a hundred pounds for my life and generously sent it me in a manner that doubled the obligation upon this i have resided near ten years in a remote part of the country endeavoring by a close application to the best authors to unlearn the principal part of what i was formerly taught and to atone by an exemplary conduct during the remainder of my days for the indiscretions of my past behavior may my story prove a means of preventing the ruin of other young women and teach such parents as mine that the only way of raising a real happiness for their children is to lay the foundation on discretion and virtue  i am sir your humble servant theodora  numb lxiv saturday april    to the babbler sir there is a species of illbreeding which i have observed to be extremely prevalent among several of our modern pretenders to politeness and which as it gives much uneasiness to a number of wellmeaning people i have taken the liberty of condemning in the following little narrative and shall therefore esteem it as a singular obligation if you will lay it before the public through the channel of your excellent paper  you must know mr babbler that i live in a tollerably genteel street not far from lincolns end and have made it my principal study during the whole time of my residence to give no offense whatsoever to any person in the neighborhood unhappily however sir there is an antiquated gentleman who lives almost opposite to me and who has a family consisting of a wife every whit as venerable as himself two daughters to whom nature has been uncommonly parsimonious in the distribution of her personal graces and a servant maid as this amiable little community pique themselves prodigiously on the regularity of their own conduct they are continually upon the watch to pry into the behavior of every body else hence sir if a gentleman knocks at my door about business some one of them continually runs to the window to see who it is and comments in a tone lould enough to be distinctly heard across the way either upon his dress or his person if i have company with me in the parlour some of them stand sentinel on me at the dining room and if i take my guests into the dining room they mount to the second floor where they have a full command of all my motions and reduce me to the disagreeable alternative of bearing the whole torrent of their impertinent observations or of letting down my curtains  to be sure sir i am not the only object of this obliging solicitude as far as they can possibly see they manifest a laudable anxiety for the conduct of their neighbors and being fortunately situated in a house pretty remarkable for the convenience of it is prospect they strike a kind of awe through a number of families considerably better than themselves and are almost as good as our reforming class of constables to enforce the minutest propriety of behavior  did their impertinence however extend no farther it might perhaps be borne with some degree of temper and they might possibly be considered as objects of our pity without ever exciting our resentment but alas mr babbler the buckling of a shoe or the wearing of a clean shirt sets them into a tittering and a little more powder in ones wig than ordinary occasions a horse laugh my wife sir being as goodnatured and placid a girl as ever existed this disposition gives them so great an advantage over her that she can never look out of her own window and is always in the greatest distress if the servant keeps her a moment at the door if she puts on but a fresh gown to visit a friend she hears lord we are dressed to day breaking from the opposite side of the street and if she sends home but an humble leg of mutton from market there is a pon my word we are resolved to live well however let who will pay for it  nay sir my little girl an infant under two years of age come in for her share of this delicate treatment and her mother having a day or two ago bought her a new bonnet the child has ever since undergone the severest exertion of their wit and god love you look at miss is the continual expression whenever the maid appears with her at the door or takes her out into lincolns end gardens for a little air and exercise in short sir not an article in our dress nor a feature in our faces escapes the eagleeyed notice of our worthy neighbors and there is scarce a possibility of conceiving how very unhappy we have been rendered by this excess of curiosity and impertinence  were these good people themselves either distinguished for any uncommon elegance of appearance or amiableness of person this behavior would be the less extraordinary  but sir sunday is perhaps the only day in the week on which they change their linen and i have already hinted that there is no extraordinary share of beauty in the family as for the father he is an absolute oran otan a mere man of the woods the old gentlewoman is the immediate idea of that venerable lady to whom saul paid a midnight visit at endor and the eldest daughter to an unmeaningness of face that actually borders upon lunacy joins a couple of tushes that project a surprising way from the mouth like the forks of an elephant the youngest to borrow an expression from the copper captain has a husk about her like a chestnut which so completely absorbs every vestige of humanity that i am almost at a loss in what order of beings to rank her and therefore though her sex has perhaps been already ascertained i shall put her species down in the doubtful gender  there is nothing mr babbler which betrays an understanding so weak or a heart so malevolent as an inclination to render others undeservedly uneasy the people of every little neighborhood like the members of the largest communities should always endeavor to engage one anothers esteem by a mutual intercourse of good at least of obliging offices true politeness however this unfashionable sense of the word may be exploded consists in exerting our utmost abilities to promote the satisfaction of our neighbors a contrary disposition though it may be reckoned extremely witty by some can be considered in that light by none but the ignorant or the worthless whoever thinks the approbation of such an essential to their happiness has my full permission to solicit it but i will readily affirm that every sensible and benevolent mind will hold them in detestation or contempt and look upon them as an equal disgrace and nuisance to society what a pity is it sir that like other nuisances there is no method of presenting them by a grand jury as there is not suffer me to present them in this manner and be assured you will have the thanks of many families in my part of the town besides those of your most humble servants  censor  numb lxv saturday april  0 to know mankind and to profit by their follies is generally the wish of the mercenary but there are some who think that exposing their own follies to the public view is the truest means of acquiring an insight into those of others this method of a mans subjecting himself to voluntary distress in order to become acquainted with human nature goes by the name of seeing life so that as the phrase goes the young fellow is now said to have seen most of life who has experienced most misery  i have often with pity regarded some of my more youthful acquaintance who took this experimental way of becoming philosophers and who thought proper to buy all the little wit they had by their sufferings and yet in fact when we come to examine this ascetic sect of students we shall find them utterly ignorant of real life and skilled only in the ceremonies of a night cellar or the etiquette of a brothel  it is amusing enough to listen to one of these gentlemen who has the character of being profoundly versed in life exerting his superiority of skill in company he has a new phrase for every thing tip us a wag of your manus is for instance shake hands let us have a buss at your muns is let me kiss you for such humor as this our unfortunate creature has had his head broken his pockets picked and his constitution destroyed though fully convinced of his errors the very moment he was running into them with the greatest avidity  it has been often said that half the pains which some men take to be rouges could very comfortably have supported them in honesty with equal truth it may be said that half the labors which these men use in the pursuit of pleasure could have supplied them with a double portion of the means pleasure is not so coy a mistress as these men would persuade us that she is she needs not be pursued through the mazes of a night adventure nor earned by the hazard of loosing a nose the usual beaten tract to happiness is ever the surest and to live like the rest of mankind is a strong presumption that the traveller is in the right way when one of our blooded young fellows with a true eccentricity of thinking separates from the crowd in order to enjoy higher delights than his acquaintance he only becomes the object of contempt and derision and like a deer in the forest he ever finds least safety when alone  the ridicule of every age has been levelled against this absurd pursuer of life and still like the witch in the fable as he has been hunted down in one shape he has assumed another in the spectators days the buck of the time was called a mohock he afterward received the appellation of a blood and at present he is called a buck the three characters of the different times however are very nearly the same they differ in little more than appellation and are all equally distinguished for malevolent of heart and weakness of understanding  the most extraordinary circumstance in the characters of these worthy gentlemen who know so much of life is that scarcely one in a thousand of them knows any thing of life at all or at best like a maggot in a cheese he only eats into the rotten part of it and after fattening for a season on the common of folly and licentiousness he comes out pampered with nothing but ignorance and immorality  let one of the most experienced philosophers in the system of modern life come for half an hour into company with two or three rational beings and he looks as if he was absolutely of a different species  conversant with nothing but what he ought not to know he is incapable of conducting himself either like a man of sense or a gentleman and acquainted only with the despicable frolicks of the garden he is at a visible loss if a subject of the least erudition is started and perplexed if he hears a syllable bordering upon politeness or good breeding he languishes only for an indelicate toast or an opportunity of introducing some paltry little adventure which ought to be reserved for a set of intoxicated apprentices on a christmas holiday even in the presence of the most modest among the softer sex he does not hesitate to mention the name of some fashionate demirep nor scruple to boast of a newgate acquaintance with an executed highwayman  yet notwithstanding this description of a modern buck is pretty exact there is an unaccountable ambition among the greatest number of our young fellows to show a tolerable pretension to the character from a strange opinion that libertinism is a proof of good sense they all sacrifice the little sense which they possess to become libertines and are infinitely less fearful of being looked upon as profligates than being ridiculed as fools  those however who would willingly arrive at the good opinion of the world and merit the secret approbation of their own hearts must act upon a very opposite principle little as the world may follow the documents of virtue it nevertheless admires them and we ourselves are never more ready to venerate a man of principle than when on account of our vices he treats us with contempt let us therefore instead of being what in our hearts we really detest endeavor to arrive at what we are ambitious to be thought and make that very pride which hurries us into such a number of excesses a laudable incentive to the road of perfection  virtue in fact wants only to be known to have a number of admirers and as in the pursuit of those vices which destroy both our temporal and our eternal felicity habit increases our relish for persevering so in the practice of all that can ensure our happiness here and hereafter habit also impels us to proceed and furnishes continual inducements which gradually lead us to the most exalted pinnacle of human excellence the man therefore who will not be happy has nobody to censure but himself as the power is entirely in his hands if he chooses but to exert it  end of the first volume
