mhamet the turkish spy   a continvation of letters written by a turkish spy at paris giving an impartial account to the divan at constantinople of the most remarkable transactions of europe and discovering several intrigues and secrets of the christian courts especially of that of france continued from the year      to the year       written originally in arabic translated into italian and from thence into english  london printed for w tailor at the sign of the ship in paternoster row       the preface it was not so much the success of the former volumes of these letters that has promoted their continuance but the excellence of the subject the beauty of the manner and the delightful variety they present us with convinced me that it was impossible but they should please  if it were possible to give the reader in the translation the same ideas he would conceive were he to read the original could i translate or indeed could our language express the story with the same vivacity the fame spirit and the same energy of words as the old exquisitely qualified arabian delivered it how much superior would it be to what it now appears with what pleasure with what raptures and extafies must it be received  but it is not to be done i may translate the words and i have some hopes the reader will suggest that i have done my duty but to render the sublime flights of the incomparable mohmut his bright ideas his surprising turns of wit and flights of fancy i say to render these exactly in our language is as difficult as it is for a painter to represent the passions or a carver to make his figures speak  it is observed by the curious that the most difficult thing in the limners art is to represent a person singing suppose it be the picture of a young lady the utmost he can do is to show her countenance bright the company listening and appearing pleased but alas toward the sound toward the charm of her voice and the beauty of her judgment he can do no more than paint her with her mouth open which is the meanest posture she can with decency be shown in and unless the other passions discover it she may as well be supposed to be swearing scolding sick or any thing else as well at singing  we can no more represent the eloquence the spirit the sprightly turns and the happy genius of our accomplished inimitable arabian by the most labored and studied translation into english than a limner can paint the voice and give the music of the song in the gestures of the lady  but when i have acknowledged this the reader i hope will not find that all the care has been taken to make old mahmut speak english i say all the care that consists with one very sollicitous to please and oblige as well as to divert and instruct  above all i have followed that sure rule in our tongue and which were it observed would i believe be acknowledged to be the best rule in all tongues viz to make the language plain artless and honest suitable to the story and in a style easy and free with as few exotic phrases and obsolete words as possible that the meanest reader may meet with no difficulty in the reading and may have no obstruction to his searching the history of things by their being obscurely represented  it was objected i know to the former volumes of this work that the turk was brought in too much debasing the christian religion extolling mahomet and speaking disrespectfully of jesus christ calling him the nazaren and the son of mary and it is certain the continuation must fall into the same method but either mahmut must be a turk or no turk either he must speak his own language or other peoples language and how must we represent words spoken by him in the first person of invincible mahmut the arabian if we must not give his own language and how can this work be a translation if we must not translate the very style of the original  let those who think they have cause for any observations of this nature observe that all care possible is taken to represent such passages in terms that may give no offense and with this caution to the reader that when he reads those parts he is desired to take them as the words of the arabian not the words of the translator and if any thing may be said to be left out of the original it can only be such places where mahmut may have taken more liberties than might be proper for the repetition of christian readers  on the other hand it will be observed in defense of the translation and of the good intention of the translator that as honest mahmut upon many occasions speaks very honorably and even reverently of our savior and particularly of the perfect laws and rules of faith and doctrine and speaks with detestation of the apostasy of his followers and of the unworthy behavior of those who profess to be his disciples and worshippers so the translator has not failed to take all occasions to do justice to the original in all those cases in particular  it is true the translator has some letters on these subjects which he has not thought fit to make public because of the nice palates of a censorious age who will take all advantages to insult the publication of such a style while yet they concern not themselves to hear the deity of our blessed lord insulted every day in public by those who call themselves believers and even the being of a god denied by a much worse infidelity than that of a mohammedan  it is an observation not unworthy the remark of our arabian and may be very useful to those that read him viz that the practical atheism so rife in the world in this age is a sin engrossed among christians that the mahometans know nothing of it and that it is not heard of among the mussulmans that any man should arrive to that degree of hardness in crime as to deny the being of a god whose glory the light of nature so evidently reveals  these letters are not only a record of history through the years they refer to and that not only respecting france but all the parts of the christian world but they are fruitful of improving observations on many subjects as well religious as moral  it is true our arabian grows ancient and we find him casting his thoughts upon the pleasures of their mohammedan futurity but as christians should when they grow nearer a future state have their minds tinged with the glories they expect so we find his understanding so far from a decay by his years that he speaks of religious things with so much the more relish and taste as if he reallizd on earth the heaven he expected  he must have very few thoughts about him who cannot see that the older our author grows the more profitable and instructing his writings will be and yet we do not find his fancy so confined but that he ranges through all the regions of science speaks of the politics of state and progress of armies with as true deductions and as clear a judgment as ever  if our correspondent at vienna to whom mahmut committed his papers and to whom they were faithfully delivered by his successor does not deceive us we may expect a yet greater variety toward the conclusion of his residence than has yet seen the light and perhaps some remains of things omitted in the time of former publication which as they come to hand shall be communicated with the greatest exactness whether they may exactly correspond with the chronology of former publications or no and though there may seem a little confusion in such a retrospect yet i doubt not the beauty of the subject shall make full amends for any disorder in the dates  this has been the reason why even in this volume some letters especially of speculative subjects may come a little out of the order of time which i think is a thing of so trifling a nature compared to the advantage of their publication that it needs not the least apology for it  a table of the letters and matters contained in this volume vol i book i letter i mahmut an arabian at paris to musa

and approved my letters to cicala bassa beglerbeg of romania and command me to write also to thy self approving as thou say my way of informing my friends of the state of things in this country it solaces my soul in the midst of my languishing distemper of which i informed the chaimacam my late friend and in which i had felt so much pain i say it solaces my soul to find my performances approved by him to whom i owe my commission and the being remembered after having been forty and eight years as one buried alive among infidels and strangers  but in particular it gives youth to my spirits and fires my soul with an inconceivable joy that thou give me the promise of sending me a successor in this nice employment thereby giving me hopes of being recalled that i may once more see my native country in which lie the bones of my father and brethren and where i shall be able to die as my soul desires even at the gates of the thrice happy and blessed mecca where lie the remains of our most holy prophet ever miraculous and performing deeds of astonishment to the eyes of all those who are allowed to look three foot above the ground on which they stand  i conjure thee happy saban now thou art exalted to the high post of a public minister i say i conjure thee by the hoary beard of thy father and grandfather by the faith of a mussulman and true believer by the fire that descended and drank up the river arath that our prophet might go over by the moon and thirteen stars which gave him light through the desert of lybia by the blood of ten thousand jews and infidel christians sacrificed at his interment and by the tomb of mahomet and all the emirs and pilgrims there attending with incessant devotion that thou forget not thy banished mahmut grown old in the service of the illustrious king of emperors and lord of nations and wearing past the capacity of performing the offices required of me forget me not i say righteous musa but procure my release that i may not die among dogs and be blended in earth with infidels and enemies of mahomet  it is time sage counselor of the wise it is time and justice requires that a faithful servant continued    years in the exile of a secret employ and having with the utmost fidelity discharged my self even to the satisfaction or confusion of those who envied me this trust should at last have liberty to come home and die in the arms of my friends and be deposited in the dust with the faithful  the troubles of life can have no great reward than to end in peace it is the great victory over the vicissitudes of this world the great triumph that wise and good men hope for to lie down in the grave and be gathered to the invi sible mansions in a state of tranquillity and at the door of the blessed wherefore do millions travel in pilgrimage to mecca and desire to have the felicity to die there but because they believe they shall from thence be immediately transported into paradise in the view of our great and sublime mahomet and what need have i of that difficulty who am a native of arabia justly styled the happy doubly so viz by the clime and by the sacred treasure reposed there i say who am a native of arabia and who in returning to my own country shall be happily situated even in sight of the miraculous monument of our prophet where i desire to end my days in a manner suitable to one whose life has been devoted to the interest and honor of my country  take it then into thy power exalted musa and think thy self fortunate that thou art able to make one happy man and to have one ancient friend always blessing thy charity and sending up incessant prayers for thy health and be not doubtful of finding a successor equally quallified for this employment however nice and if thou will have the goodness to send the person hither to me i will continue with him till i have shown him the way of conversing with mankind in this place so as to make this jealous nation easy in his society open to his enquiries and not suspicious of his employment  do this generous saban with a friendship suitable to that thou bear for me in former years when thou and i were equals and camrades in the odas of the tekeh at trapezond and let not fate which has exalted thee above thy friend cause thee to forget that as thou art already full of years as i also am so it is not many days but we shall be levelled in the dust and be equal again till we meet in the garden and rejoice in the royal palace of eden where not the highest in human glory but the most perfect in virtue shall be received with the greatest splendour into the regions of eternal delight  paris  th of the  st moon in the year      letter ii to hassan ebio mirza zebir great muffty or high priest of mahomet illustrious reverend resplendent image of the blessed lawgiver i kiss the dust of thy sacred feet in reverence of that pure and unspotted holiness that shines in thy person and which is truly hereditary to the chair of thy office i cannot sit here surrounded with the pageantry of devotion and see the ridiculous mimicking of these infidels in what they call religion without some heavenly meditations which i offer at thy feet in honor of the more pure institutions of our great prophet  these christians here finding the harsh and uncouth model of their religion consisting much in celibacies restraint of liberty monastic severities etc which they had drawn their people into the practice of instead of religion would not go down with the people or relish well with those who they knew even from the barrenness of the principle they went upon could have no true taste of it as religious i say these christians in order to make amends for their other fopperies are fain to bring as much mirth as they can into their worship that the common people may have something in religion to tickle and please them that so if they cannot hold them by the sublime they may by the sensitive part of their worship as the enthusiasms of certain heretics which i remember in arabia which were animated by fumes and smoke of herbs of an intoxicating quality used on purpose by their dervices to keep up the delusions of their principles  there is no talking with these men upon these points for should i but ask one of them to be ingenuous and confess on what occasion they introduced so many antic gestures such variety of pictures such adorations and above all such variety of musical instruments into their mosques or churches and ask whether it was not by the mechanism of those addenda to possess the minds and move the passions and affections of their proselytes they would presently start at me and cry our i was a heretic and if i lived in some other parts of the country i should be certainly sent to the inquisition this is a devilish ecclesiastic judicature where they pass sentence upon those who they think are in the least apt to prye too much into the sacred impostures of their religion  certainly venerable patriarch of the pure and faithful musselmans these nazareens are the most detestable of all pretenders to religion in the world for at the same time that they call themselves the disciples of their prophet jesus they have brought into their forms of worship so many innovations and traditional corruptions which himself never directed that their religion has now very little of the first institution in it  it is without question true that this jesus who they are denominated from was a very holy person endued with heavenly wisdom that he wrought innumerable miracles and left them pure doctrines in writings taken from his mouth and dictated to his followers and though we do not allow him to be any ways like to our most divine mahomet yet the alchoran of this their prophet jesus contains innumerable and excellent precepts which his disciples for some ages followed with great exactness and suffered inexpressible torments from the roman emperors and government in the defense of but their successors degenerating from the purity and the rectitude of principle which their said ancestors retained have corrupted their religion to that degree that it is now one of the greatest pieces of confusion and buffoonry on earth  it would have filled thee with indignation venerable and holy mirza had thou been here the other day when these nazareens were paying their public thanks to their prophet jesus who thou know they pretend to say is even equal with god i went once into one of their idolatrous temples or mosques to see the pageantry of their worship which curiosity led me to observe very particularly because it was upon an occasion of rejoicing or thanksgiving as they call it for taking of philipsburg a city of the emperor on the rhine when i was not only astonished at the ridiculous folly of such a polite nation as this is but even provoked with a holy rage and i cursed them by mahomet three times reserving serving it farther to thee to confirm the anathemas which they have reason to expect and fall under  verily it is scarce to be imagined how they can pretend if they did believe the ineffable glory of the creator of heaven and earth and that their sacrifices were offered to him that he would be captivated by the noise of fiddles and bagpipes the shooting of great ordnance the beating of kettledrums and the clamor of trumpets but thus it was for their great rhapsody of praise which they call te deum is thus managed behold just before they began their song in the mosque  0 pieces of canon were fired without as if they intended to awaken their prophet with the noise immediately after this and just before the door of the great mosque i was surpised with the confusion of    kettledrums five sets of trumpets placed at proper distances and  0 drummers of the kings guards of foot which for a quarter of an hour complimented their god with tabor and pipe  as soon as this was over an anthem so they call their idolatrous song which they sing on these occasions began within the mosque sung by the voices of eunuchs boys and women taught for those wicked purposes their voices were indeed excellent and had they been employed on occasions of mirth and delight not for the debauching the mind with corrupt ideas in religion the harmony of them was admirably fine these singers are placed in stalls for that purpose in several gradations as their voices rise then followed the te deum which was sung with the like voices but mixed with innumerable sorts of instruments of music such as fiddles baseviols hautboys fifes cymballs timbrels harps organs etc and continued about half an hour and then went off as it all begun with drums trumpets kettledrums and  0 pieces of canon from without  tell me sage prophet who guides the consciences of the faithful in paying their pure and unmixed devotions to one undivided eternal being the great alla and directs them with simple and humble devotion to send up prayers five times a day to his ineffable throne tell me what coherence can this have with the sacred thing called religion or with the nature of adoration and giving praise which ought to be performed by humble creatures to the creator of heaven and earth to whom they should rather appear as penitent offenders with mortifications and sacrifices of sorrowful hearts trembling even in their thanksgiving than with a noise of music and voices of triumph as if they were inviting their great prophet to a festival or masquerade  i think often when i reflect on these infidels that they must certainly have very gross conceptions of god and may well be said to think of him after the manner of men that is that he acts after the manner of men it is not possible that they can reverence his divine being in that awful and humble manner as the true believers who washing their bodies from outward defilement conceive of god with perfect ideas covering their eyes and retreating with heavenly solitude into the inmost soul to contemplate the being who is the sum and substance of inconceivable glory  the most which i meet with of defense for the barbarism of this custom is drawn by their cunning dervices from the practice of the jews which they say was given them by their ancient lawgiver moses but this were it just in it self is most absurd in these nazareens because as they themselves pretend to be followers of their prophet jesus who they say is the messiah which moses himself foretold them was to come and to put an end to all his institutions also they do declare that this jesus has fulfilled all mosess law and abolished all those things which belonged to that ceremonious worship setting up a more sure word of prophecy or directions for worship and also that in all this their said prophets directions which he left behind him there is not the least precept example or direction for such monstrous things as drums trumpets etc in religious worship but that on the contrary he scourged all pageantry which they had set up out of their great mosque or temple which was at jerusalem declaring that from that time the mosques where god would be worshipped should be houses of prayer only  i say notwithstanding all this these designing dervices and their pontifical muffti at rome have introduced these incoherent innovations and set their people on work to mock the immoral god of nature in such a manner as i have given thee an account of  with how much purer devotion do the faithful mussulmen prostrate their souls in the humblest manner saying prayers of a sublime nature to that one great alla the god of the gods of all nations where the religious servants of our holy prophers perform the mysteries of religion by thy sublime directions inspired with these i am present by the power of imagination every day and please my soul in this my state of absence with fancying that i see thy venerable person performing divine offices among the faithful who prostrate at thy feet reverence with thee god and his great prophet mahomet  wonder not heavenly saint if i am sometimes transported with these ideas to a degree that may seem enthusiastic be assured my dejections bear a proportion after the fire of my imagination is abated and especially when i find my self embarrasd with infidels and doomed here to business and repentance  i kiss thy feet with the most profound veneration of an humble slave paris the  th of the  0th moon in the year of the nazareens      letter iii to cicala bassa beglerbeg of romania i direct these letters to thee by the command of the late hali bassa chaimacam now in paradise whose blessing be upon us  as thou art by thy title lord of lords and by thy office the first and greatest beglerbeg of the whole mussulman empire the right hand of the invincible achmet our mighty emperor and art entrusted by his command with the most eminent affairs of his government during the absence of the vizier azem now on his prosperous expedition to the east  i know that thy martial genius as well as thy great office presiding over all the ottoman dominions in europe enclines thee to receive willingly an account of the great transactions in the nazareen world so i may call this part wherein i sojourn for the good of thy great master and the service of the whole ottoman power  thou art not ignorant wise and valiant cicala of the great overthrow of the mighty emperor of the islands called here slightly the king of england for know this haughty court gives slight and mean titles to all their neighboring princes for this king of england is indeed a most powerful prince and his empire though not large in extent yet in power and strength is exceeding great principally founded in the prodigious wealth and the immense riches of his country and people he also possesses besides the great islands of britain and ireland i say he possesses infinite tracts of land islands and colonies in the remotest parts of the world  hali bassa the late happy chaimacam of constantinople thy friend and mine commanded me to write to him the history of the fall of the king of that country called england which i did at large with the character of his person for we now see him here taking sanctuary in the court of the king of france who is his great friend and protector but in answer to this our friend haly sent me his commands to inform him how it came to pass that the king of france or of the franks in whose country i reside who thou know is taken with us for the greatest king among the nations of the messiah should at the same time that he professed so sincere friendship for the english king suffer that so mean and so weak a person as the prince of orange and who had no assistance but that of the elutch to support him should invade and attack his friend and allie the king of england when he knew at the same time that the subjects of the said english king were malcontents and inclined to revolt and my answer to these things he has wisely commanded me to send to thee knowing it seems or believing by inspiration that the predestined time of his translation unto bliss was approaching  know then illustrious and valiant leader of the faithful host that true it is that the present king of france is the greatest of all the kings of the christian nations abounding in wealth and immense treasures surrounded with numerous and victorious armies and it is no more to be questioned but that he is and also then was a sincere friend to the english king and would very willingly have prevented the mischief which has since befallen him nay had he not been his friend yet prudence and policy of state required that he would by no means have suffered the said english king to have been so invaded seeing he knew perfectly well that the prince of orange was not only a warlike prince in himself but was also a professed enemy to the greatness and ambition of france  it is also true that this king of france is now and was at that time in the very meridian of his glory clothed with innumerable triumphs and trophies of victory which are the envy and grief of all the nations about him and that all those nations would rejoice to see the said prince of orange strengthened by the addition of the english power that they might join in confederacy with him to bridle the the exorbitance of the french greatness which begins to be terrible to europe  yet most true it is that nothing but the infatuation and unaccountable indolence of this great monarch has next to the irresistible decrees of heaven brought this great affair to pass and this doubtless was the reason why the illustrious chaimacam enjoined me with such earnestness to acquaint him with these things since to him as i doubt not it will to thee who art as he was well acquainted with the state of things in these parts of the world it seemed very strange that the king of france should stand still and look on in a matter which so nearly concerned his friend and allie and in effect himself and not prevent a mischief big with such dangerous events  i must then acquaint thee that one false step in the king of france has been the occasion of all this disaster to his friend the king of england and without which it had been impossible for the prince of orange to have brought any of his designs to pass viz  at the very juncture of the preparations of the dutch the french king as if he was confederate with them resolving to push at the emperor of germany sends the dauphine with a french army of  0000 men quite out of the way to the upper rhine and causes him to sit down before phillipsburg whereas had he caused  0000 men to have advanced to the maes and but hovered over the dutch frontiers though without any attempt the dutch could never have parted with their troops to make the attempt in england  these measures they are now satisfied here were wrong and the most formidable enemy they have is by this very step strengthened with the addition of those kingdoms which alone are able to look the french armies in the face but the opinion those people have of the invincible power of their king is such that they value not the whole world which confidence may however be fatal to them in the end indeed his armies are composed of excellent troops but then it is to be considered that they are not all composed of his own subjects nay those which are of his own subjects are not esteemed his best troops but his armies are composed of germans swiss irish scots and some english and whenever a strong confederacy shall so attack him as that he shall not be able to make up the loss of these with men of the same nations they will find the french infantry inferior to any of the neighboring nations  but this must be granted that the officers of the french troops are good and it is to their conduct that the glory of their monarch is owing there is a saying which is made use of when they talk of the french and english nations by way of comparison viz that of the french if the soldiers will but follow the officers will always lead andthat of the english if the officers will but lead the soldiers will always follow so that by the way an army of english soldiers led by french officers would be invincible  how glorious are the troops of thy illustrious emperor in whose cause both soldiers and officers equally emulous of glory and of serving well the most invincible monarch of the universe are equally ready both to lead and to follow and to fix the glorious crescent the ensigns of our great mahomet upon the vanquished frontiers of the sultans enemies may thy ways be prosperous and thy arms victorious in the work of our mighty master till the crescent triumph over the cross and the whole world becomes tributary to thy lord and emperor  paris  th of the  st moon      letter iv to the most heavenly pattern of wisdom and purity hassan mirza zebir prince of the muftys if i were to salute thee venerable majestic guide of truth and lover of the faithful in the language of these nazareens when they address themselves to the great mufti of their religion i should give thee and more justly by far the title of sovereign pontiff with the addition of your holiness and acknowledge an infallibillty in judging and determining all religious controversies to be inherent to thy office  how effectually do all these particulars shine in thy person and character who art really holy and sublimely wise titles which they presumptuously ascribe oftentimes to the wickedest of men for thou may know immortal zebir that these sovereign pontiffs or muftys here who they address by the style of his holiness as above are sometimes the vilest creatures in the universe nay they often are most wretchedly scandalous drunken perjured lewd and in a word turbulent bloody and superlatively wicked till the people themselves are ashamed of them and have been obliged to depose them either by the help of the german emperor or the french it would be too long to enter into the history of them  this shall be the glory of our holy prophet and shall eternize his name viz that the great prince of the priests of mahomet is a pattern of just men inimitable for all the endowments of the mind has a soul equal to the highest function upon earth i mean the heavenly office of expounding infallibly the sublime truths of our holy alcoran and interpreting without appeal all the doctrines of mahomet  but to give thee a true idea of the pretended infallible guide of these deluded nazareens the story i am going to tell thee is recorded here even by themselves of one of their popes being the same whose scandalous conduct in the sale of his imaginary forged pardons and benedictions to the people was the first occasion of the defection which luther made among them that famous dervice who as i formerly wrote thee was the father of the separation or faction among the nazareens this pope or great mufty gave a living testimony to what we the true believers hold concerning the whole system of their religion viz that it is a fiction of the dervices contrived to delude the people and this horrid creature was it seems not able to contain the truth though it was so needful on his side to be concealed the occasion it seems was that seeing an immense and unexpected sum of money returned into his treasury at rome from his missionary dervices who he had sent abroad to make sale of indulgences relics and other frippery of the vatican he was so surprised with the unlooked for heap of gold that he cries out as in a rapture  heu quantum profuit hac fabula christi what prodigious gain says he do we make of this fable of christ  immortal mirza if the sovereign pontiff the supreme mufty of the nazareens has declared the whole system of the religion of their great prophet to be but a religious cheat a holy fable what need we any further testimony what greater witness can the true believers desire to confirm them in the heavenly way than the open confession of the great papa or father of the christians who has acknowledged that they are all deceivers and that the story of their great prophet jesus is but a fable  besides do they not own that this their great high priest is infallible in all he says or does it is not many moons ago since at their annual tribunal of the holy inquisition so they call the most hellish constitution on earth where they held what they call an auto de fe that is to say a general audit of the faith to give judgment on those they call heretics they burnt alive without mercy two men for saying their great mufty was not infallible  this we justly take hold of against them and prove then from the mouth of their infallible oracle that all the scheme of their religion is but a fable a cheat a piece of dervice craft to get money and in a word illustrious mirza that their supreme mufty or high priest is but a religious zavin or pickpocket  heaven doubtless has infatuated these infidels and given them up to dote on the grossest absurdities other wise they could never swallow such open and notorious impositions conversing once with a sect of the nazarenes here whom they call hugonots one of them told me their great prophet jesus did foretell that in the last days of the world his disciples should do thus viz that they should be given up to strong delusions and to believe lies that he was a prophet of god that thou know we do believe though we believe him to be inferior to our most holy prophet mahomet but assuredly if he prophesied that his followers should in the latter days believe lies and be given up to strong delusions there is no question but in that he has been a true prophet  these hugonots are by far an honester and wiser sect of the nazareens than those who are called catholics and therefore have been persecuted and even extirpated out of the kingdom of france and they do not fail to expose daily when they are in companies and societies where they can do it freely the cheats the impositions and the absurdities of the catholics there are diverse sects of these people who have broken off from the great mufty and they are denominated either from the countries where they live or the patrons from whom they derive their opinions as lutherans from luther calvinists from calvin and the like and though i look upon these to be as above the better sort by far as to their morality and as to their principles yet they differ again one from another and separate even in charity and affection as much as the ottomans and persians do about the successors to our great prophet mahomet nay they have likewise proceeded to persecution and even to blood  if love and unity be the band of religion and the pledge of a title to paradise questionless the mussulmen enjoy the best tokens of the felicity which we look for in the garden of god for no such divisions are seen among them as reign in these parts of the world where every man sets up a religion of his own and walks in the light of his own vision thinking it his duty to damn all the rest of mankind to the infernal pit who are not of his opinion and if i am not wrong there is a man among these christians who has given a scheme or plan which he calls heresyography in which he gives an account of the dissentions of the several sorts of christians and i think he reckons up about threescore and fourteen sects who all call themselves the followers of their great prophet so uncertain is the light by which these men are directed so imperfect the rules and doctrines which their great prophet left them as the fundamental law of their obedience or rather so ill do they observe his rules and obey his dictates for we know that their messiah left them excellent rules as the principles of life to guide to the celestial paradise but so degenerated are these his followers that albeit they are called by his name yet very little of his first institutes are found in the model of their religion nay they are daily fighting and shedding blood about the single question of what it was their prophet did command and what he did not and who shall or shall not interpret the mind and will of their prophet  blessed be the dust of thy sacred feet thou lamp of truth and light of believers whose oracle the faithful believe with fear in thy most pure explanations of our holy law are no doubtful reserves among thy obedient hearers no schisms or separations but all listen with attention to the law of thy lips speaking words of heavenly solace and guiding to the mystical fields which surround the gates of paradise sublime mirza bless thy obedient faithful devout mahmut and let deceivers perish  paris  th of the  th month in the year      letter v to hassan amiel zucharava the agae of the janisaries thou would be in thy element great captain of the innumerable seminary of the valiant soldiers of the east thou would i say be in thy element if thou were here just now where nothing is to be heard but the noise of war and the daily return of couriers from the armies in the field bringing accounts of victories taking strong cities and possessing new conquests one in the neck of another in such a manner that the king of france who seems to be wondrous devout and is constant in causing thanks to be given in the mosques and temples of their prophet jesus for every advantage he gains is obliged now to put three or four conquests into one thanksgiving and discharge his acknowledgments by wholesale which makes some people jest with the king and tell him that he does by his god as he does by the people make them take his coin at what price he pleases to put upon it  the truth is these nazareens make no scruple to jest with the most sacred things in their pretended worship and banter one another about it which is to me a certain sign that whatever seeming formalities they may have in their religion they believe little of the thing themselves but rather have the same opinion of it that we have viz that it is all a holy cheat contrived to support the priests who at first invented it and made use of only to get money  but to return to the things which i say are in thy element here thou might see one king preparing as i may very well say to go to war with all the kings of the earth in a word the king of france is already engaged in a war with the ancient enemy of the mussulmen the emperor of germany and has made diverse considerable conquests on the frontiers of his dominions as i shall tell thee presently he has besides this attacked the dominions of the king of spain which lie on this side and are called the low countries this will unavoidably end in a war with that king who is lord indeed of great dominions but has but a weak proud and pusillanimous people  besides all this it is evident that he will bring a war upon himself from england and holland in conjunction as he espouses the interest of the king of england who is fled to him for assistance against the invasion of the prince of orange of which thou have heard some time ago  this prince of orange is a person of such interest and alliances among the northern princes of germany that it is very probable when france breaks and declares war on that side there will be engaged against him and in behalf of the prince of orange all the princes of the house of lunenburgh of saxony and of brandenburgh and perhaps also the kings of denmark and sweden  thou will be earnest after this to enquire what this king of france is as well in person as in power know then that except the allpowerful port the center of glory surrounded with innumerable millions of valiant soldiers lord of the inexhaustible nurseries of the spahis janissaries and timariots throughout asia egypt and aethiopia i say except or next to this the king of france is the most powerful of all princes he is in person a most glorious prince wise politic enterprising boundless in ambition of glory and empire undaunted in his attempts of the greatest kind and never disappointed or to seek in his measures  he is surrounded with three hundred thousand veteran soldiers led by the most experienced officers in these parts of the world he is absolute master of his councils and perfectly well served in all his commands to make the least slip or mistake in his service is to lose the honor of serving i will tell thee a brief story to confirm this  an officer of note in his armies the other day being governor of a frontier town that was threatened by the enemy sent away his pack of hounds in which it seems he took great delight and was heard afterward two or three times to curse the war which was like to deprive him of the pleasure of the hunting season which was his darling sport the king being informed of it sent for him and told him since he liked his sport so much better than his service he would oblige him in his own way and so sent him into a great forest where he made him gamekeeper with a very small salary in a district of about    miles extent and ordered his hounds to be sent down after him commanding him not to stir out of his bounds which this poor gentleman has been obliged to submit to nor have all his friends or the intercession of the great officers of the army been able to get him restored though he has a great interest too  the king shows many times such testimonies of his resentment upon his officers when they do foolish things but as to misbehaving in action it is indeed seldom if ever seen here it is impossible to describe to thee what a general face of joy there is here in the countnances even of the whole nation at the prospe of the war as if they were sure of conque in every thing they go about though they are  this time going as it were to engage with all t world and be surrounded on every side wit the points of their enemies swords  it is a strange thing to see the accounts which come in every day from the rhine the frontiers of the german empire where the french armies have ranged unresisted both before and since the taking of phillipsburgh they have several armies on that side under several generals though the dauphine who commanded the siege gives orders to them all as captain general and commander in chief the marquis de boufflers commands on one side the count de montall an old soldier on the other and the marquis de uxelles on a third and they extend themselves every way the first of these has taken mayence spire worms all imperial cities they have ravaged the whole palatinate with fire and sword worse than a hoord of tartars do when they make an inroad into muscovy or poland they have put garrisons into creutznach bacharach and heidelburgh the dauphin has invested manheim and the marquis de boufflers is gone down the rhine as far as coblents they have levied contribution even to the frontiers of suabia and franconia and raised immense sums of money from the princes of wirtembergh baden hesse and others and from the imperial cities also franckfort alone has been obliged to pay them an hundred thousand crowns wirtembergh two and the circle of franconia fix they have burnt six hundred villages and towns on both sides the rhine and laid entirely wast the most fruitful and pleasant country of the palatinate not sparing the fine palaces of the prince particularly that in the castle of heidelburgh which was the most beautiful in all germany nor do they spare even the mosques or temples of their worship so that these nazareens are the most barbarous of all nations in the world for though they all profess the same religion and worship the great crucified messiah yet they permit their licentious troops to destroy the places set apart for his service  the people here i confess do not seem to approve of this new way of making war by burning and destroying of cities and towns which make no resistance but the court give this answer that it is necessary at this time to make the arms of their king dreadful and to oblige the neighboring german princes to come in and pay the contributions demanded which indeed they have done for fear of the like devastations for all this while there has appeared no considerable body of germans in the field able either to attack the french or to protect their own people  doubtless renowned hassan the effect of all this will be found to the advantage of the mussulmens arms and to weaken the forces of the infidels of germany in hungary who dare to oppose thy troops for the intestine broils of these nazareen nations have always been and ever will be the advancement of the glorious ensigns of mahomet  may victory attend those who fight under the banner of the faithful whose souls if they fall in battle go immediately triumphing to paradise the garden of inexpressible pleasure  paris the  th day of the  th moon in the year      letter vi to morat abdimelcher the kadeleskar of anatolia i cannot refrain laying at thy sacred feet blessed image of the sovereign lawgiver what i meet with in this part of the world suited to thy sublime station and in particular to that exalted temper of thy soul by which thou framest instruction out of the evil actions of wicked men to the advantage of the just  thou art to know then that the french nation where i live have under the conduct of a most furious and victorious prince made war for two years upon the emperor of the nazareens and that with great success that in the prosecution of this war and in order as they say here to intimidate and terrify the germans he has caused his troops to make the most dreadful ravages upon the frontiers that can be imagined they set fire to the villages in a most fruitful and pleasant country called the palatinate in five places at once viz on each border of that country and at one place in the middle and suffered them to burn every way till they all joined in one flame it is not possible to describe to thee the desolation made the ruin of innumerable families the destruction of flourishing cities fine palaces the murders of men ravishing of women and all manner of desolations  but the reason for which i give thee an account of this affair in particular is for what follows that the king of france after all these cruelties and inhumanities committed by his command or at least by his allowance has ordered a day to be set apart for a biram or feast of thanksgiving and to give thanks to god in all the frontier towns on that side of his conquests for completing so glorious an expedition these are the very words of his orders the true sense should have been for completing the ruin of the most flourishing country in that part of the world and scattering an hundred thousand families of miserable inhabitants to seek their bread besides the murder ravishments and inimitable cruelties practiced by the soldiers in the action  surely these infidels ought to be esteemed truly detestable for their notions of the great one god who has created the world that they can think it acceptable to his divine purity and to the perfection of his being to destroy his creatures and depopulate his creation or that he can accept thanks offered up to him for actions which it is most certain his nature abhors i remember to have seen some lines published in the english tongue which it is said were thrown into a mosque in the capital city of the english nation when they were giving thanks to their nazareen prophet for the discovery of a plot for which some who had been found guilty of it were executed the lines it was apparent were made by some who were of the other side as follows ye hypocrites leave off your pranks to murder men and give god thanks forbear for shame proceed no further for god accepts no thanks for murder   they must have very gross conceptions of god i say who can presume to give him thanks for the devastation and ruin of their fellow creatures and for the rapine and destruction which men given up to the fury of their lust and rage shall execute in the world if the righteous power of heaven concerns it self with any of the actions of these enemies of his glory and has not resolved to give them entirely up to the punishments of hell he will certainly testify his resentment not only for the crime of blood and destruction in the fact it self but for that horrid mockery of his justice in entitling him by their praises to the rapin which is in their hands as if they were doing him an acceptable service in sending thousands of souls into the regions of darkness for the caprice and ambition of one man  but that which is still more particular in this religious mockery is that the french have obliged the very people of the country it self to join in this ceremony and have even prescribed to them a text to preach upon being some verse out of their ancient writings thus come let us root them out that they be no more a nation this is the most horrible imposition that ever i have met with of its kind and is indeed acknowledged by many to be very barbarous seeing these men are all of one religion professing to be all followers of the prophet jesus the nazareen their messiah and teacher  sage oracle of heavenly knowledge thou will read this history of nazareen hypocrisy with a just detestation of soul mahomet has told us that god who is but one god will punish those with fire who mock his power and make a jest of his righteous government teaching cruelty and injustice for truth and entituling god who is gracious and merciful to robbery and ravishment injury and blood  paris  0th day of the  th moon in the year      letter vii to the kaimacham france has now passed the rubicon she has declared war against spain attacked the empire of germany and made the most powerful prince of the nazareens draw off his troops from hungary and bring    000 men into the field against this one aggressor and now to crown all she has broken with the prince of orange who is newly become king of england and with the dutch who are his allies and in short with all their dependencies so that the king of france is like to have above  00000 enemies in arms against him by sea and land  as for the affairs of england the king of france has furnished the old king with men and money and sent him to ireland where he has so well plied his time that he is master of dublin the capital of that kingdom and of the whole island except one little city in the north part called londonderry and that is besieged with  0000 men and no army in the country to relieve it hence it must needs fall into his hands so that king william so they call the prince of orange has his hands full for some time on that side and we see the king of france baffling all the rest in so strange a manner that if they do not concert their measures better all the mighty armies they have now ready against france will come to nothing  for in the very beginning of this year the french proceeding in their usual method of ravaging the country have actually burnt the cities of spire oppenheim worms and frankendale to ashes besides other smaller towns on that side they say here that the french have been very merciful in the manner of their burning of these cities viz in that they gave the people notice some days before to remove and they pretend now it was great clemency that seeing the inhabitants did not fly as they were ordered to do they did not turn them alive with their houses  to withstand these furies the emperor has been obliged to recall the duke of lorain and  0000 of the best troops they had in hungary so that i make no doubt but the grand vizier will have leisure this summer to put the resolutions of the sublime council of wisdom the divan in execution to extend the glorious ensigns of the grand seignior to the infamy of the enemies of righteous mahomet and to retake the towns which have been lost the last three years when the success of the war for our sins has seemed to go against us  these nazareens infidels enemies to god and mahomet are at this time in a word all together by the ears and now invincible man of valor is the time to gird on thy sword and to appear to the confusion of the enemies of the truth may victory attend thy already fortunate troops for now is the time to tear up the infidel nations and kingdoms by the roots  yesterday the king of france published his declaration of war against the newcrownd king of england but in this declaration he is slyled the usurper of england this new incident will probably produce great events for the prince of orange is an implacable enemy of france and a prince of unwearied application to the war  paris the  th of the  th moon      letter viii to morat abdiel

to behold the place of sanctity how happy art thou above kings emperors and the most glorious men on earth yet happy only in thy purity and humility which originally advanced thee to the highest pitch of humane preferment for how much more glorious is it to thee to keep the venerable dust of holy men than to be treasurer over all the riches of the grand seignior or to have an hundred thousand millions of purses in thy keeping  i think much of thy illustrious office when i see here in the mosques of this seemingly devout infidel one called the keeper of the relics surely there is not a greater imposture on the earth than this of relics is among the superstitious nazareens in the repositories of their churches they have the bones of any dead carcass split into thousands of pieces and set into rings enchased with gold surrounded with diamonds one is called the piece of the scull of one saint another is called a splinter taken out of the finger of another when perhaps it is in reality the bone of a dog or if of a man or woman perhaps it is of some infamous creature broken on the wheel or some prostitute dissected by the surgeon  these are worn about the necks of kings queens princes ladies with child virgins etc to preserve them from the devil from frightful dreams from treason to keep the women with child from miscarriage and the young women from fits frenzies of the matrix etc and which indeed is the intent and meaning of all the holy fraud they are sold for these purposes by the priests at an inestimable price and the juggle sometimes comes to light  a merchant of rochel lately put an excellent cheat upon the dervices of a convent or cell of religious near that city it seems the merchant was in bad circumstances as to his estate and upon the point of turning bankrupt when a ship coming into port louis from the east indies he forms a letter as written from goa by his brother wherein he tells him of a most miraculous relick of st thomas being a piece of the scull of that blessed apostle of their religion which had done the most wonderful cures in the most violent distempers of the head and brain that it cured all manner of lunacy and distraction adding that he had testimonials of the same from the convent of friars of those they call jacobins at goa where his brother had been and where all these miraculous things were wrought and that in particular it restored the memory in one who had quite lost all sense of things past for some years by being put about the neck the jewel hanging behind in the poll by the hands of a friar of that order and the like having gotten this story put into form and finding the fathers very earnest to obtain this jewel and willing to give a very great price for it he accordingly obliges himself to write to his brother to send it over by the next ship taking a contract from the fathers for  000 crowns to be paid upon delivery  having obtained this contract he goes to marseilles with it where telling the story as in confidence to a person there he acquaints the bishop of that place who being desirous to obtain so rich a prize and viewing the authentic contract of the friars of rochel offers the merchant  0000 crowns for the holy relick if he will bring it immediately to him the merchant accordingly having all his affairs ready and having a piece of an old scull made up in an enchasement of gold with the date of the year back about   0 years before the time and the names of two religious men of goa of the first planting that colony whose names he had learnt and the work made so artfully as to appear very ancient i say having all these things ready he waits till an east india ship arrived at lisbon from goa which is a colony of the portuguese and then pretending to have received the jewel writes to the bishop who with great solemnity received it and paid him his money  this story i do not avouch to thee of my own knowledge the fact if it were true having been done some years before my coming hither but many cheats like this having been daily discovered among them this is worth credit nothing is more strange to me than that a nation so intelligent as this is should not long ago have been surfeited with these miraculous fripperies and yet so t is that they receive the grossest impositions of this kind every day  i am told indeed it is by a hugonot but one who gives such testimony of it that it is not to be doubted that there are deposited as relics in several places more pieces of the cross on which they say jesus the son of mary was crucified than ten yoke of oxen could draw and yet we believe that he was not crucified at all but was received up into heaven from the judgment hall of the roman governor and the jews were obliged that the people might not enquire what was become of him to crucify another person in his stead  besides all this we have reason to know that the whole cross on which he was said to be crucified is miraculously preserved in a vault arched over with gold an hundred eathom within the earth under the foundation of the great mosque at the sublime port which was formerly a temple of the nazareens dedicated as they call it to saint sophia so that all this story of relics is no more than a legend of forgeries and fables  and yet the great king of france who it must be owned is a wise a sagacious a penetrating man as well as a great king never lies down in his bed without innumerable relics of saints as they call them hanging about his neck on the curtains of his bed and on the locks of his chamber doors as guardians and preservatives to keep him from the power of evil spirits nay there is no doubt but he has them upon him when he is solacing himself with his concubines and harlots of whom he has very many always attending his pleasures  the beams of eternal peace shining from the fire that burns over the gate of paradise be thy protector from evil venerable morat thou need no

to imanzani mehemet kadilesker of romelia in all the world there is not a greater impostor than this great mufty or sovereign pontiff of the nazareens whom they call the pope the chair they sit in and from whence they derive their pretended infallibility has been defiled with more monsters than the idol of bassamene in arabia or the pretended oracle of arsaballa in the desert of chusargha sometimes indeed they obtain a person of some morals to fill that mysterious seat of wickedness such was the late innocent xi this for ought i know may be permitted by the subtilty of the devil to keep up the delusion that the people should not be so surfeited with the continual crimes of the pontiff as to abhor the pontificate it self but even these men of morals have so much canting hypocritical stuff mingled with their other conduct and permit such frauds such open crimes among their submuftys such as their cardinals bishops abbots and the various orders of their dervices or clergy that certain it is and nothing more visible than that the whole constitution is a stated universal cheat  i have been curious to search into these frauds for the confirmation of the true believers not but that we the true mussulmen and believers of the verity know with a certainty that permits us not to doubt that their whole system of this part of the doctrine of the nazareens is a delusion and a mere invention of their dervices to establish an ecclesiastic tyranny in the world but it must needs confirm us all the more and add infinite satisfaction to us to have this confessed and testified out of the mouths of these infidels themselves  i lately read some tracts written by some of the most learned of this nation of the franks among whom i dwell wherein they speak with the utmost detestation of this great mufty called pope and not so much concerning the character or morals of the person though he who they have now elevated is but a very indifferent person that way but even of the pontificate it self i mean the authority exercised and the principles professed by the sea of rome in general that is by the pope cardinals bishops and all the cloistered crew called the roman clergy  this author whom they call monsieur jeurieu is one of those who are here called hugonots of whom i have formerly written thee a large account who have long since disowned these people i speak of he is one of the most learned of these hugonots and is now banished this kingdom for his refusing to acknowledge the pope but he is so far from complying that in his writings he offers to prove this sovereign pontiff not only not to be the true follower of jesus the son of mary their crucified prophet and messiah but an apostate and that his chair is the seat of the beast that his power is not only not christian but antichristian that he is the great false prophet spoken of in the writings of the jewish talmud and in the registers of their rabbis which they call by the name of revelation nay in one of his books he calls the roman establishment which they call the church the great scarlet whore producing sundry predictions among the writings of the disciples of jesus which give a very express and particular character of the papal tyranny under such denominations prophesying her downfall at last under the allusion of the fall of the city of babylon and that the kings of the earth shall hate her the whore that is the papal hierarchy and shall burn her flesh with fire  verily great apostle of the true believers it seems to me that these men whom they call hugonots and who are the followers of one calvin who succeeded luther in the first great defection from the roman doctrines of religion i say these hugonots are a sober zealous people much more upright and devout than the followers of the pope and seem to me to have much the better of the argument against them for albeit they acknowledge that the church of rome was originally the church planted by the followers of jesus of nazareth and continued faithful to the institutions of the said jesus as dictated to them by his said followers yet they suggest that by the corruption of many ages and the assuming disposition of the popes and their dervices or clergy they have introduced so many innovations such idolatrous practices and so many detestable additions to the first doctrines left them by the messiah that there remains nothing with them of the first institution  it must be confessed jesus of nazareth laid down to his followers and disciples most pure and holy rules both of religion and of moral virtue but it is true also that these pontiffs and their followers have filled them with so many horrible impositions that the originals are not now to be known especially that of their worshipping a piece of bread as a god suggesting that a few words of a common dervice can effectually transmutate the species of bread into the substance of their crucified messiah an idolatry horrible and detestable  but i return to the persons of their popes to whose crimes indeed all these innovations in the religion of the messiah are owing i have formerly mentioned to thee and to thy happy predecessor now rejoicing in the garden of pleasure the story of a woman counterfeit who was made a pope but by being gotten with child by one of her own servants and delivered in the open street in rome exposed that cheat to the world the nazareens strive to reject it as a falsehood and charge it as an invention of the hugonots but besides that the story is recorded long before luther or any of those they call reformers were heard of and is confessed by so many of their own writers there is no room to doubt of the truth particularly one baptista mantuanus a famous poet among them writing satyrically of hell as if he was showing a stranger the place and telling him where every great person was to be found has it thus hic pendebat adhuc sexum mentita virilem foemina cui triplici phrygiam diademata mitram extollebat papix and pontificalis adulter vid pope joan p     the sum of this shameful story i find thus in another of their own authors viz that of ravisius textor in officina lib    scitum est ex chronicis and a majoribus scriptum johannem anglicum ab ephebis sexum virulum simulasse and tandem fatem nescio quo aut fortuna certe volente ad pontificatum pervenisse in quo annos circiter duos federit post leonem iv neque prius innotuerit facti veritus quam a quodam ex domesticis impregnata tandem emiserit partum this is in a word that one joan english having concealed her sex from a youth and appeared as a man and passed her studies as another author says as a man was by we know not what destiny elected pope and sat as pope two years when being discovered and gotten with child by one of her domestics she was publicly delivered of it in the street  it seems also she died in the childbirth  but not to dwell on this hellish impostor the characters of the whole successions of those infidels who they wickedly call holy fathers were it given thee at large from the beginning would astonish thee with their abominations and wickedness  bless mahomet and his true followers who have been thy truly virtuous and holy predecessors that the chair of sovereign and sacred jurisdiction in matters religious has never been tainted with the impure lives of the possessors but as thou art so have been those before thee the bright images of virtue patterns of religion and exemplary guides of truth to the faithful  paris the viiith of the  th moon in the year      letter x to the venerable sage guide of wisdom prince of the law of mahomet great muffti and high priest of the mussulmans i send thee bright oracle of truth and virtue a piece of news confirmed from all parts of the nazareen dominion viz that the great caliph of the christians prince of the dervices of the nazareen faith is dead the infallible guide as they call him here the mirror of holiness is sunk into earth as a common man  if these popes were really persons of so much perfection so infallible in their decrees so replete with innate holiness as men here pretend and on the other hand the deluded multitude did believe their messiah had but as much interest in the celestial paradise as we mussulmans believe him to have he would never suffer any of their popes to go into the grave the common way of all men but would certainly translate them directly into paradise as enoch elias and himself were translated  but the truth is they know all this whole system of the pontificate to be a mere dream of the old deceitful dervices who made a trade of religion to dive into the purses of their votaries and it appears because their most holy fathers or popes are no more immortal than they are infallible from whence i infer that they are no more infallible than they are immortal  this deceased pope was one of the honestest men they have had in the papal chair this many ages if it may be allowed to call a father of lies an impostor and the head of a cursed imposture an honest man but to give him his due he was honester than any of those whose character i have heard of he was a just inoffensive man in his morals which very few of them are and as to the pious cheat of his office to give him his due he left it just where he found it whether he had any faith in the system or no i will not affirm but am of opinion that he had not because he had too much penetration to be imposed upon and yet i think he had too because he had too much integrity to impose upon others but that which reconciles the two extremes is that he was bred up in the delusions and perhaps received the first impressions so deep when young that his reason could not prevail over them afterward and if it was so it was no strange thing in a religion wherein one of the principal rules of faith is to have it follow those who went before them and value their doctrine rather for its antiquity than the intrinsic of its principles  they called this pope by the name of innocent xi the hugonots and protestants every where cried him up and he was called in general the protestant pope but this was principally on account of his politics not his religion in the first he was a patron of liberty in the last a tyrant and bigot but with this explanation in his favor that in the first he acted nature in the last he acted his office  they tell us a good story of him here which is an admirable proof of the generosity of his nature and the goodness of his disposition the story says that an english gentleman coming to rome and being desirous to satisfy his curiosity in seeing the pope his holiness as they call him having some intimation that he was a man of learning desired to talk with him and using very great freedom in his discourse among the rest says the pope if i mistake not i saw you yesterday at the solemn mass at st peters so they call the great mosque at rome where the pope himself goes your holiness cannot mistake says the english gentleman smiling the pope understood him and found he had really committed a mistake to say if i mistake not when he is called infallible and that the gentleman had touched the point in repartee however being a person full of good humor he carried that off and turning to another subject well says he you saw me in my habits of ceremony what do you think now of the popes being antichrist the gentleman was full of the answer but loath to give offense and asked if his holiness would give him leave to speak freely with all my heart says the pope i promise you i will not be offended  why truly says he i will not affirm that the pope is antichrist but in my country if there had been a hueandcry after antichrist and i had met your holiness in the dress you were in yesterday i believe i should have apprehended you upon suspicion  the pope they say received the jest with much good temper but did not talk much with the person after it and the hugonots and protestants make themselves very merry with the story  they publish a letter of politics in england which they say this pope wrote to king james when he sought assistance from him against the prince of orange in which they say he blamed him for offering to break through the laws and liberties of his country on pretense of introducing the romish religion but the people here cannot bear to hear of that doctrine which they say condemns the king in that very thing for which he ought to be canonized  in a word pope innocent was for every nation enjoying their own constitutions and carrying religion on by religious methods not by force armies and persecution but the religion he called himself the head of would not long subsist upon that bottom  paris   th day of the  th moon in the year      letter xi to the illustrious leader of the armies of the invincible emperor of the faithful mehemet orchanes ogli vizier azem i congratulate with an excess of joy thy advancement to the high command whereof thou art now possessed and as no man knows better than thy self how to execute the office of prime minister in a state of such boundless dominion so no man knows more of thy merit and capacity for the dignity than i who have been witness to the greatness of thy soul and thy indefatigable applications to virtuous and glorious actions from thy childhood it is now and at this distance that i foresee thy valor and conduct will curb the insolences of the infidels and enemies of mahomet and restore to the ottoman empire those towns which not the valor of the germans but the negligence and want of experience in former officers have suffered to fall into their hands  wherefore is it that the court of the grand seignior has known such changes and that no less than seven grand viziers have been removed in five years past but that fate which has reserved the retrieving the glory of the ottoman empire to a hand and head fitted by nature for that work might not only bring thee to this high station but prepare for thee the field of victory and peace  i am not caressing thee for gain or swelling thy vanity with words mahmut knows not how to be a hypocrite flattery is the sacrifice of fools and a gift that wise and great souls abhor but it is revealed to me from the sacred hills of besser abba and the cave of wonders mahomet said amen the great prophet joined his hands and shouted i heard the sound in vision imperceptible the oracle speaks by my mouth cuprioli shall gloriously end this war the infidels and nazareens shall sue for peace and it shall be given them  i live here in a country of enemies of mahomet yet the king of france is both like thee in glory and like thee happy in the most sublime undertakings he is unshaken in his misfortunes and invincible in his resolutions he received the last year several foils and disappointments his enemies in strong confederacy took from him maynce or mentz an imperial city and an impregnable fortress keyserlauter and bonn also two very strong towns and with them large countries depending on them  but like anteus who the poets feign was the son of terra and had this benefit by his birth that when he was in wrestling with hercules thrown to the earth he rose up seven times stronger than before so the king of france made more furious by his losses makes such preparations for an offensive war this year as the like is no where to be seen but at the stupendous port where thou guidest the helm of empire and where all the princes of the earth do homage  the preparations here are incredible and the king resolves to take the field in person the dauphine is to command a second and separate army and the duke of orleans the kings brother a third besides which he resolves to have a fleet of  00 sultanas of the line that is in the speech of the sea in this part of the world of men of war of  0 guns and upwards for no less ships now fight in the line of battle  the face of the whole kingdom is covered with troops and the drums beat up in all parts all the discourse is of arms and equipages and you would swear that all the people of france were to repair to the borders to see the fate of europe decided the great cities and towns are taxed at every one a regiment of soldiers or less according to their magnitude which they report will amount to   0 regiments which shall bear their names and be clothed by the said towns and the expense is to be repaid in three years after the wars shall be over or perhaps not at all for this king is not very nice in observing the promises which he makes especially those to his own subjects  fear and courage in war attend bad or good success as the rain and heat do the thickness or clearness of the air and the hopes of men rise and fall just as the enemy they pursue rises or falls before them may early successes crown thy illustrious undertakings that the ancient courage of the mussulmans may revive in thy glory and victory may be the handmaid of thy wisdom and valor  letter xii to the aga of the janissaries i had no sooner heard of the advancement of my old friend comerade and acquaintance mehemet ogli to the illustrious office of grand vizier but it foreboded to me that the affairs of the glorious empire of the world would take a new turn virtue and magnanimity possessed him from a youth he was the delight of wise men and delighted in valiant men and is now the choice of wisdom and valor it self  as is the man so are those under him his consummate experience could not but dictate to him that for the accomplishment of his great designs he must single out instruments qualified by their virtue and valiant performances to undertake the greatest actions  when i heard that thou were singled out by him from among thy fellows to be at the head of the mighty legions of the greenvest and that the janizarics were put under thy command i expected no less than what i have since found to be the consequence of such conduct viz the overthrow of the nazareens i congratulate thy beginning of success in this and the defeat of   000 of their best troops which i hear are the first trophies of thy conduct and will let the whole mussulman empire know what they are to expect from the new vizier and those who fight under the banners of mahomet by his example  prostrate on the earth i congratulate thy lord in the success of thy faithful services i will tell thee also in what manner the infidels speak of this action even among themselves for they have published their own shame from all parts  first thou may observe that in all other battles they give false accounts and relate such actions not as they really are but as they would have them to be that they may buoy up the hopes and spirits of their people and keep up what they call the reputation of their arms but this late action in servia under thy conduct has been so conspicuous that they have no false colors sufficient to hide it and are bound to relate it in its true circumstance condoling with one another for the great loss they have received i will give it thee in some of their own words  the effects of the great changes at the ottoman court says one of those nazareen writers begin to show themselves in a manner which justly alarms the german court the new vizier and the new aga of the janissaries both men of a martial disposition and of great experience in military affairs apply themselves to the business of the war in a manner quite different from those unexperienced people who went before them in a word we have had a taste of their conduct and it appears that suitable to the reputation of those two great commanders the courage of their soldiery is revived and the hopes of the germans in proportion declined  he goes on to give good advice indeed to the german generals viz to expect blows and to quicken their application to the war having a vigilant and valiant enemy to deal with meaning the vizier and thy self  the aga of the janissaries says he not being able without indignation to see the german troops insult the ottoman empire even almost at the door of the capital city and seat of their emperor resolved to attack the main body of the emperors forces consisting of   imperial regiments of foot of   00 men each and about  000 horse and dragoons who were posted at nissa and had ravaged the country as far as uscopia and mount hemus to this purpose ordering a body of tartars to pass the danube about widin the aga advanced with a body of  000 janissaries and  000 sphais and coming up within four miles of nissa joined there with a body of tartars and with some hungarians under count tekely and the next morning attacked the imperial troops commanded by the d of holstein the fight was very fierce and bloody the germans defending themselves with great bravery till after an obstinate battle of above four hours continuance in which a great many men were killed on both sides the german horse were obliged to give way and were put into some confusion and after some time more to a plain flight being pursued by the tartars so closely that only about  00 with the duke of holstein escaped to belgrade the duke himself very sorely wounded  the infantry being now forsaken of the horse were surrounded and charged in front and flank and in short were entirely cut in pieces by the janissaries very few escaping and we hear since that the duke of holstein is dead of his wounds    i send thee this testimony to thy conduct and to the valor of thy troops being made by the enemies own acknowledgment and as an earnest of what they ate to expect from the returning fortune of the ottoman troops  heaven that always showers down rewards upon the faithful and valiant give continued successes to thy arms till the enemy vomit up their unjust conquests and thou give peace to the just in the name of god and his prophet  paris  0th of the  d moon of the year    0 letter xiii to the most perfect in wisdom and virtue the upright instructor among the faithful vahimi effendi publisher of truth and teacher of wise sayings in the presence of the grand seignior surely the religion of these nazareens as they manage it here among their dervices or priests of whom there are innumerable sects is the most unaccountable mass of contradiction that was ever heard of in the world and to do justice to the lord of truth and righteousness who dwells in unity the great one god who sent his prophet the son of mary to instruct these men in the way of right things i say to do justice to him it must be declared that they walk not in his precepts as the true mussulmen walk in the right precepts of mahomet  it would offend thy ears ennurd to hear the words of justice and wisdom should i give thee the detail of the folly and madness of these hypocrites were their prophet jesus here now on earth to see the hypocritical behavior of the several sects of religious thieves among them and how they sell pardon of sins for money and send souls into torment or bliss as their friends are narrow or large in their bounty to their church he would scourge them out of the mosques consecrated to his name as he did the money changers out of the temple for never was it so true as now that his house is made a den of thieves  but not only are the religious among them a crew of unsanctified devotees but the manner with which they carry on their fraud is in it self so ridiculous that nothing is more astonishing than that the people can be imposed upon in such a manner and can take such absurdities for religion for example  they celebrate yearly the day of the nativity of the messiah jesus but as if they were determined by fate to be made ridiculous to all the sons of adam they cannot resolve among themselves when it was so tenacious also they are of their several epochas of time and of the particular accounts which one or other keep that each country keep it according to their own way some ten days sooner some ten days later than one another and in the muscovire country i am told they have no less than   several accounts  in a word they know not when he was born and did not we know the certainty of these things by the unerring revelation of our just oracle the alchoran which came from heaven we might ask them how they knew he was born at all or that there was such a person upon earth but we are able to give them a truer account of their own prophet whose pattern of virtue we declare to them would make them perfect had they obeyed his law with sincerity and faithfulness  neither are they better instructed in the nature and reason of keeping biram or a feast on the day of the nativity of the son of mary for if they acknowledge him to be a preacher of righteousness then ought his followers to practice according to his example and when they celebrate his birth in whom they trust and believe should it not be to recommend his law to one another for the just observation of their people  on the contrary the day of biram or feast observed for the birth of their prophet jesus is a day set apart for unbounded licentious vice as gluttony gaming excess of wine and all manner of liberty in those crimes in which these northern nations surmount even the wickedness of the luxurious egyptians  i swear to thee by the holy soul of my father and grandfather that there are not living in the face of the sun such a generation of bellygods as the dervices of this part of the world who under pretense of sanctity abstinence and prosessd poverty wallow in sensuality gluttony and wine and this is an aggravation of it that the day appointed to thank god for the birth of their great prophet is as it were set apart to provoke god to take from them the benefit for which their prophet jesus came among them  nor is it in vain righteous vengeance has filled them with their own ways and the laws of virtue and truth which jesus the son of mary left them to walk by when he was taken up into heaven are lost to them being swallowed up in hypocrisy and innovation on one hand ignorance and immorality on the other  an instance of their ignorance i shall give thee in another case in which they are mocked by their own people and this relates to another day which they keep as a day of devotion for the crucifixion of their messiah this they call good friday but why it has that name they cannot tell us neither is it known by one in five hundred amongst them what it is they are to do on that day or how to behave viz whether with joy or sorrow  it was yesterday that they celebrated this day in the great mosque of this city as also in all the lesser mosques but i name the great mosque because when the people came to go into the mosque or church they found a paper fixed upon the door with the following lines in several languages that all sorts of people might read it ye hypocrites pull off the sacred masque and of your selves this graver question ask whether you are in earnest or in jest whether good friday is a fast or feast if as a feast you keep the joyful day you joy that judas did your lord betray if it is a fast and all in sorrow seem you mourn that jesus did the world redeem   the people were so astonished at the question which not any of them could answer that they read them with great attention and many took copies of them so that it was to no purpose that the bishop hearing of it afterward sent his officers to pull the paper down for they were immediately made public over the whole city and are repeated now in every mouth with such pleasure that the dervices are provoked to the highest degree being banterd and jested with about them in all conversation nay i am told the king himself could not forbear repeating them by way of jest to his confessor  but that which made the greatest disturbance was that at the bottom of the paper there were three other lines upon the reading of which it was observed abundance of the more serious people began to consider whether they had best go into the mosqe that day or no and many of them really went back again the lines were thus before you go to church resolve the doubt that you may know what you go there about and not go wiser in than you come out   had this happened in spain portugal or in italy it is certain whoever had dared to take a copy of them or to repeat them again especially by way of jest upon the clergy as they do here would have been clapped up in the inquisition and never have come out but at an auto de fe with a san benitto upon his head but the french are a people of so much freedom in their general conversation that they could never suffer the yoke of the inquisition among them  letter xiv to simeon ben habbakkuk a jew at salonicha thou my old friend art in my opinion studying and spending thy years even to an extreme old age upon the weakest foundation that any man of so great learning ever did except an old friar here in france who they say has been forty years writing what he calls the history of sacred relics they call him father le plesis  he has made a collection of the trumpery they call relics which they tell me are digested into    volumes in folio to which he has with much labor added all that he could reckon up or gather and perhaps invent and having dedicated them to cardinal mazarine the cardinal who perhaps knew more of the cheat than father le plesis asked him to let him see the whole work that he might cause them to be laid before the king and obtain for him some mark of his majestys esteem the old father tickled with this compliment brought his    volumes in manuscript curiously written to the cardinal who took care of the friar indeed and made him an abbay as we style them naki esscreff or chief of the emirs i say he made him abbay of a monastry of friars benedictines but never let him see his books any more and i am told that after the cardinals death they were found in his library with this worthy remark upon them under the cardinals own hand that they were a scandalous medly of ridiculous tales and ought to be suppressed  be not angry grave simeon if i think thou art studying and laboring spinning out thy bowels and employing thy fruitless years in a production which when thou have finished will be of no profit either to thy self or any one else for as i have it from thy own pen thou have been this  0 years tracing antiquity and the learned works of the hebrew rabbis to explain and come at the original of the talmud or babylonian gemara the misna and the lectures of the gaonim and amoraim viz the expositors and doctors of the oral law of moses  alas simeon i pity thy fruitless labor thou have gotten a task endless as that of syssiphus who was condemned to roll a great stone up the mountain aeger which came back upon him immediately upon every lift he gave it and always left him just where he began  miserable man thou would do well to transpose thy studies from the subsequent to the antecedent and resolve first the previous question whether there was any such thing as an oral law committed to the children of israel by moses yea or no and till thou do this it is all but begging the question to talk of the authority of the misna which in its pretense is a body of traditional constitutions  but did ever man of learning spend his invaluable time in such a fruitless study as this in which thou art sure to arrive at nothing but in a word to leave every thing more abstruse dark and difficult than you found it  i know it is in vain to urge to thee the words of jesus the son of mary because thy thoughts of him are not the same as we mussulmen entertain for we believe him to be a prophet sent from god but thou believe him to be an impostor we believe he was translated to heaven as was enoch and elias thou that he was crucified and that his disciples the better to carry on the religious fraud dozd the roman soldiers with an opiate in some wine and having cast them into a deep sleep had stolen his body away and gave out that he was risen from the dead  but i say not to mention the preaching of this jesus who exposed sufficiently the folly and knavery of your traditions and made even the notion of an oral law ridiculous in it self i shall put thee upon this rational enquiry viz whether moses left any such oral law or not and whether it does not appear rather to be the mere subtilty craft and knavery of the rabbis pretending by suggesting such ancient institutions and undertaking to explain and expatiate upon them to gain reverence and respect among the people and indeed making themselves lawgivers for it is evident that they have in the end given the same or a superior sanctin to the tradition of the elders viz the misna the babylonian gemara etc as was given to the written law of god handed to them by the ministry of moses your great prophet and lawgiver  now sage simeon what is the evidence you have that moses gave any rules other than those which he left in writing verily thou can neither give evidence of it or lay down any probable scheme or reason of it to give evidence none will pretend nor do the most ancient writers among the hebrews go back to any time when it can be said by many hundred years that any was alive who received those oral laws from the mouth of moses the utmost authority given by the ancients and with which your people seem so well satisfied is this that they received it by tradition  these traditions are collected by rabbi juda a learned sage man but he goes no farther back than simeon the just who by his acknowledgement lived not till above a thousand years after the death of moses and knew nothing of what was left by moses himself but what was upon record in the books called the pentateuch except what was handed down to him by the traditions that is in a word the corruptions of the elders  these traditions then having no evidence of their antiquity thou would do well after the most curious search of books to resolve them as gaffir evilmouah the learned arabian of medina did long since into the corrupt exposition of dogmatick rabbis presuming in pride and ostentation to impose their sense upon the divine institutions of moses who also to add an authority though surreptitious and assumed pretend that moses was said to leave such constitutions as explanations of the laws of god as if moses who was guided by the especial and particular hand of heaven and had the pattern of every thing given him in the mount would not have been so just to the children of israel and so just to god himself as to have written for their farther instruction every thing that had been necessary for their perfect understanding the law of god if it had not been sufficiently explained in it self  farther it seems a reproach to god himself if thou acknowledgest him to be a perfect lawgiver that he should leave his laws in so hidden and dark expressions that moses his servant hidden and by whom he promulgated the whole tenor of his will should be obliged to add to it an oral law as a directory of its obedience whereas in the rest there was not a stitch in the curtains of the tabernacle but what was particularly described and directed from heaven  but to carry it yet farther by the translation as also by all the hebrew editions of the the pentateuch which i have seen the last chapters of the last of those books contain a recapitulation by moses to the people of all that god commanded him to say to them wherein he tells them the whole substance of the command the plainness of it and particularly that it needs no oral exposition or addition he makes indeed pressing instances to them for their observance of the law but does not say one word of its requiring an interpreter or any explanations expositions or particular directions on the other hand your prophet moses declared that there needed no such helps deuteronomy  0             for this commandment which i command thee this day is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou may do it  the meaning is clear it is nigh to thee familiar to thy understanding it is in thy mouth that is in thy own mouth thou need no teacher and in thy heart thou need no explanation no interpreter that thou may do it that is thou know it perfectly well and can have no excuse for not doing it  from hence it is observed in the histories of the hebrew times that on all the public solemnities among the israelites the law was to be read to the people there was no occasion of oral expositions and traditional additions the law was complete it wanted nothing but to be read to the people it carried such energy with it and was in all things so completely full so plain so intelligible and so convincing that to read it was sufficient  what then art thou doing o simeon thou art but raking in dunghils and searching the corrupt attempts of frail and erroneous men to explain and expound the law given in the most perfect form from heaven by that god who cannot err and who exhibited his commands in so perfect a form as needed no explanations  depend upon it sage rabbi thou art studying upon nothing but art surrounded with those cursed phaenomenas of human inventions which for many ages have been darkning and eclipsing not explaining the pure and unspotted law of moses your lawgiver and your rabbis have been now a thousand years endeavoring to introduce their mean and debauched whymsies into the said law as institutions of god which is the worst sort of idolatry just as the nazareens here have done who by the pretended authority of the popes or sovereign pontiffs have introduced so many oral traditions into the worship of their prophet that they have very few of his first institutions left among them  be wise in the conclusion of thy days and leave off propagating errors and imposing human inventions in the most pure laws of the high one eternal being  paris   th of the  th moon of the year    0 letter xv to the kaimacham if i judge rightly from what i have observed from the history of the nations among whom i dwell i think the mighty empire of the ottomans is the only kingdom or government in the world which god has suffered to stand protected by his great prophet mahomet without suffering the revolutions common to these european kingdoms this is a testimony of the divine pleasure and may cause us to conclude the empire of the faithful to be the delight of heaven  all the kingdoms of europe have either first or last suffered violent convulsions changes and revolutions of government as sweden denmark poland muscovy spain portugal england etc but the triumphant empire of the ottomans has from its first founder continued under the same government in the same line and in a continual increase like the growing crescent the ancient and original device of our great prophet growing toward its full and has yet never suffered any wain long may it increase till it triumph over all the nations of the world and bring the haughty empires of the perfians and nazareens to truckle to the feet of the grand seignior  england which among the kingdoms of the nazareens i just now named to thee to have already suffered changes and revolutions has suffered now about two years ago a greater change than any of those for ages before for they have deposed their rightful lord and emperor and have by the assistance of a dutch prince called the prince of orange driven their king not only from his throne but out of his dominions and we see him here as a forsaken afflicted man taking sanctuary in the court of his neighboring monarch and soliciting him for help  the king of france has always been vain of having his court called the asylum or refuge of distressed princes and has often espoused the cause of such to a degree which has been heavy upon himself and yet has so happily managed for such princes that many of them first or last have been effectually restored as was the case in the house of braganza now the royal house of portugal several italian and german princes and others but he has had no luck with entertaining kings of england for when he entertained once the brother of this prince many years ago when exiled by his rebellious people he found himself obliged by the usurper to desire him civilly to withdraw out of his dominions again  but he has so effectually espoused this prince as to enter into a very terrible war in his behalf in which the interest of the person i mentioned who was prince of orange but is now solemnly crowned king of england has been such among the other princes of europe that the greatest part of christendom as they call it is entered into a confederacy against the french king and last year it was thought would have bidden fair for his ruin  not that i believe now they will all be able together to master him especially if the arms of the invincible port do continue with success to divert the power of germany from falling in with the rest for the armies of france are infinitely numerous and this years campaign has given a new turn to their affairs their cavalry which indeed must be esteemed the best in these parts of europe are exceeding fine and are led on by the most enterprizing daring officers in these parts of the world and they again directed by generals of the utmost experience nor have they ever yet come to any decisive battle wherein the french troops have not gained both the glory and the field and that chiefly by help of their horse  it is true the now king of england as they call him is a prince that will never give it over and that by his interest his policy and his alliances appears every year stronger and stronger even after the most bloody battles and engagements  this will not be the case in france for though the number of his officers is inexhaustible and if a thousand officers were killed in a battle which has been the case more than once yet there are such numbers of gentlemen in his army ready to supply their places equal in bravery and experience to those that fall in the battle that the loss is not felt  nay some have said that it is a convenience to him that there may be room to gratify the infinite numbers of depending gentlemen whose families expect to rise by the good fortune of their relations in the army  but it is not the same with respect to the common soldiers especially the infantry for as most of the infantry are foreigners of all nations especially germans english irish and scots and all those countries are now leagued against france if these old veterane troops are once broken and destroyed by long service he cannot supply them again but with native french who though the cavalry are good beyond compare yet the common people are small weak bodies and not able to cope with the strong heavy bodied troops of the northern nations  whoever therefore lives to see this war end if it holds on many years as it is like to do will see the french infantry grow worse and worse by service whereas the troops of other nations grow better and better the reason is because they cannot be recruited with men of the same nations and of the same bravery and ability as they were made up of before  but however as things are now stated the king of france seems to make himself terrible to all the confederates grows upon them in every campaign and is continually surprising towns and countries from them by being earlier in the field than their armies can be gotten together so that he often forms a seige in the beginning of the year and takes the place and lets his army go into quarters again before the troops of the confederates which are to be fetched from the several countries where they are gone to quarter can be in the field  paris   th of the  th moon of the year    0

consequence  but i shall furnish thee with matters of weight only till i have thy farther instructions know then that this has been a year of blood among the followers of the hebrew prophet and innumerable armies have been mowed down by the sword of divine vengeance in the hands of ambition and revenge  never did any age since the beginning of the ottoman greatness offer so fair an occasion for the glory of the followers of mahomet to extend it self over the whole world the animosity among these nazareens is so great and they pursue one another with such implacable fury that it looks as if they were firmly resolved never to have peace with one another any more but were to root those they quarrel with from the face of the earth  the french are now at war with the germans as the grand seignior also is and this war is carried on with such cruelty and rage that nothing is more grateful to them here than to hear of the victories which the mussulmans armies get over the germans and though jesus the son of mary is their own prophet too yet when thousands of his followers are cut down by the sword of mahomet they boast and rejoice in the news albeit at other times they style the faithful mussulmans their common enemies  last year the french power seemed to be overmatchd the confederacy which is formed against them was so formidable that they said it would be no dishonor to lewis xiv to yield since no man was born to fight all the world and yet this year as if he coveted a war with mankind he has engaged a new enemy against him viz the duke of savoy who calls for at least  0000 men to be employed against him were it only to act upon the defensive  it is however surprising to see that with all these enemies in confederacy against him he has even this year turned the scale of fortune on his side in every part of the world on the rhine his generals have kept the field and encamped in their enemies country raising contributions and causing his army to subsist at the expense of the enemy in flanders the dutch army has been defeated under count waldeck by the duke of luxemburg at the great battle of fleuri or flerus  likewise at sea the french fleet has been superior both to the english and dutch two nations who in distinction are called the maritime powers the french have brought into the sea a fleet of  0 sail of the line a number superior to what ever yet was seen in the channel and with this fleet commanded by monsieur tourville they fairly fought both the english and dutch fleet united on the english coast off of beachy and got the advantage having several men of war of the dutch burnt stranded or sunk and three taken  only in ireland the prince of orange has been victorious king james has had the misfortune to be beaten at the boyn and is come back into france for shelter while the next letters i may write may send thee an account that he is so far from being successful that he has nothing of that personal bravery which the world knows is necessary to a king for they all say here that though his army retired the loss was but small and he was under no necessity of abandoning them by such a precipitant flight  but to return to the german empire  doubtless the advantages gained by the germans over the children of the faithful for the last  0 years must be from the anger of god upon the mussulmans empire for their sins or must be the effect of the ill conduct of the grand seigniors generals we shall see different effects will follow different conduct the new grand vizier is a man who well knows how to rectify the mistakes of his predecessors and is far from being afraid to look his enemies in the face  now is the time to retrieve the glory of the ottoman arms when a martial general is at the head of the grand seigniors armies and the german empire is laid hard at on this side so that they can neither spare the troops or the generals for the defense of hungary as they did before  paris   th of the  th moon

heaven it self singles out in the secret decrees of inscrutable providence the agents and instruments of its own work qualifying those instruments for the business and end in which they were decreed to be employed know thou then my kinsman and son of my blood that by thy accepting this secular employment thou have let us know that mahomet has rejected thee as one not worthy to repeat the holy

soul to the shining gate of bliss where thy fathers fathers to a hundred generations should have received thee with music and dances and where all the happy generations of thy ancestors would have rejoiced over thee  now i esteem thee as lost and if thou by thy humiliation and the prayers of mahomet should arrive at the garden of joy thou shall nevertheless be received there as one who had cast thy self out by thy own choice had rejected thy own felicity and wast recovered by the compassionate interposition of those more worthy than thy self and shall have the lowest place among the blessed

to the perfect judge mirror of vprightness and distributer of justice to the faithful morat ebbuchebb kadilesker of salonicha and the isles i have been searching the books of the ancient doctors of

two hundred and seventy mysteries and the rules of wisdom left written with a pen of emerald in the holy mountain of ghazuan in arabia and i have not been without deep contemplations from the inspirations which our great prophet mahomet has afforded to my    prayers a day which i used without ceasing for   months to know the reason why the infidels and cursed among the nazareens are permitted to triumph over the faithful and take from us cities wherein mosques have been built for the prayers of the mussulmans to god and his prophet  i have first found and am assured that the pilgrimages enjoined by the first commands of our religion have not been performed so that our great prophet not having been duly honored by the guides of the faithful and the servants of the mighty emperor having been permitted to transgress the laws of their fathers the indignation of god is justly fallen upon them  i have likewise found that throughout the whole mussulmans empire the commands of the one god have been transgressed in a manner which has never been since the alcoran came down from heaven or since mahomet took possession of the seat of beauty in the garden  i am informed by inspiration from the three spirits which sit on the top of jathrib on the banks of the sacred river chahiber that the mussulmans are secretly addicted to wine which is forbidden them by their fathers and by the written law  i swear to thee by the heary scalp of thy father aleb and thy grandfather raleb beloved by mahomet and favorites of men as thou art kadilesker and judge of the country round

thou shall no longer preside over the isles of the arches  put strictly in execution the laws of mahomet iv the just and invincible lawgiver and emperor and cause not only the cabarets or taverns of the greeks to be shut up but even destroy thou their vineyards from whence the cursed evaporation is drawn that the laws of sobriety be not broken under thy government and the offense be laid at thy

of the year    0 letter xix to the kaimacham i wish thou were to see as i do in this place how the french esteem the german troops which nevertheless they tell me are the terror of the ottoman cavalry it grieves me to hear how those infidels continually boast of defeating the spahis and timariots the ancient cavalry of the mussulman empire invincible and terrible from the east to the west while the same german regiments though armed with curiasses fighting against the naked french horse are cut in pieces pushed into rivers and morasses and in a word are made the scorn of the world believe me it cannot be the virtue or courage of the men it must lie in the ignorance and want of experience of the officers  the new vizier wants not that i should tell him how weak a body the best soliders in the world are in the field if led on by unexperienced officers if an army of hares with a lion to their general was esteemed by the ancients of more use tham an army of lions with a hare to their general then the placing unexperienced officers at the head of the best and bravest cavalry of the east is nothing less or more than a sacrificing the bravest men in the east to the fury of their barbarous enemies  the german horse i assure thee are far from being terrible on this side the world the gensdarmefrie of the french king which are part of the household troops here as the spahis or janissaries are of the grand seigniors have frequently charged the curiassiers of the emperor sword in hand and not fired a shot at them driving them out of the field not valuing their iron caps back and breast  indeed it is very seldom that the germans cae to stand their fury at the late battle in flanders fought on the plains of fleuri the light horse of the french army called carabineers broke    squadrons of german horse called lunenburghers and brandenburghers by the mere shock of their charge and the good management of their horses and never fired upon them till they were in plain rout  how comes it then that our spahis who are the most exquisite managers of their horses and have the best horses in the world are yet so often driven back by the infidels i shall give thee one piece of advice in this case which as thou have a martial genius thou will not fail to accept for the grand seigniors service the horses of barbary turcomania and natolia are of the finest make the most beautiful in shape full of mettle and courage of any in the otteman empire but they are not equal in strength to the courser and heavier horses of holstein of saxony and switzerland of flanders and of england from all which places the germans draw the heavy horses they now use this weight of horseflesh is the advantage in battle as the manner of fighting is now used in these parts  it was about the second moon of the last year called february that the king of france reviewed the cavalry of his household at compeigne a town on the frontiers toward flanders and as the king with the duke of luxemburgh caused the gens d arms to march by his coach he took notice that many of their officers were mounted upon the finest spanish jennets and barbs that could be seen  it was usual every year that the troops were ordered to march immediately to flanders from the review in that place but after this review the king ordered them to quarters which greatly surprised them but they understood it better when an order came the next day from the marshall boufflers that the officers of the gens d arms should all change their horses and should be all mounted upon stronger horses and  0 days time was given them to furnish themselves which was easily done in that part of the country and it was but two months after when a jest was put upon the household troops and the guards viz that all the gens d arms were mounted upon coach horses  but they soon found the advantage in action for adding the size of the horses to the courage and bravery of the men who are all chosen out of the best soldiers in the army they became a new sort of people and it is seen now for no troops can stand before them  were the grand seigniors cavalry thus mounted the germans could not cope with them but as it is now they tell one another here that the spahis are mounted to pursue not to sight if they had said to run away not to fight i could not contradict them for my business is to hear and see and say nothing but i say would the grand vizier mount his troops with the large heavy horses of thracia and macedonia of trapesond and the mountains of bosan and mingrelia though they seem fitter to draw the cannon than mount the troopers yet the advantage of it would soon be found in the field of battle  thou know i am no man of war but as i see this practice made use of here so much to advantage by men of experience thou may find reason to make use of the advice as a secret for the service of the grand seignior  paris the  th day of the  th moon of the year    0 letter xx to kara humaizoth ungwar a searcher of ancient knowledge a learned aged emir of tacsebbassara in arabia it is with inexpressible joy i look back upon those few days of my youth which i spent in thy arms thou who were a fountain of wisdom and instruction from thine infancy the knowledge not of the language of the hebrew so much as of the learning of the hebrews was thy first study and i am not ignorant of the perfection thou art arrived to in so many years application i know that no humane understanding can reach what thou art master of in the traditional wisdom of the prophets and rabbis of ancient times  how ignorant are the literati of these parts of the world in this particular that they think none of the ages or nations contemporary with moses and the elders were partakers with them of sacred knowledge or had communicated to them any part of the divine institutions which the jews call the written law  is it possible that these men should pass by the many ages of wisdom in which the arabians who were for a thousand years the wisest people upon earth and from whom the egyptians borrowed their learning and knowledge flourished as well in heavenly as in humane studies we are not without testimonies irrefragable that god revealed himself in diverse manners and through the administration of diverse persons besides those vocal legislations and awful appearances of mount sinai mentioned in the writings of moses called the pentateuch even the jews themselves confess that their great prophet moses wandered forty years in foreign countries from whence he returned fraught with wisdom and knowledge as well as with a wife and a stock of sons with which he was blessed in that country which country we know was on the back of the desert and inhabited by the tribes of midian all at that time not only under the subjection of the arabian power but partakers with them in their knowledge and wisdom for which they were at that time famous through all the nations of the earth  it is observable that even the jews themselves when they would set forth the great judgment and understanding of their lawgiver moses they say he was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians whereas we likewise know that the great teachers of science and instructers of the southsayers of egypt were arabians and that the source of all their knowledge came orginally from dharajara gurbelhumar and jabin halfarecha the most ancient doctors of arabia far elder than omer and zebdanna under the teachings of whom the soothsayers magicians and other wise men of egypt had their studies and went into the southermost parts of arabia foelix to hear and learn instruction from them so that for moses to be learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians was neither less or more than to be a pupil of the pupils of the ancient most learned arabians in whom the perfections of knowledge in the first ages of time were treasured up and from them extended all over the world particularly from arabia to egypt by the doctors and learned or wise men of those times from thence by the learning of moses to the jews and by other hands to the sages of the east from whom the grecians viz the philosophers of athens and of other grecian countries handed down and improved humane knowledge to the romans and to all the other nations of the world  i cannot sage register of humane knowledge pass over here the confession of the jews and the testimony they give to the truth i assert viz that the wisdom and knowledge as well divine as humane which was entrusted from heaven with mankind in those first post diluvian ages as they are called was committed immediately and in a more than ordinary portion to the arabians above all the nations of the world  this i say the jews acknowledge in publishing to the world among the books which they call sacred the book or story of job the patient this book is not only graced with being written in the most sublime style that the hebrew language was ever written in and by which it appears that the ancient hebrew was preserved in its highest purity and dignity of expression but it gives undoubted testimony to this great principle viz that god revealed himself from heaven to the arabians for by the confession of all the geographers in the world job and his three friends were arabians i say that god revealed himself from heaven to the arabians in the like and perhaps every way as glorious a manner as he did afterward to the other posterity of abraham the israelites  the whole tenor of that book which they call of job intimates strongly a supremacy of divine and natural knowledge infinite transcendencies of wisdom shine in every part of it all rational and supernatural powers are exerted in the significancy of expression the pungency of replies the beauty of style the vivacity of expression in the arguings of his friends and the sufferings of himself all generous principles are urged acted and improved the most passionate expostulations that can be conceived break out from the mouth of the grave patriarch under his strong pressures as from a spirit overwhelmed yet tied down to the principles of humility resignation penitence and all the graces of a religious mind and all these appear in a resplendent manner even unutterable in any language since that time known in the world nay even unutterable in the very same language by any other mouth  no example like it can ever be produced through the whole history of time among the jews even by their own confession now job by all the descriptions that can be given was an inhabitant of the land of uz this uz is according to their own doctors a country denominated from uz the grandson of noah by his eldest son shem whose posterity multiplying after their coming out of the ark extended themselves southward into the most

undertaken and the victories gained by the french over the german emperor and his allies i say is it not strange i should sit still here perfectly ignorant of either the fate or the history of what is doing in my own country and among my own kindred  how comes it to pass that thou who art the right hand to him who is the right hand of councils and keeps the secrets of the mighty empire should not inform me at this distance of the great turns in the administration since the last year how the new vizier has been exalted and how to show himself illustrious and great in action as in council he has restored victory to the arms of the grand seignior by fighting the battle of nissa and cutting in pieces above   000 of the infidel troop  it is true i hear all this and am able to send thee particulars which thou know not of but this is owing to the intelligence i keep in the courts and councils of princes who are enemies to the grand seignior and therefore cannot always prevail with themselves to speak the truth  besides have thou no sympathetick sense of the joys or griefs of an absent parent that would be to suppose that thou have none of the blood of thy fathers brother in thee or that he and i having the same father and mother thou had still no part of us communicated by generation though by the laws of nature which change not the volatile particles of thy blood maintain an invisible correspondence with those of thy fathers father who was my father whereby thou inheritest the same passions temper fire and phlegm and shall act in consonance to the humor and constitution of us that went before thee even involuntarily and by a natural force of sympathetick powers which thou may not perceive  by the same rule thou art of necessity inspired with the generous principles of thy grandfather and can not be unmindful of thy fathers image who is now though thus distant and remote the nearest parent to thee in blood and in whose affection thou have so great a share that by sympathy it is impossible for us to be unconcerned in the griefs or joys of one another which griefs or joys though unknown to either are communicated by the invisible converse of spirits  whence else is it that involuntary sadness seizes thy heart at times when perhaps thou see nothing near thee but what is the subject of pleasure and joy at that moment doubt it not the soul of thy dearest parent mahmut here at this vast distance suffers grief perhaps from distempers of the body torture of the mind disappointment affliction or some latent cause of sorrow unknown to thee  by the same secret influence i feel secret impulses of joy by a sudden spring of spirits through my blood which lifts up the soul above grief above all the reach of humane accidents and above even my power of expressing i conclude then thou or some yet nearer relation perhaps my mother thy grandmother receive some advancement some smiles from the sublime majesty of the grand seignior some uncommon token of prosperity which is thus communicated to me by the inconceivable power of sympathetick influence and the free intercourse of spirits thou know not perhaps how to express this or at all times to distinguish it but assure thy self if thou lissen vigilantly to the voice of this silent instruction thou shall always find in thy self secret intimations of all the good or evil that attends either thee or thy family  i return to my first complaint the invisible correspondence of our souls will communicate things particular to our selves but there is not the same conveyance of things public and affecting our country for though affection to our country may carry us high yet there is no secret sympathy nothing mutual between us there we are not of the same species or modeled in the same mould of nature with our governors whereas the channels of blood in relatives come from the same spring partake of the same temperament and receive motion from the same principles  i conjure thee by the blood in thy veins springing from the great fountain of guebirava in arabia the source of our generation by the graves of our ancestors buried under the hill abirjuvan by the head of thy father and the right hand of thy mother that thou forget me not in this exile but communicate to me of thy welfare and of all the public affairs of the mussulmans empire to which may all prosperity be given

the consternation of the infidels at the success of the faithful  the french partake of our joy the war against the emperor being of great advantage to them it is by their means that i have a true account of the glorious successes of the ottoman forces over the germans they tell me the grand vizier has taken nissa in consequence of the battle near that place wherein the germans lost seven princes and  000 men of their best troops that the serasquier ibrahim has taken the fort of piroth on the river moraw and the town of widin on the danube so that all the province of servia is cleared of the germans who are driven to the gates of belgrade  at the same time that they were expecting accounts of the farther progress of the ever victorious vizier they received an account another way of a yet more terrible blow given the germans by count teckli the hungarian malecontent who assisted by a body of the grand seigniors troops attacked general heister in his camp near the port du fer or the iron gate being a pass through the mountains of transylvania the german general had  000 foot and  000 horse of the imperial troops with  000 heydukes and  000 transilvanian foot but were attacked with such fury by count teckelis foot backed with a body of janissaries that they were entirely defeated and so complete was the victory that not  00 of the germans have escaped being cut in pieces general heister himself is taken and all the other general officers killed or taken  these things i do not write to thee to inform thee who have without dispute long ago the truest and first account from the grand vizier himself and have communicated the joy of it with the whole body of the faithful but i write to let thee know also the influence these successes of the invincible ottomans have on these parts of the world the french rejoice the neutral princes stand in a kind of surprise but the germans are every where in the greatest consternation imaginable not doubting but the victorious crescents will spread like a torrent and in a little time regain the whole kingdom of hungary and unravel all the conquests of their great hero the duke of lorain nor would the consternation be much greater if the grand seigniors armies were at the gates of vienna than it will be if the grand vizier should take belgrade which i will not doubt  happy be the days and prosperous the hands of the faithful may the vigilant and undaunted leader of the imperial armies of mahomet go on successfully to the end of his wishes and fulfill all the expectations of the grand seignior and of all that wish the prosperity of the mussulmans empire  but give mahmut leave to expostulate with thee in this part and to complain that i have here no information in these things however important but what i receive from the hands of strangers and from the public printed papers handed about among the infidels wherein such is the spirit of falsehood that reigns among these pretenders to uprightness that they report every thing their own way and just as they would have it be  if a victory is obtained by any of their armies whether it be one side or other they oftentimes on one hand magnify the particulars and reckon up the numbers of the killed and wounded to be more than the party defeated really had in their army and if you hear the story again from those who were beaten you fail not to lessen the number of the armies and to give an account of the action as if very few were killed wounded or taken prisoners so that oftentimes we find many more prisoners to ransom by a great many than were really taken in the fight  i that fail not always to supply the office of secretary of state with needful and full intelligence of things done in these remote parts of the world ought not to be kept ignorant of our own affairs or in what manner to represent the figure which our illustrious emperor makes in the history of the times  it weakens me in the judgment i am to make of things when i know not how they go and i am not able to make just representations or give true ideas of things to those i converse secretly with if i know not how things go at the illustrious port wherefore i entreat you let me be as at first fully informed of every thing so shall i be enabled to give right council and right advices of all matters  paris   th of the  d moon of the year      letter xxiii to solomon hagzani oglou aga of the janissaries i have received thy welcome letter which is the more so because it signifies to me in so many words that this express is sent me by the particular order of the grand seignior himself the words were no sooner sounded by my voice but without being able to read any farther i turned my face toward the happy shades of mecca and blessed the memory of our great prophet mahomet washing my self with water and making my prayers in form as for the greatest occasion that could befall me and which commanded worship and thanksgiving with the highest reverence and joy of a true believer  kings the mortal gods on earth acting by the same methods of justice and benignity as the mighty sovereign of the world though in a different proportion command the same reverence and homage in a due proportion likewise from those upon whom they please to shine  it is not a common thankfulness which such beams of favor command from subjects the benignity is of a sacred original the homage partakes of the sublime and next to our adoration of the one god father of life and the rewarder of the true believers our most perfect submissions and most prostrate affections are due to the shining glory of our imperial benefactor image of glory and supreme fountain of splendour upon earth the mirror of illustrious light and the true representative of inconceivable brightness  this duty i perform from my soul i am exalted to a sublime joy unequalled by any thing on this side the lden gates of paradise i am lifted up in rasies of inward delights unexpressible and m a fountain flowing streams of pure affection obedience and unbiased duty to the interest service and person of the great lord of the kings of the globe the emperor of the faithful  it is a heaven on this side paradise to serve so glorious a master to die in his service is to inherit the brightest circle of eden and to be transported immediately into the garden of inexpressible delight  our immortal sultan has not a more faithful slave in the extent of his unbounded empire than mahmut who has served with an inviolable fidelity almost fifty years in a station equally unhappy as unpleasant but it is more than a reward to all those services that i am at last favored with having my name mentioned by the mouth of him who is clothed with glory and overshadowed with the light of the eternal benediction  the sum of money thou have likewise sent me by bills upon the banquier of the french ambassador at the port however great my necessities are is in no comparison equal to the solace of thy letter as being sent by order of the emperor of the world  i prostrate my self on the ground and kiss the happy dust at the feet of our resplendent emperor offering up ten thousand prayers for the eternal felicity of the beloved of god and i demand of thee to do justice to mahmut in returning the most submissive acknowledgments of a devoted slave  but after all this had lifted up my soul beyond the power of its conceiving and i stood dumb and mute as one in a trance dazzled with the glory of the great sultans favor i was yet farther surpised with the happy news of the progress of the victorious arms of our emperor under the leading of the grand vizier in hungaria and the amazing account of the recovering the fortress of belgrade out of the hands of the infidel germans so much good news together was too much for an old man to bear and fainting under the weight of exuberant joy i made good that saying of the ancients viz that sudden joys like griefs confound at first   it has been a pain to me illustrious and happy solomon that i have been obliged to keep my letters thus long in return to thine which came to me with such expedition that i had contrary to all the usage of such things the news of the taking of belgrade from thy hand before it arrived here by expresses from vienna the swift chaioux who brought on the wings of joy the pleasing news to the emperor brought a blessing from mahomet with the report of a victory fair winds and a quick passage joined to disperse the tidings to all the world the vessel which brought the happy account past with a surprising pace and performed in seven days her voyage from the happy port the center of circling commerce to marseilles from whence the post brought me thy letters in nine days more by land i understand since that the english ship which carried the same news to smyrna and alexandria had so happy a passage that she performed the first in four days and the other in eleven more scarce would the air have handed on the thunder of the blast from belgrade so far and so soon when the magazines of powder were blown up could the incessant vibrations of air have been continued to the distance i speak of  happy blast that has transferred into the hands of the grand seignior a city engrafted into his empire in which were nine and fifty mosques consecrated to mahomet and not longer by the whole power of earth to be detained out of the possession of the just  it is possible for thee to exceed my joy in this place because thou partakest of the pleasures of the serail and see the smiles of the illustrious port upon this occasion but it is impossible for thee to see and indeed to entertain any idea of the consternation which the enemies of mahomet and of the invincible sultan are under upon this occasion  they are not only astonished at the loss but at the manner of it how one bomb directed by heaven should fall so into one magazine as not only to blow that particular place up but from thence to communicate its fire to the reserved coverts of all the magazines in the place and transverse the whole city this amazes them and they see clearly that heaven fightsagainst them that the faithful mussulmen are predestined to be lords of the universe and it is to no purpose to lift up the hand against the beloved of heaven  paris   th of the  d moon of the year      letter xxiv to morat abdomozar ephiesman oglou a student in the law of mahomet thou that have spent thy years in the study of the mysterious vision and art master of the secret interpretation tell me where will the superstition of the nazareens end who while they pretend to be the most devout among the servants of the messiah are the busiest people in the world to persuade themselves out of all sense of religion in the world  where sleeps eternal justice and how far may nations strive with heaven insult the being of the god of nature and call aloud for the just retribution of their crimes and yet slow vengeance not be prevailed with to exert its power and to destroy them no not at their own request  what is the punishment righteous morat if any mussulman should be so far degenerate as to deny the being of the great one god what says our great prophet whose law teaches upright things  i know thou will answer as the philosopher lycurgus the lawgiver of the grecians did when it was asked him why he had appointed no punishment for parricide viz that it was a crime not to be named among his citizens and therefore needless to be enacted or provided against  sure of all the religions that were ever erected by the wit of men and of all the gods that have been adored among the heathen never any people deviated into these disputes about them before all the idolatrous nations in the world have retained this as a first principle nulla gens tam barbara quae nescit esse deum  but the nazareens the worshipers of the messiah have run such divisions among themselves and raised so many quarrels about religion that they are at last willing to think they have been all along in the dark and that there is no such thing as religion in the world or any such thing as a god to be worshipped in a word they have phylosophizd so long about their god and how to call him that they have quite lost him and are daily questioning among one another whether there really is any such thing or no in the world  nothing is more certain than the vanity and perplexity of schooldisputes men may distinguish themselves into and out of any opinion or religion in the world but among all the sorts of infidels that ever infested the world these christians as they would be called are arrived to the highest pitch of infidelity for they are now come to resolve all religion to be a politic cheat notions of a god to be a craft of the schoolmen and in a word to deny the beginning and end of all things  these men are arrived to a degree of crime which lucifer the great angel and prince of the dark abode never pretended to the extensive knowledge of devils forbids that they should once suggest to themselves the nonexistence of that being whose power they feel in pungent torture invincible and inconceivable nor are there any atheists in the islands of perdition those who have passed the gulf into the abyss of plagues and darkness are too well convinced by their miseries of the reality of that being which they before denied  but it is in vain to talk to these men who nothing but the sables of tophet can undeceive they laugh at the local prisons despise being subject to torment ridicule the notions of a god a future state and all that which wise and good men believe concerning rewards and punishments it is of no force to tell them they outsin the devil and that the king of the eternal pit believes nay knows with horror the beatitudes which he is excluded from for they believe as little of a hell as they do of a heaven and own no devil any more than they do a god  divine morat this is a sin not to be named or to be found among mussulmen it is the just distinction of the righteous that they are believers that they know there is one god that he is but one and that mahomet is his prophet  all the celestial chapters of the alcoran that divine oracle which came down from heaven are introduced in the name of god gracious and merciful we are therefore called the faithful mussulmen because believing in one god to raze out the name and belief of god out of the mind is to apostatize from our faith and as it were to become a christian for among them only are atheists to be found among them alone are to be found men vested with reasoning powers and faculties yet denying the being of him by whose gift they enjoy those powers  by mahomet by the graves of omar ekkbutar and the forefathers of the holy mirza muhamed the beginning and first fruits of the faithful i swear if these men had been living in the days of our great prophet the alcoran should have had five chapters of curses and execrations against the wickedest of all wickedness i mean this of denying the being of a god a crime against nature against common sense against demonstration against invincible testimony of ages past in a word against the secret conviction of the minds of those who are guilty scarce a man of them being without such testimonies of their own consciences within in behalf of the eternal god that made them that in spite of the most hardened resolution it reproaches them and when they suggest no god replies thou fool  paris  0th of the   th moon of the year    0 letter xxv to the prince of the servants of god guide of the faithful mirror of wisdom and council the venerable esad high in the favor of the grand seignior and our great prophet mahomet though it is not the most agreeable thing in the world to write to thee of war and of fighting who art the lamp of truth and the guide to peace yet the story of daring virtue taking arms in their hands for truth and right is so much within thy sphere that i cannot doubt it will be pleasing to thee  the duke of savoy an enterprizing prince and one who has too long fallen into the french methods of government or rather religious tyranny over his subjects had some years ago banished an innocent inoffensive and gallant people out of his dominions because of their refusing to comply with some of the ceremonies and formalities of the worship of that part of the nazareen profession called catholic or roman  these people were inhabitants of the valleys situate among the most inaccessible parts of the alpine mountains those stupendous hills do not like our caucasus or mount hemus run on in a continued ridge and chain of rocks but they often break off abrupt and standing up in high pyramidical precipices and inaccessible steeps leave intervals of the deepest valleys which being thus walled about by unpassable hills are indeed natural fortifications of themselves the inlets into these are so difficult and in some parts so impracticable that  00 men have been known to be able to defend one of them against ten thousand but when one is entered though the hills and mountains with which they are surrounded seem to touch the stars yet the valleys are the most agreeable pleasant fruitful and habitable places imaginable  the people of these valleys are a painful honest industrious people also daring and brave to the last degree subjects generally to the king of france or the duke of savoy till one comes further north when the vales are larger and more populous being the remainders of the ancient helvetians conquered by julius caesar and now called the swiss cantons  these vaudois so they are called from the pais de vaux or valleys are not only of the sect of the nazareens called protestants but they boast that they embraced the christian religion from the pure and primitive times of it when it must be confessed the pure doctrine of jesus the son of mary was more sincerely adhered to than it has been since the papal hierarchy for since that it has been corrupted with traditions innovations and humane inventions till it is quite degenerated into a mass of error and superstition  the duke of savoy had as i said banished these people out of their habitations taken from them their substance estates habitations and even from some their children driving them to seek their bread in foreign countries where the charity of other people might support them in this condition they fled to geneva and the swiss cantons being the neighboring helvetia which i just now named where they were well received harbored relieved and permitted as well as assisted to settle nor had they any view of being restored especially while the french and savoyard acted against the protestant interest in concert with one another  but now seeing the world embarrassed in war and not so good an understanding between the french and the duke of savoy as used to be but rather a prospect of worse they formed one of the most desperate and difficult designs among themselves that for such a handful of men to undertake was ever heard of viz to force their way back to their own habitations sword in hand and to resolve to dwell there in defiance of the duke their lord and persecutor  the duke had notice of it and took all possible precaution against it which added to the difficulty for they had therefore in consequence several detachments of forces to encounter in the way besides the unsurmountable difficulty of want of provisions carriages money or troops and the exceeding length and roughnessof the way  but all this did not discourage them from making the attempt which they set on foot with all the secrecy and executed with all the vigor and success imaginable so that the world are even surprised at the relation of it which take as follows for it is well worth thy hearing  they had some friends and the swiss at least those cantons professing the same opinions in religion winked at them if they did not assist them but the principal encouragement they had was from the new king of england from whom it was said they received  00000 livres to furnish them with arms and provisions encouraged with which supplies and hopes of greater assistance they carried on the design with wonderful secrecy  the particular number which was to have removed was actually three thousand as i have seen by their lists but he that was to have paid their money not having allowed them time sufficient for such a number there was not above half were ready against the day prefixed for their departure  nevertheless the design being blown abroad about twelve hundred that were in a posture to march resolved to stay no longer for fear of meeting obstacles in their way to this purpose they crossed the lake of geneva in the night unperceived by the savoyards so that they had time to get a shore to range themselves in order of battle and send four hundred men to invest two neighboring villages before they were discovered upon this the savoyards took the alarm and were running to ring their bells backward but being threatened with fire and sword they let them pass and furnished them with necessaries for their money they crossed the river arva without molestation in regard they had been so wary as to send away a detachment to make sure of the pass but though they met with no trouble at the beginning they found enough afterward for the courts of savoy and france being informed of their motion did all they could to stop them in several narrow and dangerous passes through which they were obliged to force their way however they surmounted all these difficulties still cutting their passage through their enemies with the edge of their swords they endured the brunt of four or five skirmishes of which the sharpest was their encounter with the marquis of larre who would needs put a stop to them near a place called salbertran having along with him for that purpose a regiment of dragoons and a good number of the militia nevertheless after a smart conflict wherein they lost some men they forced the passage as they had done the rest the marquis was mortally wounded several other officers lost their lives and above two hundred french soldiers were slain afterward having vanquished all opposition they arrived happily in their own country from whence they chaced the old catholics but now inhabitants and found great plenty of all things necessary for humane support those of the valley of pragelas though subjects of france and the new converts received them with open arms and now bring them whatever they stand in need of  after this several bodies of them attempted to follow their friends particularly one of   00 men but were so unfortunate as to be repulsed in several skirmishes and obliged at last to retire  sage prince of sublime thoughts thou will see here how far zeal carries the professors of any religion whether true or false to push even to desperation and death according to a famous expression of an english writer who was well known to have as much wit and as little religion as any of the modern profligates of his time as follows zeal makes men fight like mad or drunk for dame religion as for punk   with how much purer flame does the zeal of the faithful burn which carries them on the wings of sage councils

dervice of adrianople his friend at length i have received the joyful tidings that the request i have been twenty years making to the divan and which my friends have earnestly solicited for me through the ministry of eleven grand viziers has been granted viz that i shall be recalled from this state of exile and have leave to see once more the shining valley and the glorious gates of himza the blessed the emblem of the heavenly eden and the shadow of paradise  rejoice with me o ye my friends who know net what it is to be excluded near fifty years from all the delights of earth and views of heaven what it is to be damned on earth to the society of infidels and enemies of mahomet  the blessing of aroa mahan the light of paradise the shining of the golden gate on the inaccessible mountain of sephar the wing of the archangel and the musical thunder of the valley of beauty rest on thee happy mustapha and on thy brother orchanes omar and on the graves of thy kindred for ever for the indefatigable pains thou and he also has taken to purchase thy friend mahmut this deliverance  how happy shall we be when we shall anticipate even paradise it self and embrace together in a mutual band of indissoluble friendship o that blessed seraphick word which so few understand and so many make use of here to supplant undermine and betray one another  thou have added to my ecstasies also in telling me that at my arrival at the happy port thou will accompany me in the conclusion of life and we shall make the last tour of the world together in a devout pilgrimage to the tomb of our miraculous prophet where a vision of eden shall inspire us with continual raptures and we shall insensibly drop away into paradise as in a transport of joy the fire of the cave shall translate us wrapped in the fume of inexpressible odors till we awake in paradise embracing still and in the arms of one another be carried into the brightest regions of beauty and bliss  i am coming my friend i am coming nay i am with you wrapped up already in the joy of hope every night my slumbers are crowned with visions of our joy i embrace thee in the dark and even when asleep i partake of the felicity already by the anticipation of the pleasant dream  if this joy increases upon me i know not how long humane nature may find it self able to bear the weight who knows the power of insupportable felicity it is a certain testimony that we are to be something else than what we now are before we can be capable of receiving the full stream of the joys of paradise believe me mustapha the soul as now contracted in an embodied state is no more capable of the joys of paradise without a change of all its powers and even of the extent of its whole frame than it is of supporting the torments of the gulf which burn but consume not  if by the mere entertainingthe first conceptions of the joy of my approaching bliss i am scarce able to know whether i am in a state of life or a state of eternal possession if the ecstasy is so penetrating and so forcible that i sometimes know not whether i am awake or in sleep embodied or unembodied to what height of rapture may a farther vision of the shining vale carry me and why may not this ferment of the soul thrust it forcibly out of the body as a cask of wine bursts the strongest bands for want of vent and though hoopd with iron cannot be kept within its former limits or as dilated air bursts even the fiercest mountains on the fortuitous meeting of the sulphurous and nitrous particles in which it was imprisoned  believe me mustapha the joy i conceive at my approaching remove is often too great for me to contain sometimes it vents it self in exclamations of joy sometimes in the most frantic gestures of a lunatic sometimes it breaks out at the eyes and abates its weighty pressure in a flood not tears of grief but of inexpressible exultation it is impossible to describe to thee the waking visions and the sleeping discourses i have of these things i talk all the night to the angels of eden to the porter at the gate of the wondrous grotto and to the enlightened spirits inhabiting the eternal mansions of paradise i durst not let any servant of this country sleep near me least he should hear me bless the exalted prophet and praise the gates of mecca in my nocturnal transports  when i am awake i am still in vision i dream walking every distant prospect every remote view of the pleasant hills which this country abounds with represent paradise the hill of joy the ascending turrets of adonizuna the mountains surrounding the plains of blessedness and the valley of unutterable pleasure in a word mustapha i am all rapture all ecstasy and it is impossible for me to hold more joy till mahomet inspires me with new capacities and forms my soul into a new and more extended mould  in the mean time i will tell thee from experience that it is the most unhappy part of life to be without a friend to unbosome the secrets of the soul to joy and grief are in themselves passions too strong for humane nature to restrain the embodied man is not equal to their bulk and can hold but a small part of them if he is obliged to keep them in the narrow bounds of his own thoughts and has no liberty to give them vent by the tongue they will stifle and overwhelm even life it self must sink under the weight and the soul would hasten the nearest way through that abyss to pass to the regions of light of which she her self is a native  the philosophers here entertain us with scruples concerning the souls passing the infinite inconceivable space which we call abyss being the gulf placed between time and eternity and from thence argue themselves into notions as absurd in philosophy as those they have in religion and as that of a plurality or family of gods after they have told us how far the celestial constellations of light move from one another that even the planets are some of them  00 to  00 millions of miles from this lower planet the earth and that yet they are far nearer to us than they are to the lowest of the other fixed stars above them that those other fixed stars are still placed in advanced stations above one another every stage infinitely distant from one another in space the vacancies of which abyss afford space sufficient for the mighty commets which moving in parabolas and excentrick uncertain or at least unknown motions make revolutions which it is difficult to ascertain and therefore fill the world with terror at their appearances and perhaps are reserved as the instruments of the general conflagration as some one or more of them certainly was of the general inundation or flood if such a thing may obtain our belief of which moses the lawgiver of the jews gives the story i say after they have told u these things they would start a doubt how the souls of men at their being dismissed from the prison of the body pass this infinite abyss of space how they are conveyed and how directed in their journey where no track can guide the way and in what space of time they perform the celestial journey seeing they tell us that the distance is so great that a velocity of motion swift as a ball from a cannon would not perform the labor in a million of ages  all these enquiries and suggested measurings of space motion and time have a tincture of those horrid crimes of atheism and skepticism for which these nazareens are as eminent as infamous and in which they increase every day  to a soul rightly grounded in truth and unerring doctrines it is easy to conceive that the soul of man being a divine infusion is capable of inconceivable transitions that its motion swift as the light or as thought is no sooner broke loose from the prison but it is enthroned in the paradise of god and that without any solicism in philosophy or imposition upon our understandings  how this is performed illuminated sage guide of the faithful is as needless as it is impossible to know mahomet shall at once teach us the full system and draw the curtain of darkness from our eyes the moment that we arrive at the port of bliss when we shall look back upon the immense gulf we shall have passed and wonder no more that some things were concealed from us before which were more easy to be done than for us to conceive of  partake of my joy thou mirror of perfection and expect me at the appointed time to accompany thee to the gates of the holy city if our destinated hour approaches before let us meet it with joy as being the much shorter step to the banks of abathrea the river of solace where we shall commune of supernatural things for ever till then i embrace thy shadow with raptures inconceivable  paris  th of the  st moon of the year      letter ii to mahomet tershekkah vizier azem invincible illustrious prince of the viziers bassa of the bassaes beglerbeg of the beglerbegs head of the councils in the sublime divan of the grand seignior leader of the faithful armies and guide of the empire of the mussulmen i prostrate my self at the feet of our prophet mahomet to obtain his blessing and prayers on all thy undertakings and i congratulate thy glory in thy early vigorous conduct against the enemies of the ottoman sultan whose days be ever prosperous and his end happy  i send thee herewith an account of the fate of the duke of lorrain one of the greatest enemies of the ottomans and one to whom heaven for our sins gave leave to triumph over the troops of thy great predecessors hassan kara and ibrahim on several occasions which be for ever forgotten and the memory of them blotted out of the book of jatub where are registered the wars of the empire ever happy and in whose place be recorded the victories obtained by thy sword fortunate and invincible  this duke of lorrain followed by great armies and taking the advantage of the cloud of displeasure which it was gods will should for some years hang over the kingdoms of the grand seignior on the side of the river danube obtained some advantages against the faithful forsaken at that time of the protection of mahomet and made his name terrible among the infidels by the taking from us howbeit not till after infinite slaughter of his men and a most glorious defense the city of buda which be recovered immediately by thy hand  he was now drawn out of that war against us that he might with a fury needful against an enemy so dangerous defend the dominions of the german empire against the attacks of the french who daily made inrodes into the country and threatened the destruction of the whole this great man for he really merited that name among all the leaders of armies of whom none in this part of the world came near him in character or rather in success for success does not always follow the greatest merit i say this great man is at length laid level with his inferiors in the dust for the grave knows no dignity  take the history of his death in a few words for it was brief death used no ceremonies with him he had for some time had a defluxion or rheum in his breast occasioned by a violent cold gotten in passing some mountains in his return from the frontiers on the rhine where he had been to take care of the emperors affairs and put all things in a disposition for opening the campaign or at least for opposing the french armies who generally made their first and greatest effort in the second or third or at least the fourth moons before the germans could be gotten in the field  but it was needful for him to go back to vienna to assist in the councils of war and to concert there more effectually the operations of the war he was arrived within a few leagues of the emperors court namely at a village called wells near lintz on the danube when his cold increasing he found a swelling in his throat which grew so much as to impostumate and turn to what their physicians here call a quinzy and this came on him with such violence that notwithstanding the place was inconvenient and not capable of entertaining him he was obliged to stop not being able to stir a step farther in a word in that obscure village he finished the course of what vain men here call a life of glory and victory that is in plain truth a life of blood and of the destroying his fellow creatures for as war is the plague of heaven cast upon men by the displeasure of god these we foolishly call heroes what are they but bloody men commanded by the irrevocable decree to fulfill what in wrath has been predestined to be inflicted upon the nations of the earth  but to return to the duke he found his end draw on apace and herein he showed more of the hero than in the greatest victories he gained for it is allowed on all hands that he received the first summons of death with a steadiness of mind equal to those romans of old who esteemed death no other than a shaking hands with the gods in a word glorious prince this duke wanted nothing in life or in death but to have been numbered among the faithful to have been a true believer in the everlasting law and a servant to the grand seignior  he met death with an undaunted heart and though the distemper was so violent as to allow him very little intervals from the convulsions of death and but a very few moments of time having seized upon the passages of the thorax and deprived him of the use even of his lungs except with violent heavings and insupportable pangs for breath yet he applied himself immediately to the point of dying with an unusual alacrity he first sent for a priest or dervice whom they call here a confessor for to such these nazareens apply in such cases and disburthening their consciences as they call it confess to them all their sins and then think these poor creatures wicked like themselves can absolve and forgive them foolish notion as if any but god against whom our offenses are committed could wipe out that account which souls must give to their maker which if true then had those wicked creatures power to license the committing all manner of crimes  when his confessor came as above he found him silent for his speech was stopped by the bulk of the impostumation so he took a pen and ink and wrote his confession which he intended to make which the said priest read aloud to him in private and then put into the fire in his presence for it is their maxim that what is delivered in confession is sacred and never to be divulged nay some have gone the length as to say that if a man in confession declared he intended to assassinate his prince the priest must not divulge it no though doing so would save the life of the person for which devilish doctrine one whole society of these dervices called jesuits were expelled france after the murder of the two henrys  the duke having finished his confession he in the next place received the chymerick absolution i have just now mentioned from the hands of his priest together with the viaticum or the sacrament as they call it of extreme unction which in a word they call here the last office of the church and making peace with god this being over and perceiving his end hastily approaching he wrote a letter to the emperor wherein after he had testified his sorrow for being no longer able to serve him he recommended his wife and all his family to his imperial care he wrote another to the princess his lady to comfort her for her loss which two letters he gave to his confessor with orders to deliver em immediately after his death after which the imposthume that was in his throat bursting within side stifled him so that he expired in the arms of his confessor the    th of the   th moon in the evening  he was born in the year      at vienna and was christened charles leopold nicolas sixtus he was born of francis nicolas who had been first a cardinal but by a dispensation from the pope married claudia of lorrain his cousingerman his uncle charles iii had married claudias eldest sister by whom he had no children but while his first wife lived who died not till the year      he contracted a second marriage with beatrice dcusance widow of eugenius leopold prince of cante croix by whom he had charles henry prince of vaudemont and anne the wife of julius count of lislebonna the duke of lorrain of whom i now speak married in the year      the archdutchess eleonora maria d austria the emperors sister and widow of michael king of poland by whom he had children which being very young are not yet in a condition of themselves to recover the duchy of lorrain which is their lawful inheritance  it is not yet known who will be declared generalissimo of the emperors forces but the prince of baden will return into hungary to command the imperialists unless his present sickness hinders him  every body that considers the consequences of this dukes death must acknowledge that the emperor had better have lost ten thousand men for how great a general soever he may have still remaining on that side it may be said there is not one that has that expertness that experience that authority that credit and love of the soldiers which the duke of lorrain had insomuch that all the princes of germany willingly gave way to him and in regard he was a prince poor and distressed there was no body jealous of him but they were still glad of the good success which generally attended his arms whereas on whomever else the emperor cast his eyes to confer upon him the command of his armies he cannot so well order it but that it must breed jealousies among several of the princes and

every one their chieftain that pretends to be independent and not obliged to receive orders from any one whatever  many and glorious be thy days invincible and magnificent mehemet many be thy days and

moon of the year      letter iii to amurath zahabbezin a proselyted jew reconciled to the doctrine of mahomet thou who have been delivered from the burdens of the apostate nation must needs be also filled with just indignation at the superstitions and heresies of thy people from whose tabernacles thou have taken thy flight verily amurath it has never gone well with the jews since they clogged the pure law delivered to them by moses and received by him from the mouth of god with the inventions and delusions of men  prithee tell me enlightened morat what hodge podge of a constitution will the jews bring their religion to at last they have already blended the explanations and expositions of men in such a gross manner with the positive law of god that it is hard for any that have not critically studied the constitutions of the mount to know one from the other  i have read over very attentively the pentateuch or books wherein the law of moses is contained and must tell thee had the jews adhered steadfastly to the letter of that law and not mixed with it their several innovations which they would have called by the name of interpretations they had certainly been the people of god to this day or until the shiloth of old father israel had come and whether he be already come or yet to come i find they are hard put to it to determine  but be the messiah who is doubtless meant there by shiloh and in other places of their prophet called by other names come or not come about which i purpose to write to thee hereafter it is most certain that the jews have in a most egregious manner profaned and corrupted the first institution of their law and there is no wonder that when the prophet of the christians jesus the son of mary came among them this was the great thing for which he reproached them and charged their scribes and pharisees with hypocrisy it is certain that it was for this that they were implacably bent to destroy him and that they abhor his name and memory to this day but also it is most certain that they were convinced that he had too much reason on his side to be opposed that they really had taught for doctrines the commandments of men and had destroyed the law by mixing with it their corrupt traditions and sayings of the elders  had not the jews thus degenerated from the first institutions of gods law exhibited by moses doubtless mahomet and all the empire of the faithful mussulmen had been jews to this day the caliphs of the arabian empire who were the justest and meekest men upon earth would have faithfully followed the divine influence and have worshipped god in that way which he so evidently delivered from mount sinai and as they had no faith in the messiah f he christians as to his being the person who the writings of the prophets had foretold should come they would most certainly have continued king in all the ways of god and of his prophet moses to this day or till some revelation from heaven of the true messiahs being come should have wrought upon their minds to know when the promises made of him were fulfilled  but this degeneracy of the jews increasing and besides having led them as delusions naturally do to all manner of neglect of the commands of god has given rise to all the variety of abominations which have appeared among that profligate people to this day  hence the doctrine of the nazareens and hence the pure rules of our glorious mahomet have taken the rise of their epoch in the world for were we to suppose them or either of them not to be of divine institution heaven forbid such profaneness yet it might very reasonably be expected that when the people of the nations round them saw the laws of god thus confounded with the devices of men and the people by consequence deviated into all manner of wickedness they would rightly conclude that either the law was fulfilled and the divine institution terminated and so they ought to seek out the ways of truth as heaven should direct them or that some terrible judgment from heaven would attend the people who had so degenerated that they would be removed from the face of the earth and some new and gloriou evelation would be given of the further mind of god the great legislator of the world  both these events are certainly come to pass and the jews are manifestly cast out of the fold as wicked and corrupted creatures degenerated plants having forfeited the care of him who first watered and cultivated them who they have voluntarily rejected and despised  happy be thy days enlightened convert who art broken loose from the bondage of hypocrites and have detected the fraud of electing an oral law in the throne of the divine revelation thou art come into the family of the blessed even of those who first in the most effectual manner drew the sword of justice in the cause of god against the manifest delusions of men set up in rebellion to his commands  for know thou that the successors of our great prophet viz the saracenical caliphs were the men who in the name of god drove the rabbinical impostors from babylon the seat of the jewish innovations where the talmud and the collections of their innovations and errors were first made and from whence the gemara or great mass of traditions being a comment upon the more ancient misna which they would have called the oral law of moses obtained the name of babylonian  i say the arabian caliphs and saracen powers the immediate successors of our great prophet scattered these collected mischiefs and the blow given to the jewish impostures has never yet been recovered or ever will be while the world endures for god the author of truth abhors the mixtures of humane traditions with his divine institutions much more when they are injuriously placed in a wicked usurpation over his own laws  from this conquest of babylon by abu obeid the great captain of the saracens the jews may reckon the epoch of their more effectual desolation and of their being scattered over the whole world in which dispersed condition as it often happens they have neither preserved the law no nor the talmud it self from farther and greater innovations and corruptions which by the way is agreeable to what these nazareens say of them viz that they should be given up to strong delusions to believe a lie that they all may be damned  i salute thee humble morat who in search after these things have learned the truth and delivered thy self from the errors of wicked men peace be to them who cleave to truth and prosperous be the hands of those who build upon the foundation of the faithful  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter iv to mohamed elmakem student in history at trapezond thou know little of the situation of affairs on this side of the world and less of my circumstances in this place that thou have written to me to furnish thee with materials for thy learned enquiry into the antiquities of the east and supply thee with particulars for the history of the empire of the saracens which i understand thou art compiling  had thou written to me to supply thee with the nicest and most particular accounts of the roman and grecian empires this is the fittest place at this time in the world for such an enquiry the learning of this age applying themselves and that with a great and just applause to those studies to which also they find great assistance among those writers which they call the classicks  but for the eastern learning though it is it self the beauty of all study and would furnish matter for innumerable histories of the greatest actions in the world much greater than furnished the song of homer or the commentaries of julius caesar yet it is in it self so remote that the arabic tongue in which all those things are to be found is so sunk out of knowledge in these parts of the world and the getting the tracts that are extant in it is so exceeding difficult that indeed the enquiry after it is as good as dropped and men are backward to enter into a study which seems locked up from humane enquiries or at least fortified with so many retreats and inaccessible darknesses that it is scarce to be attempted  as the wars of the arabians are a story filled with infinite variety and that nation had been for many ages the bravest the most aspiring to and the best fitted for glorious actions of any people in the world so arts and sciences and all sorts of learning flourished in the arabian kingdoms even before the rest of the world had either learned the methods of instruction or had any sense of the blessing of it  acquired knowledge seems to have had its first rise in that country the climate favored by heaven with all that could make a country pleasant and agreeable deservedly gained for the country the title of felix the inhabitants breathed an air that assisted nature beyond expression in forming a people for great things perfect health invigorating juices in the fruits of the earth and innumerable helps from natural causes prepared the people for the generous principles the fortitude and the gallantry of true heroes they seemed fit to undertake things more than humane and yet appeared capable of every thing they undertook  in study they outdid nature they searched into her very bowels and disclosed her most concealed parts they mastered all kinds of astronomical mathematical anatomical and astrological knowledge wisdom seemed to be born of them and the most exquisite accomplishments of the soul became common and familiar as if it had been the natural genius of the country as they had in their temper the greatest application to learning so they had in their minds the greatest capacities to attain it they had the brightest parts the clearest heads and the devoutest hearts of any nation in the world  in their common conduct they had the beauties of behavior and the most correct attachment to every moral virtue and besides all this they had joined to the height of a martial genius the softest meekest dispositions in the world as they were in the field all fire so they were in the family all phlegm a manly humility shone in the characters of their greatest caliphs and a generous clemency was the very natural produce of the highest birth  from them the world learned knowledge all liberal arts all studies of science began with them they were the men who gave names to the stars discovered the motions of the heavenly bodies and which is yet a more sublime study found out the influences of the planetary world and how the heavenly bodies govern this globe and reign in all the particular classes of vegetative sensitive and rational life  from them the ptolomaian astronomers gathered the first rudiments of their great system of celestial motions from them the aesculapian derived the fundamentals of physical and anatomical knowledge  job if the jews have preserved an authentic account of that eminent arabian and the book called by his name which was found in the archives of the sons of isaac may be depended upon surpassed all the students in astronomy in physics or metaphysics which have since his time been seen in the world  even the jews themselves the rabbis and the greatest men among them had but little knowledge in any other sort of science than the mere study of their own law and the disquisitions of necessary things relating to their sanhedrim and court of justice till they came to converse with the learned arabians from them they received the first introductions in science and the love of the most excellent parts of knowledge such as the study of philosophy the mathematics and especially the study of nature  it is true there is a great variety of critical study among those rabbis and they discovered themselves to have among them men of bright parts aspiring thoughts and clear and exquisite judgments but as above it was wholly taken up in the study of their own law solving difficulties in the interpretation of their particular cases of judicature and settling points of conscience in the conformity to ceremonial institutions  but even moses himself when any thing is spoken of his learning it speaks of it as borrowed he was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and this wisdom or learning of the egyptians was also received from the arabians with whom the most ancient knowledge of the sciences is to be found  search then my friend the ancient libraries the monuments and records of the arabians if thou would learn any thing of the eastern antiquity with them even long before the coming of our prophet was treasured up an infinite variety of humane wisdom and knowledge and since the time of mahomet under the caliphs and princes of the saracens the politest learning of those days has flourished in their dominions their more ancient conquests spread the glorious light of heavenly wisdom over the eastern world and they afterward brought the rudiments of philosophy into the grecian and roman countries  among them were found the innumerable tracts of history and all kinds of learning which completed ptolomys library in which it is said were to be found seventy thousand volumes and from those manuscripts innumerable copies were handed continually forward into other parts of the world till that glorious collection was destroyed  among the egyptians afterward the same spirit of magnanimity and glory was preserved with the same love of litterature and the same genius for art and sciences during the fortunate government of the mamalukes till they with the whole eastern world sunk under the invincible arm of sultan selym who god appointed to be lord of the whole earth  here then apply thy self for materials for thy well designed collection go to the banks of cuthur and to the society of devout emirs who dwell on the miraculous plain they will lead thee to the cave where are the seven hundred tables of brass on which are written with a pen of adamant with molten gold the illustrious histories of the arabian princes for four and fifty ages before the h gyra of mahomets going to heaven began  there thou will find materials for the brightest history that was ever extant in the world the priests of mecca who attend day and night at the tomb of our holy prophet will let thee into the sacred mysteries and inform thee of every thing meet to be known for the propagating thy work and making it the wonder of all the succeeding ages of the world  light and joy attend thy diligent enquiry into truth and may thou be fully rewarded in the exalted heights of paradise where knowledge is perfect and happiness complete  paris  0th of the  0th moon of the year    0 letter v to the kadileskar of natolia it is very seldom that i propose any of these nazareens for an example to the true believers because they are here the greatest hypocrites in the world religion is made a mere guise of deceit and the outside they put on to appear devout has ever some holy cheat in it to draw in fools or to buoy up the spirits of the commons to support with more alacrity the heavy loads they are to lay upon them it is a proverbial saying of their own when the fox preaches guardez les poules beware of the gueese    however as an example of a hypocrite may be recommended because the outside of it is gilded over with the sanctity of an angel and the vile design with which it is performed is concealed so i recommend to the faithful the practice of religion without the hypocrisy the guise without the disguise  the people of paris are every thing the king pleases and though in themselves and following the dictates of their own inclination they are the gayest profuse and most debauched people alive yet all on a sudden a fit of religion having possessed them they are all turned pharisees and recluses  the alteration has something dismal in it for instead of an air of inexpressible levity which was the habit even of the whole nation instead of eternal dancing and singing even as they walk along the streets and scarce restrained even in the churches instead of all the gallantry of dress and the coquettry of ribbons patches and paintings instead of innumerable coaches in the walks of the thulleries the grand tour and the park at versailles instead of songs new tunes new dances new operas and the constant noise of music this city is all on a sudden turned into a collection of cells of hermits or houses of recluses if the women go abroad it is all en des habille mussled up as if they were veiled and instead of the tour to the gardens of the loure it is only now away to the mosque to say their mattins and their vespers and directly home again the pages and servants hurry up and down all over the town to the booksellers shops to buy books of devotion and religion so that they are scarce to be had and the price exceedingly risen all other writings may be turned to waste paper for no body buys them instead of singing and dancing as they go along streets the breast all unbuttond the hat under the arm and the face covered with smiles and joy the beaus now walk with the hat pulled over their eyes their cloths buttoned close up to the chin and the neckcloth tuckt close in to the wastcoat or vest they look grave walk softly talk seriously and study to be dull  the publickhouses cabarets or taverns look as if they were broke the operas the musickmeetings and the gamingordinaries are shut up nothing open but the churches the fine walks and gardens at the kings houses in the city where the infinite numbers of coaches ladies and burghers daughters used to be surprising now they are all empty the women are all upon their knees in the churches and chapels or performing their hours as they call them in the convents and religious houses where they visit the nuns and talk all of religion as for coaches dress servants fine liveries and all gay things they are laid by and the people that made the shining splendour of the french court be the glory and envy of europe live now all retired see no company pay no visits and talk of retreating from the world nay many of them go out of town every day to their countryseats though it be at the time of year that every body uses to come to town while the gentry are in this state of humiliation the inferior sort of people have a real cause for it they mourn in earnest for trade which is here in a manner wholly supported by the luxury of the most extravagant people in the world is quite sunk in this alteration the perriwigmakers the perfumers the toyshops the taverns the assemblies for play the milleners the laceshops the weavers of silks and ribbons the mercers the drapers the tailors and a thousand trades depending upon these alas they are all undone and they walk about their shops wringing their hands and tearing their hair from their heads for they wear no beards here as men undone and ruined their trade being gone and their livelihoods taken away all on a sudden their wives sit behind the counters all in tears no body comes to buy fine cloths are all useless and of no esteem no body wears them if a gentleman should powder his wig or a lady appear in dress it would look like a swiss or like one that came a great way out of the country to be sure it would be presently said they had no business at court they were people of no fashion or they did not understand themselves in a word the countenance of the merriest nation upon earth is on a sudden changed into that of the mournfullest and heaviest generation of mankind and they look as if the city was just visited with the pestilence and they afraid to speak to one another for fear of infection  one would think the old arabian prophet jonah had been here on the same errand that he was sent to nineveh and having told them paris should be destroyed within forty days the people were all upon their penetentials for their sins  and what is the matter all this while is it real devotion is the humor of the nation changed are the people really become religious nothing like it it is all a mimick a mere piece of statemanagement the king led the way and appeared devout and as it were shut up in his closet which they say is upon the occasion of the great prospect of war and devastation of countries and nations burnings of cities and shedding of blood which as they pretended must fall as a judgment from heaven upon the kings enemies the ensuing year  it is true this is all grimace nor do the wiser sort pretend to talk much of that kind but they say the last year having been a year of glory and success to the king though surrounded with infinite enemies it has all been procured by the exemplary devotion and piety of the king who has for some time given himself up to fastings prayers innumerable masses works of mortification abstinence from pleasures and the like and that therefore his best subjects will follow the same method and thereby secure a prosperous state of things for the time to come  by the tomb of mahomet and all the holy men whose ashes surround the entrance of the circle of sanctity in mecca these nazareens are the grossest hypocrites in the universe for at the same time that this mask of humiliation is put on all the intreagues imaginable are carried on to embroil in war all the courts and princes of europe  thou art not ignorant sublime judge of equity and uprightness what infinite violences they commit in all parts of the world at the same time that they pretend to weep and mourn for the calamities of mankind the history of these things lying daily in thy sight thou can not but see through the mask of devotion they put on  a flagrant instance of it also is before thee in the daily solicitations of the french ambassador at the port to encourage the ottoman ministry to carry on the war against the nazareen emperor and prevent the projects of peace that were on foot thou art witness there to the intreagues they carry on and the assistances they give for the ottoman forces of engineers and gunners and some money if they do not belie their own councils to hasten on the preparations and make the continuance of the war inevitable  on the other hand i am witness here to the secret joy with which they entertain the news of the grand viziers successes on the frontiers the victory of nissa and the taking the town the surprising recovery of belgrade and the like nay some people here suggest that the city of belgrade was betrayed to us and the count aspremont a native of france being governor the magazines were blown up by his secret contrivance that the mussulmans army might enter sword in hand and the conquest be secured and all this that it being a blow which could not fail to put the imperial affairs into the utmost consternation might occasion a necessary diversion of the german troops as well from the empire as from italy where the king of france was resolved to push the duke of savoy with his utmost strength and who if not supported by the germans must at last be obliged to change sides and submit to france  while these steps are taking while the king of france stoops to confederate secretly with the ottomans who at the same time they pretend to call the common enemy of christendom and who they make it a piece of conscience to act against upon all occasions as infidels and people who they ought not to wish success to no not against the greatest of their enemies i say while they profess such things as these and practice in secret the very reverse of it what sincerity can there be in all the outside of their humiliation and pretended devotions  god who is one in the unity of his nature demands that we be one at all times in the unity of our practice the faithful are taught to know that god sees the inside of our imaginations and that he abhors the mask of devotion covering the deceit of the intention  just men act from just principles and cannot meek the world with the pageantry of religion any more than they can mock the great one alla the god of pure and perfect uprightness with a double entendre in their services  we shall see this fit of devotion be all over in a little while and the tiger will sit rampant upon the king of frances councils when perhaps in the beginning of the campaign he shall give orders for the burning and destroying the fruitful countries on the frontiers on the pretense of preventing his enemies armies subsisting there  blessed be the righteous desires of the believers who walk in strait paths doing justice and keeping their eyes to the gates of eden replenished with joy and crowning the pleasures of the just  paris   th of the  d moon of the year      letter vi to morat husain abdeilomar caimacham of constantinople it belongs to thee happy morat that keep the gates of the illustrious port the city of joy within whose walls dwells the mighty the resplendent mirror of glory the king of emperors whose days be multiplied and his felicity endless it belongs to thee i say to hear how the great cities of the world behave when the prosperous arms of their princes bring triumph to their gates  contrary to the expectation of enemies nay even to the surprise of the court it self every patt of the french frontiers has furnished some subject of triumph to the king of france this past year they have been overwhelmed with joy on all sides which is indeed the more welcome because they were not without apprehensions of the superiority of their enemies almost on all sides  the first of the year saluted them with a complete victory at fleuri on the banks of the sambre the month of june with a victory at sea the french navy the most formidable that ever one single power could boast of since the use of ships of war was known attacked and defeated the united fleets of england and holland and burnt stranded and took seven men of war from  0 to  0 guns each on the coast of england after this they landed some men on the same coast and burnt and plundered several villages in italy where it was thought the duke of savoy had been so well supported by his allies that he would have been superior to the french he has been attacked by the marshall de catinat an old and experienced general and in a great battle overthrown near sallusses in piemont  000 of his men slain  000 prisoners with all his cannon baggage and colors taken and the duke himself narrowly escaping  this battle has been so important though the action it self was not great that the court are not able to conceal their joy and the king himself was heard to say he valued it more than the two other victories of the year viz that of fleuri and that at sea  and he has reason to do so for as the war in savoy was more expensive to the king being at so great a distance and carried on with more resentment on either side so the king was infinitely more desirous to bring it to a conclusion that he might turn his arms another way more to his advantage and which was greater still the king had more to fear on that side than on any other if his enemies should get the advantage of his troops  but he has now effectually secured his dominions on that side and his army continues to ravage the country to deprive the duke of savoy of subsisting his army they have also taken saluzzes savigliane and several other important posts from the duke of savoy as the consequences of that victory and in close of the year all the duchy of savoy except the fortress of montmellian and the town of suza fell into the hands of the french so that unless the emperor supports the duke of savoy with a very strong power he will be reduced to very narrow circumstances in a little time  on the rhine the confederates boasted of great attempts to be made of breaking into the heart of france and the like particularly it was said the duke of bavaria who commands the army since the death of the duke of lorrain would bring an hundred thousand men into the field but the dauphine whose army was never above   000 men has defended the frontiers and in his turn passed the rhine and subsisted his army in the plains of stollhoffen at the expense of the enemies and yet has drawn off without fighting which is in it self a victory  thus all things concur to make the king of france triumph over his enemies and he lives in the continual clamor of joy the guns are ever firing for the good news which comes in from one quarter or another and i sit in my little retreat and laugh at the madness of these infidels who thus weaken and destroy one another leaving thereby an open door of victory to the arms of the grand seignior whose ways be prosperous and his triumphs uninterrupted  fortunate morat let no opportunity slip to push the interest of the illustrious high port and fail not to take all the just advantages that the dissentions of the powers of the nazarcens offer to thee these are the times appointed by fate for the recovery of all the territories of the grand seignior lost by the unhappy conduct of the vizier azem when he made that fatal attempt against vienna when mahomet was displeased and god was angry and the faithful turned their backs and fled from the face of their enemies  at the latter end of the moon rebliah the second called here april the death of the dauphiness wife to the eldest son of the king of france died which having thrown the whole court into black lessened much of the luster which would have been seen here on the occasions of the victories i have mentioned but their joy is not the less for their mourning outsides seeing this is a nation that is not more eminent for any thing in the world than for seeming what they are not and being what they do not seem  well be it with the true believers who triumph in a rectitude of soul and always are bold to show the affection or enmity which they entertain in their breast whether it be personal or national dissimulation is the effect of a cowardice and baseness of the mind which renders it afraid to show the inside of the heart god who abhors hypocrisy can never be supposed without blasphemous conceptions of his nature to approve these nazareens for sincerity dwells not in them  may the gates of paradise stand open to thee and the angel of the vale receive thee with open arms ready to transport thee to the mount of joy and open to thee the mysteries of inconceivable pleasure  paris   th of the  th moon of the year      letter vii to the rutalier aga chief eunuch or chief of the seraglio they are greatly mistaken who think the affairs of the port have not their influence on these parts of the world where i dwell they who placed me here who are now shining in the garden of beauty had other notions or they would not have obliged me to reside here so many years  the happy successes of the grand vizier in hungary thereby opening a way for farther conquests to the arms of the victorious ottomans is acknowledged here to be the saving the king of france from the absolute ruin which the superiority of the germans and their confederates would have infallibly brought upon them and i infer from hence that whenever the perfect wisdom of our mighty emperor shall think fit to put an end to the conquests he is making in hungaria and consent to come to a truce with these infidels there is no question but all the powers of europe who are now in confederacy against france will put their helping hand to such a work and will join together their endeavors to bring the emperor of the nazareens to yield to all the demands of the port that they may be at leisure to turn all their united armies against this more dangerous enemy the king of france who is now esteemed among them as the common enemy of what they call christendom  in the mean time the language of the infidels here is that the mussulmen have once again gotten fortune on their side and perhaps says one of their authors here may have found out the secret to chain her so fast to their viziers tent that she shall not make her escape a second time  i write these things to hint that ancient maxim of caled the great the first general to abbubeker caliph and immediate successor to mahomet in the civil and military government i hint to thee his maxim i say viz that a time of victory is the time to make peace the reason is clear for then said he you are sure to keep what you have gained and obtain what you ask  they talk here that the english and dutch ministers at the port have orders to concern themselves in the names of their masters to incline the grand seignior to thoughts of peace and offer to act as mediators this is a signal in deed if true of the weak condition of the emperors affairs it is no less than a white flag hung out of a town besieged to offer a capitulation and surrender and i doubt not the vizier will know how to make his advantage of it  it is true france regarding her own interest will oppose it with all her might knowing that if the nazareen emperor concludes a peace with the port he will make no peace with him but if i might be permitted to give my judgment in so weighty a case it is that the port should weight her own strength and interest not forgetting to note that however the port may regard france in carrying on the war france would have no regard to the interest of the grand seignior if he was designing to clap up the war by a peace but would rather assist the emperor against the mussulmen as they did at the battle of raab and as they did in the case of the venetians at the siege of candia things which the illustrious port may happen to remember to them hereafter  yield to peace then while victory crowns thy attempts o man assisted by heaven and let an end be put to shedding the blood of the faithful  not that i fear for the grand vizier though they talk here loudly of the mighty strength of the nazareen emperor and that he will have an hundred thousand disciplined soldiers on foot in hungary this approaching campaign but it cannot be rational to believe it if i may credit the vulgar opinion in this place money is more difficult to be had in germany than men and the emperor will be very sorely distressed to raise money for this double war if it holds another campaign  his hereditary dominions are terribly exhausted the contingencies or quotas of the princes of the empire which they call the roman months come in not only slowly but even not at all the smaller princes only are those that pay any thing and the great ones nothing the first plead poverty and the last power giving trifling reasons and haughty answers without paying any part of their money to the military chest or sending their quotas of men to the army  mighty princes often think fit to put bounds to their conquests even when they have power to extend them farther it is sufficient that the vizier has recovered to the ottoman empire the banks of the sauve and of the theiss and that belgrade and temeswaer remain the invincible barriers of our empire as for the rest of hungary it will be more an expense than an advantage to the nazareens to keep it the hungarians who hate the germans being all malcontents as well upon religious as political accounts will be for ever raising commotions weakening the power and exhausting the treasure of the emperor till at length wasted by continual factions that kingdom will fall naturally into the hands of the just nation without fighting as it did before  prosperous be the days of the emperor of the just may his head resplendent with celestial glory shine like the stars and his crown be a constellation of five hundred suns joy be to thy exalted soul dear achmethies both here and in paradise amen  paris  th of the  d moon of the year      letter viii to the kaimacham i have often given the characters of the illustrious men of these parts of the world and have told thee that the king of france has the greatest and best generals of the age and it is most true the duke of luxemburgh in flanders and monsieur catinat who acts against the duke of savoy are certainly two of the greatest men this age affords and victory seems to attend every action they take in hand  but i am called off from such mean characters if after what i have said of them they may be called mean i say i am called off from them to the rising figure the new king of england makes in the world  i have often named this person to thee as prince of orange but being now stepped up into the chair of majesty and mounted the english or rather british throne his power having thus increased to an equality with his martial genius which indeed it was not before he begins to threaten france with such an appearance in the field as no prince in europe ever made before him  he has been in ireland in person where he passed a great river called the boyn in the face of a superior army of the french and irish and defeated them by plain fighting the slaughter was not great but the victory plain and confessed by the flight of that unfortunate prince the deposed king the  d time to france who arrived here the latter end of the last year  the victorious prince pursuing the course of his good fortune has recovered the most part of the kingdom of ireland and leaving the rest to his generals appears now at the hague forming alliances against france and his designs seem to threaten the king of france that he will arm all the rest of europe against him  it is incredible to hear how the princes and states on all sides caress him the congress which he has formed at the hague is what was never seen in those parts of the world he makes himself be adored by all the powers of that part of the world and though they dissemble their apprehensions he is terribly feared by this part  the haughty spirit of the king indeed who knows not how to fear god or man supports the french nation and their natural aptness to bluster makes them seemingly despise this prince but it is easy to see the consternation of their more reserved thoughts they prepare for the war as if it was to be carried on after a differing manner than it uses to be and in flanders particularly as if they were to be more seriously attacked there than elsewhere  they pick and cull their whole army for the best troops and the most active and enterprising generals they new mount their cavalry and do a thousand things to encourage the officers to behave well at the same time letting them know they are to expect hot work that they must look for blows and that nothing but superior numbers and superior courage will carry on the war on that side  as for the king of england he is now at the hague where as i have said he has formed a congress of the princes of the northern parts of europe who are arrived there in such numbers either in person or by their ambassadors that it is worthy thy remark the like not having happened in any age where they concert a league or alliance offensive as they call it of all their powers against the single power of france if this king of france can withstand this confederacy europe must be reduced under his hand into one universal monarchy or empire far exceeding that of charlemaign  it may be of use to thee and for the service of our glorious emperor the grand seignior to give thee some account of this congress there was assembled besides the king and fourteen noblemen of great britain who he brought over with him for the splendour of his new gained dominions and besides the two electors of bavaria and brandenburgh five and twenty sovereign princes having estates and dominions of their own such as the landgrave of hesse cassel the duke of brunswick lunenburgh the duke of saxe eysuach the duke of courland and others of like degree fourteen princes of great houses but not themselves sovereigns    generals all of them having titles of honor besides their military character the dutch high admiral trump the king of spains governor of the spanish netherlands viz the marquis de gastanaga and the imperial general the prince de commercy  besides these there were a prodigious train of ambassadors envoys extraordinary and public ministers from other princes states and powers such as were too great or too remote to appear in person and even from some that were present who were to remain when their principals were gone the account they give here of them is thus  three from the emperor two from the king of spain one from sweden two from denmark two from savoy from the electors of bavaria brandenburgh treves mentz and cologn each two from the elector palatine one from the elector of saxony one from the king and republic of poland one two from the landgrave of hesse cassel one from the bishop of munster from the dukes of hannover lunenburgh wolfembuttle and zell each one from the duke of holstein one and from the cities of liege and hamburgh each one besides agents from switzerland the grisons geneva and neufchattel  i need not muster up to thee the powers of these several princes who art so well acquainted with the state of europe but thou may understand that there being a general unanimity in them all to unite against the growing power of france every one of these entered into measures and agreements for some proportion either in money or troops to support the alliance and every one of them had some pretensions upon france so that like the assembly of the birds they all pretended to pluck their respective feathers out of the plume wherewith the king of france has adorned himself  the agreement of so great a number of princes and powers will not be more wonderful to thee than it will be that france has gone on so long in a general encroachment upon her neighbors to such a degree and for so long a time till the whole world as we may say are aggrieved at her and yet never be opposed in a body before the reason is the conduct of this court has been so very subtle that the king has always found means to disunite the princes whom he had oppressed and to break all the measures laid at any time for concerting any opposition to him so that he had them often in secret league with himself ready rather to oppose one another than to join in measures to oppose him  thou will doubtless expect to hear what the king of france is doing all this while and what prospect there is of his defending himself against so many powerful adversaries as to the first as i hinted already they turn it all in public to jest and ridicule they call the new king of england le petit prince dorange and one of their scribbling poets here has written a satyr or lampoon called the cavalcade at the hague wherein he pretends to give the characters of all the princes and great persons of the congress but his work is so scurrilous and he treats sovereign princes with such indecencies and such mean course language that indeed the french gentlemen themselves who to give them their due are a very mannerly nation do not relish it  however at the same time that they treat the notion of a grand alliance against them with a kind of gayety and contempt the king shows that he knows the prince of orange and that he is not in jest and accordingly he prepares to deal with him in earnest for his army in flanders will be in the whole the garrisons included    000 men of which the duke of luxemburg who is to command them pretends on any emergency he will be able to have   0000 men in the field ready for battle  the duke is a politic and a fortunate general but they say this of him that he never came but to one battle with the prince of orange and then he was soundly beaten which was at the battle of mons at the close of the last war with the dutch of which i gave at that time a full account to solomon thy illustrious predecessor now an exalted soldier of praise in the garden of peace  rejoice happy prince in the luster of thy great command and the favor of the sultan thy lord the mirror of humane wisdom and the illustrious emperor of the faithful whose days be filled with joy and his end triumph and inexpressible glory  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter ix to hoganquin zemel atran a studier of antiquity at zaabbachz in arabia thou that art searching after ancient knowledge how can thou look into this part of the world where men know nothing but by a kind of talmudical knowledge receiving error from their fathers and handing it on to their posterity with the loose sanction only of their own approbation so that all things are accepted as truths because received from the past generations  you ask me for a history of the ancient gods whom the roman nations adored and how the stars come to be surnamed after the deities they worship  i could give thee long legends of fables for the original of the gods some one way some another as the learning of the respective ages those things were written in directed and as the several authors who have written of such things have received them such as stephanus philo varro arnobius diodorus siculus plato and many more too long to name  but if i may give thee my opinion of these things it must be as i learnt them from the leaves of the never fading tree of aphelezma on which the history of the world was written by the angel of the gate with a pen of adamant i say if i must give thee my opinion it is that thou direct thy prayers to mahomet three times a day for illumination and that thou should be instructed in the everlasting record that nothing past may be concealed from thee  certainly the introduction of idols and images to be worshipped by men was begun by the evil spirit of the lake who to erase the knowledge of the true one god built houses and families of gods in romance founded on traditional discoveries of things past  as this carried them back to the first knowledge of things so it did also of persons and as none could be more the subject of their inquiries than the first men so upon the fable of their fame for time makes mighty stories dwindle into romance they made no scruple to form the gods which they wanted to invent  from these records which remain only in the sacred repository of the cave of wonders i say from these record of traditions rise all the gods they wanted they ascribed godlike things to men gone before their memory and then conceived of them as gods on account of their great deeds  thus they go back to the beginning of men and saturn who is called the father of all both gods and men was certainly no other than adam the primogenitor of the creation to whom the whole globe was given in fee simple as lord of the soil  as adam was the first saturn so cain appears to be the first jupiter eve was also called the goddess rhea and naamath eves eldest daughter and cains wife was called venus tubulcain is the same they called vulcan nor is the similitude of sound yet worn quite out of the words for taking away the letters tu from the word and you find not much of any kind of difference between bulcain and vulcan  i know that succeeding generations in imitation of this first nomination of gods named also the heroes of their own ancestors by the same names placing them in the skies as stars of eminence and adored them as gods but these are modern compared to the original as above which i take to be the work of the first ages of time  from the tales which the antediluvians as they call them here handed down to their posterity came most of the fables with which the eastern part of the world was so full some of which i find here in their ancient poets and historians such as homer hesiod ovid cornelius severus and others for example  from the building that great stupendous staircase called the tower of babel the said poets feigned the story of pelion upon ossa or the giants undertaking a war against the gods and throwing one mountain upon another to assault heaven which is admirably described by one of the said poets thus tentavere nefas olim detrudere mundo sydera captivique jovis transfer gigantes imperium and victo leges imponere coelo cor sev  likewise from the authentic histories of the sons of noah and their dividing the earth among their posterity came the fable of dividing the world among the three brethren the sons of saturn the fiction of the golden fruit kept by the dragon was taken from the garden of eden where was a forbidden tree guarded by the divine anathema  and as some tell us from the translating enoch into heaven was taken the translation of heroes and famous men into stars and celestial signs and the like  now if thou read the wondrous manuscripts of the ancients which thou will find treasured up in the miraculous cave and collected with great industry by the most ancient arabians thou will find the full confirmation of these truths and just reason to trace the antiquity of the heathen fiction back to the first age  innumerable similitudes will appear also if thou study mosess written law where thou will find the custom of kings and conquerors making leagues covenants and conventions confirmed by the sanction of solomon and mutual sacrifices is borrowed from moses who when he read the covenant of god to the people sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice upon them  wherefore then divine atran do thou turn thy face this way for the intelligence of things ancient seeing the dispersed families of the sons of noah have not left the eastern world without authentic proofs of their original and of the customs of their ancestors  i know the lybian fables take the original of the gods of the greeks from the africans where uranus they say first reigned a name which signified heaven and who for his knowledge of the stars his people honored after his death as a star in heaven  this uranus they say was the father of the titanes or giants his wife also surnamed titea was canonized for a goddess her name signifying earth thus heaven and earth married together their son hyperion marrying his sister basilea she bore him two children called sun and moon  the rest of these fictitious tales are too long to trouble thee with and only serve to let thee know how ignorant of more ancient truth those nations were and that the more genuine and indeed only fund of antiquity is treasured up in the archives of churuth and the repositories of the holy mountain where if thou pray to mahomet thou shall have wisdom and have the just discoveries of retired truth made known to thee  paris  th of the  th moon of the year      letter x to the captain bassa i should omit the duty i owe to thy high station in the empire of the faithful if i did not acquaint thee of the greatest battle or sea fight which perhaps was ever fought in these parts of the world whether we regard the strength of the fleets or the vigor and consequence of the action  the glory and ambition of the king of france especially in his maritine affairs thou have been no stranger to for many years nor art thou ignorant that he was really arrived to a greatness at sea amazing to all those who knew the circumstances he formerly stood in with respect to his neighbors of england and holland and how the former not only were superior to him in naval strength but pretended to forbid him increasing that power or building any more ships whenever they thought fit  it was but the last year but one that we saw the fleet of france engaging those of england and holland in the open seas and being superior to them both as well in the number of ships as in the force of those ships we found the english and dutch retreating from them declining the fight and at length worsted  the next year the fleets of france were reckoned  00 sail of capital men of war of the line viz from  0 guns upwards to   0 guns and the british and dutch fleets were not so forward to engage them as was usual  but this year by i know not what fate whether the vigilance and diligence of the british admiral or the rashness and pride of the french admiral i know not but this year i say has been fatal to the king of france in his naval affairs and in a great battle at sea his fleet has been entirely overthrown and about  0 of the biggest men of war in his navy and indeed some of them the biggest in the world have been burnt or destroyed a loss which i foresee france will not be able to restore in many years if at all  they came together upon the most natural terms imaginable for monsieur tourville the french admiral though he had not in his whole fleet above    sail went boldly into the british channel to seek out his enemies who were near  0 sail thou will reasonably conclude that when the weaker looks out for the stronger there will be little difficulty to meet  the fight was bloody and there is no doubt but had the french been equal in number to the british and dutch fleets they would have had the better of them but a great disproportion of numbers left the french room for nothing but to make the best of their way to their own coast after an unequal fight in which no behavior of the particular captains and officers could atone for the intolerable rashness of the admiral in attacking the enemy when he might have declined it and easily saw the disparity of strength  the french say in justification of the admiral that he had positive and express orders to fight the confederates wherever he met them but it is alleged in reply that this was with a supposition of a probable advantage or at least a fair cast for it not to fight at all adventures two against three where they would be sure to have the worse  however it was the king who is the best judge of his own orders received the admiral perfectly well spoke cheerfully to him and was very far from showing any resentment against his conduct as if he had not obeyed orders  the loss the french has sustained is inestimable    of the finest ships the world ever saw are burnt and destroyed in their own harbors and in sight of their own people besides others smaller a sight so mortifying so dreadful and particularly so provoking to the seamen who longed for nothing more than to have fought it out ship for ship and man for man that they tore the very hair from their heads for rage to see the ships burnt in their own ports  but there was no remedy the british and dutch fleets were upon them the rest of their own fleet was separated and fled through the race of alderney for breast whereupon they set fire to the ships with their own hands after having saved out of them whatever was portable and placed the hulls so as the guns might be easily weighed  never was such a blaze of fire seen on earth the light was seen in the air an hundred miles to the infinite terror of the people  the troops which were drawn up on the shore prevented the english landing and by some cannon planted on large batteries kept off the boats a great while which were sent in to burn the ships and by those batteries they protected two men of war which were not burnt  the loss of men has not been great the account they give is about   00 men killed and  000 wounded nor have the enemy lost much less but the loss of the ships is such as the french themselves do not pretend to be able to repair in many years and since this disaster they advise the king to spare the excessive expenses of fitting out so great a fleet and employ the seamen in small cruisers to attack the commerce of the allies who abound in numbers of merchantships in all parts of the sea  this had been good advice had it been given before had the king of france laid up his great fleet and encouraged his subjects to sit out privateers he had saved the expense of thirty millions a year and wounded his enemies in the most sensible part viz their trade by which they supported all the rest of their power  but this is late advice now and makes good a proverbial saying of the most learned of the nazareens viz that the italians are wise beforehand the dutchmen in the action and the french after it is done  this blow to the naval power of france may not be without its good consequences to thy affairs our glorious master the grand seignior knows what use to make of it to the exalting the ottoman power in the levant and assisting it to maintain a just superiority of naval strength in every part of the world  glory and success attend the navies of thy lord under thy wise and prosperous conduct invincible admiral of the faithful navy and may the ensigns of mahomet spread the seas at the ports of thy enemies that the topsails of france and venice may strike to the victorious pendants of the admiralgalley under the awe of thy sword and of the grand seigniors invincible power  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter xi to amurath zahabbezin a proselyted jew of trapezond though i believe thou art a true musselman and have forsaken the errors of thy mistaken brethren yet i find by thy letters that thou art yet of the rabbinical principle and art a kind of mohammedan pharisee for thou can not refrain in all thy notions of things to put a mighty stress upon the tradition of our ancestors as if the alcoran which thou know we believe came down from heaven to our great prophet needed any explanations  it is evident to me that the laws of god handed to israel by the ministration of moses coming immediately from the divine oracle spoken by the mouth of god himself and written down by the pen of moses the faithful collector of what god had spoken to him required no explanations it is to me a sufficient objection against the jewish talmud the gemara and all the writings which are called the collections of the elders that they all differ from mosess law or the writings of the prophets in the preface or introduction of them all for that moses introduces all his precepts with thus says the lord the lord spoke all these words and said the word of the lord came unto me  saying the lord has spoken and the like whereas in the talmud and all the collections of traditional explanations it is said by way of introduction rabbi simeon says thus rabbi juda says thus rabbi eliezer says thus and the like  and wherefore seek thou a cabbalistick scheme or a collection of traditional explanations upon the perfect law of mahomet art thou ignorant how the alcoran was brought down from heaven and given to our great apostle mahomet and that every musselman believes that it requires no other law to explain or enforce it  it is true that we have a sonnah in which are said to be contained traditional explanations of the text of the alcoran but the principles of the musselmans belief are such so plain and so few that no sonnah no traditional precepts can add to or explain our whole faith being contained in these two great fundamentals viz that god is but one god and that mahomet is his apostle or prophet  the sonnah or misna of our law may explain the precepts of mahomet respecting the conduct of his disciples or followers but the great point denominating a true musselman viz believing the unity of person and the dignity of mahomet admits no explanation neither is the sonnah of our emirs concerned in such a blasphemous attempt  leave off then enlightened morat thy old cabbalistick notions and lessen thy esteem for traditional ideas believe that god is one god and that mahomet is his prophet and enjoys the blessing of eden the promised pleasures of paradise where oceans of inexpressible bliss flow down in streams of delight where millions of shining beauties attend the faithful such as should one of them appear on earth all mankind would dye for the love of her and sink into inconceivable torment at the loss of her  give no jealousies to thy friends that thou art not thoroughly informed and have not embraced the right way with a perfect mind  perhaps it may be true that the law of moses may stand in need of interpretations and the solutions of learned and judicious men in doubtful and difficult cases about their sabbattical observations legal retributions etc may be useful precedents for the judgment of the elders in like cases among the jews to this time  though i confess i believe all those traditions and precedents have rather corrupted than informed their posterity and have spread a cloud or veil of darkness over their law rather than cleared it up from any difficulties that were in it before  but suppose it so for i know the rabbinists who are the chief sort of jews who i meet with in these parts of the world do all strictly adhere to the voice of the elders and therefore the whole study of their doctors is employed upon the misna which is the original authentic text of the jewish traditions or opinions of the elders  yet what is all this to the true musselmen who believe that mahomet was a prophet sent from god and that god gave him a body of written laws viz the alcoran seeing we have no need of rabbinical authorities or traditional institutes for the understanding that law  i am told here by some of the learned fathers or rabbis of the nazareens that one nicholas clenardus a famous man in the study of the laws of the messiah and filled with learning in all the languages which were in use in these parts of the world got a passport about   0 years ago viz the year      from the king of morocco for leave to come to fez in africa the capital city of the moors to study the arabic language which at that time not scarce a scholar in all the nazareen world could read a word of  it seems his design was that he might then search and open a door for others to search after him into the fundamentals of our principles examine the alcoran read the histories of our great prophet study the sonnahs of the ancient emirs and of the sacred tereh and all the collections of traditional knowledge they could reach in order to put the people here into a method to dispute successfully against the musselmendoctors and dervices as occasion might offer  but what did all the study of this famous man amount to for i hear he lived there eleven years in which time he made himself perfect master of the tongue and likewise enquired fully into the laws of mahomet but with what success may be seen by the rest of his life he became afterward a professor of arabic in the university of prague and after that in several other places and left so many scholars who were masters of the language in diverse parts of europe that the learned men here have a tolerable skill in the tongue to this day  but not one dispute with any musselman has ever that i have heard of been managed in consequence of this learned mans elaborate studies nor have they been able to enter into any one argument against the one great fundamental of mahomets laws viz that there is but one god or that god is one  wherefore then studiest thou learned morat to bring us to the rabbinick method of explanations in our law such as the traditions of our ancient muftis and doctors in mahomets law things of very little use while the precepts of mahomet are explicit and plain fully directing the faithful  thou will labor in light to bring forth darkness for verily as the traditions of the elders have eclipsed the true light of gods law among the jews so all the studies of the most learned men that are or that shall be hereafter will not add to the light of the true believers inspired by their great prophet to choose the right way  nay as thou art already convinced that the traditions of the jewish cabbala contain in them many things immoral and unjust and that therefore as thou have well argued against the jews from whom thou art happily for thee separated by the light of wisdom so thou may well conclude these rabbinick traditions infamous and to be rejected since it is inconsistent with the righteous and wise nature of the one god to give to his servants a holy written positive law full of wise and just commandments and then suffer men to destroy the intent and meaning nay the very foundation of the law by subsequent humane interpretations  this has exposed them to the nazareens as a most contemptible sect of self wise men but who in effect have rendered themselves fools by taking upon them to correct the righteous law of god and to enervate his commands by their absurd and corrupt glosses and explanations teaching men to understand the law of god in a manner not at all agreeable to what he at first directed them to understand it  be not thou like to them least thou bring thy self into contempt but let thy knowledge be improved to instruct men to pray for divine inspiration that truth may be its own interpreter in the hearts of the faithful the blessing of the great apostle be on all those that choose right things and let error and idolatry vanish from the earth  paris  th of the  th moon of the year      letter xii to the reis effendi or secretary of state the angels of paradise surround the dominions of thy lord the dew of hemus the shining of aarathes the calms of maathaon attend thy constant labors in the service of the happy emperor of the world  the empire of the franks begins to suffer convulsions which no power on earth has been ever able to bring her to before the duke of savoy a poor and contemptible prince reduced the last year to such extremities that his friends began to talk of his casting himself upon the clemency of the french king has this year appeared at the head of an army so superior to the french that disdaining to attack the towns he had lost or so much as to attempt to recover his dominions out of the hands of the french he has boldly entered france with his army and penetrated into the province of dauphine at the head of   000 men  in this attempt the french seem perfectly surprised they have no force at hand able to make head against him the duke has taken guillestre gap ambrun and have laid all the country far and near under contribution  this is what france has not felt for many ages all the power of the nations by which the french have been so vigorously attacked have not been able till now so much as to set a foot into her dominions she has always carried the war into her enemys country and maintained her troops at the expense of the nations she has made war with  but now while the king of france triumphed as it were in the ruin of this prince had taken from him the port of nice and the city of villa franca with all the country adjoining also the city of chamberry the impregnable fortress of montmelian the town and citadel of suza and the whole duchy of savoy and gave out that they would attack turin the capital of his dominions i say in this poverty of his circumstances the duke receives a supply of   000 germans in a body also  000 men raised by the assistance of the king of england and the dutch and a great sum of money from the same powers and making the marshall catinat who was the terror of the savoyard before retreat to pignerol he insults the dominions of france and enters the heart of the province of dauphine filling all places with the terror of an invasive war  this is a terrible mortification to the king of france it must be a blow to the glory of a man the most ambitious of fame in the world and it is a greater affliction as it is from a hand which they despised so much that it would not more surprise thee to find the dominions of the grand seignior invaded by the knights of maltha  this attack has roused the court from the lethargy of their pleasures the statesmen are filled with indignation at the insult offered the king the soldiery are eager to be put into a condition to engage the savoyard and make him pay dear for the attempt but the truth is all hands are employed the king has so many broils upon his hands that he is not able to apply a suitable remedy to these mischiefs in short there are no troops though the king of france has three hundred thousand men in pay yet he has such embarrassments on his hands that he knows not where to detach ten thousand men to protect his own dominions from an invasion which it was below him so much as to think of without leaving himself open to some other enemy ready to break in at the gap which those ten thousand men would make in his defenses  this shows the mistaken arrogance of this nation in general founded on the flatteries of the courtiers viz that france alone was able to make war against the whole united powers of europe  they are however obliged to venture it and strong detachments are ordered to be made from rousillon from french comte and from the upper rhine who make long matches to join monsieur catinat but it must be at least forty days march ere some of them can come up to him and what conquests the duke of savoy may make in that time we know not  they tremble at the very gates of lions one of the greatest and richest cities in france they repair the fortifications at thoulon and marseilles as if they feared a siege in a word all france is in a consternation to find  0000 men entered into the heart of the country and no forces ready or at least in condition to oppose them  the king alone shows a temper fitted for such a surprise when every one else discover the consternation they are in the king speaks cheerfully smiles at the mention of the duke of savoy and tells the courtiers the duke and he shall be good friends for all this and he will go back again quietly  what the king means none knows but himself but as all the king says is received here as an oracle the people take heart at it without any other foundation than that the king says it so true is it that it becomes kings and generals of armies never to show any concern at whatever dangers threaten them for the eyes of the whole nation are upon them and will be dejected or encouraged just as the countenance of their king or general appears anxious or gay  illustrious counselor of the prince of emperors how glorious is the ottoman throne shining with the luster of heaven guarded by the hands of millions of

year      letter xiii to morat ebn allwazhhair a learned man studying astronomy at hadramurt in arabia what art thou doing thou retired man and wherefore art thou buried alive these five and thirty years being wrapped up among the stars and beating thy brains with innumerable rolls of figures for the calculations of the revolution of commets and the eclipses of the planets in the systems of the planetary worlds not yet discovered  it is fifteen years ago since thou wrotest to me that thou had for twenty years before spent thy whole study in a fruitless endeavor to support the old philosophy and demonstrate the ptolomaian system against the objections of the moderns and against the notions of the european philosophers being very loath those infidels who had not sense to embrace the same just notions in religion with thy self should be able to arrive to a degree of knowledge in science superior to that which the ancient learned arabians first dictated for from them ptolomey received the rudiments and elements of the celestial motions which he formed into a scheme and got the honor of having it called by his name  but after twenty years study it seems thou art obliged to acknowledge the superior excellence of the copernican scheme and the farther improvements and additions of the new philosophy and that accordingly thou have sound methods to solve all the difficult phoenomena which so distracted aristotle and the greatest men of knowledge in the east  i am therefore to suppose thee now poring upon the motions of the planets in the solar system where thou have set the sun in the center as is no question its due being the life the guide the sovereign director under god the great director and in a word the very soul and being of the whole system  it may be thou have spent some time perhaps years to draw the just proportions of gravitation by which the distances and magnitude of the planets are only to be known and perhaps thou have discovered as i have done here by looking into the like calculations in the study of learned men here that the magnitude of the sun and our distance from it and likewise the distance of all the other planets from it and from one another are infinitely greater than they were supposed by our ancestors to be and perhaps infinitely greater than we yet think them to be seeing every calculation that has yet been justly and with good judgment made carries the sun farther and farther from us and adds to its dimentions till from first supposing it to be     times bigger than the earth we are now come to know that it is no less than  00000 times bigger and that its distance is in proportion removed so that we now speak of the earths being above  0 millions of miles and some say    millions of geometrical miles distant from the sun  that all the planets gravitate to the sun and the sun to them in just though differing proportions and that all those proportions are known and calculated in a regular manner by the rules of art i see no room to question and i doubt not but when thou see some of the calculations of the present masters in this noble study which i send thee herewith thou will readily acknowledge that they are very accurate  the improvements made here in the study of these things are exceeding great the king gives all possible encouragement to such studies has built them an observatory at a prodigious expense and furnished them with glasses for observation of the best that can be found in the world and every man who applies to this study is allowed the use of those glasses by the help of which it is wonderful to consider what new discoveries in nature men daily make and to what perfection in art they are arrived  happy morat thou who receivest by the sublime intellect a superior instruction art not doubtfully informed of all these things and i congratulate the advances which thou have made in that yet more unsearchable branch of astronomical knowledge viz the revolutions number magnitude and distance of the comets bodies altogether out of our reach as well as out of our sight  this difficult study if thou can bring it to perfection will put an end to all the enthusiastic whimsies of these nazareens who are continually poring upon and making calculations of the general point of nature when time shall finish its circle and the pulse of nature beat no more  for if as we firmly believe the general conflagration which is the end of all things shall be performed by the flame of a comet which in its direct motion shall at the appointed hour of nature come so near this earth as to set both it and the moon and perhaps all the planets of our system on fire so if thou can arrive by a just calculation at the knowledge of the proper revolution of this one comet thou shall be able without any other prophetic inspiration to tell us to a minute nay to one second of time when and in what manner the conflagration of this earth and in a word the end of all things shall begin  this noble study is worthy indeed of all thy powers and as thou art already in the garden of knowledge and drinkest daily of the inspiring streams of aroa jairoth a branch of the brook of eden either thou will attain this highest pinnacle of knowledge or i must conclude that god for wise and just reasons has entirely concealed this knowledge from men perhaps until mahomet shall be sent down again to bring supernatural light into the world  however morat as thou have doubtless made infinite discoveries in the secrets of nature and in the motions order and economy of the celestial bodies why should thou not communicate to others the parts proper to be known that succeeding time may enjoy the advantage of thy labors and study  for thou know well divine morat that so the destination of righteous power has appointed that knowledge dies with men and is not conveyed by generation or bequeathed by testament to our heirs  it is sufficient and what we rejoice in that the capacities of being instructed are often conveyed as the consequences of a sublimer spirituous nature in the ordinary course of generation the semen partaking of the extraordinary vigor of its ancestor prepares the case which shall embody the subsequent soul with dilated organs and extended parts adapted for the full reception of a capacious intellect and thus the son often partakes of the natural endowments of the father but never of the acquired till by the same erudition and application he furnishes himself after the example of his indefatigable parent  mark i say they are the capacities of nature which are thus conveyed by generation and that though these are often so conveyed yet that it is not so always on the contrary we frequently find that as among the kings of thy nation a weak supine stupid rhhoboam succeeded a wise and incomparably knowing solomon so idiots and fools are often the production of generating philosophers and politicians but i return to thy particular case  since then all this knowledge must die with thee and thou shall carry from thy children the whole sum of forty or fifty years study with thee into paradise there to delight thy self in the consummate discovery and that all this shall prepare thee only for the superior delights of the garden of wisdom what profit shall the world reap from thee if thou communicate not the elements of thy wisdom for posterity to build upon  the infidels among whom i dwell boasting of the improvements they make in the sublimest branches of humane knowledge reproach the musselmen of the eastern world with being enemies of learning and perfectly void of the advantages of science living like mere animals as they say without the study or desire of knowledge and wisdom  they discover their own ignorance and injustice in this not having been acquainted with the numerous retreats of the most knowing and most studious searches after wisdom in the world and which at this day take up the happy plains of hadrumurt the valleys of saada and the golden hills of oman the most delicious part of arabia faelix where the inspired souls of wise men are ravished with the delights of wisdom and where knowledge it self takes pleasure to dwell  but in this they might justly blame us if they were sensible where alone we are deficient that whereas the true searchers after knowledge find there infinite discoveries beyond all that nature has owned her self to be furnished with in other parts of the world yet the proficients ravished with the inexpressible joy of knowing whole nature live out their years in their silent raptures without leaving behind them in laborious volumes due schemes of the discoveries they make  i tell the people here if they would know perfectly the secrets of wisdom and have the reserved treasures of nature entirely opened to them they must go and dwell among the fathers of wisdom in the district of raled and drink of the waters of cazimurt where learning is inspired by that breath of god the air and wisdom flows in a stream like the river  but then i add that they will like them write no books and the world will receive no advantage from the learning and knowledge of their forefathers  o morat in this only i would have thee imitate the nazareens and as thou have made such advances in humane learning as the world never yet knew communicate thy knowledge for the good of mankind and let these infidels hereafter confess themselves beholding to a learned arab for more discoveries into celestial nature than all the tellescopes of europe or the studies of a thousand universities could supply  paris  0th of the   th moon of the year      the end of the second book a continuation of letters written by a spy at paris book iii letter i to issuff oglan bassa teacher of the exercises of arms to the young janissaries at constantinople i know thy worth and thy experience in martial affairs thy courage and the wounds which thou have received in thy faithful services to the grand seignior i remember the services of thy father who lost one of his arms with a cannonshot at the battle of raab i know how well thou meritest from the grand seignior who knowing very well thy worth has made thee inspector of that body which is the strength and defense of the empire  but as i flatter thee not at any time so much less can i withhold giving thee the needful instructions which my distance in this place furnishes me with for the public good  in a word faithful servant of the grand seignior you must notwithstanding the excellence of your present methods for disciplining and exercising the janissaries i say you must be content to vary as well the exercise as the weapons to which they are exercised so that as they excel all the nations of infidels in prowess and valor they may not be deficient in knowledge and experience and may be furnished with all those additions and helps to the valiant hearts they are masters of as may be sufficient to continue them in the reputation which they have so long enjoyed of being the best troops in the world  i need not argue with thee the necessity and usefulness of art in the well disciplining of soldiers why do we put weapons into their hands why do we call the war a trade an art why are the courages of men lifted up to a due pitch by enuring them to action and why do we form troops into regular bodies that they may support succor and encourage one another in fight but because all ways and methods are to be studied which may add to the terror of our arms and make our men superior to their enemies in warlike experience as well as in number and courage  as weapons are put into the hands of men to defend themselves and offend their enemies so all thy predecessors in the odas of the janissaries have thought fit to alter and change those weapons after the manner of other nations that they might find no disadvantage in the field against their enemies but might be always equally armed and equally exercised in the use of those arms as the other nations with whom they are to engage  that this has been the usage i refer thee to the rules of discipline established in the seraglio confirmed in the divan in the days of selym ussan cherger bassa aga of the janissaries in the time of amurath the first the glorious conqueror of mahomets enemies under whose reign the janissaries were first taught the use of the harquebuss or gun and began to throw away their javelines and bows and arrows where thou will find it said that whereas the christians made use of certain engines contrived to cast with great force leaden bullets point blank which they brought into the ranks making thereby great slaughter of their enemies that therefore it was agreeable to the law of mahomet to repel force with the like force and that thence forward powder should be made some renegade jews having brought with them the art of making it and also the use of those engines for shooting bullets called harquebusses and that for the time to come certain numbers of the janissaries of the most able bodies should be armed therewith to annoy the in fidels in the same manner as they intended to annoy others  sage instructor of the valiant youths the flower and pillar of the ottoman glory thou will learn from me that the use of arms the exercise the additional weapons are not only many which they use now in fight but the manner of using them varies very much and the french are in this so dextrous that they are at this time the teachers of their enemies and all the nazareens borrow from them not only the way of fighting encamping fortifying attacking etc but even the terms the language of the field is all french  think it not a useless caution that i admonish thee think it not below thee to learn all the improvements of the art of war from infidels and enemies i will tell thee wherein they can learn from thee they are not wanting every step of thy excellent discipline which they find useful they add to their own  particularly as thou have long ago taught the janissaries to throw away that useless cumbersome weapon the pike and instead thereof to make all thy soldiers able to fight offensively the french are taking the hint from thee and all the old regiments are made now as they call them here fuzileers having no use of the pike among them and this will no doubt become a practice through all the armies of the nazareens  but it shall remain upon record to thy praise that this custom was taken first from thee and that thereby the janissaries have been rendered the more terrible in fight for some years particularly at the defense of the town of buda and at the battle of nissa  now as they received this hint from thee o man of martial experience be content to take back in exchange the improvement they make here of arming their musketeers with a hanjarr or dagger which they call here a bayonet which in case of a close engagement with the enemy and particularly with the horse they place on the muzzle of their firearms and presenting the point to the enemy repulse thereby the most fierce attacks of the cavalry as well as of the infantry  so that by this method of fighting the ancient way of clubbing the musket and striking with the stock or butend of their pieces is also quite laid aside the point of the bayonet being presented with double force at the end of the musket being a much more terrible way of charging and doing much more execution than the stock of the musket  take this hint from me founded upon an old maxim among the men of the sword here  paris the   th day of the  d moon of the year      letter ii to mehemet asdan cupriogli victorious conqueror of the nazareens restorer of glory to the faithful the right hand of honor the star of praise mighty supporter of the tremendous throne of the invincible sultan achmet on whose head be eternal benediction to whom but to thee enured to glory and great actions should i send an account of the glorious progress of arms on this side the world and the conquest of a city impregnable in its situation made more so by art and in a word still made terrible by a numerous garrison of resolute and experienced soldiers  in a word while the potent confederacy of the germans dutch english scots irish and all the powers of the northern world were drawing together to fall upon the king of france as if they resolved to finish the war in one campaign and that no humane power was able to withstand them  while their numerous troops were reckoned up and the onlooking world was as it were amazed at the very thoughts of what would be done by such a collected power led on by such a martial prince as the new king of england or rather as we call him here prince of orange  while all eyes were turned upon the councils of france and every one wondered what course the king would take and what dispositions of his troops he would make to oppose such prodigious forces as seemed to threaten his dominions  i say while things were in this posture we see all the world under some kind of consternation except the king of france but of him it might be truly said that he alone made all these terrible things his sport smiles continually covered his face and he was ever gay he spent the day among the fair ones and diverted himself with balls operas feasts and shows as if the whole kingdom had been in profound peace  now and then and as if it had been for his diversions only he would steal away to his divan or chamber of privy counselors where he would stay so little as to be hardly missed and return as unconcerned as one who was only born for delight and swallowed up in pleasures  when on a sudden without the least noise or disorder news came to paris for we knew nothing of it before that namure the strongest town in flanders was invested by monsieur de boufflers and that the troops were all in full march from the frontier garrisons to form the siege  nor was this all but in two or three days more we found the kings fieldequipage preparing and were told that his majesty resolved to command the siege in person  it is impossible to describe to thee what hurry and confusion this real coup de eclat has put the world into the confederates drew together their forces in such numbers and with such assurance of success that people began to be very apprehensive of the success of the enterprise only the king and the duke of luxemburg pursue steddily the measures they have taken and depend upon the success  as the confederates talk of having an hundred thousand men to raise the siege the king resolved to have as many to cover the siege besides a sufficient force to carry it on  the king having resolved to be there in person all the household troops were ordered to march the gens de arms the light horse the guards de corpse all went away before and the duke of luxemburgh saw himself surrounded with     thousand men before the king came who brought with him about   000 men more  the siege in the mean time was carried on with such vigor that the city surrendered upon articles in less than    days the batteries consisting of   0 pieces of cannon and  0 mortars made such terrible work and the french followed their work so close with attack upon attack storm upon storm even from morning to night that nothing could withstand them  upon the city having surrendered the french had this advantage that their lines took up less circumference the castle and a strong fort which was lately built took up an angle formed by two rivers the meuse and the sambre so that the french had nothing to do but to extend their works from one river to the other exactly as the city of belgrade is situate in the angle between the danube and the sauve  the castle and fort made a stout resistance the latter being defended by monsieur cohorn the engineer who contrived and built it and after whose name it was called the cohorn fort this man is no less a soldier than an engineer and is one of the best officers in this part of the world both for experience in conduct as well as courage in action  the vigor of this defense gave the prince of orange time to collect his troops and being as good as his word he approached the leaguer with an army of no less than ninety five thousand men and which was still more these troops were thought to be all old experienced regiments the flower of the military men in this part of the world  yet in sight of this army and as if they were come only to be witnesses to the glory of the french power the king of france carried the place the duke of luxemburgh covered the siege with an army at least equal to that of the confederates but posted so with a river in his front to advantage entrenched all the avenues to his camp and fortified in such a manner and those trenches mounted with such an innumerable number of cannon that it was impossible for the prince of orange to attack him or so much as to pass the river though it was but a small one to approach his entrenchments  it is true the confederates made several motions this way and that to draw him out of that situation but it would not do and the river swelling at the same time with a hasty rain gave them some excuse for not attempting what they saw could not be done without hazarding the ruin of their whole army  in the mean time the king pushing on the attacks against the place the works were continually stormed day and night the garrison was plied with incessant batteries and assaults so that all the outworks being won the garrison was obliged to capitulate after having lost above  000 men of their number in the siege  the reputation this has given to the french arms the vigor it has put into their measures and councils at a time when all europe expected they would have been oppressed with the power of so many enemies is not to be expressed nor is it to be equaled by any thing in the world but thy glorious enterprises in hungaria where thou have retrieved the honor of the ottoman arms and curbed the insolence of the enemies of thy masters glory in a manner surprising to the whole world  illustrious and fortunate general thou alone outshinest the glories of the greatest heroes may thy name be terrible and thy arm victorious till thou exaltest the crescent of mahomet upon the spire of the great mosque at vienna from whence the triumphing nazareens had the insolence to take it down after it had been an hundred and twenty years a testimony to the powerful arms of the magnificent solomon emperor of the musselmen  paris   th of the  th moon of the year      letter iii to the aga of the janissaries the nazareens the ancient enemies of god and his great prophet whose champion thou art are universally involved in war the german emperor head of the princes of the people believing in jesus and of the followers of the messiah is engaged in a bloody and heavy war against the french  though his power is great his troops numerous and well disciplined and his generals are men of gallantry and experience yet the vigilance and velocity of the french motions their subtilty in contriving their attacks and celerity in execution of their designs are such that the germans are every where worsted and defeated  the king of france is devoured in imagination but he always extricates himself by the admirable vivacity of his councils and the vigor of his generals he conquers on every hand and his turning the schemes of his adversaries all upon themselves by being before them in every action is the astonishment of mankind  the nothern powers have placed at the head of their confederacy a prince politic in council as tomombcius the mamuluck furious in battle as scanderbeg the epirot warlike in genius as isurael the persian but as all these were unfortunate and their powers at last fell under the irresistible hand of the ottoman power so the prince of orange is made glorious only by being defeated and the greatness of his soul seems rather illustrated by his equal mind under his misfortunes than by the laurels and triumphs of victory  in the beginning of the year he had the honor of seeing the king of france take the strongest fortress on the frontiers of the netherlands while he looked on at the head of a hundred thousand men but was not able to relieve it and now he has had the misfortune of attacking the french army at a village called steenkirk but has been beaten off with the loss of above  000 men and some of his best generals and has taken the pains to bring the duke of luxemburgh a victory to the very lines of his camp  in germany the king of france gains every campaign and this year he has plundered the frontiers of the empire and in view of a superior army forced the germans to repass the rhine and at last though he refused to fight their whole army has defeated a body of  000 horse which he surprised at a distance from their grand army and cut them in pieces almost to a man  thus this invincible monarch though he struggles with innumerable difficulties at home and though he has most powerful enemies abroad even on every side of him triumphs in their disappointment and will in time most certainly reduce them all one after another if some unexpected blow does not intervene to disable him at once and even this there seems to be no danger of where the power is so great and the prince so vigilant that it seems next to impossible to surprise him  the fortune of this man puts me in mind of saladin the famous prince of the arabians or of their successors the saracens who when overpowered and surrounded with innumerable armies of the nazareens who blind zeal inspired to make war upon the true musselmen on pretense of recovering the sepulcher of jesus the son of mary this prince by his vigilance and valor accompanied with a never wearied application at length conquered them all and sent them home to instruct their posterity how foolish an enterprise their fathers spent their blood and treasure upon viz to look for the sepulcher of him who was taken up into heaven  so may the arms of the invincible sultan achmet thy glorious master prosper in thy hands till the germans and other nations of the nazareens who have so long in vain lifted up the sword against him may see and repent of their folly and admonish their posterity to avoid splitting on the same rock  valiant aga wherefore is it that the experience and valor of the janissaries has not yet convinced the grand vizier of the usefulness and necessity of keeping up a larger body of those gallant troops suitable to the greatness and extent of the dominions of mahomet and proportioned to the growing power of the nazareens who by their advantages over the true believers are grown more powerful and more insolent than ever  why are not the odas of the janissaries increased in every beglerbeg or government nay why are not all the soldiers of the grand seignior made janissaries viz taught discipline enured to hardships instructed in due subordination to their officers and in a word made good soldiers  the courage the gallantry in spirit the strength and agility of body with which our people are endowed far exceeds the nations they are engaged with what are the french the italians the hungarians they have neither the constancy of mind or strength of body as the bulgarian thracian georgian and armenian janissaries the french common soldiers are low and despicable their limbs weak their subsistence mean their intemperance weakens and debilitates them and they seem capable of no service yet we see them often by the excellent conduct of their officers and their own being enured to the war i say we see them often break the undisciplined nations of other countries nay even of the germans themselves by their dextrous use of their arms and the fire of their martial disposition  were the subjects of the grand seignior thus bred to the field were they daily and duly exercised as the janissaries we know the martial genius the undaunted spirit the constancy and courage of the faithful musselmen is such that they would cut the germans in pieces the best troops of these infidel nations could not stand before them if this is not done take mahmuts word the art of war is so much improved the methods of fighting so altered and the engines and the devices of the generals so differing from what it was in our forefathers days that it will be impossible for any of the grand seigniors troops but the janissaries and spahis to stand their ground against their enemies their number must be increased and they must be encouraged equal to their deserts and then the ottoman arms shall triumph as they have always done over infidel nations to the day when the great gates of eden shall be opened and the faithful shall with swords of flame destroy the enemies of mahomet  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter iv to the aga of the janisaries it was thought in the beginning of this year that the king of frances good fortune began to leave him things went exceeding hard with him on every side for though he had taken the usual advantages of the spring by being early in the field as was always the custom of france and by which they used to have the better hand of the confederates and had thereby taken namure as i have written already to the grand vizier yet the confederatearmy harrassd the french frontiers in flanders extremely after this and attacked their whole army in their camp though without success in the end  two blows have since that befallen france which are as two stabs into the vitals of a body which before was struggling for life and it was thought had they been followed home the glory of the king of france must have expired these were the overthrow of their fleet by the english and dutch and the penetrating into the bowels of france by the duke of savoy at the head of  0000 men where he committed most dreadful ravages and burnt above a hundred towns of both which i have written fully to the kaimacham who will doubtless communicate the particulars to thee  the french nation were so humbled by these two fatal strokes coming together to neither of which they were in a condition to apply any immediate remedy and especially being at the same time threatened with a powerful invasion or descent of an army from england that they fell to what they call here the last remedy viz prayers to their messiah to this end a general day of biram was proclaimed by the great mufti of paris throughout his districts and so by the other pontifical muftis in their respective dominations with strict orders that all the people should apply themselves to their devotions and to call upon their god in the name of the son of mary to deliver them  whether it were that the sins of the other nazareen nations were so great that heaven did not think sit to chastise france by their hands or whether their prophet jesus to whom the french were said they put up their petitions did obtain help for them i do not well know how to resolve for these nazareens of france have so many intercessors that it is hard to resolve who they will thank for their deliverance or who they will acknowledge to have procured it for some pray to god alone others to jesus and some to his mother some to this old hermit some to another so that it is certain there are almost as many idols as worshipers  however it was this is certain that the whole stream of successes seems to be turned on a sudden and the attempts of the enemies of france however probable and however powerful have miscarried on every side and the king of france is in a fair way to conclude the year with a general triumph over his enemies  in truth o thou fortunate leader of the select bands of the faithful the sword in the hands of the soldier is never in vain lifted up when the eyes of those who fight are first lifted up to heaven for whether god hears these infidels or not in respect to their wrong and ill directed worship yet he may give ear to all his creatures when they lift their hands to him for help against their enemies and deliver them that they may de directed to seek the right way of applying themselves on farther occasions  hence it was without doubt that the more pure prayers of the faithful mussulmen in their great pilgrimage or procession to mecca the year before the last obtained the future favor of our great prophet who strengthened the arms and sharpened the scymaters of the janissaries to hew down the enemies of the grand seignior  it consists well with the notions we entertain of the great alla who guides the affairs of men whether private and personal or national that he sometimes hears even the calamities of infidel nations and turns the scale of his providence as they turn their eyes upwards though otherwise they may be impious transgressors of his law for heaven never can be said to stand neuter in the concerns of war and peace between nations though the contending parties may be equally infidels and enemies to god but he delivers here and delivers up there as it best answers the great ends of his glory in the earth  how much more then shall he hear the prayers of his faithful people who choose the right way and what courage must this give to the hands and hearts of thy immortal soldiers when they know the whole choir of believers five times a day make prayers for their victorious progress in the field  but to do the king of france justice after all this he took care to pray and fight whether it was that he had less confidence in the priest than in the sword i will not determine but he applied himself with infinite vigilance to every attack that was made upon him and his troops brought him unexpected victories from several quarters  at the same time heaven concurred and two things more especially seemed to be the immediate act of a supernatural power for example the duke of savoy in the middle of his success when he was entered the very heart of the dauphinate and promised to himself the plunder of the cities of briancon and grenoble nay as some said expected to pass the rhosne and penetrate into languedoc in the middle of all this triumph the duke who was the soul of the enterprise was struck from heaven with a loathsome disease which they call here les petits veroles a distemper not known in the happy climate of arabia where thou and i drew our serener breath  they tell us a story here and boast much of it though i tell thee beforehand i believe not one word of it that the very moment that the king of france was on his knees in the royal chapel or mosque of his serail or palace at versailles praying to the image of mary the mother of their prophet jesus she struck the duke of savoy with the smallpox if this were true the french would have much more reason to worship that old woman than any of us believe they have  but to leave these nazareens to their superstitions certain it is the duke was taken so ill and was brought into so much danger of his life by this distemper that it put a full stop to all his conquests and the troops retired in the best manner they could quitted all the places they had taken broke down the bridges behind them and rather fled than marched quite out of france and that faster than they came in and yet the french army was not in any posture to precipitate them at all neither did any one pursue them  whether the king of france will acknowledge this to be the hand of god or of the woman mary i know not but this i know that if he takes the honor from the hand that has really saved him in so remarkable a manner and pays the acknowledgment of it to the image of that woman it would be very righteous in the great retalliator of just sentences to make the same hand of savoy scourge him into a more rightly directed devotion  but he has bad another deliverance also immediately from heaven for the english army who were not only appointed but actually shipped and sailed in order to make a descent upon the kingdom of france and which it was apparent the french were in great apprehensions of because they knew not where to look for them or provide against them are returned and relanded in england having given over the design without its being possible to see any apparent reason for their doing so  being thus at once delivered from these two great and threatening articles they were not only easy but at leisure to apply proper remedies to the other parts where they were weakest and first the duke of luxemburg having been attacked by the king of england at steenkirk in flanders he repulst him after a very obstinate fight with the loss of near  000 men killed wounded and taken prisoners and believing himself by this victory able to stand his ground with fewer troops than before great detatchments have been made to the rhine and to piedmont of which i shall give thee a full account in my next  illustrious aga as these bloody wars destroy multitudes of men and the nazareens are thus cutting one another in pieces let thy victorious ensigns cheerfully advance secure of conquest assisted by the prayers of our great prophet and thy unwearied valor and council  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter v to the venerable mufti sage mirror of celestial wisdom the inlightend prince of the oracles of virtue guide of the true believers to the glories of paradise and keeper of the garden of pleasure verily the affairs of religion in these parts of the world tend apparently to the forgetting entirely that there is a rule for men on earth or a god to judge in heaven it would amaze thee venerable and wise patron of piety it would amaze thee i say to see how that bawble called religion is kicked about here even among the men pretending to learning understanding and the height of humane knowledge till it grows into contempt and will in a little time be entirely lost nay perhaps it may be no more remembered no not so much as the name of it  it is true there is so much gain made here by the show of it that for ought i know the formalities of religion may continue some time at least till the pride luxury and lewdness of the clergy provoke the common people to do themselves justice upon the priests which will certainly happen the first occasion the mob have to get so much power into their hands and then as the substance of religion never was among them the shadow will wear off with small difficulty  here was a book published a few months ago by a man who does not want wit entitled the vanity of religion and the necessity of the disguise of it being thrown off he would insinuate that seeing the wicked lives of the clergy or dervices makes it manifest to the world that there is no such thing as religion really and at the bottom of all their schemes but that it is a mere grimace and a piece of hypocrisy to get money and dominion one over another that therefore men ought to deliver themselves from the insupportable weight of the disguise of religion and make no farther pretenses to it in the world  some people take this to be a satyr only and pointed at the hypocrisy and cheats of the clergy who under the color of religious habits and orders are the protectors and encouragers of all sorts of wickedness but we as true mussulmen join in the litteral sense of the words and believe they ought to throw off all the disguise own the cheat and pretend no more to any thing of that which they call religion here embracing at the same time the most pure and perfect rules of blessedness from the mouth of undisguised truth owning and adhering to the everlasting oracle and the law of the great prophet mahomet  some time since i heard that the great mufti of the nazareens the prince of delusions and patron of apostate mysteries who calls himself the head of the followers of jesus the son of mary the infallible guide of the law and interpreter of the faith and doctrine of the christians was at the point of death  upon this news it is scarce possible to describe to thee what running and posting what intreaguing and caballing there was among the princes and courts in this part of the world to make an interest for a new election france is particularly concerned if possible to have a new pope elected out of the number of cardinals who are in the french interest and couriers are dispatched to all the cardinals that are so to set out immediately for rome to be present at the new election and take care of the main point in the conclave it is worthy of thy self sublime judge of venerable truth to search into the policies of those people and to have an account of this election faithfully laid before thee i shall take care to obtain as many particulars as may be depended upon and lay them at thy sacred feet as they go on  in the mean time i observe no grief for the loss of him that is going of what import say they is the death of an old man the regard to the person of the late pope is all swallowed up in the politic bustle they make for a new election and in this part spain and the emperor are the particular opposers of the french interest  this dead pope has sat in the chair of the pontiff but fifteen months and is no less than eighty one years of age i call him dead because soon after an express arrived with an account of his death the particulars i have of it as published here by the court are thus  he had been indisposed for four or five days and having reason on account of his great age to expect the first shock would carry him off he disposed himself for his exit he discoursed much the    th of the moon called january to the cardinals concerning the several interests of europe and his endeavors to prevent the growing mischiefs of the war which however he saw was impossible he passed some bulls and declared against some encroachments of the king of france upon the church  the  0 th he found himself very ill and the    st much worse and his end drawing on which obliged the cardinals and more especially his favorites to keep near his person next morning being somewhat better he received the sacred oil as they call it and the rest of the seals of their religion and discoursed a long time with cardinal colorede his confessor and other ecclesiastics upon matters of piety after which the cardinals being brought to his bed one after another he recommended it earnestly to their care to cast their eyes in the next conclave upon a worthy person to fill st peters chair more especially considering the consequence of the election at such a juncture of the affairs of europe he expired the night of the same day about four of the clock in the morning aged fourscore and one years after he had sat fifteen months and twenty two days being elected the    th of the moon which they call october       the meeting of the conclave their manner of electing the rules of their strict or rather mock confinement during the time of their electing this thou art fully acquainted with and i have no need to trouble thee with repetitions  it is not yet known who shall succeed in the pontificate of idolaters neither is it of much consequence for though the popes themselves labor very assiduously to make themselves considerable to the princes of europe yet the princes on the other hand oftentimes take occasion to mortify the popes and to let them see the insignificancy of their power when it comes in competition with temporal interest i say this makes the whole system of the papacy a mere piece of political pageantry carried on to support the pride and luxury of the clergy and which is in it self nothing at all but a bubble of air and emptiness when it comes to be tried with its superiors the secular powers of europe  the conclave is met and the last pope has left it full which has not been known in the memory of man this pope was a person of the least signification of any that has sat in this chair of abomination for many ages and can only have this said in his favor that he has done neither good nor harm he has left little but his name to put posterity in mind that ever he was here he was superannuated when he came in and after a stay only of one year and three moons left the chair of the old fisherman just where he found it  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter vi to ali bassa chief of the engineers and seraskeir of the morea i cannot have a fairer occasion to give thee an account of something in thine own way than what offers just now among the nazareens the castle of montmelian is a fortress in the duchy of savoy which for many ages has been thought impregnable as well by the difficulty of its situation as the addition of all the fortifications that art could invent or the best engineers of this country contrive to render it perfectly inaccessible  it is seated upon a monstrous rock exceeding high steep and inaccessible except on one end where it runs out long narrow and sloping down till it gradually comes level to a little plain from whence they pass to a little river with a bridge over it called the isera  this is the only passage into the fort but is so taken up with works innumerable one above another and one defending another that it is not to be conceived how art should find its way among such opposition to work it self into the town  it is commanded by one rock which indeed overlooks this part but there is no possible getting any cannon up to that rock except by pullies and engines and this must be done in the face of the fire of the forts on the hill of the castle  yet this impregnable fortress has been taken by the french after a long blockade in a few days formal siege and that in the most severe season of the year when the mountains of which the whole country is composed were all covered with snow and the cold so severe that every one thought it insupportable  this however surprises no body here whatever it may do in other countries for france has always his men ready to take the field his magazines and his arsenals are always well furnished and he has such good generals and such a great number of officers that they make it a point of honor to expose their lives when it is for the glory of the french monarchy besides the monarch himself little cares how he sacrifices his best soldiers and being absolute exacts such vast sums from his subjects makes his soldiers march all seasons of the year and takes his time and his measures so exactly that he may be said to play a sure game whenever he has a mind to make himself master of any place  of this they that have to deal with france ought to be sensible in good earnest for so long as they are not vigilant and upon their guard france will be always upon the surprise with them it is in vain to trust in the situation of a fortress if there be not men in a condition to be stirring at all times there are no places now adays impregnable unless they be relieved in time the fortresses that are the highest raised are no less subject to the destruction of the bombs and carcasses than to the strokes of thundering cannon so that all that great guns can tear down must yield at length to a conqueror that resolves to spare neither lives nor limbs to make himself master of a place especially when unmolested from without since artillery came in use there is nothing can resist the force of it when the general that besieges has no enemy to disturb him behind the engines now adays made use of give the besieged so little time to look about em that many times they are taken when they think to make the stoutest defense and therefore the surest way is always to have men lie ready near those places which are most in danger that in case of necessity they may be able to form a body sufficient to encounter the enemy  this place was taken in two and thirty days principally by the power of battering and mining for there was not any one attack made of any consequence  the besieged defended themselves without much use of either great shot or small shot and yet they killed the french a great many brave men and some considerable officers their chief defense was countermining the works of the assailants and rolling great stones upon them from the tops and ascents of the rocks which coming so furiously and receiving additional strength to the motion from the heights from whence they were cast were not to be resisted no not so much as the shot of great guns might have been resisted  the garrison plied them with this sort of battery incessantly so that no sconer had the assailants raised a battery of cannon or any work to cover or lodge their men but in one nights time it was overthrown and as it were buried with stones and the vast quantity of rubbish the stones brought with them so that the cannon were dismounted as it were in a moment or perhaps broken and the carriages clogged so as not to be stirred stones of two or three ton coming down continually upon them from the summits of an immense mountain  the bombs however and miners reduced the place and a bomb by accident breaking into one of the mines which the garrison themselves had made to ruin the approaches blew up the great bastion of the place at which breach the french taking hold of the occasion six hundred men immediately entered and the garrison seeing themselves surprised beat a parley  the garrison were but  00 men and it is observed that they were so secured in the retreats which they had in the rock from the shot and bombs that though the french were not sparing of either one or other yet they lost very few men within the place i think less than  0 whereas the french lost above   00 men without besides such as died by the extremities of the weather which were a great many  but that which is yet more strange than all this is that the king of france has given positive orders to have the place entirely demolished which some people think to be very ill policy but i am of opinion i confess that the king is in the right for he concludes that on a peace which he knew would sometime or other happen it must be restored and he is not willing it should cost him  000 men again if he should ever have an occasion to lay another siege to it and as the fortifications before were made by the french he knows the duke of savoy cannot spare so much money as it must cost to restore them to what they were before  for thy farther improvement in the art of fortifications and attacks of towns and to acquaint thee with the noble experiment daily made on these occasions by this aspiring infidel nation i shall send thee several plans and drafts of the

me in this retired piece of secret service i say i never doubted but if there was one man in the whole empire fitter than another for the work thou would find him out  and yet it never entered into my thoughts that thou should send as far as algier on the borders of the empire of morocco for a man who has for many years had upon his hands an employment in its nature the same though not so filled with variety as this of mine  morat oglou the son of the late chaioux bassa is a person so well versed in the courts and affairs of the nazareens that i know not a man fitted like him for this employment i remember very well the errand he was sent upon to the english court and how well he discharged himself during his residence there for twelve years and i have much wondered that such a genius could be buried in silence for so long time as he has been in africa though i doubt not but he has employed his hours in the most useful manner and with the most advantage possible to himself  i know he will come hither stored with knowledge in the public affairs of the nazareen countries as well as with the wisdom of the arabians whose language and manners as well as studies he is thoroughly master of his genius enclines him to all useful studies he is a great master of history and of natural philosophy and as i have been told has for some years among the moors addicted himself to the study of the heavenly motions and is the most perfect astronomer in that country  i shall rejoice at his arriving here and shall not fail to dispatch the orders i have received from thee to the jew at florence that he may give him notice of the grand seigniors pleasure  it will not a little contribute to our great masters service if he takes the nearest passage by sea to alicant and travels through spain and portugal to bring with him some account of things transacting in those courts  i shall obey the orders of the divan who direct that i should assist a year after his coming here to

viii to the aga of the janissaries i have already written to thee an account how the good fortune of the king of france is returned to him and this campaign which in one part of it was most fatal to france and threatening to be still more so has appeared more to the glory of the french nation and particularly of the king than any since the war begun  the beginning of the season the campaign was opened with the siege of namure a terrible place for strength and yet taken in the view of an hundred thousand men and headed by the greatest and most formidable enemy the king of france has in the world viz the king of england a man whose character rises in the world like a new star in a constellation never discovered before  after this the same king of england with that great army warmly endeavored to bring the duke of luxemburgh to a battle but yet when he attempted to force him to it by attacking him at steenkirk was repulsed and obliged to retreat with very great loss of his best men several generals of great reputation have been killed in this attempt with abundance of officers and six or eight thousand soldiers  the campaign on the rhine seemed to be going off without action but the duke de lorge the french general who commanded there having received some forces from flanders followed the germans so well and managed so subtly that at length he tricked them into a separation and then turning short upon one half of them before they could join again fell upon that part of their army which marched under the duke of wirtemberg toward germany defeated them entirely cut  000 of them in pieces took  000 prisoners a great many officers of note and among them the duke himself  after this pursuing the other body who were commanded by the landgrave of hesse and had laid siege to the strong fortress of ebrenburgh he obliged them to raise the siege with great precipitation and in the mean time monsieur de lorge had ordered a body of troops to make the usual havoc of a conqueror in the duke of wirtemburgs country and the circles adjacent where besides the plunder they gained which was prodigious great they raised some millions of money for contribution  the germans have received this blow as a just return for their drawing so many of their troops from the rhine to fight against the faithful mussulmen in hungaria which they do upon a supposition that the princes of the confederacy would supply them with other troops in their stead how well they perform it this is an example and i rather send thee this account because thou may gather from it that the emperor of the nazareens has already sent for five german regiments of foot and four regiments of horse from hungary the foot making    00 men and the horse  000 and thou may depend that every blow the emperor receives upon the rhine will be felt in hungary where the troops of the grand seignior on whose arms be the luster of heaven will have so much the more room to act with success  in catalonia the french general with the assistance of a squadron of men of war from thoulon has in less than twelve days taken the strong town and port of roses a conquest the more considerable because of its being the best harbor for shipping that the spaniards have upon the whole continent of their dominions in the mediterranean  the method the court of france takes when any prisoners of quality fall into their hands is very singular and worth thy observation in this place as it recommends the civility of the french nation to all the world the prince of wirtemberg taken prisoner as i have said by the duke de lorge is a man of arms a lieutenant general in the emperors army and a prince of the empire also though he was but administrator at present of the duchy of wirtemberg for the heir his nephew who is a minor  thou will observe in the usage this prince met with how well the french soldiers know their duty and what respect their king and all his generals by his command shows to captived princes or officers of quality when he was taken prisoner which it seems was by a lieutenant of horse he had not the least violence offered him or any thing taken from him only the officer desired some token from him that he was the person that gave him his hand that is to say that took him prisoner and saved him from the fury of the soldiers upon which the duke took a fine diamondring from his finger and a gold watch out of his pocket and gave to the lieutenant who returned him his watch again and took his parole of honor that he would not offer to escape  the duke however desired the lieutenant to accompany him to the generals tent which being in the heat of action he could not do without leave of his captain but the captain upon the news saluted the prince and gave the lieutenant orders to attend him  when he was brought to the duke de lorges tent at his first salute he presented his sword and pistols to him the prince holding the point of the sword and the muzzles of the pistols toward himself which is the custom in the field when an officer demands quarter  the duke de lorge treated him with all possible respect gave him back his sword and taking his parole gave him a guard of two captains to attend him but without any restraint except that as he was under promise it was understood that he was not to quit the camp  after the first ceremony the general asked his highness if the people that took him had offered him any violence or taken any thing from him the prince told him no but that on the contrary the lieutenant to whom he surrendered had with some hazard to himself prevented two troopers with whom he the prince was engaged from wounding him first as well as rifling him afterward  upon this the general caused the lieutenant to be called in and asking the prince what the value of what he had about him might amount to he said about a thousand crowns immediately he made the lieutenant captain of a troop in the same regiment he served in and told him that was for the service he had done the king then he gave him a thousand crowns in money and told him that was for his care of the prince his prisoner in return to this the lieutenant pulled off the ring he had taken of the duke as a token and restored it the duke took the ring but the next morning sent it him again and an assignment on the townhouse of nurembergh for  00 crowns a year during his life  when the prince had been some time at strasburgh the king sent him an invitation to come to paris ordered his journey to be defrayed all the way ordered all the governors of towns to receive him as a prince to show him all military honors to let him visit the fortifications and to beat the drums as he passed as if he had been a general of their own army  when he came to versailles he was treated with the same generosity and with great magnificence the king received him with the utmost civility and ceremony only told him he was obliged not to say he was glad to see him because of the circumstances  he was invited to come often to court and whenever he did come the officers of the kitchen had orders to provide a table for him the master of the horse had orders to provide the coaches for him and whenever he pleased to hunt the querries furnished him with horses hounds and attendance from the kings stables  the king presented him with his picture set with diamonds and with a very fine jewel and told him he was sorry his ransom was not sufficient to make it worth his presenting him with his liberty but he hoped he would take the freedom of going home whenever he pleased and in the mean time all the care possible should be taken to make him forget his misfortunes  valiant aga may the angel that keeps the holy gate guard thee from falling into the hands of the enemies of mahomet let princes be thy prisoners and the swords of the mightiest of thy enemies be delivered into thy hands cruelty is not in thy nature happy will they be who fall into thy generous hands who know as well how to be merciful to the miserable as terrible to the desperate  i must confess this courteous usage of prisoners is a generous practice and very consistent with the fiercest and most vigorous methods of making war and always has this effect to the advantage of those that practice it that it is a debt which some time or other comes to be paid to advantage  it is to be observed also that though the prince had all possible liberty to go where he pleased yet having passed his parole viz to be a prisoner he was obliged not to serve again or to appear in the field again till his ransom was paid or that he was exchanged according to the cartel or agreement for exchange of prisoners  paris  th of the  th moon of the year      letter ix to zema ellmahannon an old dervice at damascus the affairs of the world are not uncertain by a mere fortuitous accident of causes or in obedience to the ill fate of men upon whom those uncertainties fall but by the mere course of nature the necessary event of things tending naturally to daily revolution  death the common law of nature is not an accident to life but a mere consequence of being every thing that has a beginning must necessarily end otherwise it would be a monstrous rupture in the course of nature  nature it self is mortal it is a machine made up of innumerable consequences attending the first great cause the motion given it shall continue as long as the hand which first put it together appointed it to go but when the weights are once run down when the clue is wound off all the powers cease nothing can wind it up again  hence those philosophers here who follow the old notion of epicurus that the world was made or rather made it self by mere chance by a fortuitous conjunction of atoms i say these philosophers argue not only absurdly but even to the last degree weakly and foolishly for having traced the beginning of nature to the atoms or particles of matter flowing in the abyss by whose conjunction and attrition the beautiful frame of the world has been made and its motion performed i say they argue absurdly for they most ignorantly pass over the just progress of the inquiry who first gave being to those atoms which one question destroys all their system according to that distich of the poet speaking of the atoms jumbling together into the frame of the world forgetting that some power must first bestow existence on those atoms that did so   they have another fable here among the naturalists but it seems not only an ignorant one but a very unnatural one viz that man made himself i remember a learned arabian at the holy city when in my youth i attended the sacred service with my father i say a learned arabian had a debate with as learned a jew on the point i mention viz of a first cause in nature and coming down to the being of man the jew urged an argument which i now find much in use in this nation of atheists and deists among whom i live viz of man being his own maker why then says amiaz zebir oglou so was the ancient arabian called why then says he man must be eternal for what could give it self life could certainly preserve life and if man is eternal says he then man is god for whatever is eternal is god  the ancients told a merry fable of prometheus who having made a man of clay stole fire from the sun to put life into his figure for which felony say they he was condemned to be chained down to a rock where a great vulture was always preying upon his bowels  but looking into an english poet lately where this fable was mentioned as alluding to the ancient principle of atheism above i met these lines drawn from the same reasoning as those above the great promethean artist poets say first made the model of a man in clay contrived the form of parts and when he had done stole vital heat from the prolifick sun but not a poet tells us to this day who made prometheus first and who the clay who gave the great prolifick to the sun and where the first productive work begun   i wonder often how these nazareens who are nevertheless a knowing and learned people especially in these parts i say i often reflect with wonder whence this brutish notion is derived i mean of denying the being of a god and all the subsequent notions of the worlds eternity mans selfexistent power and the like  upon the whole i have resolved it into this that it is the natural consequence of the corruption of their own religion for while their priests set up here so many absurdities and pay their adorations to so many supposed deities men of penetration frequently see through all the false glosses of the clergy and find it often a legend of forgeries a mere bundle of nonsense and inconsistencies and then not being enlightened from heaven with the sacred knowledge of the true one god it leads them into a contempt of all principles and their religion dwindles away to nothing they begin in ridiculing their own profession and then go on to the great extreme of denying even god himself  such a crime is never found among the followers of mahomet the first principle of whose religion contains a confession of one god the faithful are therefore called mussulmans the name we boast of signifying a believer of the one god and of mahomet his prophet  the light of the divine oracle which inspired mahomet shines into the understandings of the faithful and they worship the creator of the world they neither kneel to a piece of bread nor worship an old woman and call her gods mother but declare to all the world that god is one god and to him alone we pray with incessant prayers revolving the moon and constant as the day  receive righteous zema the relation of the blasphemies of these mockers of god and pray to mahomet that all his faithful followers may be kept in the right way  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter x to ali bassa chief of the engineers and seraskeir of the morea when i wrote last to thee i gave thee an account of the taking the strong town of montmelian in the dominions of savoy with some description of the fortress it self and bad thee to expect to hear from me again  according to my word i here send thee true drafts of the several towns and the sieges of them which have been carried on these last two years by the french who are now certainly the best masters in the world of the art of raising fortifications and of attacking them when they have done  the fortifications of the town and port of dunkirk i send thee as a thing by it self because i am informed the grand seignior has commanded thee to make a port and harbor at candia which he designs to make the strongest city and the safest harbor in the world  thou will see by this plan that the french engineers had a piece of work to do here the situation of which did not appear to the eye capable of being made to bear the perfection of it they had a harbor and basin to build which the king resolved should be capable of receiving his largest men of war some of which drew    to    foot water and the channel of the port they had to work it on had not above    foot water at the highest tides and this upon a flat shore where the sea except at springtides scarce flowed   foot in a tide sometimes scarce flowed at all into the town  to bring this to perfection the engineers first considered a small river which passed through the flat country above and emptied it self into the sea at this place whose little channel scarce deserving the name of a river made the port  the first thing the engineers had to do was to draw the water of several other small rivers which in their natural course ran into the sea at other places on the coast to join their waters with this little stream and then they laid the large parts of low land which you see marked in the plan together for receiving the quantity of water when it should come in and stop it in this river when the sluices were shut  below the conjunction of these waters several large sluices were made to stop their course and swell them till they flowed over all those lands and so keep them up till a very great head of water was gotten together for the uses of which i shall speak presently  when this provision for a backwater was first made then they went to work with the channel of the port which they cut    foot in depth into the earth deeper than it was before  to secure this work and preserve the depth of the channel which the sea would otherwise fill up even in one tide it being a very flat and sandy shore i say to secure this they built those two prodigious jettes or peirs which you see in the draught which ran out into the sea no less than   000 hemizas being almost an english mile and a half even to low watermark formed of an innumerable number of trees of an immense size bound with iron and sharpened at bottom and driven with the force of mighty blows by a bolqueen of a ton weight raised high in the air and let fall at once they call these trees here pilotis  these two peirs being made solid the spaces filled up with stone and chalk and the heads joined together with bars of iron are firm as the solid earth and breaking off the violence of the sea make the space between a calm safe channel into which when ships were entered they were secured from any hazards of wind or weather  they also took care to preserve the channel which as i have said was thus deep from filling up by the sea and at the upper end of it and within the fortifications of the town a large basin or pool was made able to receive the biggest ships and able to contain above  00 sail at the entrance into which was a sluice or waterstop the gates of which were six and fifty foot wide being a work of that prodigious expense and requiring so much skill of the engineer that some workmen of very good experience declared to the king it was impossible that monsieur vauban whose undertaking the whole work was could ever bring it to perfection  but he laughed at them all and went on finished it and brought the gates of that immense sluice to so exact a balance that they are now made to open and shut by the hands of two men only viz one at each gate  the sluice first spoken of which kept in the landwater now discovered its usefulness and the exquisite skill of the workman for whenever the channel seemed to fill or the sea cast any banks of sand up against the mouth of the peirs as it would have done in two or three tides the opening this sluice let go a mighty stream of water which they call a backwater or backcurrent which always keeps the channel open to its full depth  thus this mighty work is finished the wonder of this part of the world as to the innumerable works for strengthening the town the risebank for farther strengthening the port an immense work advanced in the very sea and founded also upon piles yet made so strong as not only to carry  00 guns which are planted on its parapet but to bear  00 dwellinghouses and a church or mosque and so become a little town of its self all this i refer thee for to the plan of the work which is without question the most perfect fortification in the world and if it ever should be attacked as it will require an army to defend it so they must expect to lose a good army before it that attempt it  they are aware here that the king of england the most enterprizing prince in this part of the world has his eye upon it especially since the victory over the french fleet has secured him the superiority at sea and therefore the generals always keep a watchful eye over it and very rarely have less than    or  0000 men in it or within reach of it when the campaign is over  the fortifications of this place including the harbor etc is said to have cost the king of france twenty thousand purses which in the coin of this country is called no less than an hundred millions of their money  the draft of this place is worth thy study and worthy the hand of a power immense and inimitable like that of the grand seignior half the care and art which is showed here would make the city of candia which is so much envied by the nazareens be the safest and most terrible port in the levant  success and wonders be the end of all thy undertakings and let the glory of thy illustrious lord be made more and more conspicuous by thy exquisite performances the other plans which i send thee i shall write of by thy servant the chaioux mustapha who is here with me and who i shall dispatch in twelve days to the kaimacham on business of importance  paris   th day of the  th moon of the year      letter xi to the kadilescher of romelia there has happened this month a thing which as it is the subject matter of conversation all over the nazareen world so it tends more to the personal dishonor of the king of france than any thing that i have ever heard charged upon him through the whole course of a long and flourishing reign  there has been a conspiracy detected in the confederate army in flanders to assassinate the new king of england the conspiracy it self though odious and detestable in its nature is not the main thing i take notice of to thee for such things are frequent among these nazareens though not heard of among the true believers of the one god the faithful followers of mahomet i say among the mussulmans no such thing is ever heard of it is below the dignity of man as a man to kill by treason nor can the religious principles of those who believe the rewards of paradise or the torment of fire permit them to think of such practices without horror thank mahomet it is only practiced among christians the mussulmans abhor it  i say therefore i had not mentioned this crime odious in its self even to humane nature it is not the fact it self which i insist upon but this in particular that there is great reason to believe the king of france himself or at least his chief ministers of state and they we know dare do nothing without his orders have been discovered to be in the design  it is scarce to be thought of without horror and execration that men of honor as they call themselves here should stoop to murder the man they cannot conquer in all the reigns of the ottoman princes or of the caliphs of syria in all the days of the saracen empire the true successors of our great prophet mahomet whose more righteous law forbids rapn injustice and blood no such thing has yet been left upon record  was it ever known that any of the princes followers of mahomet ever sent an assassinator or murderer to cut off a nazareen prince general or commander of an army by treason though we esteem the nazareens as dogs enemies of god and such as of right demand to be cut off from the earth yet it is always attempted honorably by war and the arm of battle as open enemies ought to deal with one another leaving the sword to decide the quarrel and god to direct as best pleases him  never i say was any nazareen prince captain general or other enemy surprised on our account by treason and murder these people value themselves upon the name by which they pretend to be distinguished viz christians and the king of france is called the most christian king as if he was more a christian or a better man than other kings but this affair has sullied his face and blackened his character in such a manner as all the other idolatrous nations in the world would abhor and let them say what they will it seems to me that these assassinating principles are not allowed at least not so much if at all by any people in the world but these christians in the name of mahomet let them have the praise of it let them be the only people in the world who deal in secret murder  as to the king of france men may call him the most christian king as long as they please but if he gives encouragement to such villainies as these i dare pronounce caius fabritius a roman pagan a far better christian than the most christian king for he being general of the romans against pyrrhus king of macedon one of the stoutest enemies the romans ever had when the macedonian princes physician came and promised him to poison his master for a sum of money he not only scorned his proposals but sent him with a letter discovering his treachery to the king to deal with him according to his deserts  this was done like a roman but the king of france like those who they call here christians has not thought fit to act in such a generous manner for monsieur granval who it was proved openly had undertaken the business of assassinating the king of england had it seems been encouraged to and employed in this horrid work first by monsieur louvois the first minister of state to the king of france and since his death by monsieur de barbasieux his son with the gift of eighty pistols a small piece of gold coin which goes here for four ducates and with the promise of twenty thousand livres per ann reward when the murder was committed  this it seems has been proved in the military divan or as they call it here the court martial and the person has been condemned and executed for it even himself not denying the fact  nor do they concern themselves much to deny it here or to disown that he was employed by the french ministers for these are it seems above covering such things from the world not valuing the censures of men however just  there is a noble principle in the minds of wise men which qualifies them to support the censures and reproaches of the world and to receive the vilest usage with the highest contempt and this is an attainment worthy of a good man and makes a man truly great but this is always built upon this preliminary as a foundation viz that the charge is unjust as well as indecent that the person is innocent for no wise man can bear a just censure if his own heart reproaches him with the crime his face is covered with blushes at the censure and he sinks under the weight of the reflection as a child does under the stripes of his preceptor  to contemn just censure is the token of a face hardened by crime grown wicked to a degree above being touched by conscience or principles of honor and is a token not of a very wise man but of a very wicked man  it is with some horror i write of this particular circumstance if kings can thus justify the surprising their opposite princes with murder and assassination what need is there of making war it is enough to revenge the injury done by the hands of villains and assassinators and we may leave the kings of the earth to kill one another without engaging armies of innocent people in the quarrel  men of just principles abhor these things and indeed the king is exclaimed against universally in all foreign courts on this affair at home here it is true people dare say nothing so they cast it all upon monsieur barbisieux and clear the king of the scandal of it  if this wicked custom prevails kings are the most unhappy of men they must live wrapped in iron for the day and sleep covered with terrors in the night the dagger and the pistol would be their daily dread and as it was said of the first james king of england they would bewray nature at the sight of a naked sword  it appears upon record in the histories of these parts of the world that the ancestor of this prince the king of england was murdered in the same manner as has been thus attempted now and that it was done in consequence of the proscription of his enemy the king of spain who publicly invited all the men of villainous principles of which the nazareens never want examples to murder the prince of orange promising a reward of a thousand pistols to the person who should kill him  but the whole world blamed the king of spain for it even when he published the invitation to murder and several of the princes even of the king of spains own party openly protested against it but much more after the murder was committed and the murderer confessed that it was upon the hearing of that proclamation that he undertook it i say from that time the king of spain was abhorred by all men of honor as a tyrant a man of cruelty and a murderer nor did righteous heaven prosper any of his affairs after it  after all the king of england lives the traitor has been put to death and the horror of the fact has cemented rather than weakened the confederacy nay it has filled the enemies of france with that animosity against her management that it may be truly said of the king he has nothing to trust to but the sword for the least and weakest of his enemies are deaf to all accommodations  paris   th of

sixty chapters and read forty four year upon the first chapter and did not finish it neither  thus designing in my last letter to send thee a lecture of fortifications and attacks upon all the towns or sieges which have been the subject of discourse here during this war i spent my whole letter upon the town and port of dunkirk and have done very little indeed toward finishing it either but thy mathematical genius will supply the rest  next to this town i begin with the town of mons of the siege of which i wrote formerly to the port after thou have surveyed the works how regular how large how well situated for defense and how well defended by a resolute garrison who failed in no part of their duty thou will perhaps wonder how it came to be carried as it were sword in hand that is to say in about    days after the trenches were opened  but thou will be more fully satisfied when thou shall observe some marks i have made in the plan of the siege by which it will be seen that the french began with draining the morass which lies on one part of the town which the confederates thought was impracticable and by which means they came dryfooted to the town on a side where there were very slight works the germans believing that the place was inaccessible on that side  the siege of namure is the most remarkable in this part of the country of which also i have written particularly before the castle is a very inaccessible thing and is defended by its situation which is not only raised high on the summit of a rock as you will see by the plan but is seated in the angle of two large rivers the sambre and the maez like the city of belgrade between the sauve and the danube  but the strength of this castle is doubled by a work called the cohorne fort which is a royal fortification built by one monsieur cohorne a flemish engineer and a lieutenant general in the confederates army the plan of this fort will show thee the skill of the engineer and the gallant defense he made in it against the whole french army will show thee his bravery but the consequence of this fort best appears by telling thee that the castle however strong in it self made very little defense after the surrender of this fort  the plan of the port of nice and the city of villa franca as also of the port and town of roses in rousillon on the frontiers of spain as they have a great similitude to one another and have both met with the same fate viz to be attacked by the french during this war so they will show thee perfectly well how fatal an error it is to leave ports of such consequence and so capable of being rendered impregnable so naked and defenseless as both those places were  this is a mistake the french king is never guilty of whatever town is taken by him is sure to get by the exchange of masters for he always makes it stronger than it was before and almost all the frontier places having been first or last in the possession of france owe most of their strength to his diligence in fortifying them  this also is like to be the fate of roses and of nice for the french engineers are at work already upon them both and they tell us that nice especially shall be made impregnable and the harbor be made capable of receiving the largest men of war and though he may do this yet it is odds but in time he comes to render this town up to the duke of savoy  the reason indeed of this difference between the towns possessed by france and those possessed by other princes is chiefly this that the latter want money and the king of france always abounds that the latter when they have money care not to lay it out on such things and the other spares no expense to make places strong believing it as it often times appears to be the best money he can lay out  i cannot but think the frontiers of the grand seigniors dominions deficient on this very article how else could the effeminate muscovites have reduced so important a town as that of asoph on the paulus meotis had the king of france been possessed of such a fortress it would have been made as terrible as dunkirk and it would never have been in the power of any enemy much less a contemptible nation of whom it usually was a saying at the port that they neither knew how to make peace or war  i doubt not thou art forward enough to regulate these matters and had the royal imperial mandate issued out to thee asoph would long ago have been a place as impregnable as any of the king of frances ports are to none of which the confederates have been yet able to approach through the whole series of the war no not since they have boasted of their superiority at sea  nor is our lord the grand seignior whose name i mention with reverence bowing my head to the ground the brightness of the upper regions of light be on his head i say our mighty emperor the lord of the world is not unwilling to allow the expense of necessary fortifications to strengthen the towns exposed to his enemies but it has been the negligence or covetousness of the viziers to whom the emperor has committed the charge of those things  vigilant ali thou art always awake to the interest of thy master and to the glory of his empire extended from the east to the west seas i know that nothing escapes thy observation i conjure thee by the dust of happy icharrah thy predecessor whose dwelling is in paradise by the bones of thy great grandfather ibrahim who was principal engineer to solomon the magnificent at the famous sieges of rhodes and maltha by the brazen gates of mecca and the invincible turrets of medina let not the hint i am now going to give thee be forgotten neither take it in evil part from me who am anxious for the glory of our invincible lord achmet emperor of the world  take it not in evil part that i ask this important question why is not belgrade which is now fallen into the hands of thy lord why i say is it not made the most invincible place on earth  thou know it is not and that it has all the advantages by situation which can be desired two mighty rivers wash its walls with their furious currents viz the sauve and the danube the angle where they join is wholly taken up with the town and castle which are thereby utterly inaccessible on two sides of three had the king of france this important place his engineers in spite of the hardest rocks the highest mountains the most impenetrable parts of the earth would long ago have brought the sauve to have entirely surrounded the town and to have embraced it with its divided stream equally deep navigable and rapid like the other part  infinite bastions cavaliers parapets lines courtins tenails ravelines counterscarps motes covered ways hornworks crownworks lunettes retrenchments redoubts etc should have ere now so surrounded the town as not to make it possible for any army to attack it without the certain ruin of their infantry  when it was last taken the works were generally speaking entirely demolished by the blast of powder which blew it up why should not all the plan of the place have received a new face and why not make it strong enough to be worthy the name of the bulwark of the ottoman empire  flatter not thy self that the power of thy lord is so great that it will never suffer any revolution or that the victorious vizier can never meet with any foil these things are influenced by the secret destinated appointments of him that guides thee and i and every head that bears the charge of a soul and albeit that what is thus appointed shall not be reversed yet such agency as that of giving a stop to the enemies of mahomet by the assistance of humane power is always allowed to be bestowed on the faithful and the aids of art to support us in the defense of the dominions of our emperor was always allowed not as lawful only but expedient at all times leaving the issues of things to god and mahomet  rouse up thy self thou man of knowledge and apply thy self to strengthen this frontier surround it with innumerable works spare no cost or labor to make it a terror of the nazareen empire extend it to such limits that its garrison may be an army and that to invest it may require  00000 men  draw round it a treble counterscarp i know the situation will allow it for the inmost works are high as a mountain and will overlook seven descents below it  the two heights of orwar next the river sauve will require a double crownwork to surround them with a parapet high as a cavallier if it should be attacked and suppose it should be carried sword in hand it is impossible an enemy can make a lodgment in it the troops which shall be posted in the mountain will pour in such floods of livid fire of shot of grenadoes etc that nothing can support it  on the side next the danube the hill ibrahim bassa readily guides thy hand to erect a royal fort under its protection no ships from the danube can batter it the rock defending its flanks the same rock affording at the same time a natural line for  00 pieces of cannon to cut off even the navigation of the danube and send to the bottom the strongest vessels which shall attempt to lie open to it  glorious ali why is not this city made the bulwark of the ottoman empire depend upon it as the arms of the victorious kuprioli have conquered this fortress so the nazareens will lose no opportunity of recovering it and if once they are masters of it again they will not fail to make it the strongest fortress in the world  then shall the blood of the faithful which it shall cost to recover it from the infidels be laid to their charge who neglected strengthening it while it was in their hands  paris  th of the  0th moon of the year      letter xii to the kaimacham note this letter should have been printed in page     book ii and letter xii in the same book should have been placed here wonder not that i follow so soon my last express with another letter almost upon the same subject the king of france is certainly the most politic prince in the world he knew not only what was concluded against him at the hague in the great congress of princes which i mentioned in my last and which met there the beginning of the last moon but he knew the reputation that illustrious appearance of princes would give to the confederated arms if they had leisure given them to go on as they began and therefore to give some sudden coup de eclat in the infancy of their alliance was not only the best way to weaken and disconcert them but also to lessen the reputation of a body monstrous like hydra and composed of many heads as well as many members  however he lay still till the prince of orange had broken up his congress and was gone to his palace of loo a house of pleasure in the dutch gueldre where he designed to pass the time till the season for taking the field should call him away  but he was scarce gotten thither when expresses in the heels of one another brought him word that the french were making preparations in all their frontiergarrisons for some great enterprise and that though the season for armies to take the field was not yet by two moons at least yet it was certain the french would march very quickly  this alarmed the prince who was himself perfectly vigilant and as able to judge of the designs of the enemy as any officer in his army the hague which but a few days before was thronged with princes generalofficers and colonels of the army was on a sudden an abandoned desolate place compared to what it was before the governors of towns and provinces the generals the officers were all flown to their respective commands as if they had been driven away with a storm of wind  nor was it without cause for in about ten days after the first alarm they found the french whose motions are the swiftest of any nation in the world were actually in the field with  0000 men and in less than five days more in spite of the severity of a terrible season difficulty of impassable roads and of all the inconveniences of a wintersiege they had invested the city of mons the capital of hainault in the spanish low countries this was the    th day of the third moon  this place is not only considerable in its self as it is a very strong frontier but also as it secures a spacious country which will be at the disposal of the french if they succeed in their design it is environed on every side with good fortifications except on that side which is between the gates of brussels and aeh where there is only a bare wall secured by a large and deep morass so that it is impossible to be approached that way but they say the design of the french is to drain the morass which being done the town will be easily taken and to that purpose as impossible as the design seems to be yet they have got together twenty thousand pioneers from all the frontiers which they have set to work under the protection of an army of sixty thousand men the garrison is said to consist of seven thousand well disciplined soldiers of which the greatest part are germans and besides them there is a great number of the townsmen well exercised in arms who have promised to make a vigorous resistance all under the command of the prince of bergues who pretended to hold it out to the utmost nevertheless france made this business a point of honor and there could be no question but they will put as fair for it as possible the king the dauphine most of the mareschals of france and all the best generals of the kingdom were there to see the general assault to which purpose they have drawn out of germany all their best men in a word it may be said that the whole power of france is going to fall upon that poor city  the prince of orange came immediately back from loo having staid there but two nights expresses flew like posts riding on a whirlwind to all the confederateprinces for help and all the troops near hand were ordered to the general rendezvous  but alas what signified troops in brandexburgh the land of hessia or other remote countries to an army in full march and a town already invested with ten thousand horse the french secure of the success pushed the siege with the utmost vigor and to encourage the soldiers by the presence of so illustrious a leader the king himself resolved to command the siege he arrived in the camp the    st of the third moon visited the posts himself had an officer killed with a cannonshot just at his elbow and saw the trenches opened before the place in his own presence on the    th and on the  th of this moon the town capitulated  the king of england drew together all the troops which were within reach and encamped at hall not far from the french camp but he never could get above   000 men together  the town made a very vigorous defense and the garrison were reduced to   00 men but the fury of the french could not be withstood who with a numerous artillery beat down all the defenses of the place and followed it with such continued attacks not valuing the lives of their men that it was impossible to hold out  the town having capitulated the french have put  0000 foot and  000 horse into it as a garrison and are retired into quarters having thus cut their enemies out work enough in the morning of the campaign to keep them employed perhaps all the rest of the time  as the king by this sudden blow has been before hand with the confederates so he lets them see that by entering the fields so before the usual time he will be always before them and that their confederacy will have no effect so long as they march every country troops back to their own limits for winter quarters  but the king of france has not contented himself with this advantage for on the side of piedmont he has done just the same thing taking from the duke of savoy the city of nice and the town of villa franca the principal port that prince had on the side of the mediterranean sea  this action was carried on with all that secrecy and celerity which is peculiar to the french conduct and in which they are a pattern to all that would prosper in great undertakings monsieur catinat a vigilant and fortunate general commanded the expedition they began to draw the troops together at thoulon and the general rendezvous was between that place and grace a town on the river vaar they were all at the place the    d of february but the march being difficult they could not sit down before the town till the    th of march which however was so early in the year that no troops but those of france who conquer all kinds of difficulties could pretend to take the field  this city of nice is surrounded with forts palanques and fortifications at a distance from it and on the particular places which must be passed to come at it as first villa franca a town about a league from nice secondly the fort called the castle of villa franca thirdly the fort of st hospitio fourthly the fort of montalban then the city of nice and lastly the citadel all these places were fortified and most of them especially the castle of villa franca and the fort of montalban yet by the    th in the morning the french had mastered them all and sat down before the citadel of nice having brought also a squadron of men of war to block up the port by sea that no relief might get in  in a word nice had the fate of belgrade for a bomb falling into a magazine of powder blew it up with three other magazines killed  00 of the garrison demolished the best part of the fortifications and frighted the governor and his remaining part of the garrison into an immediate surrender  thus this king makes himself a terror to the world the duke of savoy is in a fair way to be ruined and they say is desirous to make his peace whether that be true or no time will discover but it is certain if he does not or is not immediately assisted in a powerful manner by the emperor his destruction is not far off for the king of france reselves to give monsieur catinat  0000 men to reduce him at once and make quick work of him on the other hand monsieur the duke of orleans the kings brother whose daughter the duke of savoy has married has sent an express to turin to inform his soninlaw of the dangers that attend him and to advise him to take speedy measures to accommodate his affairs with the king offering his good offices at the same time to dispose his majesty to his interest but it seems the duke is not so apprehensive as others are or has some secret dependences which they are not informed of  however the king of france has by these two actions so anticipated the glory of the next campaign that his enemies have nothing to do but to try if they can regain in the summer what he has taken from them in the spring and he has nothing to do but to act upon the defensive if he pleases till they are dispersed again and then they may expect him to fall upon them again just as before  i need not lay these things before thee as a pattern the success of the ottoman affairs against the infidel nations manifest that the grand vizier wants no experience vigilance council for contriving or vigor for execution of his glorious attempts may glory and virtue increase his fame and may the sultan our lord the inexhaustible source of magnificence and luster lift up his head above the kings of the earth crowned with inconceivable glory and the light of an hundred thousand constellations  paris   th of the  th moon of the year      letter xiii to mahomed elmaken student in history in trapezond if there is any thing to be gathered from outward appearances the desolations nature works upon her self with her own hands must be tokens of the anger of god upon the nations nature is never lunatic non compos mentis or so out of her wits as in the frenzy to lay violent hands upon her self if the author of nature does not lay his irresistible commands upon her to do so for the punishment of wicked men  certain it is that in violent tempests hurricans or tournadoes eruptions of fire and water earthquakes and the like nature seems felo de se she appears armed against her self tearing her own bowels defacing her own beautiful countenance and in a word acting all the parts of a man who being demented by the fury of a disease a fever or the like lays violent hands upon himself  this has been a year terrible in the nazaren nations for these things and particularly for earthquakes of which there are some very affrighting instances this year in holland france germany and great britain as near as can be gathered the whole body of the earth felt a jogg or two at the very same moment of time which though it did no harm yet it put all these parts of the world into a most terrible consternation  but in america they tell us dreadful stories for example that in the empire of mexico three and twenty villages are overwhelmed with great part of the inhabitants and a great town called truxillo almost quite demolished that in peru a great mountain sunk down into a plain country and a great hill rose up out of a lake  but the most affrighting story of all is that of the island of jamaica situated in the gulf of mexico and now a colony of the english who formerly took it from the spaniards the principal town or port of this island was called port royal and of that town the principal part was called the point being a neck of land running out into the water like a peir this had upon it very fair buildings and the principal merchants of the island resided there  it was in the middle of the day or rather a little before noon when by a furious earthquake one whole side of that neck of land i mentioned which they called the point sunk by a sudden and violent earthquake and the buildings having then no foundation slid all down into the sea so that above  000 people were immediately swallowed up with their habitations goods and effects  the calamity of this country is not to be expressed for in the other part of the island where the dwellings were not swallowed up the earth for several days moved so violently that the people could not stand upon it even in the very fields but lying down rolled with it up and down the earth like vessels on the sea and you may be sure they were all the while in the utmost horror and distraction expecting every moment to be swallowed up alive  certainly the consternation must be inexpressible among the miserable inhabitants for it was a calamity which they had never felt before in the place and since i am speaking of earthquakes things which very rarely happen among the righteous nations it is not improper to give thee a brief historical account of some of the most remarkable earthquakes which have happened in these nazaren parts of the world where they are more frequent than in any other places  it is about two thousand and sixty six years ago that there happened one in achaia which almost utterly destroyed it and which was attended with inundations which in the very heart of corinth deluged the cities of helice and buris of which ovid makes mention in the    th book of his metamorphosis si quaereas helicen and burien achaeidas urbes invenies sub aquis and adbuc ostendere nautae inclinata solent cum maibus oppida mersis ovid met  the last year of the two hundred and seventieth olympiad the most part of the buildings of tire and sidon were overturned and an infinite number of people buried under their ruins the third year of the     olympiad rome was shaken for three days and three nights together and d rrachium was levelled with the ground together with several cities of campania nay in our own country i have read in the holy writings of aaiada that in the reign of bajazet ii the mighty and most invincible emperor there was an earthquake at constantinople that lasted forty days and that during all that time there was not an hour past but the city suffered extraordinary shocks so that the grand vizier by the grand seigniors command employed forescore thousand workmen to repair the city till by the prayers of the faithful rest was obtained  in the year    0 of the nazaren account an earthquake ruined a great part of the city of naples that of arian a smaller city was swallowed up of the sea and several other towns utterly overthrown in that part of italy called calabria in the year      there arose upon the sea of ancona together with a thick gloomy cloud that extended above two miles a tempest of wind water fire eightning and thunder which piercing to the most deep abysses of the sea forced up the waves with a most dreadful fury and carried all before it upon the land this afterward caused as the writers here testify so dreadful an earthquake that the kingdom of naples was in a manner quite ruined and all italy carried the dismal marks of it a million of houses castles and palaces were buried in their own ruin above thirty thousand people were crushed to pieces by their weight and a huge mountain was overturned into the lake de la guarde in the milanese joseph acosta relates that in peru the year      there happened an earthquake which removed the city of anguaquim two leagues from the place where it stood without demolishing it in regard the situation of the whole country was changed and every body has heard of the earthquake which happened among the mountains of the alps in a place called the valtoline in the year    0 by the violence of which a great mountain near bigorre sunk down into the earth and was covered over with the water of a lake hard by but the greatest and most dreadful earthquake was that which divided america from africa and europe for we read in platos timaeus that they talked in his time of an island near the pillars of hercules that was called atlantis bigger than europe and africa both together which by a horrible earthquake and a deluge of twenty four days was swallowed up and covered with the sea and never seen since  00 millions of people being destroyed with it and that the sea which swallowed it up has from thence been called the atlantic ocean to this day  some of the ancients among these people have been of opinion that the earth was a great animal and that the shivering occasioned by some distemper not unlike that of an aguefit was the cause of its trembling father bourhours one of their priests here but an author of fame among them speaks many pretty things upon this fancy in his discourse of eugenius and aristus upon the ebbing and flowing of the sea  the greatest of the heathen philosopher s accused the stars of these disorders upon the earth and some of them expostulated with the gods very earnestly on this account but to speak one word of the causes of them in general i say that there are two which are natural and may very rationally be accounted for and it is most profitable to speak of such rather than of imaginary causes   that the subterranean fires and winds are the first cause the bowels of the earth are full of bituminous matter sulphurous and nitrous particles saltpeter and the like and when it happens that one stone by secret operation falling upon another strikes fire by collision or that air penetrates in unusual quantities those combustible matters being kindled and the winds blowing up the flames they cause most terrible overturnings of the earth unless they find outlets as in etna vesuvius and other mountains whose opening tops give vent to the flame the second natural cause which i observe proceeds from the water that is under the earth which undermining the foundations that support the subterranean vaults which extend themselves for several leagues together in several parts those vaults deprived of their usual prop and overpressd by their own weight shrink down and all of a sudden impetuously pushing forward the air and water enclosed in the earth give the upper parts those violent and boistrous jolts which quickly overturn the weaker structures of humane art which must of necessity give way to those more than gigantick impetuosities that rend and shatter the more solid frame of nature it self  grave mahomed thou who have searched the most retired parts of nature art fully instructed in these things may that power which uses these most furious distortings of nature as weapons or scourges in his hand to correct infidels preserve the faithful in safety that the mussulmans empire may be the epitome of eden and be the retreat of the universe whither the people may flee from the deluges of life and enjoy the tranquillity of the blessed  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter xiv to simeon ben habbakkuk a jew at salonica i have just written at large to thy old friend and mine elmakem at trapezond with an account of a very terrible earthquake which they say has happened at the island of jamaica in the gulf of mexico belonging to the english nazarens  it might be agreeable to thee to give thee an account of the particular of this terrible thing but thou art too familiarly acquainted with such things in the country where thou live to need any information from me one circumstance only i cannot omit because it relates to the people whom thou belongest to  the earthquake there as the relations which come from england and also others from the french colonies in those parts particularly at cuba martinico and the french part of hispaniola give an account was very terrible and that in particular that after the first shock which overthrew the capital town of the island for several days the earth rolled up and down like the waves of the sea that in sundry places great chasmas appeared the earth parting and leaving several openings gaping dreadfully to a frightful depth  that the poor people amazed and terrified to the last extremity lying in the open fields expected to be swallowed up every moment and that some were even frighted to death anticipating death it self with the apprehensions of it and confirming that just notion that the fear of any evil is greater than the evil it self like as the desire of any good is far greater than the possession  i need not spend time to inform thee of that who have too just notions and too large a portion of judgment not to know that what is present affects the senses in a quite differing manner from what is to come what is present to us is seen in its genuine form but what is distant and represented only by the passions as by fear or desire is magnified to an infinite degree as those passions get the victory over our reason  but what apprehensions of death or rather of the world after death produced the effect i am going to relate to thee that i know not and leave to thee but the fact is thus i am assured that the jews for there are a great many families of thy nation in that island i say the jews in the extremity of the terror they were in upon occasion of this earthquake called upon jesus the son of mary to save them  i have no room to question the truth of the fact because diverse jews here have not only heard of it but do approve and justify the relation  if the mussulmans who acknowledge jesus to be the messiah and that he was a prophet ser from god as we acknowledge mahomet also to be had in such a calamity called upon any of the prophets and upon jesus also to assist them in that extremity it might have been said it was because we do believe him to have been a just man and that he was ordained of god to be one of the six great masters of the law of god an oracle of truth and one of the instructors of men certain it is we give a just history from god how that he has caused the truth and the doctrines of righteousness to be instituted by six oracles viz the oracle of adam handed on by oral ministration to the deluge the oracle of noah forming the institutions of divine worship to the renewed world the oracle of abraham whose preaching and institutions was received by all his numerous posterity who were founders of many nations and from whose bowels our ancestor ishmael is descended the oracle of moses whose law was prescribed to your nation only the oracle of jesus whose institutions howbeit they are professed by his followers have yet suffered so many corruptions interpretations and addition of humane inventions that the pure professors of his law are very rarely found and very difficult among so many professors to be known and the oracle of mahomet whose light and empire is spread over three parts in four of the discovered world  but how inconsistent must it be for thy nation who have condemned this jesus as an impostor and would as we believe without question have put him to death had not god took him i say how inconsistent must it be with that hatred of him which they professed to call upon him in their trouble wherefore o simeon consider and judge of these things with righteous judgment for if god has owned the said jesus to be his prophet and you continue to despise him you ought to take this for a judgment from heaven upon your infidelity that the jews were brought by his invisible power in the extremity of their terror to recognize the messiah in the person of that jesus whom you had intentionally at least murdered before  be wise then and cease to adhere to the oracle of moses and the talmudic systems of thy misguided rabbis seeing other oracles have succeeded by the appointment of god every one exceeding each other in purity and excellence as the oracle of moses likewise in his days excelled all those which were before him  paris  th of the  0th moon of the year      the end of the third book a continuation of letters written by a spy at paris book iv letter i to the selictaraga or chief sword bearer i was ordered by isuff bassa reis effendi in case of his being gone a journey to bagdat to negotiate a peace with the persians as i find he is to write to thee what i had purposed to say of the affairs of these parts of the world it is always of importance for the principal secretaries prime ministers statesmen and managers in the court of our illustrious master to know the minutest matters relating to government to peace and to war how much more then the important affairs in the court of the greatest king in these parts of the world whose actions none can imitate whose glory is only outshind by the mirror of superior glory the luster of the sublime the ever great and resplendent grand seignior whose days be happy and his rising every morning victorious  if one may guess by the increasing power of the king of france by his vigilance and application to the business as well of war as of government if one may calculate from the immense treasures he lays up the numbers of his armies the vigor of his councils the experience and bravery of his generals the early motion of his troops and from the progres of his arms the last year it would intimate that this must be a year of wonders  it is true that the king of england is a resplendent star increasing in magnitude a prince whose martial genius fills the world with expectations gives vigor and spirit to the soldiery is the life of the confederacy and is not to be discouraged by the greatest repulses but still he amasses troops raises new armies increases the numbers of his confederates and causes every day new enemies to rise up to the king of france  but the king of france bullies them all and appears equal to their greatest designs superior to them in numbers and above all superior in the exquisite administration of all his affairs as well civil as military  men always believed the king of france would outdo the ancient giants in the desperate efforts of the present war nay considering who he has to engage with it must be so or he must fall under the weight of so many enemies but it was thought also that his treasure would fail him before his troops and that he must be at last exhausted and enfeebled that way  but he disappoints them all that way too for he finds such ways to raise money and that in such immense quantity that it is almost incredible his enemies boast that he raises it with difficulty which indeed is true but what is that to their purpose seeing difficult or not difficult he does raise the money indeed such is his skill to direct his demands of money and his absolute power to enforce those demands that his officers will tear it out of the bowels of the people so long as there is any silver in the kingdom  when i look on the application of this court to raise money how intense upon it and how absolutely necessary it is to them to have it i have wondered they have not thought of empting the wonderful lake of thoulouse this is a great standing pool of water near the city of thoulouse into which they tell us that the ancient gauls after they had sacked the temple of delphos threw an hundred and ten thousand pound weight of gold and five millions of pounds weight of silver on its being suggested that it was sacrilegious wealth and that the gods were angry with them it is true that cepio the roman consul got up a great deal of it some ages afterward and carried it away but a modern geographer of this place tells us there is a great deal still left which the people of thoulouse would fain have been fingering but that they were still frighted with devils and monsters of all kinds now the king of france who has so many dragoons that fear neither god nor the devil might easily make himself master of it or if this failed one would think that all the sacred relics in france should turn to a vast account he had better sell them than squeeze out the very heartblood of his subjects there is half st peters beard at poitiers would be worth to him half a million of money and the shrines of the apostles at st stephens in thoulouse would suffice to furnish him for seven years together but this by the way  the king of france has not only very exquisite methods of raising money but the economy of his government is such that when it is raised it is always applied to the proper uses we never hear of embezzlements and misapplication among his finnanciers or treasurers and by this punctual management of his treasure he has this advantage that his troops are always in the field before his enemies let them make the utmost speed they can  this he threatens them with on all hands this year and though i am now writing to thee but in the second moon we see already his cavalry new mounted his household troops new clothed his recruits distributed and most of his armies in a condition to march while some of the confederates are little more than got home into their winter quarters and i am mistaken if we do not see him give them some considerable blow before they can get into the field  every year he increases his troops and it is said that this year he adds sixty thousand men to his armies besides a prodigious number wanting to recruit his old regiments expect therefore i shall in a little while send the news of some coup de eclat on this side  fail not also to communicate to the grand vizier that the french resolve to push the emperor so vigorously on the rhine that he may expect few troops will be spared to go to hungary this summer and the germans talk already of bringing six thousand horse away from the hereditary countries which is the same thing as from hungary  thou know wise and penetrating commander what advantage the happy port ever made of the intestine broils of the nazarens the very first rise of the ottoman name derived from the weakness of the christian princes and that weakness from their being divided one against another wisdom rises upon the ruins of folly in all ages and places in the world whether personal or national  let the ottoman glory still rise and while the hands of infidels and idolaters are thus lifted up against one another let the faithful embrace the occasion and advance the mussulmans empire till it spread the face of the german dominions and strike terror into the heart of this great emperor of the french who at present bids defiance to the world and can never be effectually reduced till the question lies between him and the glorious emperor of the world  paris  th of the  d moon of the year      letter ii to the grand mufti i once gave a brief recapitulation of the history of earthquakes to thy holy slave elmakem at trapezond my letter was occasioned by looking back with horror and regret on the convulsions of nature which i have lately met with of that kind particularly some remarkable and dreadful casualties which have happened in these few years time in these parts of the world  here is now a new and most dreadful return of this particular kind happened in italy and the island of sicily i intimated in my letter to elmakem how these kinds of gods judgments seem peculiar to these countries thou will say so too when thou shall hear the following story which is just now come to hand it was the ninth of the first moon about four of the clock in the morning that a terrible farthquake was felt at the city of messina in sicily the protection of mahomet be upon every true mussulman for certainly the like of this earthquake was never heard of especially in some of the most dreadful parts of it of which such undoubted authorities are brought that there is no room to question the truth take the heads of it as follows viz at first it did no damage only that it shook the whole city in a most frightful manner and terrified the people most strangely the greatest part of them fled to the fields the rest run to the moschs to make their prayers however in about three hours it went off for that time but the third day after it returned with such fury that the whole city was terribly shattered the violence of the shock in a moment overturned four and twenty palaces and endangered all the rest of the buildings all the people thronged to the dome that is the chief mosch where the archbishop preached and gave that provoking insult upon the one god called absolution as did also such is their delusion here a great number of their dervices dispersed for that purpose into all the quarters of the city after this every body thought of nothing else but escaping from the danger by retiring into the country those who could set up tents were safe from the injuries of the weather but many of the others were destroyed the air being all on a flame by reason of a most terrible thunder and continual flashes of lightning but this is but the least part of this story for notwithstanding the great damages done to this city it was nothing to what many others received the towns of faormina maseal madica the cities of agousta catanea syracuse carlentino and several other considerable cities towns and provinces are utterly ruined agousta is become a mere lake by reason of a rupture which the sea made into that part where the houses stood while at the same time the lightning flashing into the fortress of the city blew it up into the air catanea was utterly overturned and sixteen thousand persons were buried under the ruins of the great mosch only the    th and    th two fresh jolts gave new alarms but without damage nor is the news from palermo less surprising but i have not yet the particulars all that is known at present is that the palace royal is quite overturned and the viceroy had much ado to escape to the galleys it may be truly said that sicily is utterly laid waste as also the lower calabria being a country in the southermost part of the kingdom of naples it is thought that above a hundred thousand persons are destroyed in this dismal calamity besides above twenty thousand wounded  with this i must inform thee a little of the wickedness of the audacious priests in that country on this occasion in particular viz that as messina received less damage than the other cities and for that the people in that country are very superstitious the monks who understand how to make their advantages of the simplicity of the country people spread abroad a report at the time of the earthquake that the blessed virgin so they call mary the mother of the prophet jesus had revealed to a young girl of nine years of age in that city who was her particular favorite that by means of her intercession she had obtained that the city of messina which is under her protection should not be destroyed in the common calamity with the rest and this has caused a thousand idolatrous extravagances among them in gratitude to this woman they have dressed up her effigy or image in all the moschs decked with jewels of an inestimable value they put a crown upon her head and impiously call her queen of heaven and all the city old and young flow into the temples to say their prayers to her  allow me transcendent mirror of piety image of the divine prophet allow me to express my abhorrence of such execrable idolatry blaspheming the ineffable glory of the one great god who has said before me only shall men worship  i frequently talk to them of this woman mary and grant to them she was highly honored in being the mother of their prophet but i challenge them to show me one word in all the institutions even of their prophet himself directing his disciples to worship her or empowering her to any part of the office of an intercessor in heaven much less crowning her as a queen who was her self a poor humble wife to a mean and a laborious mechanic but they grow angry and cross themselves as if they saw the devil when i talk thus and calling me hugonot tell me if i was in italy i should be sent to the inquisition so i talk of something else  but to return to the story the citizens of catanea found to their cost the impotence of the like churchpageantry for though the dervices there brought forth the image of st agatha another old woman who they have made an idol of too and who they call patroness of that city and that many thousand of the poor frighted people fled after her to the great mosque or cathedral grovelling on the ground on their hands and knees to their saint yet they were all involved in the general destruction for the whole cathedral being transversd by the earthquake the poor votaries with their saint were buried in the ruins of that very church they fled to for safety it is said no less than  000 people chiefly women children and priests perished in that one moque  there is not so much as one edifice left standing in that whole city infinite numbers of people are maimed and bruised besides those who are killed and very few escaped but such as got into the fields for as for the sea it retreated above two miles from them by the first rising of the earth  immortal prince of the priests of mahomet fill all the faithful mussulmans with a just contempt of the idolatry of infidels for which no doubt these strokes of the anger of the great alla the god of thunder is fallen upon them  paris  0th of the  st moon of the year      letter iii to hassan el abmenzai steward to the sultanness alfaraiza it is the sum of humane misery to have no body to communicate our joys and griefs with the heart is not able to contain its own excesses but they will break out and if we have not a friend to unburthen the soul to it will discover its burden in every line of the countenance  old nathan the jew furnished me with an equivalent for this violence of the mind which was a kind of a charm repeating a certain number of words in a corruption of the syriac tongue and then to tell my whole story with my face toward the sun as if i were talking to a particular friend  but all these things have appeared empty shadows to me and my heart has been ready to burst for these thirteen moons past with the violent agitations of joy and despair revolving in their turns equally strong and equally unsupportable  it was next to impossible for me to conceal the transports of my soul when i had by three several expresses from the port the most comforting agreeable news that the grand seignior the lord of benign and heavenly council the merciful rewarder of his faithful slaves had heard my repeated prayers and had granted me license to return to the graves of my fathers and to close an age of misery and retirement with the consolation of the faithful viz to die at the feet of our great prophet kissing the steps of his tomb and the dust of the feet of ten millions of pilgrims  this happy news was seconded by another no less agreeable from the reis effendi wherein he congratulates my completing my desires and gives me the name of my successor viz ali mezzawar of damascas my old friend and acquaintance who has for many years resided for the service of the illustrious port among the reconciled rebels of algier  at the same time that this happy news made glad my heart i received letters from ali himself to whom a chaioux had been sent with orders to him to repair to paris intimating how readily he would obey those orders and that he was just taking ship for marseilles in order to come to paris  judge you my friend how surprising all these good tidings were to a soul ready almost to fly out of its prison at the first account of it and who had lived eleven moons in the most perfect state of satisfaction that it was possible for me to represent to my self in the world insomuch that i fed as it were upon the air of expectation with a mind satisfied even to a surfeit of contentment  nay as if fate intended to sport with my misfortunes and i was still to be made more miserable than any man was before me i was still lifted up higher to add to the weight of my fall and to dash me utterly in pieces by the force of it in a word my deliverer arrived and i received a letter from him dated at marseilles where he landed assuring me that he lost no time to come forward and promised himself a singular pleasure in dismissing me and setting me at full liberty for my return  is it possible that all this could be an ignis fatuus to ensnare my mind and plunge me in the deepest despair was there any thing now but the single hazard of mortality between me and my deliverance who would not have looked upon himself as a freeman and have begun to truss up his baggage to depart  but see the product of surprising decrees the next letter i received was from chalons where my dear friend was taken sick and sent an express a faithful messenger to desire me to come to him thither for that he was dangerously ill  it was with a surprise of grief that i received this account and immediately i posted to chalons but it was with an inexpressible sorrow that when i came to him he had but just life left in him enough to know me and being not able to speak expired in my arms  thus all my comforts are blasted at once and the hopes i had entertained of being see free from the diconsolate circumstances i am in are entirely cut off  it was with great secrecy that i caused his body to be washed with clean water and having hired a carriage which they call here a hearse i embalmed the corpse and caused it to be put into a coffin of lead and went away with it as traveling for paris  when i came upon the road to a place where the ways parted sloaping one toward the right and the other toward the left i discharged the hearse and its attendance having told them that another hearse was to meet me there and so setting the coffin upon the ground they went their way here with a just solemnity of tears i buried my deceased friend laying the coffin on one side with his face toward the sacred repository at mecca that he may awake again with his eyes directly against the golden gate at the entrance into paradise  and now i am a disconsolate mourner indeed condole with me my friend hassan and deliver the letter here enclosed to the reis effendi that i may obtain another successor and may not die here among mahomets enemies and my dust be blended with that of infidels enemies to mahomet blasphemers and idolaters  think of mahmut o you my friends who have the joy of being surrounded with the temples of the faithful and who say your prayers in their just courses to the great prophet and to the great one god the common father of all the true mussulmans think what it is to be excluded from the society of the blessed and left to starve here with the hunger of disappointed expectations  paris  th day of the  d moon of the year      letter iv to the mufti these nazarens are the most addicted to fiction and forgery of any people that ever i met with it is a received custom among them that whenever they have to do with any sect or opinion of people differing from their own the first thing they go about is to represent them as monstrous and unnatural either in person or in principle or perhaps in both dressing them up in ridiculous shapes and imposing a thousand stories about them upon the credulity and ignorance of the vulgar that they may entertain immovable prejudices and aversions against the persons and principles they profess  it would amaze thee illustrious prince of wisdom to hear what absurd romantic tales what imaginary histories and what innumerable forged stories they tell of our sublime prophet mahomet in what colors they represent him and the sacred institutions of our law which we are satisfied were handed from heaven to us by his ministration  what fabulous miracles they muster up to be pretended by him how he used sorcery and witchcraft and feigned the inspiration of the spirit of god by the help of a pidgeon how his tomb in which is his coffin hangs suspended in the air between heaven and earth and what strange inspirations and agitations he was represented by to his followers all which the true mussulmans disown and take no notice of  we have a famous instance of this just now among themselves in the court of their horrible inquisition where they dress the people up whom they determine to the flames in coats painted all over with devils and tormenting spirits to fill the minds of the people with horror and detestation at the poor victims determining them to be enemies to god and his church hating and abhorring them as such without enquiring into any thing of which they are accused  there is another example of their injustice in the story of father molinos a dervice of great fame among them and who they call the quietist because he placed the sum of religion in the secret contemplations of the great one god and declared against the pageantry of worship with which the nazarens abound  i could not doubt but thou would be pleased with some account of this extraordinary man of his principles and of his end which has been in the prisons of the inquisition where he was condemned to remain during life his name was michael de molinos a spaniard by birth and of a very good family and fortune  he betook himself to study from his youth wrote several books before he commenced a dervice or priest in the year      he published one of these books under the title of the spiritual guide which won him the esteem of several cardinals or such as afterward were made cardinals as the cardinals coloredo attieri petrucii the last of which molinos called his tomotheus cassanata azolini and carpegna together with cardinal destrees who of all the rest was he who most familiarly visited him and showed him most affection and tenderness but at last betrayed him this book he wrote argues very strenuously against pennances mortifications visions ecstasies vocal prayers the abuses of confession and the insipidness of catholic sermons and books and in a word against all their ecclesiastic frippery by which they carry on the cheat of their religion at rome among the people and from whence they spread the fraud over the world  the next year cardinal odeschalchi being created pope under the name of innocent xi was no sooner installed but he gave apparent marks of his friendship to molinos by open familiarity with him lodging him in the vatican and conversing with him on affairs of the greatest consequence which acquired him the respect of all men and his method was so applauded at rome that except the jesuits the most part of the confessors followed it and caused their penitents to quit their rosaries and betake themselves to mental prayers and a contemplative life cardinal destrees also that he might contribute to the propagation of this doctrine caused to be translated out of french into italian a certain book entitled an easy way to raise a soul to contemplation and at the same time father petruci published several letters and some treatises upon the same subject if ever there was any real danger that the nazarens should return to the first principles of their prophet jesus and worship god in the spirit if ever the fraud of popes and cardinals was in a way to be effectually overthrown in a word if ever the popes and popish tribe were like to turn hugonots now was the time but the jesuits who were too cunning not to see the danger and to ward off the blow finding the new doctrine of molinos get ground and that all people forsook the confessionals thought it time to lay about them and therefore taking the alarm in behalf of religion they first branded molinos for a heretic and accused him for denying the trinity so they call their doctrine of three persons or as we call it of three gods maliciously inferring that his maxims tended to the destroying the humanity of their prophet jesus they likewise insinuated that he was an enemy to prayer because he affirmed that the perfection of the soul isted not in speaking nor in thinking of god but in the loving him after an extraordinary manner they accused him that he made all christians indifferent because he adds that men ought not to disturb themselves when they fall into any transgression but to make their advantage of  this was occasioned by a prayer which he calls a prayer of quietude and the maxim they called heresy is now called quietism these accusations and some others made such a noise that the inquisition took cognizance of em but the office for that time found nothing blameworthy in molinos or in his doctrine besides the pope gave a bishopric to father petrucii who was one of molinoss most zealous disciples this put the jesuits almost out of their wits so that they caused a report to be whispered about that the bishop being a spainard he might as well be of the race of the jews but this did not hinder the number of the quietists from increasing every day  however as i said above the cardinal de estrees influenced it seems from hence for the jesuits have all the power here in france betrayed him and from his greatest friend became his accuser and enemy and left not till he got him into the prisons of the inquisition where he ended his days for it is no easy thing for any man to get out of such hands when he is once abandoned of his protectors let his quality be what it will or his innocence ever so clear  i think this man was brought to the entrance of truth and had he been enlightened by the beams of churuth and the blessed vision of alluzared the angel of paradise had he been guided so as to come into the society of the faithful he would have been a just and a wise man qualified for the immortal contemplations of haimut and the plains of illumination but as he was so near the truth it could not be expected that he should escape the persecutions of the sons of error  enlightened guide to immortal truth bless the eyes of those who searching after sublime contemplation are raised above the enjoyments of life and give themselves up to the enquiry after exalted wisdom  paris  th of the  d moon of the year      letter v to the grand vizier the devil must certainly deal with the french kings generals whether the french king deals with the devil or no that i cannot tell it is true his new great general the duke of luxemberg of whom i am now to speak has been charged with it and many accounts have been made public about his being a sorcerer that he was invulnerable and that the devil had engaged to keep him free from sword and gun for a certain term of years  i do not affirm these things but as it is certainly true that the nazarens have some people among them so abandoned of heaven as to enter into secret compacts with hell what wonder if those who are already deluded into infidelity should be capable of the extremes of all delusions and outdo those nations in wickedness who never heard of a divine law or a sovereign divine being  but to return to the duke of luxemberg they do not indeed stick to say here that he is a witch or wizard and that he has a secret infernal correspondence but they do not say that he is any forwarder for that to expose himself to sword or gun or to venture his flesh farther than other generals when he comes to action  but he does the greatest things in the field and is so much master of fortune that the amazed people stand and look on with surprise and say he deals with the devil he has now given the greatest blow to the confederates that ever they have yet received and contrary to the expectations of all the world has first drawn the confederate army into that irrecoverable oversight of dividing their army and then forcing them to fight with an inequality of forces  the king of england who is now very justly esteemed the greatest general the confederates have has been always forward to bring the french to a battle eager to fight but vigilant not to be taken at an advantage but however vigilant he was the duke has overreached him the two armies lay encamped upon the little mehaign a river on that side of the netherlands next to namure their numbers about  0000 men on a side not much odds on one side or other  the french general having taken huy before the confederates could come up to relieve it made evident shows of attacking the city of liege where there was a garrison but as the place was large and not capable of defense the king of england sent away in several detachments about    battallions of men with orders to encamp under the cannon of the town and fortify themselves which they did so strongly as not to be attacked but in the forms of a siege the duke made show of falling upon them with his whole army and in the mean time the marshall dharcourt lay with a body of   000 men as a flying camp posted at a distance from the army toward huy and this obliged the king of england also to make another strong detachment to watch his motions  these detachments reduced the confederate army to about   000 men the d of luxemberg taking hold of this advantage faces about with his whole army at the same time giving secret orders to the mares dharcourt to decamp with all possible secrecy with his cavalry only which were    squadrons and join him which he performed so well as to come up in the heat of the battle while the other body sent to observe him knew nothing of his march  thus every thing conspired to give the french the advantage the confederate army though inferior in number was composed of some of the choicest troops in those parts of the world picked select regiments out of all the nations concerned and led on by the greatest generals they had such as the prince of orange whom the world now calls king of england though we do not here give him that title a prince whose courage and gallantry they speak very well of here though they hate his person also the elector of bavaria was there and a world of princes and noblemen of all the nations concerned in the war  they had about half a days notice of the battle and some blamed the king that he did not retreat but in truth he had not time for the french would have been upon him before it had been possible to have carried off his cannon and baggage and would have put all in confusion so he resolved to fight  nothing more surpised the french than to find that when they viewed the confederatearmy over night they saw them drawn up in battalia in the open field but in the morning when the fight was to begin found them entrenched up to the teeth with a regular parapet in front and in a posture not to be attacked without infinite disadvantage  then it was that the duke was advised to retire and give it over but he was gone too far to retreat with honor and resolved to attack them cost what it would  never was a more terrible fight it is in vain to describe it to thee it would take up a book not a letter the attacks were so furious the defense so resolute and obstinate that nothing that is humane can be supposed to do more the french found every avenue so guarded every regiment so well posted seconded and supported that they saw it impossible to penetrate any where but in one village and there the flower of the confederatetroops were posted so that the resistance was terrible  they attacked this village with such fury that they drove out or cut in pieces all the troops posted there but in a moment fresh troops attacked them again and drove them out with the same fury and slaughter  judge illustrious ali thou who have seen the most bloody attacks and the most obstinate defenses at bude belgrade and all the other great actions of the war in hungary where thou so often have repelled the fury of the germans to their confusion judge what slaughter must be the consequence of taking and losing this village three times in this manner in the space of about five hours  at last the duke of luxemberg putting the sum of the whole battle upon this one action came on the third time and carried the village succouring his troops so well and supporting them with such numbers that they could not be dislodged and when the king of england would have attacked them again he found some of his best troops so discouraged by the danger of the service that they did not do their duty nay as it is said refused to march  upon breaking in here the duke of bavaria pressed the king to give it over who was himself leading up his own guards english and dutch to drive the french back but the duke assuring the king that the french had entered so many troops that it was impossible to remove them prevailed on him with much difficulty to make a retreat before the troops were pushed into disorder upon which the king immediately ordered the left wing of his army to draw off and with his usual presence of mind made a desperate stand in the rear till they were quite clear off the field of battle  but his right had not such good luck for the french having driven them from their posts and having formed themselves in two lines within the entrenchments no sooner saw them begin their retreat but they attacked them with such vigor that they put them into the utmost confusion especially the cavalry who coming to a little river which was in their rear called the geet and the bridges not being able to receive them they tumbled into it one over another that though there was scarce water enough to drown them they were rather stifled in the mud with the weight of one another than drowned in the water  several whole squadrons seeing the consequence of attempting to pass the river chose rather to face about and charge again but there being nothing but desperation in such an attempt they were all cut in pieces  in short the french have an entire victory they have taken    pieces of cannon   mortars above a hundred colors standards and kettledrums with all their carriages ammunition and baggage five general officers  00 other officers and  000 soldiers and we are told that the enemy has left   000 men killed on the field of battle besides the wounded which are at least as many  this victory is so much the more glorious to france because the confederates lay so much stress upon the goodness of the troops and the conduct of the king of england that they thought it impossible they should be beaten but that confidence has often times been the ruin of great armies  it is true the loss of men is exceeding great in the french army and especially among the officers of whom they have lost abundance and a great many even of the kings own blood are wounded for the terrible conflict in the village and the manner in which they carried on the attack was such that their loss of men must be very great  they own here the loss of      men killed and wounded but others speak of three times that number  let the infidels fight and tear one another to pieces that the faithful may triumph over them but peace be in the illustrious port for ever   pax optima rerum quas homini novisse datum est  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter vi to the selictar aga or chief sword bearer to the sultan achmet lord of the illustrious among men prince of the kings of the three corners of the earth there is not a more empty and insignificant pageantry on earth than this the nazarens make such a noise about the world with viz about orders of knighthood  old sultan saladine the happy leader of the victorious mussulman exposed the nazaren knights to the last degree of ridicule and laughter in the account of his glorious victories over the enthusiastic crowds rather than armies of those fools that pretended to fight for the sepulcher of jesus had several of these sort of people prisoners in his armies who caused them to be led about in chains with all their trumpery their crosses their caps their mantles and sashes and afterward hanged them they carried always such a ridiculous weight of trophies and badges of one sort or another as rendered them more like porters bearing a vast burden on their backs than men prepared to buckle with an adversary  one of these a prince by birth and of a sovereign title was taken by one of the sultans dwarfs and for the honor of the pigmy soldier saladine caused him to lead his prisoner by a halter tied about his neck through the saracen camp in a word they were at last a shame to their own people and have been with good reason wholly extirpated except a sorry remain of them at the island of maltha where they fled after the immortal solomon the magnificent emperor of the mussulmans drove them from the isle of rhodes  here viz at maltha they live by rapin piracy and mockpiety and carry on the cheat of their knighthood among those that please to be cheated but at present their reputation is very low  but however the first contrivers of these honorary trifles have sunk the thing it self remains and the nazarens are so fond of it that there is now scarce a nation without what they call their order of knighthood the king of spain and the emperor have that of the golden fleece the king of england the garter and the king of france a blasphemous order called knights of the holy ghost i could say much of the impiety of it if i were one of those who believe the divinity of the holy ghost but that is not to the case before me  the order of the garter which is that of the king of england is a merry institution and sounds well enough being conceived in a frolic of one of their kings dancing with a lady who dropped a blue ribband from her leg which they call a garter which the amorous king took up and wore over his shoulder which blue ribband is to this day the chief ornament of the order this last month it was sent as a mighty piece of honor to the elector of saxony who received the gaudy trisle with wonderful acknowledgments and all possible ceremony wearing the blue ribband above his clothes wherever he goes  the like compliment the king of spain has made to prince lewis of baden of the order of the golden fleece and that great warrior walks about with the image of a dead sheep hanging about his neck one would think these people were mad that upon every whimsie make the meanest animals the trophy of honor to them as in their heraldry another of their sumptuary whimsies one carries a goats head for his device another a bunch of hops and an eminent family in england i have heard give three owls for their emblem or coat of distinction which bird they nevertheless esteem as the most contemptible another great family here shows a crab and another yet greater a ladder to say nothing of their veneration to a cross which is to them the highest of all ensigns though it be nothing less or more than a gibbet or a wheel is viz an engine of horror and death  but to go back to the order of the dead she for so it ought to be called i shall give thee from their histories a summary of its antiquity and institution and that in few words and leave the ridiculous part to thy wiser observation  the order of the golden fleece was instituted at bruges by philip the good duke of burgundy in the year      who commanded that all who were admitted into this order should carry in a collar composed of steel flint stones and st andrews crosses the representation of a sheep the spaniards generally believe that this order was instituted in honor of the holy virgin and st andrew by reason of an apparition of an angel that appeared to a certain countryman and gave him a fleece of gold commanding him withal to raise forces under that standard and so exspel the moors out of spain others believe it to have been instituted in memory of the great gain which the dukes of burgundy got by wool others in remembrance of gidcons fleece who with three hundred men defeated the whole army of the midianites the chemists will have it to be a chemical mystery in imitation of the famous golden fleece of the ancients which the most refined in that art say was no more than the secret of their elixir written in parchment others pretend that it owes the institution of it to the fishing for gold in some rivers of spain at which time they used to fling a sheeps fleece into the water and after it had lain a little while draw it up again and picked out the grains of gold that stuck to the wool which was practiced formerly by the inhabitants of calchis who by that means became so rich that they drew the covetous argonauts to invade them and make themselves masters of their wealth but they who imagine that all these orders owe their originals to the gallantries of princes affirm that it was in memory of a ladys combings whose hair was extremely white and with whom philip the good was passionately in love however it were it is a very ancient and honorable order in regard that the king of spain not only wears it himself but presents it to foreign princes the habit of the order is a coat of cloth of silver a mantle of crimson velvet and a hood of violet colored velvet  happy the inspired genius of the faithful who despising this taffety glory establish their names on the basis of virtue and make themselves truly great by their own heroic actions leaving the praise of their deeds to the trophies and garlands of the inlightend train of beauties in the garden of pleasure who despise the ensigns of temporary honor expecting a sublimer fame among the millions of heroes whose blood has raised the mussulmans empire above the songs or the tongues of men and whose merit seeming to lie in the dust of oblivion shall rise like a comet resound in glory and enlighten with its luster the valleys of beauty in the garden of pleasure  paris the   th of  th moon of the year      letter vii to mustapha osman a dervice of adrianople his friend here is such a tale of nazaren superstition told here just now as thou have not heard of i believe in many years and as i dare affirm may challenge all the follies of the blindest ages of paganism in the world to show any thing like it  thou art no stranger to the manner of the nazarens devotion having lived among them so long at vienna where they are as devout that is as superstitious as any where among the rest of their fopperies thou know they make allazehiah or consecrate a little bit of wafer or bread which they persuade the people to believe mark i do not say they believe it themselves i say they persuade the people to believe that this piece of bread is turned by the crossings and mutterings of words which they use over it into the substance the very body bones blood and flesh of the son of mary who they worship and call their savior  in a word i speak it with horror they call this consecrated wafer the real god that made them and the whole globe of heaven and earth and this trifle of their own making they adore as if jesus the son of mary were really there were this jesus who they call their prophet to come down from the mansions of paradise where he is surrounded with glory inconceivable with the four mighty prophets that went before him and where we believe our great prophet shines in unsufferable light with him i say were he to descend hither and see what a paltry demigod they substitute in his place and what adoration they pay to it in his stead he would certainly scourge this idol out of his worship and out of the moschs of his worshippers as he did the pawnbrokers out of the temple at jerusalem  but to return to the biggotry of the nazarens it was near a city called bruges in flanders where the scene i am to represent to thee was laid a certain sacrilegious wretch who had thou may be sure less veneration for the son of mary than for the golden pix so they call the vessel in which these consecrated gods are placed and left upon the altar in their moschs or if not so did not perhaps believe the truth of the priests allegations viz that god was laid up in the little gold box upon the altar i say this thief having more mind to the gold than veneration for the thing reposited broke into the mosch in the night and stole it away  the city thou may imagine was in a great uproar upon the discovery of such a dreadful crime the mosch or church was interdicted for  0 days and shut up being esteemed unclean after a wretch so impious had set his foot in it the gates of the city were immediately shut as if a murderer had been to be searched for and the strict enquiry was such that it was impossible the criminal could escape  when he was apprehended the main thing which was enquired of was what he had done with the deity as they esteemed it to be which the man not without torturing to extremity at length confessed he had thrown into a house of office  this was received with the utmost amazement and surprise the criminal was put to death with most exquisite torment being broken alive upon the wheel after his flesh had been first torn with burning pinchers  but that which is behind is more strange still for no sooner was it known where the wretch had cast the host so they call the consecrated wafer i have named to thee but the people flocked day and night to the unclean place to say their prayers to the idol swallowed up in excrement they continued this stinking devotion with such zeal that the finest ladies were not ashamed to be seen kneeling in that nasty place and crowding one another almost to death to get in nay if any one had fallen in for it was a deep vault i believe they would have esteemed it meritorious of heaven nor would they have suffered the filth to have been wiped off of their clothes least any part of the holy article should have been mingled with it  in a word the whole city concerned themselves in the thing and to expiate the offense which was committed within their walls they caused the vault full of filth as it was to be arched over and a chapel to be built there which is actually done and thither the biggotted citizens go to say their prayers morning and evening  righteous osman view the enthusiasm of blinded zeal in these infidels with a just abhorrence and rejoice in paying a more pure devotion to the great one god in the moschs of the faithful surely the nazarens have forgotten the institutes of their great prophet wherein he taught them a more reasonable service and are worshipping a worse god than ever the egyptians did  but nothing is more true than that ignorance accompanying devotion will lead men to do the meanest vile and loathsome things if they are but once persuaded it is meritorious as these nazarens believe if ever these people are accepted by their great prophet upon the merit of these devotions jesus the son of mary must be a meaner person than even we the followers of mahomet believed him to be  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter viii to muley hamet mahomozzi an egyptian at medina a master in the study of magic thou know old friend muley that i always condemned the art thou have so many years made thy study that i thought it an unperforming romancing piece of froth that i recommended to thee rather the study of antiquity and history and to restore to the world the first ages of the arabs and the mighty wars and magnanimous deeds of our ancestors the saracens the founding their glorious empire since devolved upon the invincible sultan our glorious emperor upon whose head be ten thousand years of joy in the bright paths of paradise  otherwise i recommended to thy capable genius the study of astronomy the search into the motions magnitude distance revolutions and eclypses of all the heavenly bodies but to turn sorcerer and magician in thy old age and to have all those illuminated parts which formed thy genius and made thee capable of mounting thy thoughts up to heaven i say to have these all sink down to hell and instead of ranging through the shining mazes of light in the summits of paradise be groping continually in the darkness of tophet where you can have no light but that of the infernal pit no oracle but that of the archdevil beelzebub and in which thy highest qualification or acquirement must be that of bringing evil tidings to the world this is an unaccountable folly  but i found thee obstinate and unpersuadable so i left thee to go on till old age and experience should bring thee to see thy self in the wrong and that all the wonderful pretenses thou have made to the knowledge of hidden things amount to no more than the tale of a roasted horse  and now after thirty years study and all the searches thou have made into the dark regions of horror after all thy acquaintance with the inhabitants of the air and with the world of spirits here is a device among the nazarens that i dare say has outdone thee in all that thou have not only arrived to thy self but in all that thou have ever heard of that any one else arrived to nay i much question whether the prince of evil spirits himself were he permitted to assume humane shape could act the like amazing things as this man has done  it is a religieuse or a student as he calls himself of the city of leon who carries about with him a shaking rod i fancy it sometimes to be just such another as that miraculous rod which moses carried in his hand when he stretched it out to bring plagues and desolation upon thy forefathers the egyptians this priest by the means of this rod or wand discovers treason conspiracies murder and robbery finds out lost treasure forgotten land marks secret adulteries and in a word detects all sorts of fraud lying and malicious false accusations  it was presently said this man dealt with the devil and they talked of burning him for a wizard or familiar but he confounded them with asking whether it was the devils business to detect crimes or to prompt men to crimes to do good or to do evil intimating that his rod was qualified to expose wickedness discover all sorts of villainies and bring offenders to justice but had no power to prompt or encourage any thing that was evil and this saved the man from censure  there is no more doubt of the truth of his performance than there is possibility of guessing by what means it is performed he is now in this city where he does wonders and the world is astonished at him monsieur the kings brother hid a great parcel of money in his garden and sunk a steelbox with some jewels in a fountain of water but the shaking wand discovered both immediately the princess of conde discovered by it a servant who had stolen several pieces of plate from her toilette particularly two large silver candlesticks though the robbery had been committed almost three years before it is impossible to question the truth of the stories they tell of this man and his wondrous rod unless one would doubt the whole city and believe every one you meet a party to the fraud  for my part i know not what to think of this man for as above there is no denying the facts he performs so there is no resolving how he performs it  i know the southsayers and diviners of the east the wise men of thy country and the magicians of persia used a wand in all their performances of this nature also we find in many ancient writings that the scythians the sarmatians and the thracians and many other nations used divinations and sorceries by twigs and rods in the same or like manner as this leontine does  the goths also retained this custom whether they received it from the ancient scythians or not i know not but i find it crept in among the huns and perhaps marched round through those desolate parts of the world which are now called muscovy into laponia and the north where nothing is more certain than that they raise storms and calms and cause the winds to blow this way or that as the mariners please or pay them and that they do it by crossing little switches or wands in wild and irregular motions to those quarters from whence they will have it blow  this rabdomantick art or divining by rods i thought had been dropped out of the world but they assure me here that when gustavus adolphus king of sweden made war in germany the swedish soldiers would with rods find out the treasure which the monks hid in their churches and convents in vaults and places under ground where nothing but such an art could do it  for my part i have so little faith in these things that i cannot give the credit to it that others do though at the same time i must confess i cannot detect any falacy yet in it though sometimes i begin to think there must be some legerdemain in it which no body could yet find out but which would in time discover it self as such things generally do the rest i must leave to time but i dare say thou will confess thou art outdone by this man and perhaps will say it is impossible to be true but for that there is no room for question because there is no argument against demonstration  paris  0th of the  th moon of the year      letter ix to the kaimacham the good fortune of the king of france is now indeed returned and though he did not make the advantage of the spring as he usually did and undertook nothing early yet the successes which have flowed in upon him since have abundantly made him amends in flanders he has gained the most glorious victory that ever he yet obtained in all his reign of which i have given thee a full account but as if this was not enough the successes of his armies have been on every side equal to it in proportion to the forces engaged  while the armies in flanders were preparing for that glorious action the duke de lorge passed the rhine in germany ravaged the frontiers of the empire with as much fury as ever a hoord of tartars made an inroad into poland only that they did not covet so much the sweeping away of the people for they do not sell slaves in these countries except such as are brought from africa who they call negroes  in this ravage they resolved to attack the city of hidleberg the capital of one of the electors of the nazaren empire which they did they pushed the siege with such fury on one hand and the place was so ill defended on the other that they took both the city and the castle in a very few days  in taking this castle they were masters of one of the finest palaces in all these parts of the world the seat of the elector palatine the buildings the furniture the paintings inimitably fine and inestimably rich all which the marshall de lorge caused first to be plundered by his soldiers and then burnt down to the ground for which all the world blamed him and spoke of the marshall with great tokens of abhorrence  but they tell us the marshall had express orders from the king his master for what he did and the reason they give for that is still a greater satyr upon the king viz that he ordered the castle and fine palace at heidleberg to be demolished because it was the only palace in the world that exceeded his new house at versailles  if this were true i say it was a great satyr on the pride and ostentation of the king of france  on the other hand the baseness of the governor who so ill defended this city has been treated with that just disgrace which such a piece of vile cowardice well deserves and of which i send thee a particular account that thou may present to the divan a precedent commendable and very fit to be used upon such officers as being entrusted with places of importance fail in their duty or basely give up the fortresses of the empire of the faithful into the hands of the enemy  the governor of heidleberg was the baron heidesdorf a major general of the emperors armies a franconian by birth of a good family one of the knights of the teutonick order and till now he was thought to have been a very good officer but his cowardice and surprise was proved plainly on a full hearing before a court martial and his sentence was very severe for they sentenced him to be beheaded after being degraded of all his honors which was done with the utmost disgrace  the execution was in this form viz he was carried to the house of the teutonick order which is in hailbrun where he was clad in the robes of one of the knights and then having both his collar and his cross taken from him they struck him twice upon the face with it then the youngest knight taking him by the arm thrust him out of the house and gave him two kicks at the door that leads into the street nor was this all but he was carried in a tumbrel by the common hangman to the prince of badens camp and after he had been a spectacle to all the army drawn up in battalia on purpose he was lead up to a scaffold where he was to have lost his head as the sentence imported but as the executioner was preparing to do his duty there came a reprieve which gave him his life at the intercession of the teutonick order but still more disgrace for after the hangman had girt his sword about him he took it from him again immediately broke it in two and gave him three slaps with the flat side of the blade upon his face at the end of this ignominious execution he was declared banished out of the circles of suabia franconia the upper rhine and austria to which purpose the hangman carried him in his tumbrel beyond the neckar and there left him where as some letters say the country people much more his friends than they who begged his life on such shameful terms in a few days after knocked him on the head some say he requested a bor that is a countryfellow to do him that office as of kindness that he might not live to see his disgrace  heroic prince of the immortal spahis thou art well able to judge how much more agreeable death must be to a man of honor than such usage and after all they say the baron was a man of as much personal bravery as any man and had distinguished himself with great advantage upon many occasions however being overpowered now with great numbers and seeing no relief at hand he unhappily misbehavd at last  it is necessary sometimes too to let the weight of all fall upon one head to excuse others for after all they allege that due care was not taken to repair the fortifications of the place or to give him a body of men able to have made a good defense  happy the invincible empire of the mussulmans where it never was known that any governor aga or bassa in the numerous armies of the grand seignior being entrusted with the defense of any fortified town betrayed it to the unbelievers let the nazarens testify for us and let it be spoken openly what characters they give here to the honor of our bassas governors of buda newhausel gran canisia great waradin and belgrade and to the blood those sieges or blockades have cost the unbelievers before they got them or any of them into their hands  in this the empire of our immortal sultan is truly invincible viz that nothing falls out of the hands of his slaves the leaders of his mighty armies but with all the resistance and defense that honor and an inviolable fidelity to their master calls for from them  i remember the glorious defense thou made at the first siege of buda made famous under thy government by the bones the nazarens left in heaps under the walls for which inimitable conduct thou art still honored among thy enemies and advanced worthily to the favor and cabinet of the greatest emperor in the world  paris   th of the  th moon of the year      letter x to the captain bassa in my last to thee i gave an account of a terrible blow given to the french naval power by the british and dutch in the great battle at sea and the burning their ships afterward in their own harbor thou may now see the reverse  certainly what the french want in force they make up in policy and in vigilance it was true that the french though their diligence in repairing their navy was beyond all that the world thought possible were not able to fight the english and dutch fleet joined together who were no less than  0 men of war of the line yet by their vigilance and dexterity in taking hold of the advantage offered them they have given the confederates a terrible blow at sea and had not the confederates been very fortunate even in this disaster the blow had been much greater  the english and dutch whose trade is their wealth and the fountain of their strength especially at sea had prepared a mighty fleet of merchantships bound to portugal spain and the levant and to the august port also the receptacle of nations richly freighted with all sorts of wealth and rich commodities proper for those parts  this great fleet contained above  00 sail and the grand navy being ready to sail it was thought convenient to take the advantage of their convoy as far as they could be had which was to the mouth of the bay of biscay here the said united grand navy left the merchants to proceed on their several voyages and left them about thirty men of war to be their convoy  it was in an ill hour the grand fleet left them the  0 th of june for the vigilant french who watched for such a desirable booty and well knew where they would part sailed about   days before them from the coast of france with  0 men of war and waited for them in legos bay and on the coast of portugal and spain about cape st vincent which they call here the southward cape  about the    d they took a small french bark who told them there was    french men of war in legos bay but the english having  0 men of war thought of a booty rather than a battle on that account on the    th they began to discover some french ships of war being at that time about cape st vincent and the next day in the morning they plainly perceived the whole french fleet to their great surprise and even amazement the english admiral with    men of war discovering plainly the superior strength of the french shifted his course westward and having some advantage of the wind made all the sail they could giving a signal to the merchantships and to the dutch men of war to follow among the merchantships there was the greatest consternation imaginable every one cried out to his fellow we are all undone  the french not regarding so much the men of war fell in among the merchantmen who every one endeavored to shift for themselves the best they could and the fleet being so very great many got away however above threescore and six sail were taken or burnt most of them richly laden two dutch men of war after an obstinare fight were taken four english merchantships immensly rich bound to the happy port were sunk by the french after they were entered the harbor of gibraltar and a dutch ship burnt  in a word though it was next to miraculous that the french got no more booty yet the loss to the english and dutch amounts to many millions of livres and the consternation throughout those trading nations is inexpressible  the dutch lost three sultanas taken and two burnt the english two and a store ship besides the merchantships  this action has revived the courage and restored the credit of the french seamen who it was said were very much dispirited at the last years misfortune and at the manifest superiority of the confederate fleets the loss of the confederates in ships and in goods is esteemed at    millions of livres and the french say that now they are even with the english for the burning their men of war at lahogue  the very same hour almost that this news makes glad the people of france they are rejoicing also on the accounts of accumulated victories over their enemies on all sides on the rhine they have pushed the germans far into the empire defeated several of their bodies raised infinite contributions upon the circles dismantled their towns and ravaged the country  in catalonia the french army and navy has carried roses by a short siege of eight days by sea and land and has ravaged the country far and wide even to the gates of barcelona which it is said they will also besiege  invincible captain of a thousand sultanas chief admiral of the armadas of the faithful thou know what it is to gain victories as well as to rejoice in them the triumphs of the french nation are faint emblems of the glorious conquests of our invincible emperor in the days when the kingdoms of the world fell faster into their hands than towns do here into the hands of france  may victories continue still to crown the head of thy immortal master till surrounded with inimitable glory he ascends to paradise in the arms of our great prophet mahomet there to enjoy the treasures of peace in the company of omar ekir and alibeker the blessed and shine like the sun in the strength of inexpressible glory  paris   th of the  th moon of the year      letter xi to the grand vizier i am destined to write of nothing but victories for this whole year if france goes on thus a little longer lewis xiv and the bright scepter of the invincible race of ottoman the glorious whose days be many and his people prosperous will meet on the banks of danubius and share the empire of the world between them  i have thrice already written of the victories of the french by land and sea the taking of cities and towns and a vast extent of dominions depending on them are things too mean to engage a pen which has the wonders of this reign to describe france has crowned the campaign with another complete victory and that over the enemy of all the rest which most moved his choler  it had been a mortification almost insupportable to the french court to find the little d of savoy a prince who the king could at another time have crushed with one of his fingers insult him while his hands were as it were tied by the struggles he had with more significant enemies the marshall catinat complained in his letters to the king that while the marshall de luxemburgh had still    000 men in flanders even after the confederates were defeated at landen the duke de lorge  0000 men on the rhine and no enemy to fight with and the duke de noailles   000 in catalonia while the spaniards durst not look him in the face he only catinat should be left with a handful of men as if condemned to the misery of seeing his majesty affronted by the savoyard without power to resist and concludes his letter with earnest entreaties for succors or that the king would give him leave with  000 horse that were with him and that were made desperate with seeing the ruin of their country to break into the enemys armies and die as became them with their swords in their hands  at length the king gave ear to the mareschals importunities and ordered the duke de lorge to make a detachment of   000 men from alsace to march to italy among which were the gens d arms and other troops of the household and at the same time the campaign being over in catalonia the duke de noailles was ordered to detach  000 foot and  000 horse from that side and though the march was long yet both those detachments together with  000 men from provence joined monsieur catinat almost together and came in so good time that he had an opportunity to enter piedmont just as the duke of savoy grown haughty by his success pretended to bombard pignerol  the duke hearing of the march of the french drew off and retreated to cover turin which the marshall catinat made him believe he would attack and the two armies met in the great plain of marsaglia about five leagues from turin  the marshall an old soldier who knew his army was now equal at least in number and superior in cavalry to the savoyard and whose troops were sufficiently provoked by the ravages which the germans and spanish troops in particular had made the year before in france for which they waited an occasion to pay them home i say the marshall and his whole army breathing nothing but revenge made no stop but as soon as they came up with their enemies let them see they must fight for it and acrordingly lying but one night in reach of the dukes army the next morning he marched in full battalia directly to their camp and fell upon them with such fury that nothing could withstand them  it was observed that the cavalry in the french left wing and the infantry in the main battle charged their enemy sword in hand without firing a gun the foot with their handjars screwed on the muzzles of their pieces a method never practiced before coming up to the teeth of the milanese troops overturned all that stood in their way so that receiving their first fire and not firing at all themselves the enemies were cut in pieces before they had time to charge their muskets a second time  in short this daring courage of the king of frances troops dispiritted the duke of savoys troops to that degree that they could no where stand their ground before the french their army is quite broken above  000 killed on the spot  000 taken prisoners    pieces of cannon all their baggage and  0  colors and standards taken by the french  invincible prince of generals the particulars of this battle will assure thee how easily the german cavalry are to be conquered not the curiassers themselves of whom such terrible things have been said though armed and barbd man and horse were able to resist the french gens d arms and light horse who despising armor and neglecting their carabines charged naked into the line of the german horse and by the dextrous management of their horses and an invincible daring courage broke them in an instant and cut them in pieces with their swords only  glory attend the armies of the illustrious resplendent emperor of the world led by thy experienced and victorious hand these victories of the french will make way for thy conquests and the nazaren emperor shall no more be able to stand before thee being obliged to call off his armies to defend his imperial palace from the conquering french who if no sudden and unexpected accident intervene will soon make the walls of vienna tremble  while i am writing this to thee news is come from the duke of luxemburgh that he has convinced the world that the victory he obtained at landen was complete by his besieging charleroy in the face of the king of englands army who pretended to be recruited again but did not think fit to try their hands in another battle the town held out but    days after the trenches were opened and is surrendered which makes the victories of the french this year be no less than    in number  paris   th of the  0th
