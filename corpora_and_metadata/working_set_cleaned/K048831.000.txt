honorable lord harrowby my lord albina had the honor of being known to your lordship almost from her infancy her faults and her graces you are already acquainted with as she grew up in some measure beneath your lordships eye she is now arrived at maturity and if in her present state my lord you should find her more polished than when she had last the honor of your attention it is chiefly owing to the hints with which you then favored me  i have the honor to be my lord your lordships grateful and obedient humble servant h cowley  preface the very favorable reception with which the pieces i have presented to the stage have been honored by the public has given them the appearance of great success and it is probable that those who were witnesses of their reception will be surprised to find this tragedy prefaced by complaints of hardship and injury and to know that it has been productive of a train of mortifications and disappointments to its author  it is with the utmost reluctance that i feel myself compelled to enter into the disagreeable circumstances which preceded the representation this is however necessary as i now present a tragedy which i presume to call original to the cooler inspection of the reader though i know that the principal circumstances of the plot and the leading traits of character have appeared in other plays previous to the representation of this  the idea of writing for the stage struck me by mere accident and the runaway was my first literary attempt of any kind i am as ready as the severest critic can wish to admit that it has all the crudeness of a first attempt it succeeded however on the stage far beyond my most sanguine expectations and during its run which was stopped by the benefits was one of the most profitable plays both to the author and manager that appears on the records of the treasurybooks at either house  a success so encouraging opened a new prospect of advantage to my family which i have since pursued with alacrity but this success closed with the unfortunate period in which mr garrick resigned the management of drury lane  when mr sheridan obtained a share of the patent i flattered myself that i had some right to his attention as author of the last piece which was produced by his able predecessor but the first winter in which he commenced the management my comedy to use the technical term was shelfd the vanity of a young author was piqued and i wrote to mr sheridan in the civilest terms i could to remonstrate on the occasion but of my letter not the least notice was taken as i was not then informed of mr sheridans general neglect of letters i considered this slight as a particular insult to me especially as the comedy was not played again that year but by command of their majestys and for the benefit of performers i therefore selt myself under a necessity of presenting my tragedy at covent garden but as i had some reason to dread mr harriss opinions it was presented to him in the summer of      by a lady of rank with the name and sex of the author concealed after several weeks of anxious expectation it was returned peremptorily rejected i then waited on him and avowed the unfortunate piece but had little reason to flatter myself with the circumstances of my reception mr harris to d me that there was no hope from alteration that the play was unfit for the stage and that he was convinced it never could be made fit he disliked the whole idea of gondiberts situation and thought every incident of the fifth act inadmissible as he believed no audience would hear it the last part of this opinion surprised me as i had conceived the fifth act was the principal strength of the piece but i was compelled to submit nor is its rejection the injury of which i complain had the ashes of my tragedy rested undisturbed i might have mourned over them but i would have mourned in silence  the tragedy of percy was soon after announced i attended its representation with anxious curiosity at this play had been approved by that judgment which had decided so severely on mine at the opening of the piece i was much concerned to see an old english story attempted though it bore little resemblance to the legendary tales of percy and douglas and that so much was said of chivalry and of expeditions to the holy land  circumstances which though finely calculated for the stage had been much neglected by our poets in favor of the tales of greek and roman antiquity yet as the crusades are common historical facts i could only consider my being in some measure anticipated as unfortunate but i can hardly describe my astonishment or distress when i saw raby the father of the heroine appear in almost the same situation with westmoreland and resent his soninlaws imputation on the honor of his daughter in a train of ideas exactly similar to those which i had given to the father of adina and that he even spoke several lines nearly verbatim which will be found on comparing the two tragedies  i learnt from the papers of next day that percy was a translation from a tragedy called gabrielle de vergy written by m belloy i was soon after informed by persons who had read the original for i am unacquainted with the language that in m belleys tragedy there is no father i had remarked indeed during the representation that raby seemed to have no connection with the plot he was out of the way during all the business of the play and returned just time enough to challenge the defamer of his daughter and to call himself her champion which however neither introduces nor retards a single event  various were my conjectures on this occasion but prudence suggested a cautious silence as i had still hopes at drury lane mr sheridan received me infiitely better than i expected and regretted that i had not brought my piece before as mr jephson and mr craddock had each a tragedy promised for the next winter       which must put it off another season but assured me in the most explicit terms that no other tragedy should come before it provided it was proper for the stage which he added in a very polite manner he had no doubt of he soon after received my farce of who is the dupe with equal frankness and promised that it should be brought out in the best part of the season as some recompense for the delay of my tragedy more than satisfied happy with my prospects i had only to regret that i had misapprehended his neglect of my letter and caused myself so many uneasy hours  the law of lombardy was soon after put into rehearsal and i learnt with great surprise that it bore a resemblance to albina in the conduct of the piece though not in the story or characters i was greatly alarmed at the idea of more anticipation which whether accidental or otherwise was destructive of every prospect of reputation or advantage to me this resemblance was mentioned to mr sheridan and i thought myself happy when by his interposition mr harris was prevailed on to read the tragedy on the suggestion that some alteration had been made and they acknowledged that if both pieces were entitled to the stage the only means of doing justice to both was to bring them out at the same time at different houses otherwise the novelty of one of them must be destroyed  and the idea of rival tragedies might be as advantageous as that of rival actors had been on some particular occasions this matter of very anxious expectation was suspended near a month as mr sheridan met with great difficulty in finding the copy of the tragedy in the meantime the speaking pantomime of the touchstone was brought out and as i was then in great good humor with mr harris i had a pleasure in endeavoring to suggest some useful alterations and was happy when he accepted the new scene of lady fashions rout which i considered as an earnest that he intended to accept the tragedy mr sheridan at length found albina and i attended him by appointment on this occasion i waited three hours which was rather longer than he had ever made me wait before he came at length with the tragedy in his hand and i feel myself too much flattered by what he then said to omit it whatever length it may add to my tale  he made a thousand apologies and in apologies for negligence mr sheridan is remarkably easy and successful but said he had brought the best in his hand which was my tragedy saying i have now read every word of it i was determined not to see you till i had and this it is that has kept me so long before i enter into particulars i will tell you that i think your tragedy a very good one it will do you much honor and be of service to the theateron my acknowledgements he added upon my word i really think what i say and without a compliment i am surprised that such a tragedy could have been refused mr harris must have seen it when his head was full of other business if he had read it attentively he could not have refused it this tragedy has a right to the stage it must and shall be done  the tragedy was then opened and mr sheridan showed me several indentings against lines which he wished me to consider he said the characters were very strongly drawn and the story interesting and frequently pointed out passages which on account of the poetry or the thought he was pleased to admire the only objection of importance was that he thought gondibert should not see or mention the bridal bed in the last scene but on my attempting a timorous defense he added dont alter this or any other passage unless it strikes you as it does me you ought to be tenacious every original writer must give up passages with difficulty it is only translators and borrowers who are so ready to comply with every hint that is proposed  the judgment pronounced by mr sheridan made me particularly happy as mr harris had promised the same morning that he would be guided by mr sheridans opinion who said he would give the tragedy to mr harris himself and tell him what he thought of it this was adding favor to favor and my thanks i believe sufficiently expressed my sentiments  mr harris a few days afterward took my tragedy as he imagined into the country but on opening it found that mr sheridan had by mistake given him a comedy this occasioned another weeks suspense it was then however obtained and read and i had scarce a doubt considering every circumstance that it would be put into immediate rehearsal  all my hopes were however confounded by mr harriss persevering with inflexible steadiness in his former opinion he said there had been no material alterations which was certainly true and that it was still his opinion that the tragedy could never be made fit for the stage when he was reminded that mr sheridan entertained a very different opinion of it he replied i dont believe he has read it he may have dipped into it but i am convinced he has not read it through this was afterward discussed in the presence of both when mr sheridan assured mr harris that he had read the whole and that it was his opinion it ought to be done but mr harris remained inflexible  when i next saw mr sheridan it was on the subject of my farce he observed me dispirited and kindly taking my hand said never mind em you and i will show that we know a good tragedy  this farce mr harris had offered to take and put into immediate rehearsal but as i had then no doubt of its being played in an advantageous part of the season at drury lane i had no inducement to change the house for which it was intended who is the dupe however in consequence of repeated breaches of appointments and promises was not produced till the middle of the benefits when it could not have a regular run and i was then to pay an hundred guineas thirty of which had been added by the present managers for the chance of a benefit at a time when the current business of the theater would not produce that sum  the pecuniary disappointment i did not consider as material in this instance as i hoped that the applause with which the farce was uniformly received would have put an end to the difficulty of getting my pieces on the stage which was infinitely more harrassing to my mind than the labor of producing them i was however soon after greatly hurt to hear that mr sheridan evaded the subject when it was accidentally menioned and advised me to write a comedy  it was necessary for this purpose that i should have some comic ideas and they were all completely driven from my mind by the vexations i had undergone i had indeed made some progress in writing a piece founded on turkish manners the scene of which is laid in asia and slattered myself with success from the novelty of the attempt but it lies and must lie in its present state till i have reason to believe it will meet with a fair and candid reception from the theaters  mr craddocks tragedy was then preparing for rehearsal and the parts given out but another play of miss mores was discovered to be nearly finished and mr harris was so eager to bring it out though it was then near the conclusion of the season that she has said he would hardly give her time to finish it there was only one capital actress at either house who would undertake a new part in may and though she belonged to drury lane she was cast in miss mores pray at covent garden in consequence of the levelling power of the coalition and mr craddocks play was put off till next season  another play by miss more alarmed me greatly the terror of suffering again what i had felt at percy induced me to write to her in much agitation a d i am sorry that i was prevented from sending that letter and induced to believe it was impossible that the same palpable resemblance could again happen under this conviction i attended the representation and heard with astonishment what appeared to me to be every essential circumstance in the plot and character of my play and to observe that it was changed principally in those places which had been objected to in mine in orlando as in gondbert the action springs from love which took its rise in a situation wherein hope was impossible though the object is changed from the widow of his brother to the betrothed mistress of his friend  the character and offices of editha were given though the sex was changed from the same motive of aggrandizing his fortune though without the same stimulus of a degraded situation he worms himself into the considence of the despairing lover and persuades him that he is secretly beloved by isabella whilst she receives the addresses of another orlando breaks into a rhapsody similar to that of gondibert persuades himself he had seen many proofs of that concealed passion and gives himself up to the guidance of his artful counselor which produces a catastrophe that is nearly the same orlando in the dark intending to stab rivers by a fortunate mistake stabs bertrand and the principal situation of the catastrophe is produced exactly in the same manner in both plays which is by the critical entrance of the person supposed to be murdered the greater part of this however passes behind the scenes in fatal falsehood by which the dramatic effect is weakened but the principal objections made to mine are removed the character of the sister of rivers and other parts of the play differ from mine but there is a scene between the father and his daughter on her being rejected by orlando that bears the same resemblance in the literal expression to the scene between westmoreland and albina in the fourth act of this play as the scene in percy did to that between him and edward  how all these wonderful resemblances happened it is impossible for me to know  nor do i know that miss more ever saw my tragedy  it was in mr garricks possession under the name of edwina soon after the conclusion of the season in which he he left the stage about which time i have since been informed miss more was an inmate at hampton and that the play afterward called percy was then translating my tragedy was afterward in mr harriss closet at the same time with percy and again nearly at the same time with fatal falsehood i know that managers are continually employed in giving advice and in suggesting alternations to authors and i have frequently heard before i had any experience in this anxious warfare of the danger when once an idea is afloat in the theatrical hemisphere of its getting into other plays amidst the crowd of plots and stage contrivances in which a manager is involved recollection is too frequently mistaken for the suggestions of imagination  should it after all appear to the public that there is nothing more in these repeated resemblances than what may be accounted for by supposing a similarity in our minds and that by some wonderful coincidence miss more and i have but one common stock of ideas between us i have only to lament that the whole misfortune of this similarity has fallen upon me and as in this case we must continue writing in the same track it seems reasonable that we should have our productions brought forward in turn instead of which miss more has had two tragedies brought out both of which were written since mine whilst i struggled for the representation of this in vain but as there seems to be little hope of my obtaining this or any other favor from the winter managers i presume at least that as i do not pretend to prove  what it is impossible for me to know  that miss more ever read or copied me that it will be admitted that i have not copied her had i not been able to ascertain the fact that my tragedy was written long before percy and fatal falsehood appeared no proof would have been required beyond their extreme similarity that i had been guilty of the grossest plagiarism  i now found myself deprived of all hope of albinas appearing to the public as an original play yet i still conceived myself sure of its being represented at drury lane the next season but i soon after accidentally learnt that mr sheridan had promised another tragedy and as mr craddocks had been put off i well knew that three would not be done  this with his evading the subject and saying that he thought mr harris would still do it reduced me to the disagreeable necessity of asking an explicit declaration when i heard with inexpressible astonishment  that he neyer intended to do the play at drury lane and that the next season was engaged to mr craddock and another gentlemanon being reminded of his promises and encomiums he said  it was still his opinion that the tragedy was a very good one that it ought not to have been refused and that he had proposed to prevail on mr harris after all to bring it out but as this had been improperly mentioned to mr harris there was now an end of it i was then charged with having pieced conversations together which mr sheridan said should never happen again and from the whole of his behavior it appeared to me that he meant this to close his doors against me  this most injurious and unaccountable conduct appears to me to be the effect of that coalition of the theaters which by uniting the interests and prejudices of the managers deprives an author of all hope after a piece has been rejected by one had mr sheridan been unconnected with covent garden i have no doubt from the opinion he conceived of my tragedy but that it would have been brought out in a most advantageous manner ideas of rivalship which is the natural and proper effect of two houses would have been as favorable to me as their union has been ruinous  the morning succeeding my interview with mr sheridan mr colman was asked to bring out a tragedy for me at the haymarket which both the winter managers had refused his answer was  when an author of reputation thinks proper to bring me a piece i dont think i have a right to deliberate if mrs cowley invites the town to a tragedy at the haymarket i am only the midwife to give it a safe delivery to the world when one does not know a writer it is different  this candid and liberal answer i have great pleasure in recording the tragedy when read drew an approbation not less warm from mr colman than from mr sheridan and it was not merely praise mr colman put it into immediate rehearsal for which i think myself under the highest obligation as tragedy is inconsistent with the sportive genius of the haymarket and there was little hope of advantage equal to the expensive preparation of a regular tragedy it was however presented with no other alteration than the curtailments which were necessary on account of the length where the time of representation is shorter than in the winter theaters  and with the disadvantage of having one of its principal editha since given to miss sherry characters performed in a style which excited laughter yet it was received with a degree of applause for which i should be ungrateful were i not vain of it  had i taken up my pen merely in pursuit of applause i should have been completely gratified but this though so ostentatiously held out as the motive for productions in the poetic line has seldom in any age or country produced works of any considerable reputation dramatic writers in particular have always sought for support from their labor which is too great to be undertaken for amusement this may appear a vulgar topic but to me it is a very serious subject of complaint that by the conduct of the winter managers i have been deprived of a reasonable prospect of several hundred pounds and have spent years of fruitless anxiety and trouble my productions have been uniformly received by the public with applause yet i find the doors of the winter theaters shut against me  to this severe fate i most reluctantly submit  prologue the first part of this prologue which was intended for mr parsons was not spoken on the stage  prompter speaking without pray sir come back  come back  the author swears that if you speak  hang authors and their airs i say i will speak though she burst with rage what right has she upon our summer stage   with dismal stories and long acts in verse solemn and slowpaced as a midnight hearse heydey from floor to

challenge edward will thou proclaim thy love for raimond no love so unsanctiond starts from human customs and from all human laws yet still methinks he should not win the countess  gondibert should not shall not  editha with what an insolent content he left her he passed me but too full of bliss was he to see an object less than his albina sudden it struck me  now with how much ease this haughty joy might be transformed to woe thy heart now swelling with triumphant passion a little word that touched it with suspicion would with a serpents tooth its raptures cure  suspicion once awakened never sleeps  gondibert suspicion of albina  editha yes  suspicion infuse its poison  twill be balm to thee  gondibert impossible  resplendent lilies that in deserts bloom where mans licentious eye has never roamd boast less unsullied pureness than her mind  editha though to the world she spotless may appear as mountain snow yet can no doubtful tint by a suspicious brother be discerned lord raimond may have trusted gondibert with fears that he kept chary from the world or may not you in some unguarded moment   admitted by a brothers rights have caught her frigid virtue melting at the suit of some young paramour  gondibert hah  editha your tried honor must stamp the story with the face of truth and force conviction on his heart in spite of all the doubts which passion may retain to plead in beautys cause  gondibert oh ye just powers what must the passion what be the despair that prompts my haughty soul to such mean arts deceit till now a stranger to my heart welcome with all thy wiles  upon my tongue distill thy subtle poison to blister edwards peace yet it is not possible one look one tone of here is would controvert the blackest tales that malice could suggest  editha let him but feel the sting of jealousy and every tone and look will fix it deeper  gondibert should he be wrought to such accursed belief not he alone but all mankind would scorn her  the antiquated maid the wife the hypocrite whilst the loose wanton hails with impious joy a sister in albina horrid thought that form beheld by the admiring world with chaste respect  shall it with loose contempt be gazed on  shall the angelic mind of her my soul adores ever feel the stings the bitterness of scorn  editha be it thy prayer thy hope thy comfort think on the riches of that bounteous hour when raimond drooping sunk beneath the shame the world will pour upon her guiltless head   by edward left  abandoned by her father the eye of nature virtue friendship shut in thee alone she finds respect and love beholds thee weep her woes and share her anguish   accomplish this and thank thy liberal stars  gondibert oh twere a boundless luxury of bliss i would steal her sorrows rob her of her griefs and give her in exchange soft peace and love yet oh it cannot be  me she would regard with a cold sisters brow  editha lovers it is said have eagles sight that can interpret glances and the soft language of a blush explain but eyes and blushes speak in vain to you  or you have read them backwards  gondibert ha what say thou lead not i charge thee to such dangerous heights yet tell me   editha tell thee strange that gondibert he who can penetrate the veil of policy detect the sophists arts and trace the chain whose hidden links control the will of man that he should need be told what not to know argues gross blindness or determined error  gondibert blindness to what editha speak  explain  editha recall then to your mind the marriage months of the deceased lord  did no complaint no word ambiguous ever escape his lips reflecting on the coldness of albina  gondibert her coldness  ha  what then  editha nay answer me can you remember  gondibert yes i have never forgot that as he feasted once my greedy ear with praises of his bride he sudden stopped and with a sigh  a sigh which seemed tescape from hidden stores  exclaimed  yet gondibert all good and beauteous as she is not yet have i inspired her icy heart with love  editha then hear she is not ice albinas bosom glows with all natures sympathetic fire know too that when a wife untouched appears by a fond husbands tender anxious love it is not because she is formed of flint or snow albinas heart was to her husband cold because some happier youth engrossed its fire some happy youth unconscious of his fate the countess loved and thou  yes thou were he  gondibert then i am most accursed it cannot be albina loved not me  or if she did tell me perfidious woman  cruel tell me why did till now conceal the glorious secret why now reveal it  editha to confirm your purpose compassion to your sorrows has impelled me now to reveal a confidence reposed   no not reposed to chance i owe the tale  gondibert editha thou have caught my listening soul  her faculties her every sense she crowds to one i am all ear  editha oppressed with cares as once upon a couch i had reclined to woo a short repose albina entered tender her look deep thought was in her eye which pensively upon the vacant air she fixed  then turned it eager on the portrait where you a mars the living canvas shows and for a while with ardent gaze surveyed it  saying had i the pencil held that helmet had been loves chaplet and the uncouth armor upon those graceful limbs bright hymens flowery robe i started  she espied me and overcome with shame and sinking eeu to earth with fear conjured me by the love i bore her fame by all the sacred honor of our sex never to divulge  never whisper to my heart the fatal secret which through chance was mine  gondibert it is enough  she loves  albina loves the truth divine swift rushes on my heart and all its powers confess the rapturous guest thousand sweet tokens now afresh start up darting like hidden sunbeams on my mind and make it drunk with bliss but edward  edward blind fool to feast on shadows  dream of happiness whilst one more daring boldly asks the substance and bears it from my arms  my hopes forever  editha trust me my lord if you can thwart their marriage she will again return with heightned ardor to her first love and with sweet chidings meet the tardy vows that gave another leave to ask the heart she would fain have given to thee  gondibert oh it is a bribe would tempt my soul to earth if at the gates of paradise thou phantom honor hide thy stern head conscience go sleep till sated love shall give thee leave to prate then will i hear thee  wail in a friars cowl the precious sin and think monastic rigours too slight  too poor a penance for my joys  editha to scape suspicions prying eyes well part when nights kind shades shall wrap all mortal things in doubtful semblance meet me in the garden there edward you shall see and frame his mind to such conviction as i mean to give it  gondibert commands like mystic oracles you give hiding in doubtful words a glorious fate to thee sweet priestess i resign my faith nor dare beyond what you reveal enquire ye hours wear wings till we shall meet again  exit editha so  to mould the frenzy of despairing love is no less easy than to wind the jealous oh that man  a being formed as if in natures vanity to show how great how exquisite her skill

mists of passion he will then rejoice we have saved him from an act which all his future days would mark with horror  editha with this design did gondibert trust you  egbert not with the circumstance he means to urge i from disjointed converse drew his purpose ere morning dawns he hopes to disunite the noble pair  editha so  this is then your errand  egbert this is my errand to preserve their hearts from fierce distractions pangs when they hear things that else might shake their faith  editha it is well old man i will acquaint the countess with your message and bring you here her orders  exit egbert gracious heaven pardon if i do break my faith to him whom i am bound to serve i serve him now i drag him from a deep abyss of guilt which all his future days in deep remorse and acts of virtue spent would hardly purify repentance calls not back the deed it mourns and years of penitence will not raze out the marks that sin has graved  enter editha with servants editha seize that old

of him whose errors should by thee be cloakd and screend from mortal eyes why stand ye loitring thus it is from your mistress these commands i bring  if you obey them not it is at your peril  egbert oh hear me hear for the sake of him   they drag him off editha when fools like you will prate ye must be cagd lest ye should babble to the gaping world of things ye have not powers to comprehend to choose that dotard for a confidant better have told the story at the mart or to the mummers who infest our halls to be by them personifyd on eves and holidays of his imprisonment his lord must not be told should he survive these days of trouble he shall be released mean time he will learn discretion  exit scene another part of the garden enter egbert and servants egbert oh wonder not that i should

streaming tears  cherished my griefswoln heart and placed me in earl raimonds family  wherein to youth and manhood i have grown thou then were my preserver  now i am thine  egbert in truth surprise and terror so dismayed me i knew you not now that i do i bless you  servant such orders from the countess never were given but proud edithas power made it unsafe to thwart her in that grotto thou may bide till the evening grows more dark  then use this key it leads you to the grove farewell good egbert  exit egbert farewell my friend  tomorrow better thanks i will present thee  heaven twas not thy will that i should basely perish in my duty forgive me that my confidence did fail and for a moment gave me to despair  enter the grotto enter gondibert and editha gondibert it is beyond my hopes it is a design which sure some pitying spirit did inspire who once enrobd in flesh felt passions sting  and sympathetic still to human sorrows bestowed the vision on thy quickening brain but how requite thee for thy generous aid for me thy fame thy welfare thou do hazard  editha to your great brother i indebted stand that i have now existence  it is but just that i should risk for you the welfare he bestowed  gondibert but where is he  this edward  who has thrust twixt me and my felicity his claim though now you are perched upon the giddy wheel and thankst thy fate for such a glorious stand

stunning proof such as would shake a faith engraved on the heart ere its first pulses beat no tale though varnished with the deepest skill no circumstance though guided by the hand of art can shade or for a moment throw the slightest cloud on countess raimonds fame but demonstration  demonstration speaking to his gross sense that edward that shall force thee to curse the paragon of natures works and yield thee to thy raptured rivals arms  editha yet tale and circumstance will have their weight they will mould his mind for the broad proof which else like arrows striking against a marble rock will shiver or rebound i go to watch when he retires and to direct him hither besure you mark each motion of his heart catch every passion on a barbed hook and torture him till he with agony shall hate her   gondibert the fierce transports of his rage may prompt him on the instant to accuse her  editha to counteract his transports be my care this laboring head my lord has not so framed the close design for blundring chance to mar may we depend upon your servants faith  gondibert they are devoted to my will  editha enough the dress prepared you will find within my closet the antichamber

us has hung us round with senses exquisite has planted in our hearts resistless passions the first to weaken and the last to war on poor defenseless naked virtue how dark the night the moon has hid her head as scorning with her lucid beams to gild this murky business through umbrageous trees the whistling eurus speaks in hollow murmurs and dismal fancy in yon shadowy ailes might conjure up an hundred phantoms how strong the impression of our dawning years the tales of sprites and goblins that did awe my infancy all rush upon my mind and spite of haughty reason make it shrink who is it approaches  enter edward edward edward  gondibert gondibert  edward what means this summons at so late an hour i sought you here  sent by the fair editha for the relation of important secrets which to my private ear you mean tintrust  gondibert could i entrust them edward to your ear without the poison of the words i utter distilling to your heart i would with boldness speak them   edward surely a tale thus guarded and hemmed in with words so circumspect must have much weight but heavy matters suit not hours like these my soul now banqueting on its felicity and all her faculties absorbed in bliss looks down from an exalted height and scorns so low a thought as care  farewell my lord you will be our guest tomorrow  welcome guest upon the happiest morn old time ever brought to supplicating man going gondibert i charge thee stay  thou arrogant of bliss my tale perhaps may end in guest forbidding in the postponing thhymeneal feast  edward say thou postponing thhymeneal feast by heaven in the wide circle of events that possibility may teem with one shall not be found to make me for a day suspend the bliss of calling raimond mine  gondibert blind and presumptuous  the passing air has borne away thy vow and in its track thy recantation follows edward albina never can be thine amazement sits upon thy brow i swear that had the countess kept her single state my evercautious tongue had never divulged what it must now reveal  but on the edge of sudden ruin edward i behold thee and now extend my arm to snatch thee from it  edward thy words have formed a chaos in my soul something there lurks beneath their doubtful phrase i dread to hear  yet ask thee to unfold  gondibert then steel your mind to bear the storys horror call up your fortitude   edward thou torturst me  speak it  gondibert the widow of my brother  is a woman  mere woman  weak woman of mould so tender it cannot resist a lovers melting plea  nor bear so harsh a charge as cruelty  edward do i not know that she is tender soft as dreams of cradled infancy or note of philomel  whose music in the ear of the benighted traveller makes beams of roseate morn unwelcome to his eye why then to me mysteriously descant upon her gentleness  gondibert cause more than thee her gentleness with healing pity views and to benighted lovers makes the beams of roseate morn unwelcome  edward villain thou lie drawing gondibert come come this female rage ill suits a soldier  edward ill suits thy blasphemy base coward  gondibert coward  edward thou dare not shall not think me coward  edward then guard thee or i will write it in thy heart  gondibert hah come on then plunge in thy weapon deep besure take heed thou do not miss the spot where illjudgd friendship in that heart for edward tranformd him into gondiberts assassin  edward oh   gondibert shrink not appease your anger with my blood then to albina boast of having slain the man who had unveiled her to your eyes she will fawn upon thee  cozen thee  and gull thee with the fond vows that have in other ears shed their sweet poison  edward should my fathers spirit from heaven descend tabet thee in this tale i would swear it lyd  gondibert nay then i crave your pardon

instant of tumultuous passion to lure her back again to love and gondibert  editha hold hold my lord such rashness would undo us beware of proud vindictive westmoreland a single glance to his suspicious eye would be a clue to ravel out our secret he has a faculty to see mens souls as though their lineaments were written characters by which he reads their scarceexisting thoughts  fly from

virtuous egbert  egbert oh that these hours had not so sudden past i can recall when this despised old man was dear to you  when hanging on my neck you would listen to   gondibert no more i do still love thee still reverence thy virtues  but oh egbert i see them as the humid arch of heaven that distant in bright order glows and beautifies the scene  yet does impart to man no influence nor yields

seen by thee from such a towering distance should make thee jealous of thy own discerning and keep thy rude presumptuous judgment down go  begone  pushing him off what cursed untoward chance made him a witness no matter  keener sorrows now surround me oh westmoreland why must i tear the pillow thus cruel from thy timeblanchd head  why drag thee from ages soft repose to give thy bosom to the inhuman spear no  perish first i will go and to the king relate the crimes to which a furious passion drove a wretch who saw the only treasure of his soul torn from his grasp  to bless the man he hates going what and thus mark  thus stamp myself a villain to aid the transports of triumphant edward oh twere a suicide that honor claims not that nature would abhor what then oh guide me heaven or

  risking in private feuds the precious blood which for your country only should be spilt  westmoreland my liege i answer the demand lord edward did yesterday with humble suit entreat that in his favor i would move my daughter   feigning true passion and unequalled love with warm regard i did accept the charge and  not without some difficulty  won her this morn was fixed by hymeneal rites to sanctify the passion they avowed this very morn whilst i with joy impatient prepared to hail him son  he came with slander charged  breathing base falsehoods to stain her name and gloss the violation of his pledged faith  therefore i challenge edward  king this charge by westmorelands good earl alleged we have with wonder and concern attended amongst the bright ladies who adorn our court not one so peerless stands as countess raimond not one whose fame more fitly suits her birth nor one whose honor more becomes her fame why then lord edward have thou causeless stained it why thrown away a gem that throned monarchs might have beheld thee wear with envy  edward be witness for me heaven you my dread sovereign and ye assembled people  bear me witness that raimonds chastity i held unquestioned as the high mystries of our holy faith i loved her with most honorable love and to have worn with her the marriagechain more glorious deemed it than imperial crowns i who would yesterday against a legion her honor have maintained must now  oh horrible here in the blushing face of day stand forth the forced accuser of undone albina  king some wrong interpretation seems to lurk and to have caused this mischievous dispute we do advise ye lords to take more time if in short space the knot does not unfold we do consent that ye again shall meet and prove at point of sword whose is the error  westmoreland this sword my liege has taught the eastern world submission to your laws its faithful point has probd the hearts of infidels and rebels  may its good service to confusion turn and may this arm cling nerveless to my side if i depart the lists ere i have proved it on the defamer of my spotless child  king in this nice point we only with advice would interpose not fetter with commands if this be your maturd resolve pursue it though deeply we lament that two such heroes should against each others bosom turn the lance sound to the combat  trumpet sounds herald advances herald ye

editha it is thus that men when sinking from the ruin which their own folly bred accuse the heavens and execrate their stars curse not thy fate nor egbert it is thyself on whom thou should revenge thine injuries  gondibert editha spare me my mind with wild contending passions torn now like a heart by worrying dogs forsook sinks into apathy  editha hear then a tale will rouse thee from thy lethargy  this night albina will be edwards wife  gondibert this night  editha this hour  gondibert it is enough my wrongs awake in all their strength and cry aloud for vengeance there is an insult in this overhaste that finishes the whole pausing editha leave me on dreadful things i now would ruminate  editha on what impart to me thy thoughts  instruct me  gondibert no leave me  editha ha i see his mind is full of some important deed his lowering brow and that fixed eye bespeak some latent mischief mischiefs awake to ye alone my soul bears unison i will urge him to the quick conceive the transports of victorious edward conceive his triumph  triumph over thee that even in raimonds arms points every bliss  makes rapture sweeter   gondibert fiend have thou no mercy do riot in my woes are these the gifts of friendship  editha no  the gifts of wild despair oh were thou such a dotard to believe that pity  pity to thy woes ever prompted me to steep my soul in crimes  gondibert what is it i hear  editha that i aspired to greatness and perceived no road to reach my hopes but through lord edward that to behold another in his arms is madness and that thee i made my tool to interrupt their hated loves  gondibert perdition fly me thou monster lest thy womanhood i should forget and scatter thee in atoms to the tempestuous winds  exit editha with an air of menace musing be firm my soul nor let unworthy weakness destroy the vengeful purpose thou have framed banished  robbed of my country and my name yet they have left a mind defies their vengeance  which though these limbs were locked in bolts of steel and darkness wrapped these precious founts of light would rise superior to their bounded power and scorn alike their fetters and their laws he for whom i am exiled for exiled gondibert

unrestrained within the bosom of this noble youth bright virtues sprung as in their native bed till vice  alluring in the shape of love  crept silent to his heart  there spread her poisons  there her black empire fixed then dragged her slave through infamy to death  the end
