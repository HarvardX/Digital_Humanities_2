life and soul of all music the very essence of harmony your singers of taste will run up and down the ladder of sounds from the cellar up to the garret now rumbling along till they make your ears crack again and then in the piano they expire like a swan to their own melody in our favorite composition we are not contented with making the sound an echo to the sense but by a happy tumbling of both together create the most agreeable confusion of harmony in the universe   phil it may be very fine but i dont like it this taste as you call it seems to have declared war against nature and turned all her works topsyturvy pray shall i meet with all these fopperies at court   cla court madam abounds with curiosities there you will meet a thousand objects to entertain you there are your pretty little creatures with high heels to their shoes and solitaires round their necks that look so ladylike you would think they were women with swords by their sides then there are your precise puppets trotting along with formal bands under their chins and plastered wigs upon their head whispering strange nothings in your ear and exhibiting at one view the most whimsical combination of pride and servility   air phil how strange the mode which truth neglects and rests all beauty in defects but we by homely nature taught though rude in speech are plain in thought  phil come then i long to be there let us to court   mad iave de honor to present milady vid her fan   phil dear me what use can i make of this   cia this is a wonderful instrument its exercise is various and elegant   mad i will tell you i will show you de use madame   air for various purpose serves the fan as thus  a decent blind between the sticks to peep at man nor yet betray your mind each action has a meaning plain

her delicacy she has not hitherto upbraided me i perceive the princess entertains strong suspicions which you know are but too well grounded   fred yet those my lord are easily removed   duke and how   fred your highnesses orders have already done it for what you promised phillis will be a proof by which emily cannot suspect that this amor has any thing real in it when this same colin whom the young madam doats on comes to court his love will be a blind for yours   duke true i have sent for him but what then  pray explain   fred the awkward simplicity of country lovers must make an agreeable contrast with the elegance of court manners an amusement only fit for laughter as such only you designed it for that purpose you brought them hither for entertainment and observation the princess cannot suspect your designs upon phillis when her own collin is permitted to be with her and you will easily find means to compass your intentions when all suspicions are quieted  air the harsh resolve o yet withold forbear her gentle heart to grieve if only painful truth is told it is mercy to deceive our wishes aid each slight disguise and love the place of truth supplies  duke but see the princess comes  i would avoid her exeunt   scene iii enter emily and clara emi he shuns me clara alas it is now beyond all doubt   cla do not torment yourself and create imaginary affliction  air ourselves too often we deceive and wrong our judgment to believe when thinking harshly of the swain we cheat our hopes and brood on pain  emi with the generality of women i confess the heart is not so much affected as their vanity is hurt by the fickleness of their lovers selflove is too often the link which unites their souls but the only interest which sways my bosom is the purest and tendered affection   cla believe me madam the duke is no stranger to your tenderness  he will return it   emi you would comfort me i see  perhaps i am alarmed from too slight a cause however watch their steps if you regard your mistress  air if tyrant love with cruel dart transfix the maidens tender heart of easy faith and fond belief she hugs the dart and aids the thief till left her helpless state to mourn neglected loving and forlorn she finds while grief her bosom stings as well as darts the god has wings but who is this the duke brings with him  oh it is the village nymph he so much doats on i must observe them   exit scene iv enter phillis and duke duke well what think you of the court does it delight you phillis   phil it is the seat of wonders every thing changes character here the men are quite different i met one who is the lord of the manor in our neighborhood a very proud gentleman amongst us he carries his head so high and so fierce and threatens folks with his cane in the country if they do but look upon him here he was bowing and scraping and cringing like a spaniel why are they so complaisant here these great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country does the court make them so much better no i believe if they do any good here it is only to get a right to do something bad elsewhere   duke i hear you with pleasure did not the brilliancy and politeness of the court surprise you   phil oh they were extravagantly polite indeed they paid their compliments with wonderful civility and ran over my person and features in a loud whisper with the most minute observation  upon my word she is a mighty pretty right thing quite an angel for the country what a poor little innocent it is what an air she has what a walk what a voice    duke oh that is mere pleasantry  they will be more careful by and by and show you infinitely more respect they will be eager o invent new diversions for you the will read your wishes in your eyes and i my dear will serve them as a model   scene v enter emily and clara emi to phil so madam you have made a noble conquest suffer me i beseech you to pay my homage where the duke pays his   duke nay but emily you

the fair and all the world must feel the same who marks her shape and air a mein so rich in every grace her manners so polite such beauty beaming from her face  was ever such a fright phil so then the duke is her lover yes yes i plainly perceive it upon my word this place abounds with very odd customs  to the duke can you divide your heart to two at a time  to emily the duke loves me too madam he has sworn it   emi ironically to the duke mere pleasantry that is all   duke nay but i assure you to emi   phil you need not be under any apprehensions on my account for my part i love colin to emi   duke yes yes colin is her love and colin shall come i told you so  to emily dont give any credit   emi i believe nothing   duke twas but a whim that caused all this for i imagined the rustic simplicity of these peasants might make an agreeable contrast with the refined manners of our courtiers   emi forcing a laugh a very ridiculous project truly oh we shall be charmingly amused come let us hear some of her prattle  well my dear and how do you like the court   phil may i speak my lord   duke oh what you please   phil then if i must fairly confess the truth i am heartily tired of this horrid place where every object i perceive seems a contradiction to common sense their whole design is to reverse nature where people are for ever busy in doing nothing where they eat without appetite and lie down without rest where their mirth is all grimace and their pleasure nothing but perpetual noise   cla her observation madam to me seems perfectly just groves and retirements are your only places for innocence and simplicity   air along your verdant lowly vale calm zepbyr breathes a gentle gale but rustling through the lofty trees it swells beyond the peaceful breeze thus free from envys poisoned dart you beast a pure unruffled heart while jarring thoughts our peace desorm and swell our passions to a storm emi and pray when is she to return to her village again is she to go tomorrow   phil no sir to night to night i beseech you the sooner the better   emi come come then let us leave her to prepare for her journey and indulge her meditation on her beloved colin your

neighbor your fine folk for all their vapouring and bouncing are no honester than they should be who would have thought that our phillis would have been sent for to court   hob sent for quoth a no damon trapanned drawn in by artifice  lord what a parcel of nonsense of teeth and lips and ivory and coals and diamonds did some of these puppets pour out before the wenches in our village till the maids grew so fantastic that they did not know their heads from their tails   dam fair words cover foul dealings give me plain speech and plain manners i say   hob by my troth gaffer i never could abide these leg making gentry who bow and scrape and palaver with their hats stuck like gizzards under their arms and all the while they mean no more by their civility than to cukold the husband or debauch the daughter   dam thank heaven hobbinol we have none of those vices we are not so polite and in good truth i envy none of those sort of folk  air tho my dress as my manners is simple and plain a rascal i hate and a knave i disdain my dealings are just and my conscience is clear and i am richer than those that have thousands a year though bent down with age and for sporting uncouth i feel no remorse from the follies of youth i still tell my tale and rejoice in my song and my boys think my life not a moment too long let the courtiers thse dealers in grin and grimace creep under dance over for title or place above all the titles that flow from a throne that of honest i prize and that titles my own  hob but sure they cannot mean mischief to our young couple since my boy colin has been sent for to court with all haste and to meet your phillis they said body of me how their eyes will sparkle when they meet each other i will warrant you now she is as melancholy as a turtle that has lost its mate   dam but for my part hobbinol i cannot abide the thoughts of her being at court why the place is for all the world like a fair full of nonsense noise and show   hob aye neigbour they keep fair here all the year round and a plentiful market too only the goods now and then are a little stale   dam a plague take their town manners i say though i doff my hat never so low and bespeak them never so civilly they do but laugh in my face adod i think we have been as proper folks as the best of them in our time they mun keep their flaunts and fleers to themselves it is a wonderment to me neighbor how we found our way hither   hob or how we escaped whole from so many dangers i thought i should have had my body squeezed to death by one of those fidgetting fellows with poles in his hands and a chair at his backside who thrust me into the kennel almost under the wheel of a coach and then surlily cried out  by your leave  had i known that had been the way of asking civil question ecod but i would have had my crutch ready to have given him an answer   dam well well these disasters are at an end now   hob true gaffer true we mun not bide here we must try what we can to recover our children and for my part i do think colin will be perfect mad if he misses his dear phillis exeunt   scene ii an antichamber in the palace enter frederick phillis and mademoiselle fred i am sorry colins inconstancy should give you so much distress accidents of that sort are so common here nobody regards them a little farther acquaintance with court will convince you the failing is too general to deserve much blame  air from flower to flower the butterfly over fields or gardens ranging sips sweets from each and flutters by and all his life is changing thus roving man new objects sway by various charms delighted whilst she who pleases most today tomorrow shall be flighted  phi faithless faithless colin and pray mademoiselle does colin know the duke designs to visit me   mad oui oui he be informed long since poor soul   phi the news of it has affected him no doubt   mad certainement madame pour a little quarter of an hour or so   fred i beheld him run up and down stamping and tearing and raving and rending like a madman then he would stop short of a sudden and folding his arms like a lover despairing beside a clear stream heave a desperate sigh with the most rueful length of face mortal ever beheld   mad vraiment it was pitoyable case  air oh twould pierce a heart of stone to hear him roar and blubber so great a lover never was known  nor ever so great a lubber like little master left alone by gay mamma forsaken with hiecup sob and sigh and groan his heart is almost breaking  fred but like the rest of his sex sorrow took no fast hold of him twas but an april shower and all was fair again   phil indeed were it not for his treachery i could almost find in my heart to pity him  but i find myself strangely fatigued your pleasures here pall the mind without entertaining it my spirits are quite overpowered   fred i am glad of it now now you begin to have the bon ton  i was sure your ladyship could not be so long amongst the polite world without catching the manners of it it is nothing but nerves and fashionable vapors a thing of course   phil vapors and weak nerves why can it be a fashion to be sick   fred o lord its downright ungenteel to be otherwise your ruddy complexion and active limbs may do very well for a dairy maid in the country but here they are perfectly unnecessary nay absolutely improper lord mam it is as unfashionable for a fine lady to be without a complaint as to be out of debt   phil the more i observe your manners here the more they surprise me  but there is a scheme come into my head were it not possible mademoiselle that colin might be concealed somewhere hereabouts that he may overhear our intercourse   mad sans doubt madame but pourquoi for what purpose   phil the dearest in the world revenge   mad ah dat be the most delicious morsel   fred and the injustice he has done you by his suspicions deserves the worst of mortifications from your hands   phil well then sir to you and mademoiselle i leave the management of this affair the duke will be delighted with it adieu i shall attend his highnesss pleasure exeunt fred and mad if colin blames me now it is not without reason but i will still surprise him more he shall be satisfied as to the interview between the duke and me and if my contrivance succeeds the princess too shall be served  alas why came i hither is it the air i breathe which poisons all my peace at home my only thought was mirth there all was tranquillity pleasure and happiness  air when far from fashions gilded scence i breathed my native air my thoughts were calm my mind serene no doubtings harbored there but now no more myself i find distraction rends my breast whilst hopes and fears disturb my mind and banish all my rest  scene iii enter emily and clara emi so clara i still find her here you see the so much boasted charms of the country will i fear lose all their relish after the splendor of a court   cla love madam is undoubtedly very intoxicating and it is no wonder if the addresses of a duke turn the brain of an ignorant village lass   air flattering hopes the mind deceiving easy faith too often cheat woman fond and all believing loves and hugs the dear deceit noisy shows of pomp and riches cupids tricks to catch the fair lowly maids too often bewitches flattery is the beautys snare emi so then you will not leave us yet the court has stronger attractions than you were aware of phillis   phi alas madam did it depend upon my choice i would be far off the pleasures of this place are lost upon me they are too artificial for us simple folks who are the servants of nature   emi quit then as fast as you can a place so contrary to your matters i would not delay a moment alas why cannot i shake off this troublesome pomp and pageantry of courts   air return sweet lass to flocks and swains where simple nature mildly reigns where love is every shepherds care and every nymph is kind as fair the court has only tinsel toys insipid mirth and idle noise but rural joys are ever new while nymphs are kind and shepherds true phil upon my word ladies you reason excellently well in your turn i perceive the advice of every body flows from selfinterested motives you would most obligingly inform me that my presence displeases you madam i heartily believe it  but now i think on it i cannot go yet it is absolutely impossible i have a particular engagemement with the duke   emi with the duke   phil yes with the duke oh you will laugh exceedingly    emi laugh i laugh how   phil the duke you know is in love with you   emi sighs and what then   phil then why he desires an interview with me   emi which you have granted i suppose   phil oh doubtless it is not for folks in such an humble situation as mine to refuse so great an honor and indeed after so many instances of friendship and protection it were a sin to deny so small a request but i see madam you are discomposed   emi who i not i not in the least   phil i cannot abide to be thought ungrateful   emi so then phillis after all this parade of honor and virtue and love you can make an assignation   phil come come dont be suspicious where you dread a rival you may find a friend i pity your uneasiness madam nor will i ever be the cause of adding to it come then with me and if possible endeavor to forget your jealous resentment i warrant you all will be well yet   scene

impossible  what phillis meet the duke alone alas it is but too true  here behold me in the very chamber  can i yet doubt ah that couch that telltale couch suggests enough to make me shudder  what an object for a faithful sweet heart such as i am what alarms what violent emotions it raises  my folly has aggravated her to an entire neglect of me  well heaven be thanked i am not quite friendless yet  the good natured gentlewoman who was so civil to me before has sent me hither whether i may overhear all  let me see i will conceal myself under this table and from thence observe what passes and if i find my suspicions true i know how to be revenged for the trick she has played me yes thou cruel hardhearted phillis i will suddenly break out and shame you  in midst of your joys i will tell you to your face that you are a false ungrateful hussy and then  i will go hang myself and then  you shall never see me more    air my tender heart now bleeds in vain my tears she sees with cold disdain ah
