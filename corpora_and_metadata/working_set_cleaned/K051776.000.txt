first hint of this drama i send you the original that you may see my great reserve in borrowing from it at the same time humbly begging pardon of the gentleman unknown with whose hasty sketch i have taken so many liberties this plot is here totally changed and his personages thrown into a different cast of character i have availed myself but very sparingly of his words scarce at all of his poetry  i hope he will have the goodness to forgive me for what i have retained and what i have rejected assuring him that he is welcome to use still greater license with any work of mine  i adopt the laconic dialogue of italian burletta in order to comprise my fable within the narrow limits of late prescribed by the taste of your audiences this is short enough to admit their being indulged with
