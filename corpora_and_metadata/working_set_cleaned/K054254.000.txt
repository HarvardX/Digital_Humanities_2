an essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning  an essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning in a letter from a gentleman in the city to his friend in oxford    printed at the theater in oxford for anth peisley bookseller   0   imprimatur  to mander vicecan oxon january      00  0  an essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning etc sir i am glad to hear from you that the study of the mathematics is promoted and encouraged among the youth of your university the great influence which these sciences have on philosophy and all useful learning as well as the concerns of the public may sufficiently recommend them to your choice and consideration and the particular advantages which you of that place enjoy give us just reason to expect from you a suitable improvement in them i have here sent you some short reflections upon the usefulness of mathematical learning which may serve as an argument to incite you to a closer and more vigorous pursuit of it  in all ages and countries where learning has prevailed the mathematical sciences have been looked upon as the most considerable branch of it the very name  implies no less by which they were called either for their excellency or because of all the sciences they were first taught or because they were judged to comprehend  and amongst those that are commonly reckoned to be the seven liberal arts four are mathematical to wit arithmetic music geometry and astronomy  but notwithstanding their excellency and reputation they have not been taught nor studied so universally as some of the rest which i take to have proceeded from the following causes the aversion of the greatest part of mankind to serious attention and close arguing their not comprehending sufficiently the necessity or great usefulness of these in other parts of learning an opinion that this study requires a particular genius and turn of head which few are so happy as to be born with and the want of public encouragement and able masters for these and perhaps some other reasons this study has been generally neglected and regarded only by some few persons whose happy genius and curiosity have prompted them to it or who have been forced upon it by its immediate subserviency to some particular art or office  therefore i think i cannot do better service to learning youth and the nation in general than by showing that the mathematics of all parts of humane knowledge for the improvement of the mind for their subserviency to other arts and their usefulness to the commonwealth deserve most to be encouraged i know a discourse of this nature will be offensive to some who while they are ignorant of mathematics yet think themselves masters of all valuable learning but their displeasure must not deterr me from delivering an useful truth  the advantages which accrue to the mind by mathematical studies consist chiefly in these things  st in accustoming it to attention  dly in giving it a habit of close and demonstrative reasoning  dly in freeing it from prejudice credulity and superstition  first the mathematics make the mind attentive to the objects which it considers this they do by entertaining it with a great variety of truths which are delightful and evident but not obvious truth is the same thing to the understanding as music to the ear and beauty to the eye the pursuit of it does really as much gratify a natural faculty implanted in us by our wise creator as the pleasing of our senses only in the former case as the object and faculty are more spiritual the delight is the more pure free from the regret turpitude lassitude and intemperance that commonly attend sensual pleasures the most part of other sciences consisting only of probable reasonings the mind has not where to fix and wanting sufficient principles to pursue its searches upon gives them over as impossible again as in mathematical investigations truth may be found so it is not always obvious this spurs the mind and makes it diligent and attentive in geometria says quinctilian lib i cap  0 partem fatentur esse utilem teneris aetatibus agitari namque animos atque acui ingenia and celeritatem percipiendi venire inde concedunt and plato in repub lib vii observes that the youth who are furnished with mathematical knowledge are prompt and quick at all other sciences  therefore he calls it  and indeed youth is generally so much more delighted with mathematical studies than with the unpleasant tasks that are some times imposed upon them that i have known some reclaimed by them from idleness and neglect of learning and acquire in time a habit of thinking diligence and attention qualities which we ought to study by all means to beget in their desultory and roving minds  the second advantage which the mind reaps from mathematical knowledge is a habit of clear demonstrative and methodical reasoning we are contrived by nature to learn by imitation more than by precept and i believe in that respect reasoning is much like other inferior arts as dancing singing etc acquired by practice by accustoming our selves to reason closely about quantity we acquire a habit of doing so in other things it is surprising to see what superficial inconsequential reasonings satisfy the most part of mankind a piece of wit a jest a simile or a quotation of an author passes for a mighty argument with such things as these are the most part of authors stuffed and from these weighty premises they infer their conclusions this weakness and effeminacy of mankind in being persuaded where they are delighted have made them the sport of orators poets and men of wit those lumina orationis are indeed very good diversion for the fancy but are not the proper business of the understanding and where a man pretends to write on abstract subjects in a scientifical method he ought not to debauch in them logical precepts are more useful nay they are absolutely necessary for a rule of formal arguing in public disputations and confounding an obstinate and perverse adversary and exposing him to the audience or readers but in the search of truth an imitation of the method of the geometers will carry a man further than all the dialectical rules their analysis is the proper model we ought to form our selves upon and imitate in the regular disposition and gradual progress of our enquiries and even he who is ignorant of the nature of mathematical analysis uses a method somewhat analogous to it the composition of the geometers or their method of demonstrating truths already found out viz by definitions of words agreed upon by selfevident truths and propositions that have been already demonstrated is practicable in other subjects though not to the same perfection the natural want of evidence in the things themselves not allowing it but it is imitable to a considerable degree i dare appeal to some writings of our own age and nation the authors of which have been mathematically inclined i shall add no more on this head but that one who is accustomed to the methodical systems of truths which the geometers have reared up in the several branches of those sciences which they have cultivated will hardly bear with the confusion and disorder of other sciences but endeavor as far as he can to reform them  thirdly mathematical knowledge adds a manly vigor to the mind frees it from prejudice credulity and superstition this it does two ways  st by accustoming us to examine and not to take things upon trust  dly by giving us a clear and extensive knowledge of the system of the world which as it creates in us the most profound reverence of the almighty and wise creator so it frees us from the mean and narrow thoughts which ignorance and superstition are apt to beget how great an enemy mathematics are to superstition appears from this that in those countries where romish priests exercise their barbarous tyranny over the minds of men astronomers who are fully persuaded of the motion of the earth dare not speak out but tho the inquisition may extort a recantation the pope and a general council too will not find themselves able to persuade to the contrary opinion perhaps this may have given occasion to a calumnious suggestion as if mathematics were an enemy to religion which is a scandal thrown both on the one and the other for truth can never be an enemy to true religion which appears always to the best advantage when it is most examined  si propius stes te capiet magis    on the contrary the mathematics are friends to religion inasmuch as they charm the passions restrain the impetuosity of imagination and purge the mind from error and prejudice vice is error confusion and false reasoning and all truth is more or less opposite to it besides mathematical studies may serve for a pleasant entertainment for those hours which young men are apt to throw away upon their vices the delightfulness of them being such as to make solitude not only easy but desirable  what i have said may serve to recommend mathematics for acquiring a vigorous constitution of mind for which purpose they are as useful as exercise is for procuring health and strength to the body i proceed now to show their vast extent and usefulness in other parts of knowledge and here it might suffice to tell you that mathematics is the science of quantity or the art of reasoning about things that are capable of more and less and that the most part of the objects of our knowledge are such as matter space number time motion gravity etc we have but imperfect ideas of things without quantity and as imperfect a one of quantity it self without the help of mathematics all the visible works of god almighty are made in number weight and measure therefore to consider them we ought to understand arithmetic geometry and staticks and the greater advances we make in those arts the more capable we are of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions but this will farther appear from particulars  and first if we consider to what perfection we now know the courses periods order distances and proportions of the several great bodies of the universe at least such as fall within our view we shall have cause to admire the sagacity and industry of the mathematicians and the power of numbers and geometry well applied let us cast our eyes backward and consider astronomy in its infancy or rather let us suppose it still to begin for instance a colony of rude country people transplanted into an island remote from the commerce of all mankind without so much as the knowledge of the calendar and the periods of the seasons without instruments to make observations or any the least notion of observations or instruments when is it we could expect any of their posterity should arrive at the art of predicting an eclipse not only so but the art of reckoning all eclipses that are past or to come for any number of years when is it we could suppose that one of those islanders transported to any other place of the earth should be able by the inspection of the heavens to find how much he were south or north east or west of his own island and to conduct his ship back thither for my part though i know this may be and is daily done by what is known in astronomy yet when i consider the vast industry sagacity multitude of observations and other extrinsick things necessary for such a sublime piece of knowledge i should be apt to pronounce it impossible and never to be hoped for now we are let so much into the knowledge of the machine of the universe and motion of its parts by the rules of this science perhaps the invention may seem easy but when we reflect what penetration and contrivance were necessary to lay the foundations of so great and extensive an art we cannot but admire its first inventors as thales milesius who as diogenes laertius and pliny say first predicted eclipses and his scholar anaximander milesius who found out the globous figure of the earth the aequinoctial points the obliquity of the ecliptic the principles of gnomonicks and made the first sphere or image of the heavens and pythagoras to whom we owe the discovery of the true system of the world and order of the planets though it may be they were assisted by the egyptians and chaldeans but whoever they were that first made these bold steps in this noble art they deserve the praise and admiration of all future ages felices animae quibus haec cognoscere primis inque domos superas scandere cura fuit credibile est illos pariter vitiisque jocisque altius humanis exseruisse caput non venus and vinum sublimia pectora fregit officiumque fori militiaeque labor non levis ambitio perfusaque gloria fuco magnarumque fames sollicitavit opum admovere oculis distantia sidera nostris aetheraque ingenio supposuere suo ovid in io fast  but though the industry of former ages had discovered the periods of the great bodies of the universe and the true system and order of them and their orbits pretty near yet was there one thing still reserved for the glory of this age and the honor of the english nation the grand secret of the whole machine which now it is discovered proves to be like the other contrivances of infinite wisdom simple and natural depending upon the most known and most common property of matter viz gravity from this the incomparable mr newton has demonstrated the theories of all the bodies of the solar system of all the primary planets and their secondaries and among others the moon which seemed most averse to numbers and not only of the planets the slowest of which compleats its period in less than half the age of a man but likewise of the comets some of which its probable spend more than  000 years in one revolution about the sun for whose theory he has laid such a foundation that after ages assisted with more observations may be able to calculate their returns in a word the precession of the aequinoctial points the tides the unequal vibration of pendulous bodies in different latitudes etc are no more a question to those that have geometry enough to understand what he has delivered on those subjects a perfection in philosophy that the boldest thinker durst hardly have hoped for and unless mankind turn barbarous will continue the reputation of this nation as long as the fabric of nature shall endure after this what is it we may not expect from geometry joined to observations and experiments  the next considerable object of natural knowledge i take to be light how unsuccessful enquiries are about this glorious body without the help of geometry may appear from the empty and frivolous discourses and disputations of a sort of men that call themselves philosophers whom nothing will serve forsooth but the knowledge of the very nature and intimate causes of every thing while on the other hand the geometers not troubling themselves with those fruitless enquiries about the nature of light have discovered two remarkable properties of it in the reflection and refraction of its beams and from those and their streightness in other cases have invented the noble arts of optics catoptricks and dioptricks teaching us to manage this subtle body for the improvement of our knowledge and useful purposes of life they have likewise demonstrated the causes of several celestial appearances that arise from the inflection of its beams both in the heavenly bodies themselves and other phoenomena as parhelia the iris etc and by a late experiment they have discovered the celerity of its motion and we shall know yet more surprising properties of light when mr newton shall be pleased to gratify the world with his book of light and colors  the fluids which involve our earth viz air and water are the next great and conspicuous bodies that nature presents to our view and i think we know little of either but what is owing to mechanics and geometry the two chiefest properties of air its gravity and elastick force have been discovered by mechanical experiments from thence the decrease of the airs density according to the increase of the distance of the earth has been demonstrated by geometers and confirmed by experiments of the subsidence of the mercury in the torricellian experiment from this likewise by assistance of geometry they have determined the height of the atmosphere as far as it has any sensible density which agrees exactly with another observation of the duration of the twilight air and water make up the object of the hydrostaticks though denominated only from the latter of which the principles were long since settled and demonstrated by archimedes in his book  where are demonstrated the causes of several surprising phoenomena of nature depending only on the aequilibrium of fluids the relative gravities of these fluids and of solids swimming or sinking therein here also the mathematicians consider the different pressures resistances and celerities of solids moved in fluids from whence they explain a great many appearances of nature unintelligible to those who are ignorant of geometry  next if we descend to the animal kingdom there we may see the brightest strokes of divine mechanics and whither we consider first the animal economy in general either in the internal motion and circulation of the juices forced through the several canals by the motion of the heart or their external motions and the instruments wherewith these are performed we must reduce them to mechanical rules and confess the necessity of the knowledge of mechanics to understand them or explain them to others borelli in his excellent treatise de motu animalium steno in his admirable myologiae specimen and other mathematical men on the one hand and the nonsensical unintelligible stuff that the common writers on these subjects have filled their books with on the other are sufficient instances to show how necessary geometry is in such speculations the only organ of an animal body whose structure and manner of operation is fully understood has been the only one which the geometers have taken to their share to consider it is incredible how sillily the greatest and ablest physicians talked of the parts of the eye and their use and of the modus visionis before kepler by his geometry found it out and put it past dispute though they applied themselves particularly to this and valued themselves on it and galen pretended a particular divine commission to treat of it nay notwithstanding the full discovery of it some go on in copying their predecessors and talk as vngeometrically as ever it is true we cannot reason so clearly of the internal motions of an animal body as of the external wanting sufficient data and decisive experiments but what relates to the latter as the articulation structure insertion and vires of the muscles is as subject to strict mathematical disquisition as any thing whatsoever and even in the theory of diseases and their cures those who talk mechanically talk most intelligibly which may be the reason for the opinion of the ancient physicians that mathematics are necessary for the study of medicine it self for which i could bring long quotations out of their works among the letters that are ascribed to hippocrates there is one to his son thessalus recommending to him the study of arithmetic and geometry as necessary to medicine galen in his book entitled  begins   if one of the reasons of the ancients for this be now somewhat unfashionable to wit because they thought a physician should be able to know the situation and aspects of the stars which they believed had influence upon men and their diseases and positively to deny it and say that they have none at all is the effect of want of observation we have a much better and undoubted one in its room viz that mathematics are found to be the best instrument of promoting natural knowledge  dly if we consider not only the animal economy in general but likewise the wonderful structure of the different sorts of animals according to the different purposes for which they were designed the various elements they inhabit the several ways of procuring their nourishment and propagating their kind the different enemies they have and accidents they are subject to here is still a greater need of geometry it is pity that the qualities of an expert anatomist and skillful geometer have seldom met in the same person when such a one shall appear there is a whole terra incognita of delightful knowledge to employ his time and reward his industry  as for the other two kingdoms borelli and other mathematical men seem to have talked very clearly of vegetation and steno another mathematician in his excellent treatise de solido intra solidum naturaliter contento has applied this part of learning very handsomely to fossils and some other parts of natural history i shall add only one thing more that if we consider motion it self the great instrument of the actions of bodies upon one another the theory of it is entirely owing to the geometers who have demonstrated its laws both in hard and elastick bodies showed how to measure it is quantity how to compound and resolve the several forces by which bodies are agitated and to determine the lines which those compound forces make them describe of such forces gravity being the most constant and uniform affords a great variety of useful knowledge in considering several motions that happen upon the earth viz as to the free descent of heavy bodies the curve of projectiles the descent and weight of heavy bodies when they lie on inclined plains the theory of the motion of pendulous bodies etc  from what i have said i shall draw but one corollary that a natural philosopher without mathematics is a very odd sort of a person that reasons about things that have bulk figure motion number weight etc without arithmetic geometry mechanics staticks etc i must needs say i have the last contempt for those gentlemen that pretend to explain how the earth was framed and yet can hardly measure an acre of ground upon the surface of it and as the philosopher speaks qui repent pedibus illotis ad philosophos divertunt non hoc est satis quod sint omnino  sed legem etiam dant qua philosophari discant  the usefulness of mathematics in several other arts and sciences is fully as plain they were looked upon by the ancient philosophers as the key to all knowledge therefore plato wrote upon his school  let none unskilled in geometry enter and xenocrates told one ignorant in mathematics who desired to be his scholar that he was fitter to card wool  you want the handle of philosophy viz geometry there is no understanding the works of the ancient philosophers without it theo smyrnoeus has wrote a book entitled an explanation of those things in mathematics that are necessary for the reading of plato aristotle illustrates his precepts and other thoughts by mathematical examples and that not only in logic etc but even in ethics where he makes use of geometrical and arithmetical proportion to explain commutative and distributive justice  every body knows that chronology and geography are indispensable preparations for history a relation of matter of fact being a very lifeless insipid thing without the circumstances of time and place nor is it sufficient for one that would understand things thoroughly that he knows the topography that is the name of the country where such a place lies with those of the near adjacent places and how these lie in respect of one another but it will become him likewise to understand the scientifical principles of the art that is to have a true idea of a place we ought to know the relation it has to any other place as to the distance and bearing its climate heat cold length of days etc which things do much enliven the readers notion of the very action it self just so it is necessary to know the technical or doctrinal part of chronology if a man would be thoroughly skilled in history it being impossible without it to unravel the confusion of historians i remember mr hally has determined the day and hour of julius coesars landing in britain from the circumstances of his relation and every body knows how great use our incomparable historian mr dodwell has made of the calculated times of eclipses for settling the times of great events which before were as to this essential circumstance almost fabulous both chronology and geography and also the knowledge of the suns and moons motions so far as they relate to the constitution of the calendar and year are necessary to a divine and how sadly some otherwise eminent have blunderd when they meddled with things that relate to these and border on them is too apparent  no body i think will question the interest that mathematics have in painting music and architecture which are all founded on numbers perspective and the rules of light and shadows are owing to geometry and optics and i think those two comprehend pretty near the whole art of painting except decorum and ordinance which are only a due observance of the history and circumstances of the subject you represent for by perspective may be understood the art of designing the outlines of your solid whether that be a building landscape or animal and the draught of a man is really as much the perspective of a man as the draught of a building is of a building though for particular reasons as because it consists of more crooked lines etc it is hard to reduce the perspective of the former to the ordinary established rules  if mathematics had not reduced music to a regular system by contriving its scales it had been no art but enthusiastic rapture left to the roving fancy of every practitioner this appears by the extraordinary pains which the ancients have taken to fit numbers to three sorts of music the diatonick chromatick and enharmonick which if we consider with their nicety in distinguishing their several modes we shall be apt to judge they had something very fine in their music at least for moving the passions with single instruments and voices but music had been imperfect still had not arithmetic stepped in once more and guido aretinus by inventing the temperament making the fifth false by a certain determined quantity taught us to tune our organs and intermix all the three kinds of the ancients to which we owe all the regular and noble harmony of our modern music  as for civil architecture of military i shall speak afterward there is hardly any part of mathematics but is some way subservient to it geometry and arithmetic for the due measure of the several parts of a building the plans models computation of materials time and charges for ordering right its arches and vaults that they may be both firm and beautiful mechanics for its strength and firmness transporting and raising materials and optics for the symmetry and beauty and i would not have any assume the character of an architect without a competent skill in all of these you see that vitruvius requires these and many more for making a complete architect i must own that should any one set up to practice in any of the forementioned arts furnished only with his mathematical rules he would produce but very clumsy pieces he that should pretend to draw by the geometrical rules of perspective or compose music merely by his skill in harmonical numbers would show but awkward performances in those composed subjects besides the stiff rules there must be fancy genius and habit yet nevertheless these arts owe their being to mathematics as laying the foundation of their theory and affording them precepts which being once invented are securely relied upon by practitioners thus many design that know not a ittle of the reason of the rules they practice b and many no better quality  in their way compose music better perhaps than he could have done that invented the scale and the numbers upon which their harmony is founded as mathematics laid the foundation of these arts so they must improve them and he that would invent must be skilled in numbers besides it is fit a man should know the true grounds and reasons of what he studies and he that does so will certainly practice in his art with greater judgment and variety where the ordinary rules fail him  i proceed now to show the more immediate usefulness of mathematics in civil affairs to begin with arithmetic it were an endless task to relate its several uses in public and private business the regulation and quick dispatch of both seem entirely owing to it the nations that want it are altogether barbarous as some americans who can hardly reckon above twenty and i believe it would go near to ruin the trade of the nation were the easy practice of arithmetic abolished for example were the merchants and tradesmen obliged to make use of no other than the roman way of notation by letters instead of our present and if we should feel the want of our arithmetic in the easiest calculations how much more in those that are some thing harder as interest simple and compound annuities etc in which it is incredible how much the ordinary rules and tables influence the dispatch of business arithmetic is not only the great instrument of private commerce but by it are or ought to be kept the public accounts of a nation i mean those that regard the whole state of a commonwealth as to the number fructification of its people increase of stock improvement of lands and manufactures balance of trade public revenues coynage military power by sea and land etc those that would judge or reason truly about the state of any nation must go that way to work subjecting all the forementioned particulars to calculation this is the true political knowledge in this respect the affairs of a commonwealth differ from those of a private family only in the greatness and multitude of particulars that make up the accounts machiavel goes this way to work in his account of different estates what sir william petty and several others of our countrymen have wrote in political arithmetic does abundantly show the pleasure and usefulness of such speculations it is true for want of good information their calculations some times proceed upon erroneous suppositions but that is not the fault of the art but what is it the government could not perform in this way who have the command of all public records  lastly numbers are applicable even to such things as seem to be governed by no rule i mean such as depend on chance the quantity of probability and proportion of it in any two proposed cases being subject to calculation as much as any thing else upon this depend the principles of game we find sharpers know enough of this to cheat some men that would take it very ill to be thought bubbles and one gamester exceeds another as he has a greater sagacity and readiness in calculating his probability to win or lose in any proposed case to understand the theory of chance thoroughly requires a great knowledge of numbers and a pretty competent one of algebra  the several uses of geometry are not much fewer than those of arithmetic it is necessary for ascertaining of property both in plains and solids or in surveying and guaging by it land is sold by the measure as well as cloth workmen are paid the due price of their labor according to the superficial or solid measure of their work and the quantity of liquors determined for a due regulation of their price and duty all which do wonderfully conduce to the easy dispatch of business and the preventing of frauds and controversies i need not mention the measuring distances laying down of plans and maps of countries in which we have daily experience of its usefulness these are some familiar instances of things to which geometry is ordinarily applied of its use in civil military and naval architecture we shall speak afterward  from astronomy we have the regular disposition of our time in a due succession of years which are kept within their limits as to the return of the seasons and the motion of the sun this is no small advantage for the due repetition of the same work labor and actions for many of our public private military and country affairs appointments etc depending on the products of the ground and they on the seasons it is necessary that the returns of them be adjusted pretty near to the motion of the sun and we should quickly find the inconveniency of a vague undetermined year if we used that of the mahumetans whose beginning and every month wanders through all the days of ours or the solar year which shows the seasons beside the adjusting of the moons motion to the suns is required for the decent observation and celebration of the churchfeasts and fasts according to the ancient custom and primitive institution and likewise for the knowing of the ebbing and flowing of the tides the spring and neap tides currents etc so that whatever some people may think of an almanac where all these are set down it is oftentimes the most useful paper that is published the same year with it nay the nation could better spare all the voluminous authors in the termcatalogue than that single sheet besides without a regular chronology there can be no certain history which appears by the confusion amongst historians before the right disposition of the year and at present among the turks who have the same confusion in their history as in their calendar therefore a matter of such importance might well deserve the care of the great emperor to whom we owe our present calendar who was himself a great proficient in astronomy pliny has quoted several things from his books of the rising and setting of the stars lib xviii cap       etc and lucan makes him say  media inter praelia semper stellarum coelique plagis superisque vacavi   the mechanics have produced so many useful engines subservient to convenience that it would be a task too great to relate the several sorts of them some of them keep life it self from being a burden if we consider such as are invented for raising weights and are employed in building and other great works in which no impediment is too great for them or hydraulick engines for raising of water serving for great use and comfort to mankind where they have no other way to be supplied readily with that necessary element or such as by making wind and water work for us save animal force and great charges and perform those actions which require a vast multitude of hands and without which every mans time would be too little to prepare his own aliment and other necessaries or those machines that have been invented by mankind for delight and curiosity imitating the motions of animals or other works of nature we shall have reason to admire and extol so excellent an art what shall we say of the several instruments which are contrived to measure time we should quickly find the value of them if we were reduced to the condition of those barbarous nations that want them the pendulumclock invented and completed by that famous mathematician monsieur hugens is an useful invention is there any thing more wonderful than several planetary machines which have been invented to show the motions of the heavenly bodies and their places at any time of which the most ingenious according to the exactest numbers and true system was made by the same m hugens to which we may very justly apply claudians noble verses upon that of archimedes jupiter in parvo cum cerneret aethera vitro risit and ad superos talia dicta dedit huttine mortalis progressa potentia curae jam meus in fragili luditur or be labor jura poli rerumque fidem legesque deorum ecce syracusais transtulit art senex inclusus variis famulatur spiritus astris et vioum certis motibus urget opus percurrit proprium mentitus signifer annum et simulata novo cynthia mense redit jamque suum volvens audax industria mundum gaudet and humana sidera mente regit quid falso insontem tonitru salmonea miror aemula naturae parva reperta manus   here i ought to mention the sciatherical instruments for want of which there was a time when the grecians themselves were forced to measure the shadow in order to know the hour and as pliny  cap ult lib vii tells us the romans made use of an erroneous sundial for ninety nine years till q marcius philippus their censor set up a better which no doubt at that time was thought a jewel and at last that famous pyramid was set up in the campus martius to serve for a gnomon to a dial marked on the street to this sort of engines ought to be referred spheres globes astrolabes projections of the sphere etc these are such useful and necessary things that alone may recommend the art by which they are made for by these we are able in our closet to judge of the celestial motions and to visit the most distant places of the earth without the fatigue and danger of voyages to determine concerning their distance situation climate nature of the seasons length of their days and their relation to the celestial bodies as much as if we were inhabitants to all these i might add those instruments which the mathematicians have invented to execute their own precepts for making observations either at sea or land surveying gauging etc  the catoptricks and dioptricks furnish us with variety of useful inventions both for the promoting of knowledge and the conveniences of life whereby sight the great instrument of our perception is so much improved that neither the distance nor the minuteness of the object are any more impediments to it the telescope is of so vast use that besides the delightful and useful purposes it is applied to here below as the descrying ships and men and armies at a distance we have by its means discovered new parts of the creation fresh instances of the surprising wisdom of the adorable creator we have by it discovered the satellites of jupiter the satellites and ring of saturn the rotation of the planets about their own axes besides other appearances whereby the system of the world is made plain to sense as it was before to reason the telescope has also improved the manner of astronomical observations and made them much more accurate than it was possible for them to be before and these improvements in astronomy have brought along with them as ever correspondent improvements in geography from the observation of jupiters satellites we have a ready way to determine the longitude of places on the earth on the other hand the microscope has not been less useful in helping us to the sight of such objects as by their minuteness escape our naked eye by it men have pursued nature into its most retired recesses so that now it can hardly any more hide its greatest mysteries from us how much have we learned by the help of the microscope of the contrivance and structure of animal and vegetable bodies and the composition of fluids and solids but if these sciences had never gone further than by their single specula and lentes to give those surprising appearances of objects and their images and to produce heat unimitable by our hottest furnaces and to furnish infallible easy cheap and safe remedies for the decay of our sight arising commonly from old age and for purblindness they had merited the greatest esteem and invited to the closest study especially if we consider that such as naturally are almost blind and either know not their nearest acquaintance at the distance of a rooms breadth or cannot read in order to pass their time pleasantly are by glasses adapted to the defect of their eyes set on a level again with those that enjoy their eyesight best and that without danger pain or charge  again mathematics are highly serviceable to a nation in military affairs i believe this will be readily acknowledged by every body the affairs of war take in number space force distance time etc things of mathematical consideration in all its parts in tacticks castrametation fortifying attacquing and defending the ancients had more occasion for mechanics in the art of war than we have gunpowder readily producing a force far exceeding all the engines they had contrived for battery and this i reckon has lost us a good occasion of improving our mechanics the cunning of mankind never exerting it self so much as in their arts of destroying one another but as gunpowder has made mechanics less serviceable to war it has made geometry more necessary there being a force or resistance in the due measures and proportions of the lines and angles of a fortification which contribute much toward its strength this art of fortification has been much studied of late but i dare not affirm that it has attained its utmost perfection and though where the ground is regular it admits but of small variety the measures being pretty well determined by geometry and experience yet where the ground is made up of natural strengths and weaknesses it affords some scope for thinking and contrivance but there is another much harder piece of geometry which gunpowder has given us occasion to improve and that is the doctrine of projectiles whereon the art of gunnery is founded here the geometers have invented a beautiful theory and rules and instruments which have reduced the casting of bombs to great exactness as for tacticks and castrametation mathematics retain the same place in them as ever and some tolerable skill in these are necessary for officers as well as for engineers an officer that understands fortification will caeteris paribus much better defend his post as knowing wherein its strength consists or make use of his advantage to his enemys ruin than he that does not he knows when he leads never so small a party what his advantages and disadvantages in defending and attacquing are how to make the best of his ground etc and hereby can do truly more service than another of as much courage who for want of such knowledge it may be throws away himself and a number of brave fellows under his command and it is well if the mischief reaches no further as for a competent skill in numbers it is so necessary to officers that no man can be safely trusted with a company that has it not all the business is not to fire muskets the managing of affairs the dealing with agents etc happen more frequently and the higher the command is the more skill in all the aforesaid things is required and i dare appeal to all the nations in europe whether caeteris paribus officers are not advanced in proportion to their skill in mathematical learning except that some times great names and quality carry it but still so as that the prince depends upon a man of mathematical learning that is put as director to the quality when that learning is wanting in it  lastly navigation which is made up of astronomy and geometry is so noble an art and to which mankind owes so many advantages that upon this single account those excellent sciences deserve most of all to be studied and merit the greatest encouragement from a nation that owes to it both its riches and security and not only does the common art of navigation depend on mathematics but whatever improvements shall be made in the architectura navalis or building of ships whether they are designed for merchantships or ships of war whether swift running or bearing a great sail or lying near the wind be desired these must all be the improvements of geometry shipcarpenters indeed are very industrious but in these things they acknowledge their inability confess that their best productions are the effects of chance and implore the geometers help nor will common geometry do the business it requires the most abstruse to determine the different sections of a ship according as it is designed for any of the foresaid ends a french mathematician p le host has lately endeavored some thing in this way and though it is not free from errors as requiring a fuller knowledge in geometry yet is the author much to be commended for this as having bravely designed and paved the way for other mathematicians and also for the former and bigger part of his book wherein he brings to a system the working of ships and the naval tacticks or the regular disposition of a fleet in attacquing fighting and retreating according to the different circumstances of wind tides etc  the great objection that is made against the necessity of mathematics in the forementioned great affairs of navigation the art military etc is that we see those affairs are carried on and managed by such as are not great mathematicians as seamen engineers surveyers gaugers clockmakers glassgrinders etc and that the mathematicians are commonly speculative retired studious men that are not for an active life and business but content themselves to sit in their studies and pore over a scheme or a calculation to which there is this plain and easy answer the mathematicians have not only invented and ordered all the arts abovementioned by which those grand affairs are managed but have laid down precepts contrived instruments and abridgements so plainly that common artificers are capable of practicing by them though they understand not a tittle of the grounds on which the precepts are built and in this they have consulted the good and necessities of mankind those affairs demand so great a number of people to manage them that it is impossible to breed so many good or even tolerable mathematicians the only thing then to be done was to make their precepts so plain that they might be understood and practiced by a multitude of men this will best appear by examples nothing is more ordinary than dispatch of business by common arithmetic by the tables of simple and compound interest annuities etc yet how few men of business understand the reasons of common arithmetic or the contrivance of those tables now they are made but securely rely on them as true they were the good and the thoroughmathematicians that made those precepts so plain and calculated those tables that facilitate the practice so much nothing is more universally necessary than the measuring of plains and solids and it is impossible to breed so many good mathematicians as that there may be one that understands all the geometry requisite for surveying and measuring of prisms and pyramids and their parts and measuring frustums of conoids and spheroids in every market town where such work is necessary the mathematicians have therefore inscribed such lines on their common rulers and slipping rulers and adapted so plain precepts to them that every countrycarpenter and gauger can do the business accurately enough though he knows no more of those instruments tables and precepts he makes use of than a hobbyhorse so in navigation it is impossible to breed so many good mathematicians as would be necessary to sail the hundredth part of the ships of the nation but the mathematicians have laid down so plain and distinct precepts calculated necessary tables and contrived convenient instruments so that a seaman that knows not the truths on which his precepts and tables depend may practice safely by them they resolve triangules every day that know not the reason of any one of their operations seamen in their calculations make use of artificial numbers or logarithmes that know nothing of their contrivance and indeed all those great inventions of the most famous mathematicians had been almost useless for those common and great affairs had not the practice of them been made easy to those who cannot understand them from hence it is plain that it is to those speculative retired men we owe the rules the instruments the precepts for using them and the tables which facilitate the dispatch of so many great affairs and supply mankind with so many conveniences of life they were the men that taught the world to apply arithmetic astronomy and geometry to sailing without which the needle would be still useless just the same way in the other parts of mathematics the precepts that are practiced by multitudes without being understood were contrived by some few great mathematicians  since then it has been shown how much mathematics improve the mind how subservient they are to other arts and how immediately useful to the commonwealth there needs no other arguments or motives to a government to encourage them this is the natural conclusion from these premises plato in his republic  lib vii takes care that whoever is to be educated for magistracy or any considerable post in the commonwealth may be instructed first in arithmetic then in geometry and thirdly in astronomy and however necessary those arts were in platos time they are much more so now the arts of war and trade requiring much more the assistance of those sciences now than they did then as being brought to a greater height and perfection and accordingly we see these sciences are the particular care of princes that design to raise the force and power of their countries it is well known that this is none of the least arts whereby the french king has brought his subjects to make that figure at sea which they at this time do i mean the care he takes for educating those appointed for seaservice in mathematical learning for in the ordonnance marine title viii he orders that there be professors to teach navigation publicly in all the seaport towns who must know designing and teach it to their scholars in order to lay down the appearances of coasts etc they are to keep their schools open and read four times a week to the seamen where they must have charts globes spheres compasses quadrants astrolabes and all books and instruments necessary to teach their art the directors of hospitals are obliged to send thither yearly two or three of their boys to be taught and to furnish them with books and instruments those professors are obliged to examine the journals deposited in the office of admiralty in the place of their establishment to correct the errors in presence of the seamen and to restore them within a month etc king charles the second who well understood the importance of establishments of this nature founded one such school in christs hospital london which i believe is inferior to none of the french but it is to be wished there were many more such his present majesty during the time of the late war established a mathematical lecture to breed up engineers and officers as knowing very well the importance thereof and this continued some time after the peace and it is worthy the consideration of the wisdom of the nation whether the restoring and continuing this even in peace be not expedient for the breeding of engineers who are so useful and valuable and so difficult to be had in time of war and so little dangerous in times of peace  besides the crowd of merchants seamen surveyors engineers shipcarpenters artisans etc that are to be instructed in the practice of such parts of mathematics as are necessary to their own business respectively a competent number of able mathematicians ought to be entertained in order to apply themselves to the practice not only to instruct the former sort but likewise to remove those obstacles which such as do not think beyond their common rules cannot overcome and no doubt it is no small impediment to the advancement of arts that speculative men and good mathematicians are unacquainted with their particular defects and the several circumstances in them that render things practicable or impracticable but if there were public encouragement we should have skilful mathematicians employed in those arts who would certainly find out and remedy the imperfections of them the present lords commissioners of the admiralty knowing that there are still two great desiderata in navigation to wit the theory of the variation of the magnetical needle and a method of finding out the longitude of any place that may be practicable at sea by seamen and being sensible of what importance it would be to find out either of them have employed a very fit person the ingenious mr hally who has joined an entire acquaintance in the practice to a full and thorough knowledge of the more abstruse parts of mathematics and now that he is returned it is not doubted but he will satisfy those that sent him and in due time the world too with his discoveries in both those particulars and in many other that he has had occasion to make and where a long series of observations and experiments is necessary he has no doubt laid such a foundation as that afterobservers may gradually perfect them if it were not for more than the correcting the situation of the coasts where he touched and by them others whose relation to the former is known the nation is more then triply paid and those who sent him have by this mission secured to themselves more true honor and lasting fame than by actions that at first view appear more magnificent  the next thing that is necessary for the improvement of mathematical learning is that mathematics be more generally studied at our universities than hitherto they have been from those seminaries the state justly expects and demands those who are acquainted both with the speculation and practice in those are all the encouragements to them imaginable leisure and assistance there are still at hand books and instruments as also other scholars that have made equal progress and may be comrades in study and the direction of the professors there are also in perfection all the incitements to this study and especially an acquaintance with the works of the ancients where this learning is so much recommended there other faculties are studied to which it is subservient there also are the nobility and gentry bred who in due time must be called to their share in the government of the fleets army treasury and other public employments where mathematical learning is absolutely necessary and without which they though of never so great natural parts must be at the mercy and discretion of their servants and deputies who will first cheat them and then laugh at them and not only public employments but their private concerns demand mathematical knowledge if their fortunes lie in woods coal salt manufactures etc the necessity of this knowledge is open and known and even in landestates no undertaking for improvement can be securely relied upon without it it not only makes a man of quality and estate his whole life more illustrious and more useful for all affairs as hippocrates says  etc but in particular it is the best companion for a country life were this once become a fashionable study and the mode exercises its empire over learning as well as other things it is hard to tell how far it might influence the morals of our nobility and gentry in rendering them serious diligent curious taking them off from the more fruitless and airy exercises of the fancy which they are apt to run into  the only objection i can think of that is brought against these studies is that mathematics require a particular turn of head and a happy genius that few people are masters of without which all the pains bestowed upon the study of them are in vain they imagine that a man must be born a mathematician i answer that this exception is common to mathematics and other arts that there are persons that have a particular capacity and fitness to one more than another every body owns and from experience i dare say it is not in any higher degree true concerning mathematics than the others a man of good sense and application is the person that is by nature fitted for them especially if he begins betimes and if his circumstances have been such that this did not happen by prudent direction the defect may be supplied as much as in any art whatsoever the only advantage this objection has is that it is on the side of softness and idleness those powerful allies  there is nothing further remains sir but that i give you my thoughts in general concerning the order and method of studying mathematics which i shall do very shortly as knowing that you are already acquainted with the best methods and others with you may have them easily from the best and ablest hands  first then i lay down for a principle that no body at an university is to be taught the practice of any rule without the true and solid reason and demonstration of the same rules without demonstration must and ought to be taught to seamen artisans etc as i have already said and schools for such people are fit in seaports and tradingtowns but it is far below the dignity of an university which is designed for solid and true learning to do this it is from the universities that they must come who are able to remedy the defects of the arts and therefore nothing must be taken on trust there seamen and surveyors etc remember their rules because they are perpetually practicing them but scholars who are not thus employed if they know not the demonstration of them presently forget them  secondly no part of mathematics ought to be taught by compendiums this follows from the former compendiums are fit to give a general and superficial knowledge not a thorough one it is time and not the bulk of books we ought to be sparing of and i appeal to any person of experience whether solid knowledge is not acquired in shorter time by books treating fully of their subjects than by compendiums and abridgements  from hence it follows that the elements of arithmetic and geometry are to be taught euclid in his thirteen books of elements gives us both but our present way of notation supersedes some of those of arithmetic as demonstrating the rules from the operations themselves there remain then the first six books for the geometry of plains and the last three for stereometry the rest ought to be read in their own place for the perfection of arithmetic in teaching these care ought to be taken to make use of such examples as suit with the condition of the scholar for instance merchants accounts and affairs for examples of the operations of arithmetic to one that is afterward to have a concern that way whereas to a man of the first quality examples from the increase and decrease of the people or from land or seaforce and from the tacticks ought to be proposed for it is certain nothing makes one tired sooner than the frivolous and trifling examples that are commonly brought for the exercise of the rules of arithmetic and geometry though this is common to them with the other arts as grammar logic etc  the manner of writing of the mathematicians of this and the former age makes trigonometry with the manner of constructing its tables etc almost elementary and the practical geometry commonly so called is very fit to come next as an elegant application of the elements of geometry to business as surveying gauging etc  after the elements of sphericks which are perfectly well handled by theodosius a full insight into the principles of astronomy will be necessary  mechanics come next to be read which are the ground of a great part of natural learning and afterward optics catoptricks and dioptricks  but none of these except the elements can be fully understood until one is pretty well skilled in conicksections and all these are made more easy by some tolerable skill in algebra and its application to geometry  these foundations being laid any one may with great ease pursue the study of the mathematics as his occasions require either in its abstract parts and the more recondite geometry and its application to natural knowledge or in mechanics by prosecuting the staticks hydrostaticks ballisticks etc or in astronomy by its application to geography navigation gnomonicks astrolabes etc but in most of these a particular order is not necessary any one may take that first which he is most inclined to  i shall not offer you any advice concerning the choice of books but refer you if you want any to the direction of those who are eminent among you in this part of learning i ask your pardon for the omission of ceremony in these papers having followed rather the ordinary way of essay than letter and wishing you good success in your studies i am  sir your friend and servant    november   00 finis
