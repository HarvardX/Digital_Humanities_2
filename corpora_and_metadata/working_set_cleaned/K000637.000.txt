south and lewis baboon the publishers preface the world is much indebted to the famous sir humphry polesworth for his ingenious and impartial account of john bulls lawsuit yet there is just cause of complaint against him in that he retails it only by parcels and will not give us the whole work this forces me who am only the publisher to bespeak the assistance of his friends and acquaintance to engage him to lay aside that stingy humor and gratify the curiosity of the public at once he pleads in excuse that they are only private memoirs wrote for his own use in a loose style to serve as a help to his ordinary conversation i represented to him the good reception the two first parts had met that though they had been calculated by him only for the meridian of grubstreet yet they were taken notice of by the better sort that the world was now sufficiently acquainted with john bull and interested it self in his little concerns he answered with a smile that he had indeed some trifling things to impart that concerned john bulls relations and domestic affairs if these would satisfy me he gave me free leave to make use of them because they would serve to make the history of the lawsuit more intelligible when i had looked over the manuscript i found likewise some further account of the composition which perhaps may not be unacceptable to such as have read the two former parts  chap i the character of john bulls mother john had a mother whom he loved and honored extremely a discreet grave sober good conditioned cleanly old gentlewoman as ever lived she was none of your crossgrained termagant scolding jades that one had as good be hanged as live in the house with such as are always censuring the conduct and telling scandalous stories of their neighbors extolling their own good qualities and undervaluing those of others on the contrary she was of a meek spirit and as she was strictly virtuous her self so she always put the best construction upon the words and actions of her neighbors except where they were irreconcilable to the rules of honesty and decency she was neither one of your precise prudes nor one of your fantastical old belles that dress themselves like girls of fifteen as she neither wore a ruff forehead cloth nor highcrownd hat so she had laid aside feathers flowers and crimpt ribons in her headdress furbulow scarfs and hoopd petticoats she scorned to patch and paint yet she loved to keep her hands and her face clean though she wore no flaunting laced ruffles she would not keep her self in a constant sweat with greasy flannel though her hair was not stuck with jewels she was not ashamed of a diamond cross she was not like some ladies hung about with toys and trinkets twiser cases pocketglasses and essence bottles she used only a gold watch and an almanac to mark the hours and the holy days her furniture was neat and genteel well fancied with a bon goust as she affected not the grandeur of a state with a canopy she thought there was no offense in an elbow chair she had laid aside your carving gilding and japan work as being too apt to gather dirt but she never could be prevailed upon to part with plain wainscot and clean hangings there are some ladies that affect to smell a stink in every thing they are always highly perfumed and continually burning frankincense in their rooms she was above such affectation yet she never would lay aside the use of brooms and scrubbing brushes and scrupled not to lay her linen in fresh lavender she was no less genteel in her behavior wellbred without affectation in the due mean between one of your affected cursying pieces of formality and your romps that have no regard to the common rules of civility there are some ladies that affect a mighty regard for their relations we must not eat to day for my uncle tom or my cousin betty died this time ten years let us have a ball to night it is my neighbor such a ones birthday she looked upon all this as grimace yet she constantly observed her husbands birthday her wedding day and some few more though she was a truly good woman and had a sincere motherly love for her son john yet there wanted not those who endeavored to create a misunderstanding between them and they had so far prevailed with him once that he turned her out of doors to his geeat sorrow as he found afterward for his affairs went all at sixes and sevens she was no less judicious in the turn of her conversation and choice of her studies in which she far exceeded all her sex your rakes that hate the company of all sober grave gentlewomen would bear hers and she would by her handsome manner of proceeding sooner reclaim than some that were more sower and reserved she was a zealous preacher up of chastity and conjugal fidelity in wives and by no means a friend to the newfangld doctrine of the indispensible duty of cuckoldom tho she advanced her opinions with a becoming assurance yet she never ushered them in as some positive creatures will do with dogmatical assertions this is infallible i cannot be mistaken none but a rogue can deny it it has been observed that such people are oftener in the wrong than any body though she had a thousand good qualities she was not without her faults amongst which one might perhaps reckon too great lenity to her servants to whom she always gave good counsel but often too gentle correction i thought i could not say less of john bulls mother because she bears a part in the following transactions  chap ii the character of john bulls sister peg with the quarrels that happened between master and miss in their childhood john had a sister a poor girl that had been starved at nurse any body would have guessed miss to have been bred up under the influence of a cruel stepdame and john to be the fondling of a tender mother john looked ruddy and plump with a pair of cheeks like a trumpeter miss looked pale and wan as if she had the green sickness and no wonder for john was the darling he had all the good bits was crammed with good pullet chicken pig goose and capon while miss had only a little oatmeal and water or a dry crust without butter john had his golden pippens peaches and nectarnes poor miss a crap apple sloe or blackberry master lay in the best apartment with his bed chamber toward the south sun miss lodged in a garret exposed to the north wind which shreveld her countenance however this usage tho it stunted the poor girl in her growth gave her a hardy constitution she had life and spirit in abundance and knew when she was ill used now and then she would seize upon johns commons snatch a leg of a pullet or a bit of good beef for which they were sure to go to fisticuffs master was indeed too strong for her but miss would not yield in the least point but even when master had got her down she would scratch and bite like a tiger when he gave her a cuff on the ear she would prick him with her knittingneedle john brought a great chain one day to tie her to the bed post for which affront miss aimed a penknife at his heart in short these quarrels grew up to rooted aversions they gave one another nicknames she called him gundyguts and he called her lousy peg though the girl was a right clever wench as any was and through her pale looks you might discern spirit and vivacity which made her not indeed a perfect beauty but something that was agreeable it was barbarous in parents not to take notice of these early quarrels and make them live better together such domestic fewds proving afterward the occasion of misfortunes to them both peg had indeed some odd humors and comical antipathy for which john would jeer her what think you of my sister peg  says he that faints at the sound of an organ and yet will dance and frisk at the noise of a bagpipe what is that to you gundyguts quoth peg every bodys to choose their own music then peg had taken a fancy not to say her paternoster which made people imagine strange things of her of the three brothers that have made such a clutter in the world lord peter martin and jack jack had of late been her inclinations lord peter she detested nor did martin stand much better in her good graces but jack had found the way to her heart i have often admired what charms she discovered in that awkward booby till i talked with a person that was acquainted with the intrigue who gave me the following account of it  chap iii jacks charms or the method by which he gained pegs heart in the first place jack was a very young fellow by much the youngest of the three brothers and people indeed wondered how such a young upstart jackanapes should grow so pert and saucy and take so much upon him   jack bragged of greater abilities than other men he was well gifted as he pretended i need not tell you what secret influence that has upon the ladies   jack had a most scandalous tongue and persuaded peg that all mankind besides himself were poxd by that scarletfacd whore signiora bubonia as for his brother lord peter the tokens were evident in him blotches scabs and the corona his brother martin though he was not quite so bad had some nocturnal pains which his friends pretended were only scorbutical but he was sure proceeded from a worse cause by such malicious insinuations he had possessed the lady that he was the only man in the world of a sound pure and untainted constitution though there were some that stuck not to say that signiora bubonia and jack railed at one another only the better to hide an intrigue and that jack had been found with signiora under his cloak carrying her home in a dark stormy night   jack was a prodigious ogler he would ogle you the outside of his eye inward and the white upward   jack gave himself out for a man of great estate in the fortunate islands of which the sole property was vested in his person by this trick he cheated abundance of poor people of small sums pretending to make over plantations in the said islands but when the poor wretches came there with jacks grant they were beat mocked and turned out of doors   i told you that peg was whimsical and loved any thing that was particular in that way jack was her man for he neither thought spoke dressed nor acted like other mortals he was for your bold strokes he railed at fops though himself the most affected in the world instead of the common fashion he would visit his mistress in a mourning cloak band short cuffs and a peaked beard he invented a way of coming into a room backwards which he said showed more humility and less affectation where other people stood he sat where they sat he stood when he went to court he used to kick away the state and sit down by his prince cheek by choul confound these states says he they are a modern invention when he spoke to his prince he always turned his brch upon him if he was advised to fast for his health he would eat roast beef if he was allowed a more plentiful diet then he would be sure that day to live upon watergruel he would cry at a wedding laugh and make jests at a funeral he was no less singular in his opinions you would have burst your sides to hear him talk politics all governments says he is founded upon the right distribution of punishments decent executions keep the world in awe for that reason the majority of mankind ought to be hanged every year for example i suppose the magistrate ought to pass an irreversible sentence upon all blueeyd children from the cradle but that there may be some show of justice in his proceeding these children ought to be trained up by masters appointed for that purpose to all sorts of villainy that they may deserve their fate and the execution of them may serve as an object of terror to the rest of mankind as to the giving of pardons he had this singular method that when these wretches had the ropes about their necks it should be enquired who believed they should be hanged and who not the first were to be pardoned the last hanged outright such as were once pardoned were never to be hanged afterward for any crime whatsoever he had such skill in physiognomy that he would pronounce peremptorily upon a mans face that fellow says he do what he will cant avoid hanging he has a hanging look by the same art he would prognosticate a principality to a scoundrel he was no less particular in the choice of his studies they were generally bent toward exploded chimeras the perpetum mobile the circular shot philosophers stone and silent gunpowder making chains for fleas nets for flies and instruments to unrevel cobwebs and split hairs thus i think i have given you a distinct account of the methods he practiced upon peg her brother would now and then ask her what a devil do thou see in that pragmatical coxcomb to make thee so in love with him he is a fit match for a tailor or a shoemakers daughter but not for you that are a gentlewoman fancy is free quoth peg i will take my awn way do you take yours i do no care for your flaunting beaus that gang with their breasts open and their sarks over their waistcoats that accost me with set speeches out of sidneys arcadia or the academy of compliments jack is a sober grave youngman though he has none of your studied harangues his meaning is sincere he has a great regard to his fathers will and he that shows himself a good son will make a good husband besides i know he has the original deed of conveyance to the fortunate islands the others are counterfeits there is nothing so obstinate as young ladies in their amors the more you cross them the worse they are  chap iv how the relations reconciled john and his sister peg and what return peg made to johns message john bull otherwise a good natured man was very hardhearted to his sister peg chiefly from an aversion he had conceived in his infancy while he flourished kept a warm house and drove a plentiful trade poor peg was forced to go hawking and pedling about the streets selling knives scissars and shoebuckles now and then carried a basket of fish to the market sowed spun and knit for a poor livelihood till her fingersend were sore and when she could not get bread for her family she was forced to hire em out at journeywork to her neighbors yet in these her poor circumstances she still preserved the air and mien of a gentlewoman a certain decent pride that extorted respect from the haughtiest of her neighbors when she came into any full assembly she would not yield the pas to the best of them if one asked her are not you related to john bull yes says she he has the honor to be my brother so pegs affairs went till all the relations cried out shame upon john for his barbarous usage of his own flesh and blood that it was an easy matter for him to put her in a credible way of living not only without hurt but with advantage to himself being she was an industrious person and might be serviceable to him in his way of business hang her jade quoth john i cannot endure her as long as she keeps that rascal jacks company they told him the way to reclaim her was to take her into his house that by conversation the childish humors of their younger days might be worn out these arguments were enforced by a certain incident it happened that john was at that time about making his will and entailing his estate the very same in which nic frog is namd executor now his sister pegs name being in the entail he could not make a thorough settlement without her consent there was indeed a malicious story went about as if johns last wife had fallen in love with jack as he was eating custard a horseback that she persuaded john to take his sister peg into the house the better to drive on her intrigue with jack concluding he would follow his mistress peg all i can infer from this story is that when one has got a bad character in the world people will report and believe any thing of them true or false but to return to my story when peg received johns message she huffd and stormed like the devil my brother john quoth she is grown wondrous kind hearted all of a sudden but i meikle doubt whether it be not mair for his awn convenience than my good he draws up his weits and his deeds forsooth and i mun set my hand to them unsight unseen i like the young man he has settled upon well enough but i think i ought to have a valuable consideration for my consent he wants my poor little farm because it makes a nook in his park wall ye may even tell him he has mair than he makes good use of he gangs up and down drinking roaring and quarrelling through all the country merkats making foolish bargins in his cups which he repents when he is sober like a thriftless wretch spending the goods and gear that his forefathers won with the sweat of their brows light come light go he cares not a farthing but why should i stand surety for his silly contracts the little i have is free and i can call it my own hames hame be it never so hamely i ken him well enough he could never abide me and when he has his ends he will even use me as he did before i am sure i shall be treated like a poor drudge i shall be set to tend the bairns darn the hose and mend the linen then there is no living with that auld carline his mother she rails at jack and jacks an honester man than any of her kin i shall be plagued with her spells and her paternosters and silly auld world ceremonies i mun never pair my nails on a friday nor begin a journey on childermas day and i mun stand becking and binging as i gang out and into the hall tell him he may even began his get i will have nothing to do with him i will stay like the poor country mouse in my own habitation so peg talked but for all that by the interposition of good friends and by many a bonny thing that were sent and many more that were promised peg the matter was concluded and peg taken into the house upon certain articles one of which was that she might have the freedom of jacks conversation and might take him for better and for worse if she pleased provided always he did not come into the house at unseasonable hours and disturb the rest of the old woman johns mother  chap v of some quarrels that happened after peg was taken into the family it is an old observation that the qnarrels of relations are harder to reconcile than any other injuries from friends fret and gall more and the memory of them is not so easily obliterated this is cunningly represented by one of your old sages called aesop in the story of the bird that was grieved extremely for being wounded with an arrow feathered with his own wing as also of the oak that let many a heavy groan when he was cleft with a wedge of his own timber there was no man in the world less subject to rancour than john bull considering how often his good nature had been abused yet i dont know but he was too apt to hearken to tatling people that carried tales between him and his sister peg on purpose to sow jealousies and set them together by the ars they say that there were some hardships put upon  that had been better let alone but it was the business of good people to restrain the injuries on one side and moderate the resentments on the other a good friend acts both parts the one without the other will not do the purchasemoney of pegs farm was ill paid then peg loved a little good liquor and the servants shut up the winecellar but for that peg found a trick for she made a false key pegs servants complained that they were debarred from all manner of business and never suffered to touch the least thing within the house if they offered to come into the warehouse then strait went the yard slap over their noddle if they ventured into the countingroom a fellow would throw an ink bottle at their head if they came into the best apartment to set any thing there in order they were saluted with a broom if they meddld with any thing in the kitchen it was odds but the cook laid them over the pate with a ladle one that would have got into the stables was met by two rascals who fell to work with him with a brush and a currycomb some climbing up into the coach box were told that one of their companions had been there before that could not drive then slap went the long whip about their ears on the other hand it was complained that pegs servants were always asking for drinkmoney that they had more than their share of the christmasbox to say the truth pegs lads bustld pretty hard for that for when they were endeavoring to lock it up they got in their great fists and pulled out handfuls of halfcrowns some shillings and sixpences others in the scramble picked up guineas and broadpieces but there happened a worse thing than all this it was complained that pegs servants had great stomachs and brought too many of their friends and acquaintance to the table that johns family was like to be eat out of house and home instead of regulating this matter as it ought to be pegs young men were thrust away from the table then there was the devil and all to do spoons plates and dishes flew about the room like mad and sir roger who was now major domo had enough to do to quiet them peg said this was contrary to agreement whereby she was in all things to be treated like a child of the family then she called upon those that had made her such fair promises and undertook for her brother johns good behavior but alas to her cost she found that they were the first and readiest to do her the injury john at last agreed to this regulation that pegs footme might sit with his bookkeeper journeymen and apprentices and pegs better sort of servants might sit with his footmen if they pleased  then they began to orderplumb porridge and minced pies for pegs dinner peg told them she had an aversion to that sort of food that upon forcing down a mess of it some years ago it threw her into a fit till she brought it up again some alleged it was nothing but humor that the same mess should be servd up again for supper and breakfast next morning others would have made use of a horn but the wiser sort bid let her alone and she might take to it of her own accord  chap vi the conversation between john bull and his wife mrs bull though our affairs honey are in a bad condition i have a better opinion of them since you seem to be convinced of the ill course you have been in and are resolved to submit to proper remedies but when i consider your immense debts your foolish bargains and the general disorder of your business i have a curiosity to know what fate or chance has brought you into this condition   j bull i wish you would talk of some other subject the thoughts of it make me mad our family must have their run   mrs bull but such a strange thing as this never happened to any of your family before they have had law suits but though they spent the income they never mortgaged the stock sure you must have some of the  or the norfolk blood in you prithee give me some account of thse matters   j bull who could help it there lives not such a fellow by bread as that old lewis baboon it is the cheatingest contentious rogue upon the face of the earth you must know one day as nic frog and i were over a bottle making up an old quarrel the old knave would needs have us drink a bottle of his champaigne and so one after another till my friend nic and i not being used to such heady stuff got bloody drunk lewis all the while either by the strength of his brain or flinching his glass kept himself sober as a judge my worthy friends quoth lewis henceforth let us live neighbourly i am as peaceable and quiet as a lamb of my own temper but it has been my misfortune to live among quarrelsom neighbors there is but one thing can make us fall out and that is the inheritance of lord strutts estate i am content for peace sake to wave my right and submit to any expedient to prevent a lawsuit i think an equal division will be the fairest way well moved old lewis quoth frog and i hope my friend john here will not be refractory at the same time he clapped me on the back and slabberd me all over from cheek to cheek with his great tongue do as you please gentlemen quoth i it is all one to john bull we agreed to part that night and next morning to meet at the corner of lord strutts park wall with our surveying instruments which accordingly we did old lewis carried a chain and a semicircle nic paper rulers and a lead pencil and i followed at some distance with a long pole we began first with surveying the meadowgrounds afterward we measured the corn fields close by close then we proceeded to the woodlands the copper and tin mines all this while nic laid down every thing exactly upon paper calculated the acres and roods to a great nicety when we had finished the land we were going to break into the house and gardens to take an inventory of his plate pictures and other furniture   mrs bull what said lord strutt to all this   j bull as we had almost finished our concern we were accosted by some of lord strutts servants hey day what is here what a devils the meaning of all these trangams and gimcracks gentlemen what in the name of wonder are you gong about jumping over my masters hedges and running your lines cross his grounds if you are at any fieldpastime you might have asked leave my master is a civil wellbred person as any is   mrs bull what could you answer to this   j bull why truly my neighbor frog and i were still hotheaded we told him his master was an old doting puppy that minded nothing of his own business that we were surveying his estate and settling it for him since he would not do it himself upon this there happened a qurrrel but we being stronger than they sent them away with a flea in their ear they went home and told their master my lord say they there are three odd sort of fellows going about your grounds with the strangest machines that ever we beheld in our life i suppose they are going to rob your orchard fell your trees or drive away your cattle they told us strange things of settling your estate one is a lusty old fellow in a black wig with a black beard without teeth there is another thick squat fellow in trunkhose the third is a little long nosed thin man i was then lean being just come out of a fit of sickness i suppose it is fit to send after them lest they carry something away   mrs bull i fancy this put the old fellow in a rare tweag   john bull weak as he was he called for his long toledo swore and bouncd about the room sdeath what am i come to to be affronted so by my tradesmen i know the rascals my barber clothier and linnendraper dispose of my estate bring hither my blunderbuss i will warrant ye you shall see daylight through them scoundrels dogs the scum of the earth frog that was my fathers kitchenboy he pretend to meddle with my estate with my will ah poor strutt what art thou come to at last thou have lived too long in the world to see thy age and infirmity so despised how will the ghosts of my noble ancestors receive these tidings they cannot must not sleep quietly in their graves in short the old gentleman was carried off in a fainting fit and after bleeding in both arms hardly recoverd   mrs bull really this was a very extraordinary way of proceeding i long to hear the rest of it   j bull after we had come back to the tavern and taken the other bottle of champaigne we quarreled a little about the division of the estate lewis halld and pulled the map on one side and frog and i on the other till we had like to have tore the parchment to pieces at last lewis pulled out a pair of great taylors shears and clipped off a corner for himself which he said was a manor that lay convenient for him and left frog and me the rest to dispose of as we pleased we were overjoyed to think lewis was contented with so little not smelling what was at the bottom of the plot there happened indeed an incident that gave us some disturbance a cunning fellow one of my servants two days after peeping through the keyhole observed that old lewis had stole away our part of the map and saw him fiddling and turning the map from one corner to the other trying to join the two pieces together again he was muttering something to himself which he did not well hear only these words it is great pity it is great pity my servant added that he believed this had some illmeaning i told him he was a coxcomb always pretending to be wiser than his companions lewis and i are good friends he is an honest fellow and i dare say will stand to his bargain the sequel of the story proved this fellows suspicion to be too wellgrounded for lewis reveald our whole secret to the deceased lord strutt who in reward to his treachery and revenge to frog and me settled his whole estate upon the present philip baboon then we understood what he meant by piecing the map together   mrs bull and was you surprised at this had not lord strutt reason to be angry would you have been contented to have been so used your self   j bull why truly wife it was not easily reconciled to the common methods but then it was the fashion to do such things i have read of your golden age your silver age etc one might justly call this the age of the lawyers there was hardly a man of substance in all the country but had  counterfeit that pretended to his estate as the philosophers say that there is a duplicate of every terrestrial animal at sea so it was in this age of the lawyers there was at least two of every thing nay of my conscience i think there were three esquire hackums at one time lewis baboon entertaind a fellow that called himself john bulls heir i knew him no more than the child unborn yet he brought me into some trouble and expense there was another that pretended to be esquire south and two lord strutts you know in short it was usual for a parcel of fellows to meet and dispose of the whole estates in the country this lies convenient for me tom thou would do more good with that dick than the old fellow that has it so to law they went with the true owners the lawyers got well by it every body else was undone it was a common thing for an honest man when he came home at night to find another fellow domineering in his family hectoring his servants calling for supper and pretending to go to bed to his wife in every house you might observe two sofias quarrelling who was master for my own part i am still afraid of the same treatment that i should find some body behind my counter selling my broad cloth   mrs bull there are a sort of fellows that they call banterers and bambouzlers that play such tricks but it seems these fellows were in earnest   j bull i begin to think that justice is a better rule than convenience for all some people make so slight on it   chap vii of the hard shifts mrs bull was put to to preserve the manor of bullocks hatch with sir rogers method to keep off importunate duns as john bull and his wife were talking together they were surprizd with a sudden knocking at the door those wicked scriveners and lawyers no doubt quoth john and so it was some asking for the money he owed and others warning to prepare for the approaching term what a cursed life do i lead quoth john debt is like deadly sin for godsake sir roger get me rid of these fellows i will warrant you quoth sir roger leave them to me and in eed it was pleasant enough to observe sir rogers method with these importunate duns his sincere friendship for john bull made him submit to many things for his service which he would have scornd to have done for himself sometimes he would stand at the door with his long poll to keep off the duns till john got out at the backdoor when the lawyers and tradesmen brought extravagant bills sir roger used to bargain before hand for leave to cut off a quarter of a yard in any part of the bill he pleased he wore a pair of scissars in his pocket for this purpose and would snip it off so nicely as you cannot imagine like a  goldsmith he kept all your holydays there was not one wanting in his calendar when ready money was scarce he would set them a telling a tho pounds and sixpences groats and three pe pieces it would have done your heart good to have seen him charge through an army of lawyers attorneys clerks and tradesmen sometimes with sword in hand at other times nuzling like an eel in the mud when a fellow stuck like a bur that there was no shaking him off he  to be a mighty inquisitive about the health of his uncles and aunts in the country he could call them all by their names for he knew every body and could talk to them in their own way the extremely impertinent he would send away to see some strange sight as the dragon at hockley the hole or bid him call the  0th of next february now and then you would see him in the kitchen weighing the beef and butter paying ready money that the maids might not run atick at the market and the butchers by bribing of them sell damagd and light meat another time he would slip into the cellar and gage the casks in his leisure minutes he was posting his books and gathering in his debts uch frugal methods were necessary where money was so scarce and duns so numerous all this while john kept his credit could show his head both at change and westministerhall no man protested his bill nor refused his bond only the sharpers and the scriveners the lawyers and other clerks pelted sir roger as he went along the squirters were at it with their kennelwater for they were mad for the loss of their bubble and that they could not get him to mortgage the manor of bullocks hatch sir roger shook his ears and nuzled along wellsatisfied within himself that he was doing a charitable work in rescuing an honest man from the claws of harpies and bloodsuckers mrs bull did all that an affectionate wife and a good housewife could do yet the boundaries of virtues are indivisible lines it is impossible to march up close to the frontiers of frugality without entering the territories of parsimony your good housewifes are apt to look into the minutest things therefore some blamed mrs bull for new heelpiecing her shoes grudging a quarter of a pound of soap and sand to scowre the rooms but especially that she would not allow her maids and apprentices the benefit of john bunyan the londonapprentice or the sevenchampions in the black letter  chap viii a continuation of the conversation betwixt john bull and his wife mrs bull it is a most sad life we lead my dear to be so teased paying interest for old debts and still contracting new ones however i dont blame you for vindicating your honor and chastizing old lewis to curb the insolent protect the oppressed recover ones own and defend what one has are good effects of the law the only thing i want to know is how you came to make an end of your money before you finished your law suit   john bull i was told by the learned in the law that my suit stood upon three firm pillars more money for more law more law for more money and no composition more money for more law was plain demonstration for who can go to law without money and it was as plain that any man that has money may have law for it the third was as evident as the other two for what composition could be made with a rogue that never kept a word he said   mrs bull i think you are most likely to get out of this labyrinth by the second door by want of ready money to purchase this precious commodity but you seem not only to have bought too much of it but have paid too dear for what you have bought else how was it possible to run so much in debt when at this very time the yearly income of what is mortgaged to those usurers would discharge hocuss bills and give you your belly full of law or all your life without running one six pence in debt you have been bred up to business i suppose you can cipher i wonder you never used your pen and ink   j bull now you urge me too far prithee dear wife hold thy tongue suppose a young heir heedless raw and unexperienced full of spirit and vigor with a favorite passion in the hands of  scriveners such fellows are like your wire  mills if they get hold of a mans finger  pull in his whole body at last till they squeeze  blood and guts out of him when i wanted mon half a dozen of these fellows were always waiting in my antichamber with their securities ready drawn i was tempted with the ready some farm or other went to pot i received with one hand and paid it away with the other to lawyers that like so many hell hounds were ready to devour me then the rogues would plead poverty and scarcity of money that always ended in receiving ninety for the hundred after they had got possession of my best rents they were able to supply me with my own money but what was worse when i looked into the securities there was no clause of redemption   mrs bull no clause of redemption say you that is hard   john bull no great matter for i cannot pay them they had got a worse trick than that the same man bought and sold to himself paid the money and gave the acquittance the same man was butcher and grasier brewer and butler cook and poulterer there is something still worse than all this there came twenty bills upon me at once which i had given money to discharge i was like to be pulled to pieces by brewer butcher and baker even my herbwoman dund me as i went along the streets thanks to my friend sir rger else i must have gone to goal when i askd the meaning of this i was told the money went to the lawyers counsel will not tick sir hocus was urging my bookkeeper sat sotting all day playing at purt and allfours in short by griping usurers devouring lawyers and negligent servants i am brought to this pass   mrs bull this was hard usage but methinks the least reflection might have retrieved you   j bull it is true yet consider my circumstances my honor was engaged and i did not know how to get out besides i was for five years often drunk always muddled they carried me from tavern to tavern to alehouses and brandyshops brought me acquainted with such strange dogs there goes the prittiest fellow in the world says one for managing a jury make him yours there is another can pick you up witnesses sergeant such a one has a silver tongue at the bar i believe in time i should have retained every single person within the inns of court the night after a trial i treated the lawyers their wives and daughters with fiddles hautboys drums and trumpets i was always hotheaded then they placd me in the middle the attorneys and their clerks dancing about me hooping and hallowing long live john bull the glory and support of the law   mrs bull really husband you went through a very notable course   john bull one of the things that first alarmed me was that they showed a spite against my poor old mother lord quoth i what makes you so jealous of a poor old innocent gentlewoman that minds only her prayers and her practice of piety she never meddles in any of your concerns foh say they to see a handsome brisk genteel young fellow so much governed by a doting old woman why dont yo and suck the bubby do you consider she keeps you of a good jointure she has the best of your estate settled upon her for rentcharge hang her old thief turn her out of doors seize her lands and let her go to law if she dares soft and fair gentlemen quoth i my mothers my mother our family are not of an unnatural temper tho i dont take all her advice i will not seize her jointure long may she enjoy it good woman i dont grudge it her she allows me now and then a brace of hundreds for my lawsuit that is pretty fair about this time the old gentlewoman fell ill of an odd sort of a distemper it began with a coldness and numbness in her limbs which by degrees affected the nerves i think the physicians call them seized the brain and at last ended in a lethargy it betrayed it self at first in a sort of indifference and carelessness in all her actions coldness to her best friends and an aversion to stir or go about the common offices of life she that was the cleanliest creature in the world never shrunk now if you set a closestool under her nose she that would sometimes rattle off her servants pretty sharply now if she saw them drink or heard them talk profanely never took any notice of it instead of her usual charities to deserving persons she threw away her money upon roaring swearing bullies and randy beggars that went about the streets what is the matter with the old gentlewoman said every body she nev used to do in this manner at last the distemper grew more violent and threw her downright into ravi fits in which she shrieked out so loud that she dsturbd the whole neighborhood in her fits  called out upon one sir william oh sir william  have betrayed me killed me stabbed me sold me  cuckold of dover see see clum with his bloody kni seize him seize him stop him behold the the fury  her hissing snakes where is my son john is he well is he well poor man i pity him and abundance of such strange stuff that no body could make any thing of i knew little of the matter for when i inquired about her health the answer was that she was in a good moderate way physicians were sent for in haste sir roger with great difficulty brought rff gth came upon the first message there were several others called in but as usual upon such occasions they differed strangely at the consultation at last they divided into two parties one sided with gth and the other with rff dr gth this case seems to me to be plainly hysterical the old woman is whimsical it is a common thing for your old women to be so i will pawn my life blisters with the steel diet will recover her others suggested strong purging and letting of blood because she was plethorick some went so far as to say the old woman was mad and nothing would do better than a little corporal correction rff gentlemen you are mistaken in this case it is plainly an accute distemper and she cannot hold out three days without she is supported with strong cordials i came into the room with a good deal of concern and asked them what they thought of my mother in no manner of danger i vow to god quoth gth the old woman is hysterical fanciful sir i vow to god i tell you sir says rff she cannot live three days to an end unless there is some very effectual course taken with her she has a malignant fever then fool puppy and blockhead was the best words they gave i could hardly restrain them from throwing the inkbottles at one anothers heads i forgot to tell you that one party of the physicians desired i would take my sister peg into the house to nurse her but the old gentlewoman would not hear of that at last one physician asked if the lady had ever been used to take laudanum her maid answered not that she knew that indeed there was a high german liveryman of hers one van ptschirnsooker that gave her a sort of a quack powder the physician desired to see it nay says he there is opium in this i am sure   mrs bull i hope you examined a little into this matter   john bull i did indeed and discovered a great mystery of iniquity the witnesses made oath that they had heard some of the liverymen frequently railing at their mistress they said she was a troublesome fiddle faddle old woman and so ceremonious that there was no bearing of her they were so plagued with bowing and cringing as they went in and out of the room that their backs achd she used to scold at one for his dirty shoes at another for his greasy hair and not combing his head then she was so passionate and fiery in her temper that there was no living with her she wanted something to sweeten her blood that they never had a quiet nights rest for getting up in the morning to early sacraments that they wished they could find some way or another to keep the old woman quiet in her bed such discourses were often overheard among the liverymen that the said van ptschirnsooker had undertook this matter a maid made affidavit that she had seen the said van ptschirnsooker one of the liverymen frequently making up of medicines and administering them to all the neighbors that she saw him one morning make up the powder which her mistress took that she had the curiosity to ask him whence he had the ingredients they come says he from several parts of de world dis i have from geneva dat from rome this white powder from amsterdam and the red from edinburgh but the chief ingredient of all comes from turkey it was likewise proved that the said van ptschirnsooker had been frequently seen at the rose with jack who was known to bea an inveterate spite to his mistress that he brought  certain powder to his mistress which the examina believes to be the same and spoke the following word madam here is grand secret van de world my sweetni powder it does temperate de humor despel de wind and cure de vapor it lulleth and quieteth de animal sprits procuring rest and pleasant dreams it is the infallble receipt for de scurvy all heass in de bloodt and bring out upon de skin it is de true blood stancher stopping all fluxes of de bloodt if you do take dis you will never ail any ding it will cure you of all diseases and abundance more to this purpose which the examinant does not remember   john bull was interrupted in his story by a porter that brought him a letter from nicholas frog which is as follows  chap ix a copy of nic frogs letter to john bull john bull reads friend john what lum is it that makes thee jealous of thy old friend nicholas have thou forgot how some years ago he took thee out of the spunging house tis true my friend nic did so and i thank him but he made me pay a swinging reckoning thou begins now to repent the bargain that thou wast so fond of and if thou durst would forswear thy own hand and seal thou say that thou have purchased me too great an estate already when at the same time thou know i have only a mortgage it is true i have possession and the tenants own me for master but has not esquire south the equity of redemption no doubt and will redeem it very speedily poor nic has only possession eleven points of the law as for the turnpikes i have set up they are for other people not for my friand john i have ordered my servant constantly to attend to et thy carriages through without paying any thing only i hope thou will not come too heavy laden to spoil my ways certainly i have just cause of offense against thee my friend for supposing it possible that thou and i should ever quarrel what hounsfoot is it that puts these whims in thy head ten thousand last of devils haul me if i dont love thee as i love my life no question as the devil loves holy water does not thy own hand and seal oblige  to purchase for me till i say it is enough are not  words plain i say it is not enough do thou think thy frind nicholas frog made a childs bargain mark the words of thy contract tota pecunia with all thy money very well i have purchased with my own money my childrens and my grand childrens money is not that enough well tota pecunia let it be for at present i have none at all he would not have me purchase with other peoples money sure since tota pecunia is the bargain i think it is plain no more money no more purchase and whatever the world may say nicholas frog is but a poor man in comparison of the rich the opulent john bull great clothier of the world i have had many losses six of my best sheep were drowned and the water has come into my cellar and spoiled a pipe of my best brandy it would be a more friendly act in thee to carry a brief about the country to repair the losses of thy poor friend is it not evident to all the world that i am still hemmed in by lewis baboon is he not just upon my borders and so he will be if i purchase a thousand acres more unless he gets some body betwixt them i tell thee friend john thou have flatterers that persuade thee that thou art a man of business do not believe them if thou would still leave thy affairs in my hands thou should see how handsomely i would deal by thee that ever thou should be dazzled with the enchanted islands and mountains of gold that old lewis promises thee dswounds why do thou not lay out thy money to purchase a place at court of honest israel i tell thee thou must not so much as think of a composition not think of a composition that is hard indeed i cannot help thinking of it if i would thou complainst of want of money let thy wife and daughter burn the god lace upon their petticoats sell thy fat cattle retrench but a sirloin of beef and a peckloaf in a week from thy gormandizing guts retrench my beef a dog retrench my beef then it is plain the rascal has an ill design upon me he would starve me mortgage thy manor of bullocks hatch or pawn thy crop for ten year a rogue part with my country seat my patrimony all that i have left in the world ill see him hanged first why have thou changed thy attorney can any man manage thy cause better for thee very pleasant because a man has a good attorney he must never make an end of his lawsuit ah john john i wish thou knevvest thy own mind thou art as fickle as the wind i tell thee thou had better let this composition alone or leave it to thy loving friend  nic frog  chap x of some extraordinary things that passed at the salutation tavern in the conference between bull frog esquire south and lewis baboon frog had given his word that he would meet the above mentioned company at the salutation to talk of this agreement though he durst not directly break his appointment he made many a shuffling excuse one time he pretended to be seized with the gout in his right knee then he got a great cold that had struck him deaf of one ear afterward two of his coachhorses fell sick and he durst not go by water for fear of catching an ague john would take no excuse but hurried him away come nic  says he let us go and hear at least what this old fellow has to propose i hope there is no hurt in that be it so  quoth nic but if i catch any harm woe be to you my wife and children will curse you as long as they live when they were come to the salutation john concluded all was sure then and that he should be troubled no more with law affairs he thought every body as plain and sincere as he was well neighbors quoth he let us now make an end of all matters and live peaceably together for the time to come if every body is as well inclined as i we shall quickly come to the upshot of our affair and so pointing to frog to say something to the great surprise of all the company frog was seizd with a dead palsy in the tongue john began to ask him some plain questions and hoopd and hollowed in his ear john bull let us come to the point nic who would thou have to be the lord strutt would thou have philip baboon nic shook his head and said nothing john bull will thou then have esquire south to be lord strutt nic shook his head a second time john bull then who the devil will thou have say something or another nic opend his mouth and pointed to his tongue and cried a a a a which was as much as to say he could not speak john bull shall i serve philip baboon with broad cloth and accept of the composition that he offers with the liberty of his parks and fishponds then nic roared like a bull o o o o if thou will not let me have them will thou take them thy self then nic grind cackled and laughed till he was like to kill himself and seemed to be so pleased that he fell a frisking and dancing about the oom john bull shall i leave all this matter to thy anagement nic and go about my business then nic got up a glass and drank to john shaking him by the hand till he had like to have shook his shoulder out of joint john bull i understand thee nic but i shall make thee speak before i go then nic put his finger in his cheek and made him cry buck which was as much as to say i care not a farthing for thee john bull i have done nic if thou will not speak i will make my own terms with old lewis here then nic lolld out his tongue and turned up his bumm to him which was as much as to say kiss  john perceiving that frog would not speak turns to old lewis since we cannot make this obstinate fellow speak lewis pray condescend a little to his humor and set down thy meaning upon paper  may answer it in another scrap i am infinitely  quoth lewis that it happens so unfortunately for playing a little at cudgels the other day a fellow has given me such a rap over the right arm that i am quite lame  have lost the use of my forefinger and thumb so that i  hold my pen john bull that is all one let me  for you lewis but i have a misfortune that i nnot read any bodies hand but my own john bull try what you can do with your left hand lewis that is impossible it will make such a scrawl that it will not be legible as they were talking of this matter in came esquire south all dressed up in feathers and ribbons stark staring mad brandishing his sword as if he ld have cut off their heads crying room room  for the grand esquire of the world the flower of quires what covered in my presence i will crush your ouls and crack you like lice with that he had like to ave struck john bulls hat into the fire but john  was pretty strong fisted gave him such a squeeze as made his eyes water he went on still in his mad pranks when i am lord of the universe the sun shall  and adore me thou frog shall be my bailiff lewis my tailor and thou john bull shall be my fool all this  frog laughd in his sleeve gave the esquire  noggan of brandy and clapd him on the back which made him ten times madder poor john stood in amaze talking thus to himself well john thou art got into rare company one has a dumb devil the other a mad devil and the third a spirit of infirmity an honest man has a fine time ont amongst such rogues what art thou asking of them after all some mighty boon one would think only to sit quietly at thy own fireside sdeath what have i to do with such fellows john bull after all  losses and crsses can live better without them than they can without him would to god i lived a thousand leagues off them but the devils in it john bull is in and john bull must get out as well as be can as he was talking to himself he observd frog and old lewis edgng toward one another to whisper so that john was forced to sit with his arms akimbo to keep them asunder some people advised john to blood frog under the tonue or take away his bread and butter which would certainly make him speak to give esquire south hellebore as for lewis some were for emollient poltass others for opening his arm with an incision knife  i could not obtain from sir humphry at this time a copy of johns letter which he sent to his nephew by the young necromancer wherein he advises him not to eat butter ham and drink old hock in a morning with the esquire and frog for fear of giving him a sour breath  finis
