little able to return your favours that like those who owe too much i can only live by getting further into your debt you have not only been careful of my fortune which was the effect of your nobleness but you have been solicitous of my reputation which is that of your kindness it is not long since i gave you the trouble of perusing a play for me and now instead of an acknowledgment i have given you a greater in the correction of a poem but since you are to bear this persecution i will at least give you the encouragement of a martyr you could never suffer in a nobler cause for i have chosen the most heroic subject which any poet could desire i have taken upon me to describe the motives the beginning progress and successes of a most just and necessary war in it the care management and prudence of our king the conduct and valour of a royal admiral and of two incomparable generals the invincible courage of our captains and seamen and three glorious victories the result of all after this i have in the fire the most deplorable but withal the greatest argument that can be imagined the destruction being so swift so sudden so vast and miserable as nothing can parallel in story the former part of this poem relating to the war is but a due expiation for my not having served my king and country in it all gentlemen are almost obliged to it and i know no reason we should give that advantage to the commonalty of england to be foremost in brave actions which the nobles of france would never suffer in their peasants i should not have written this but to a person who has been ever forward to appear in all employments whither his honour and generosity have called him the latter part of my poem which describes the fire i owe first to the piety and fatherly affection of our monarch to his suffering subjects and in the second place to the courage loyalty and magnanimity of the city both which were so conspicuous that i wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve i have called my poem historical not epic though both the actions and actors are as much heroic as any poem can contain but since the action is not properly one nor that accomplished in the last successes i have judged it too bold a title for a few stanzas which are little more in number than a single iliad or the longest of the æneids for this reason i mean not of length but broken action tied too severely to the laws of history i am apt to agree with those who rank lucan rather among historians in verse than epic poets in whose room if i am not deceived silius italicus though a worse writer may more justly be admitted i have chosen to write my poem in quatrains or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme because i have ever judged them more noble and of greater dignity both for the sound and number than any other verse in use amongst us in which i am sure i have your approbation the learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme and were less constrained in the quantity of every syllable which they might vary with spondees or dactyls besides so many other helps of grammatical figures for the lengthening or abbreviation of them than the modern are in the close of that one syllable which often confines and more often corrupts the sense of all the rest but in this necessity of our rhymes i have always found the couplet verse most easy though not so proper for this occasion for there the work is sooner at an end every two lines concluding the labour of the poet but in quatrains he is to carry it further on and not only so but to bear along in his head the troublesome sense of four lines together for those who write correctly in this kind must needs acknowledge that the last line of the stanza is to be considered in the composition of the first neither can we give ourselves the liberty of making any part of a verse for the sake of rhyme or concluding with a word which is not current english or using the variety of female rhymes all which our fathers practised and for the female rhymes they are still in use among other nations with the italian in every line with the spaniard promiscuously with the french alternately as those who have read the alarique the pucelle or any of their later poems will agree with me and besides this they write in alexandrius or verses of six feet such as amongst us is the old translation of homer by chapman all which by lengthening of their chain makes the sphere of their activity the larger i have dwelt too long upon the choice of my stanza which you may remember is much better defended in the preface to gondibert and therefore i will hasten to acquaint you with my endeavours in the writing in general i will only say i have never yet seen the description of any naval fight in the proper terms which are used at sea and if there be any such in another language as that of lucan in the third of his pharsalia yet i could not avail myself of it in the english the terms of art in every tongue bearing more of the idiom of it than any other words we hear indeed among our poets of the thundering of guns the smoke the disorder and the slaughter but all these are common notions and certainly as those who in a logical dispute keep in general terms would hide a fallacy so those who do it in any poetical description would veil their ignorance    descriptas servare vices operumque colores   cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor  for my own part if i had little knowledge of the sea yet i have thought it no shame to learn and if i have made some few mistakes it is only as you can bear me witness because i have wanted opportunity to correct them the whole poem being first written and now sent you from a place where i have not so much as the converse of any seaman yet though the trouble i had in writing it was great it was more than recompensed by the pleasure i found myself so warm in celebrating the praises of military men two such especially as the prince   and general that it is no wonder if they inspired me with thoughts above my ordinary level and i am well satisfied that as they are incomparably the best subject i ever had excepting only the royal family so also that this i have written of them is much better than what i have performed on any other i have been forced to help out other arguments but this has been bountiful to me they have been low and barren of praise and i have exalted them and made them fruitful but hereomnia sponte suâ reddit justissima tellus i have had a large a fair and a pleasant field so fertile that without my cultivating it has given me two harvests in a summer and in both oppressed the reaper all other greatness in subjects is only counterfeit it will not endure the test of danger the greatness of arms is only real other greatness burdens a nation with its weight this supports it with its strength and as it is the happiness of the age so it is the peculiar goodness of the best of kings that we may praise his subjects without offending him doubtless it proceeds from a just confidence of his own virtue which the lustre of no other can be so great as to darken in him for the good or the valiant are never safely praised under a bad or a degenerate prince but to return from this digression to a further account of my poem i must crave leave to tell you that as i have endeavoured to adorn it with noble thoughts so much more to express those thoughts with elocution the composition of all poems is or ought to be of wit and wit in the poet or witwriting if you will give me leave to use a schooldistinction is no other than the faculty of imagination in the writer which like a nimble spaniel beats over and ranges through the field of memory till it springs the quarry it hunted after or without metaphor which searches over all the memory for the species or ideas of those things which it designs to represent wit written is that which is well designed the happy result of thought or product of imagination but to proceed from wit in the general notion of it to the proper wit of an heroic or historical poem i judge it chiefly to consist in the delightful imaging of persons actions passions or things it is not the jerk or sting of an epigram nor the seeming contradiction of a poor antithesis the delight of an illjudging audience in a play of rhyme nor the jingle of a more poor paronomasia neither is it so much the morality of a grave sentence affected by lucan but more sparingly used by virgil but it is some lively and apt description dressed in such colours of speech that it sets before your eyes the absent object as perfectly and more delightfully than nature so then the first happiness of the poets imagination is properly invention or finding of the thought the second is fancy or the variation deriving or moulding of that thought as the judgment represents it proper to the subject the third is elocution or the art of clothing and adorning that thought so found and varied in apt significant and sounding words the quickness of the imagination is seen in the invention the fertility in the fancy and the accuracy in the expression for the two first of these ovid is famous among the poets for the latter virgil ovid images more often the movements and affections of the mind either combating between two contrary passions or extremely discomposed by one his words therefore are the least part of his care for he pictures nature in disorder with which the study and choice of words is inconsistent this is the proper wit of dialogue or discourse and consequently of the drama where all that is said is to be supposed the effect of sudden thought which though it excludes not the quickness of wit in repartees yet admits not a too curious election of words too frequent allusions or use of tropes or in fine anything that shows remoteness of thought or labour in the writer on the other side virgil speaks not so often to us in the person of another like ovid but in his own he relates almost all things as from himself and thereby gains more liberty than the other to express his thoughts with all the graces of elocution to write more figuratively and to confess as well the labour as the force of his imagination though he describes his dido well and naturally in the violence of her passions yet he must yield in that to the myrrha the biblis the althæa of ovid for as great an admirer of him as i am i must acknowledge that if i see not more of their souls than i see of didos at least i have a greater concernment for them and that convinces me that ovid has touched those tender strokes more delicately than virgil could but when action or persons are to be described when any such image is to be set before us how bold how masterly are the strokes of virgil we see the objects he presents us with in their native figures in their proper motions but so we see them as our own eyes could never have beheld them so beautiful in themselves we see the soul of the poet like that universal one of which he speaks informing and moving through all his pictures     totamque infusa per artus   mens agitat molem et magno so corpore miscet   we behold him embellishing his images as he makes venus breathing beauty upon her son æneas      lumenque juventæ   purpureum et lætos oculis afflârat honores   quale manus addunt ebori decus aut ubi flavo   argentum pariusve lapis circundatur auro  see his tempest his funeral sports his combat of turnus and æneas and in his georgics which i esteem the divinest part of all his writings the plague the country the battle of the bulls the labour of the bees and those many other excellent images of nature most of which are neither great in themselves nor have any natural ornament to bear them up but the words wherewith he describes them are so excellent that it might be well applied to him which was said by ovid materiam superabat opus the very sound of his words has often somewhat that is connatural to the subject and while we read him we sit as in a play beholding the scenes of what he represents to perform this he made frequent use of tropes which you know change the nature of a known word by applying it to some other signification and this is it which horace means in his epistle to the pisos    dixeris egregiè notum si callida verbum   reddiderit junctura novum  but i am sensible i have presumed too far to entertain you with a rude discourse of that art which you both know so well and put into practice with so much happiness yet before i leave virgil i must own the vanity to tell you and by you the world that he has been my master in this poem i have followed him everywhere i know not with what success but i am sure with diligence enough my images are many of them copied from him and the rest are imitations of him my expressions also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would admit of in translation and this sir i have done with that boldness for which i will stand accountable to any of our little critics who perhaps are no better acquainted with him than i am upon your first perusal of this poem you have taken notice of some words which i have innovated if it be too bold for me to say refined upon his latin which as i offer not to introduce into english prose so i hope they are neither improper nor altogether inelegant in verse and in this horace will again defend me    et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si   græco fonte cadunt parcè detorta  the inference is exceeding plain for if a roman poet might have liberty to coin a word supposing only that it was derived from the greek was put into a latin termination and that he used this liberty but seldom and with modesty how much more justly may i challenge that privilege to do it with the same prerequisites from the best and most judicious of latin writers in some places where either the fancy or the words were his or any others i have noted it in the margin that i might not seem a plagiary in others i have neglected it to avoid as well tediousness as the affectation of doing it too often such descriptions or images well wrought which i promise not for mine are as i have said the adequate delight of heroic poesy for they beget admiration which is its proper object as the images of the burlesque which is contrary to this by the same reason beget laughter for the one shows nature beautified as in the picture of a fair woman which we all admire the other shows her deformed as in that of a lazar or of a fool with distorted face and antique gestures at which we cannot forbear to laugh because it is a deviation from nature but though the same images serve equally for the epic poesy and for the historic and panegyric which are branches of it yet a several sort of sculpture is to be used in them if some of them are to be like those of juvenal stantes in curribus æmiliani heroes drawn in their triumphal chariots and in their full proportion others are to be like that of virgil spirantia mollius oera there is somewhat more of softness and tenderness to be shown in them you will soon find i write not this without concern some who have seen a paper of verses which i wrote last year to her highness the duchess have accused them of that only thing i could defend in them they said i did humi serpere that i wanted not only height of fancy but dignity of words to set it off i might well answer with that of horace nunc non erat his locus i knew i addressed them to a lady and accordingly i affected the softness of expression and the smoothness of measure rather than the height of thought and in what i did endeavour it is no vanity to say i have succeeded i detest arrogance but there is some difference betwixt that and a just defence but i will not further bribe your candour or the readers i leave them to speak for me and if they can to make out that character not pretending to a greater which i have given them  and now sir it is time i should relieve you from the tedious length of this account you have better and more profitable employment for your hours and i wrong the public to detain you longer in conclusion i must leave my poem to you with all its faults which i hope to find fewer in the printing by your emendations i know you are not of the number of those of whom the younger pliny speaks nec sunt parum multi qui carpere amicos suos judicium vocant i am rather too secure of you on that side your candour in pardoning my errors may make you more remiss in correcting them if you will not withal consider that they come into the world with your approbation and through your hands i beg from you the greatest favour you can confer upon an absent person since i repose upon your management what is dearest to me my fame and reputation and therefore i hope it will stir you up to make my poem fairer by many of your blots if not you know the story of the gamester who married the rich mans daughter and when her father denied the portion christened all the children by his surname that if in conclusion they must beg they should do so by one name as well as by the other but since the reproach of my faults will light on you it is but reason i should do you that justice to the readers to let them know that if there be anything tolerable in this poem they owe the argument to your choice the writing to your encouragement the correction to your judgment and the care of it to your friendship to which he must ever acknowledge himself to owe all things who is sir the most obedient and most faithful of your servants  john dryden  from charlton in wiltshire nov  0                                                 in thriving arts long time had holland grown        crouching at home

halfclothed halfnaked hastily retire      and frighted mothers strike their breasts too late        for helpless infants left amidst the fire       their cries soon waken all the dwellers near

nightrobbers lift the wellstored hive      an humming through their waxen city grows        and out upon each others wings they drive       now streets grow throngd and busy as by day        some run for buckets to the hallowd quire      some cut the pipes and some the engines play        and some more bold mount ladders to the fire     0 in vain for from the east a belgian wind        his hostile

opens wide      he wades the streets and straight he reaches cross        and plays his longing flames on the other side       at first they warm then scorch and then they take        now with long

far off the cracks of falling houses ring        and shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast       near as he draws thick harbingers of smoke        with gloomy pillars cover all the place      whose little intervals of night are broke        by sparks that drive against his sacred face     0 more than his guards his sorrows made him known        and pious tears which down his cheeks did shower      the wretched in his grief forgot their own        so much the pity of a king has power       he wept the flames of what he loved so well        and what so well had merited his love      for never prince in grace did more excel        or royal city more in duty strove       nor with an idle care did he behold        subjects may grieve but monarchs must redress      he cheers the fearful and commends the bold        and makes despairers hope for good success       himself directs what first is to be done        and orders all the succours which they bring      the helpful and the good about him run        and form an army worthy such a king       he sees the dire contagion spread so fast        that where it seizes all relief is vain      and therefore must unwillingly lay waste        that country which would else the foe maintain       the powder blows up all before the fire        the amazèd flames stand gatherd on a heap      and from the precipices brink retire        afraid to venture on so large a leap       thus fighting fires a while themselves consume        but straight like turks forced on to win or die      they first lay tender bridges of their fume

 and climbing from below their fellows meet       thus to some desert plain or old woodside        dire nighthags come from far to dance their round      and oer broad rivers on their fiends they ride        or sweep in clouds above the blasted ground       no help avails for hydralike the fire        lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way      and scarce the wealthy can one half retire        before he rushes in to share the prey     0 the rich grow suppliant and the poor grow proud        those offer mighty gain and these ask more      so void of pity is the ignoble crowd        when others ruin may increase their store       as those who live by shores with joy behold        some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh      and from the rocks leap down for shipwreckd gold

on their backs the spoils of vulcan lade       the days were all in this lost labour spent        and when the weary king gave place to night      his beams he to his royal brother lent        and so shone still in his reflective light       night came but without darkness or repose        a dismal picture of the general doom      where souls distracted when the trumpet blows        and half unready with their bodies come       those who have homes when home they do repair        to a last lodging call their wandering friends      their short uneasy sleeps are broke with care        to look how near their own destruction tends       those who have none sit round where once it was        and with full eyes each wonted room require      haunting the yet warm ashes of the place        as murderd men walk where they did expire       some stir up coals and watch the vestal fire        others in vain from sight of ruin run      and while through burning labyrinths they retire        with loathing eyes repeat what they would shun       the most in fields like herded beasts lie down        to dews obnoxious on the grassy floor      and while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown        sad parents watch the remnants of their store       while by the motion of the flames they guess        what streets are burning now and what are near      an infant waking to the paps would

the fugitive flames chastised went forth to prey        on pious structures by our fathers reard      by which to heaven they did affect the way        ere faith in churchmen without works was heard       the wanting orphans saw with watery eyes        their founders charity in dust laid low      and sent to god their everanswered cries        for he protects the poor who made them so       nor

daring flames peepd in and saw from far        the awful beauties of the sacred quire      but since it was profaned by civil war        heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire       now down the narrow streets it swiftly came        and widely opening did on both sides prey      this benefit we sadly owe the flame        if only ruin must enlarge our way       and now four days the sun

his heart and eyes abound      to the allgood his lifted hands he folds        and thanks him low on his redeemed ground       as when sharp frosts had long constraind the earth        a kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain      and first the tender blade peeps up to birth        and straight the green fields laugh with promised grain       by such degrees the spreading gladness grew        in

and poets vainly strove   in every age the lumpish mass to move   but those were pedants when compared with these   who know not only to instruct but please   poets alone found the delightful way   mysterious morals gently to convey   in charming numbers so that as men grew   pleased with their poems they grew wiser too                       0   satire has always shone among the rest   and is the boldest way if not the best   to tell men freely of their foulest faults   to laugh at their vain deeds and vainer thoughts   in satire too the wise took different ways   to each deserving its

receive none the design i am sure is honest but he who draws his pen for one party must expect to make enemies of the other for wit and fool are consequence of whig and tory and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary side there is a treasury of merits in the fanatic church as well as in the popish and a pennyworth to be had of saintship honesty and poetry for the lewd the factious and the blockheads but the longest chapter in deuteronomy has not curses enough for an antibromingham my comfort is their manifest prejudice to my cause will render their judgment of less authority against me yet if a poem have genius it will force its own reception in the world for there is a sweetness in good verse which tickles even while it hurts and no man can be heartily angry with him who pleases him against his will the commendation  of adversaries is the greatest triumph of a writer because it never comes unless extorted but i can be satisfied on more easy terms if i happen to please the more moderate sort i shall be sure of an honest party and in all probability of the best judges for the least concerned are commonly the least corrupt and i confess i have laid in for those by rebating the satire where justice would allow it from carrying too sharp an edge they who can criticise so weakly as to imagine i have done my worst may be convinced at their own cost that i can write severely with more ease than i can gently i have but laughed at some mens follies when i could have declaimed against their vices and other mens virtues i have commended as freely as i have taxed their crimes and now if you are a malicious reader i expect you should return upon me that i affect to be thought more impartial than i am but if men are not to be judged by their professions god forgive you commonwealthsmen for professing so plausibly for the government you cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing my name for that would reflect too grossly upon your own party who never dare though they have the advantage of a jury to secure them if you like not my poem the fault may possibly be in my writing though it is hard for an author to judge against himself but more probably it is in your morals which cannot bear the truth of it the violent on both sides will condemn the character of absalom as either too favourably or too hardly drawn but they are not the violent whom i desire to please the fault on the right hand is to extenuate palliate and indulge and to confess freely i have endeavoured to commit it besides the respect which i owe his birth i have a greater for his heroic virtues and david himself could not be more tender of the young mans life than i would be of his reputation but since the most excellent natures are always the most easy and as being such are the soonest perverted by ill counsels especially when baited with fame and glory it is no more a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of achitophel than it was for adam not to have resisted the two devils the serpent and the woman the conclusion of the story i purposely forbore to prosecute because i could not obtain from myself to show absalom unfortunate the frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waist and if the draught be so far true it is as much as i designed  were i the inventor who am only the historian i should certainly conclude the piece with the reconcilement of absalom to david and who knows but this may come to pass things were not brought to an extremity where i left the story there seems yet to be room left for a composure hereafter there may be only for pity i have not so much as an uncharitable wish against achitophel but am content to be accused of a goodnatured error and to hope with origen that the devil himself may at last be saved for which reason in this poem he is neither brought to set his house in order nor to dispose of his person afterwards as he in wisdom shall think fit god is infinitely merciful and his vicegerent is only not so because he is not infinite  the true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction and he who writes honestly is no more an enemy to the offender than the physician to the patient when he prescribes harsh remedies to an inveterate disease for those are only in order to prevent the chirurgeons work of an ense rescindendum which i wish not to my very enemies to conclude all if the body politic have any analogy to the natural in my weak judgment an act of oblivion were as necessary in a hot distempered state as an opiate would be in a raging fever

            the medal     a satire against sedition   epistle to the whigs  for to whom can i dedicate this poem with so much justice as to you it is the representation of your own hero it is the picture drawn at length which you admire and prize so much in little none of your ornaments are wanting neither the landscape of your tower nor the rising sun nor the anno domini of your new sovereigns coronation this must needs be a grateful undertaking to your whole party especially to those who have not been so happy as to purchase the original i hear the graver has made a good market of it all his kings are bought up already or the value of the remainder so enhanced that many a poor polander who would be glad to worship the image is not able to go to the cost of him but must be content to see him here i must confess i am no great artist but signpost painting  will serve the turn to remember a friend by especially when better is not to be had yet for your comfort the lineaments are true and though he sat not five times to me as he did to b yet i have consulted history as the italian painters do when they would draw a nero or a caligula though they have not seen the man they can help their imagination by a statue of him and find out the colouring from suetonius and tacitus truth is you might have spared one side of your medal the head would be seen to more advantage if it were placed on a spike of the tower a little nearer to the sun which would then break out to better purpose  you tell us in your preface to the noprotestant plot   that you shall be forced hereafter to leave off your modesty i suppose you mean that little which is left you for it was worn to rags when you put out this medal never was there practised such a piece of notorious impudence in the face of an established government i believe when he is dead you will wear him in thumb rings as the turks did scanderbeg as if there were virtue in his bones to preserve you against monarchy yet all this while you pretend not only zeal for the public good but a due veneration for the person of the king but all men who can see an inch before them may easily detect those gross fallacies that it is necessary for men in your circumstances to pretend both is granted you for without them there could be no ground to raise a faction but i would ask you one civil question what right has any man among you or any association of men to come nearer to you who out of parliament cannot be considered in a public capacity to meet as you daily do in factious clubs to vilify the government in your discourses and to libel it in all your writings who made you judges in israel or how is it consistent with your zeal for the public welfare to promote sedition does your definition of loyal which is to serve the king according to the laws allow you the licence of traducing the executive power with which you own he is invested you complain that his majesty has lost the love and confidence of his people and by your very urging it you endeavour what in you lies to make him lose them all good subjects abhor the thought of arbitrary power whether it be in one or many if you were the patriots you would seem you would not at this rate incense the multitude to assume it for no sober man can fear it either from the kings disposition or his practice or even where you would odiously lay it from his ministers give us leave to enjoy the government and the benefit of laws under which we were born and which we desire to transmit to our posterity you are not the trustees of the public liberty and if you have not right to petition in a crowd much less have you to intermeddle in the management of affairs or to arraign what you do not like which in effect is everything that is done by the king and council can you imagine that any reasonable man will believe you respect the person of his majesty when it is apparent that your seditious pamphlets are stuffed with particular reflections on him if you have the confidence to deny this it is easy to be evinced from a thousand passages which i only forbear to quote because i desire they should die and be forgotten i have perused many of your papers and to show you that i have the third part of your noprotestant plot is much  of it stolen from your dead authors pamphlet called the growth of popery as manifestly as miltons defence of the english people is from buchanan de jure regni apud scotos or your first covenant and new association from the holy league of the french guisards any one who reads davila may trace your practices all along there were the same pretences for reformation and loyalty the same aspersions of the king and the same grounds of a rebellion i know not whether you will take the historians word who says it was reported that poltrot a huguenot murdered francis duke of guise by the instigations of theodore beza or that it was a huguenot minister otherwise called a presbyterian for our church abhors so devilish a tenet who first writ a treatise of the lawfulness of deposing and murdering kings of a different persuasion in religion but i am able to prove from the doctrine of calvin and principles of buchanan that they set the people above the magistrate which if i mistake not is your own fundamental and which carries your loyalty no further than your liking when a vote of the house of commons goes on your side you are as ready to observe it as if it were passed into a law but when you are pinched with any former and yet unrepealed act of parliament you declare that in some cases you will not be obliged by it the passage is in the same third part of the noprotestant plot and is too plain to be denied the late copy of your intended association you neither wholly justify nor condemn but as the papists when they are unopposed fly out into all the pageantries of worship but in times of war when they are hard pressed by arguments lie close intrenched behind the council of trent so now when your affairs are in a low condition you dare not pretend that to be a legal combination but whensoever you are afloat i doubt not but it will be maintained and justified to purpose for indeed there is nothing to defend it but the sword it is the proper time to say anything when men have all things in their power  in the mean time you would fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this association and that in the time of queen elizabeth   but there is this small difference betwixt them that the ends of one are directly opposite to the other one with the queens approbation and conjunction as head of it the other without either the consent or knowledge of the king against whose authority it is manifestly designed therefore you do well to have recourse to your last evasion that it was contrived by your enemies and shuffled into the papers that were seized which yet you see the nation is not so easy to believe as your own jury but the matter is not difficult to find twelve men in newgate who would acquit a malefactor  i have only one favour to desire of you at parting that when you think of answering this poem you would employ the same pens against it who have combated with so much success against absalom and achitophel for then you may assure yourselves of a clear victory without the least reply rail at me abundantly and not to break a custom do it without wit by this method you will gain a considerable point which is wholly to waive the answer of my arguments never own the bottom of your principles for fear they should be treason fall severely on the miscarriages of government for if scandal be  not allowed you are no freeborn subjects if god has not blessed you with the talent of rhyming make use of my poor stock and welcome let your verses run upon my feet and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads reduced to the last extremity of sense turn my own lines upon me and in utter despair of your own satire make me satirize myself some of you have been driven to this bay already but above all the rest commend me to the nonconformist parson who writ the whip and key i am afraid it is not read so much as the piece deserves because the bookseller is every week crying help at the end of his gazette to get it off you see i am charitable enough to do him a kindness that it may be published as well as printed and that so much skill in hebrew derivations may not lie for wastepaper in the shop yet i half suspect he went no further for his learning than the index of hebrew names and etymologies which is printed at the end of some english bibles if achitophel signifies the brother of a fool the author of that poem will pass with his readers for the next of kin and perhaps it is the relation that makes the kindness whatever the verses are buy them up i beseech you out of pity for i hear the conventicle is shut up and the brother   of achitophel out of service  now footmen you know have the generosity to make a purse for a member of their society who has had his livery pulled over his ears and even protestant socks are bought up among you out of veneration to the name a dissenter in poetry from sense and english will make as good a protestant rhymer as a dissenter from the church of england a protestant parson besides if you encourage a young beginner who knows but he may elevate his style a little above the vulgar epithets of profane and saucy jack and atheistic scribbler with which he treats me when the fit of enthusiasm is strong upon him by which wellmannered and charitable expressions i was certain of his sect before i knew his name what would you have more of a man he has damned me in your cause from genesis to the revelations and has half the texts of both the testaments against me if you will be so civil to yourselves as to take him for your interpreter and not to take them for irish witnesses after all perhaps you will tell me that you retained him only for the opening of your cause and that your main lawyer is yet behind now if it so happen he meet with no more reply than his predecessors you may either conclude that i trust to the goodness of my cause or fear my adversary or disdain him or what you please for the short of it is it is indifferent to your humble servant whatever your party says or thinks of him                                         of all our antic

which the handling of so serious a subject would not be expected may reasonably oblige the author to say somewhat in defence both of himself and of his undertaking in the first place if it be objected to me that being a layman i ought not to have concerned myself with speculations which belong to the profession of divinity i could answer that perhaps laymen with equal advantages of parts and knowledge are not the most incompetent judges of sacred things but in the due sense of my own weakness and want of learning i plead not this i pretend not to make myself a judge of faith in others but only to make a confession of my own i lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark but wait on it with the reverence that becomes me at a distance in the next place i will ingenuously confess that the helps i have used in this small treatise were many of them taken from the works of our own reverend divines of the church of england so that the weapons with which i combat irreligion are already consecrated though i suppose they may be taken down as lawfully as the sword of goliah was by david when they are to be employed for the common cause against the enemies of piety i intend not by this to entitle them to any of my errors which yet i hope are only those of charity to mankind and such as my own charity has caused me to commit that of others may more easily excuse being naturally inclined to scepticism in philosophy i have no reason to impose my opinions in a subject which is above it but whatever they are i submit them with all reverence to my mother church accounting them no farther mine than as they are authorised or at least uncondemned by her and indeed to secure myself on this side i have used the necessary precaution of showing this paper before it was published to a judicious and learned friend a man indefatigably zealous in the service of the church and state and whose writings have highly deserved of both he was pleased to approve the body of the discourse and i hope he is more my friend than to do it out of complaisance it is true he had too good a taste to like it all and amongst some other faults recommended to my second view what i have written perhaps too boldly on st athanasius which he advised me wholly to omit i am sensible enough that i had done more prudently to have followed his opinion but then i could not have satisfied myself that i had done honestly not to have written what was my own it has always been my thought that heathens who never did nor without miracle could hear of the name of christ were yet in a possibility of salvation neither will it enter easily into my belief that before the coming of our saviour the whole world excepting only the jewish nation should lie under the inevitable necessity of everlasting punishment for want of that revelation which was confined to so small a spot of ground as that of palestine among the sons of noah we read of one only who was accursed and if a blessing in the ripeness of time was reserved for japhet of whose progeny we are it seems unaccountable to me why so many generations of the same offspring as preceded our saviour in the flesh should be all involved in one common condemnation and yet that their posterity should be entitled to the hopes of salvation as if a bill of exclusion had passed only on the fathers which debarred not the sons from their succession or that so many ages had been delivered over to hell and so many reserved for heaven and that the devil had the first choice and god the next truly i am apt to think that the revealed religion which was taught by noah to all his sons might continue for some ages in the whole posterity that afterwards it was included wholly in the family of shem is manifest but when the progenies of ham and japhet swarmed into colonies and those colonies were subdivided into many others in process of time their descendants lost by little and little the primitive and purer rites of divine worship retaining only the notion of one deity to which succeeding generations added others for men took their degrees in those ages from conquerors to gods revelation being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind the light of nature as the next in dignity was substituted and that is it which st paul concludes to be the rule of the heathens and by which they are hereafter to be judged if my supposition be true then the consequence which i have assumed in my poem may be also true namely that deism or the principles of natural worship are only the faint remnants or dying flames of revealed religion in the posterity of noah and that our modern philosophersnay and some of our philosophising divineshave too much exalted the faculties of our souls when they have maintained that by their force mankind has been able to find out that there is one supreme agent or intellectual being which we call god that praise and prayer are his due worship and the rest of those deducements which i am confident are the remote effects of revelation and unattainable by our discourse i mean as simply considered and without the benefit of divine illumination so that we have not lifted up ourselves to god by the weak pinions of our reason but he has been pleased to descend to us and what socrates said of him what plato writ and the rest of the heathen philosophers of several nations is all no more than the twilight of revelation after the sun of it was set in the race of noah that there is something above us some principle of motion our reason can apprehend though it cannot discover what it is by its own virtue and indeed it is very improbable that we who by the strength of our faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any being not so much as of our own should be able to find out by them that supreme nature which we cannot otherwise define than by saying it is infinite as if infinite were definable or infinity a subject for our narrow understanding they who would prove religion by reason do but weaken the cause which they endeavour to support it is to take away the pillars from our faith and to prop it only with a twig it is to design a tower like that of babel which if it were possible as it is not to reach heaven would come to nothing by the confusion of the workmen for every man is building a several way impotently conceited of his own model and his own materials reason is always striving and always at a loss and of necessity it must so come to pass while it is exercised about that which is not its own proper object let us be content at last to know god by his own methods at least so much of him as he is pleased to reveal to us in the sacred scriptures to apprehend them to be the word of god is all our reason has to do for all beyond it is the work of faith which is the seal of heaven impressed upon our human understanding  and now for what concerns the holy bishop athanasius the preface of whose creed seems inconsistent with my opinion which is that heathens may possibly be saved in the first place i desire it may be considered that it is the preface only not the creed itself which till i am better informed is of too hard a digestion for my charity it is not that i am ignorant how many several texts of scripture seemingly support that cause but neither am i ignorant how all those texts may receive a kinder and more mollified interpretation every man who is read in church history knows that belief was drawn up after a long contestation with arius concerning the divinity of our blessed saviour and his being one substance with the father and that thus compiled it was sent abroad among the christian churches as a kind of test which whosoever took was looked upon as an orthodox believer it is manifest from hence that the heathen part of the empire was not concerned in it for its business was not to distinguish betwixt pagans and christians but betwixt heretics and true believers this well considered takes off the heavy weight of censure which i would willingly avoid from so venerable a man for if this proportion whosoever will be saved be restrained only to those to whom it was intended and for whom it was composed i mean the christians then the anathema reaches not the heathens who had never heard of christ and were nothing interested in that dispute after all i am far from blaming even that prefatory addition to the creed and as far from cavilling at the continuation of it in the liturgy of the church where on the days appointed it is publicly read for i suppose there is the same reason for it now in opposition to the socinians as there was then against the arians the one being a heresy which seems to have been refined out of the other and with how much more plausibility of reason it combats our religion with so much more caution it ought to be avoided therefore the prudence of our church is to be commended which has interposed her authority for the recommendation of this creed yet to such as are grounded in the true belief those explanatory creeds the nicene and this of athanasius might perhaps be spared for what is supernatural will always be a mystery in spite of exposition and for my own part the plain apostles creed is most suitable to my weak understanding as the simplest diet is the most easy of digestion  i have dwelt longer on this subject than i intended and longer than perhaps i ought for having laid down as my foundation that the scripture is a rule that in all things needful to salvation it is clear sufficient and ordained by god almighty for that purpose i have left myself no right to interpret obscure places such as concern the possibility of eternal happiness to heathens because whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary to be known  but by asserting the scripture to be the canon of oar faith i have unavoidably created to myself two sorts of enemies the papists indeed more directly because they have kept the scriptures from us what they could and have reserved to themselves a right of interpreting what they have delivered under the pretence of infallibility and the fanatics more collaterally because they have assumed what amounts to an infallibility in the private spirit and have detorted those texts of scripture which are not necessary to salvation to the damnable uses of sedition disturbance and destruction of the civil government to begin with the papists and to speak freely i think them the less dangerous at least in appearance to our present state for not only the penal laws are in force against them and their number is contemptible but also their peers and commons are excluded from parliament and consequently those laws in no probability of being repealed a general and uninterrupted plot of their clergy ever since the reformation i suppose all protestants believe for it is not reasonable to think but that so many of their orders as were outed from their fat possessions would endeavour a reentrance against those whom they account heretics as for the late design mr colemans letters for aught i know are the best evidence and what they discover without wiredrawing their sense or malicious glosses all men of reason conclude credible if there be anything more than this required of me i must believe it as well as i am able in spite of the witnesses and out of a decent conformity to the votes of parliament for i suppose the fanatics will not allow the private spirit in this case here the infallibility is at least in one part of the government and our understandings as well as our wills are represented but to return to the roman catholics how can we be secure from the practice of jesuited papists in that religion for not two or three of that order as some of them would impose upon us but almost the whole body of them are of opinion that their infallible master has a right over kings not only in spirituals but temporals not to name mariana bellarmine emanuel sa molina santare simancha   and at least twenty others of foreign countries we can produce of our own nation campian and doleman or parsons besides many are named whom i have not read who all of them attest this doctrine that the pope can depose and give away the right of any sovereign prince si vel paulum deflexerit if he shall never so little warp but if he once comes to be excommunicated then the bond of obedience is taken off from subjects and they may and ought to drive him like another nebuchadnezzar ex hominum christianorum dominatu from exercising dominion over christians and to this they are bound by virtue of divine precept and by all the ties of conscience under no less penalty than damnation if they answer me as a learned priest has lately written that this doctrine of the jesuits is not de fide and that consequently they are not obliged by it they must pardon me if i think they have said nothing to the purpose for it is a maxim in their church where points of faith are not decided and that doctors are of contrary opinions they may follow which part they please but more safely the most received and most authorised and their champion bellarmine has told the world in his apology that the king of england is a vassal to the pope ratione directi domini and that he holds in villanage of his roman landlord which is no new claim put in for england our chronicles are his authentic witnesses that king john was deposed by the same plea and philip augustus admitted tenant and which makes the more for bellarmine the french king was again ejected when our king submitted to the church and the crown was received under the sordid condition of a vassalage  it is not sufficient for the more moderate and wellmeaning papists of which i doubt not there are many to produce the evidences of their loyalty to the late king and to declare their innocency in this plot i will grant their behaviour in the first to have been as loyal and as brave as they desire and will be willing to hold them excused as to the second i mean when it comes to my turn and after my betters for it is a madness to be sober alone while the nation continues drank but that saying of their father cres is still running in my head that they may be dispensed with in their obedience to an heretic prince while the necessity of the times shall oblige them to it for that as another of them tells us is only the effect of christian prudence but when once they shall get power to shake him off an heretic is no lawful king and consequently to rise against him is no rebellion i should be glad therefore that they would follow the advice which was charitably given them by a reverend prelate of our church namely that they would join in a public act of disowning and detesting those jesuitic principles and subscribe to all doctrines which deny the popes authority of deposing kings and releasing subjects from their oath of allegiance to which i should think they might easily be induced if it be true that this present pope has condemned the doctrine of kingkilling a thesis of the jesuits maintained amongst others ex cathedra as they call it or in open consistory  leaving them therefore in so fair a way if they please themselves of satisfying all reasonable men of their sincerity and good meaning to the government i shall make bold to consider that other extreme of our religioni mean the fanatics or schismatics of the english church since the bible has been translated into our tongue they have used it so as if their business was not to be saved but to be damned by its contents if we consider only them better had it been for the english nation that it had still remained in the original greek and hebrew or at least in the honest latin of st jerome than that several texts in it should have been prevaricated to the destruction of that government which put it into so ungrateful hands  how many heresies the first translation of tindal produced in few years let my lord herberts history of henry viii inform you insomuch that for the gross errors in it and the great mischiefs it occasioned a sentence passed on the first edition of the bible too shameful almost to be repeated after the short reign of edward vi who had continued to carry on the reformation on other principles than it was begun every one knows that not only the chief promoters of that work but many others whose consciences would not dispense with popery were forced for fear of persecution to change climates from whence returning at the beginning of queen elizabeths reign many of them who had been in france and at geneva brought back the rigid opinions and imperious discipline of calvin to graft upon our reformation which though they cunningly concealed at first as well knowing how nauseously that drug would go down in a lawful monarchy which was prescribed for a rebellious commonwealth yet they always kept it in reserve and were never wanting to themselves either in court or parliament when either they had any prospect of a numerous party of fanatic members of the one or the encouragement of any favourite in the other whose covetousness was gaping at the patrimony of the church they who will consult the works of our venerable hooker or the account of his life or more particularly the letter written to him on this subject by george cranmer may see by what gradations they proceeded from the dislike of cap and surplice the very next step was admonitions to the parliament against the whole government ecclesiastical then came out volumes in english and latin in defence of their tenets and immediately practices were set on foot to erect their discipline without authority those not succeeding satire and railing was the next and martin marprelate the marvel of those times was the first presbyterian scribbler who sanctified libels and scurrility to the use of the good old cause which was done says my author upon this account that their serious treatises having been fully answered and refuted they might compass by railing what they had lost by reasoning and when their cause was sunk in court and parliament they might at least hedge in a stake amongst the rabble for to their ignorance all things are wit which are abusive but if church and state were made the theme then the doctoral degree of wit was to be taken at billingsgate even the most saintlike of the party though they durst not excuse this contempt and vilifying of the government yet were pleased and grinned at it with a pious smile and called it a judgment of god against the hierarchy thus sectaries we may see were born with teeth foulmouthed and scurrilous from their infancy and if spiritual pride venom violence contempt of superiors and slander had been the marks of orthodox belief the presbytery and the rest of our schismatics which are their spawn were always the most visible church in the christian world  it is true the government was too strong at that time for a rebellion but to show what proficiency they had made in calvins school even then their mouths watered at it for two of their gifted brotherhood hacket   and coppinger as the story tells us got up into a peasecart and harangue the people to dispose them to an insurrection and to establish their discipline by force so that however it comes about that now they celebrate queen elizabeths birthnight as that of their saint and patroness yet then they were for doing the work of the lord by arms against her and in all probability they wanted but a fanatic lord mayor and two sheriffs of their party to have compassed it  our venerable hooker after many admonitions which he had given them towards the end of his preface breaks out into this prophetic speech there is in every one of these considerations most just cause to fear lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence meaning the presbyterian discipline should cause posterity to feel those evils which as yet are more easy for us to prevent than they would be for them to remedy  how fatally this cassandra has foretold we know too well by sad experience the seeds were sown in the time of queen elizabeth the bloody harvest ripened in the reign of king charles the martyr and because all the sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some of the loose grains another crop is too like to follow nay i fear it is unavoidable if the conventiclers be permitted still to scatter  a man may be suffered to quote an adversary to our religion when he speaks truth and it is the observation of maimbourg in his history of calvinism that wherever that discipline was planted and embraced rebellion civil war and misery attended it and how indeed should it happen otherwise reformation of church and state has always been the ground of our divisions in england while we were papists our holy father rid us by pretending authority out of the scriptures to depose princes when we shook off his authority the sectaries furnished themselves with the same weapons and out of the same magazine the bible so that the scriptures which are in themselves the greatest security of governors as commanding express obedience to them are now turned to their destruction and never since the reformation has there wanted a text of their interpreting to authorise a rebel and it is to be noted by the way that the doctrines of kingkilling and deposing which have been taken up only by the worst party of the papists the most frontless flatterers of the popes authority have been espoused defended and are still maintained by the whole body of nonconformists and republicans it is but dubbing themselves the people of god which it is the interest of their preachers to tell them they are and their own interest to believe and after that they cannot dip into the bible but one text or another will turn up for their purpose if they are under persecution as they call it then that is a mark of their election if they flourish then god works miracles for their deliverance and the saints are to possess the earth  they may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this paper but i who know best how far i could have gone on this subject must be bold to tell them they are spared though at the same time i am not ignorant that they interpret the mildness of a writer to them as they do the mercy of the government in the one they think it fear and conclude it weakness in the other the best way for them to confute me is as i before advised the papists to disclaim their principles and renounce their practices we shall all be glad to think them true englishmen when they obey the king and true protestants when they conform to the church discipline  it remains that i acquaint the reader that these verses were written for an ingenious young gentleman   my friend upon his translation of the critical history of the old testament composed by the learned father simon the verses therefore are addressed to the translator of that work and the style of them is what it ought to be epistolary  if any one be so lamentable a critic as to require the smoothness the numbers and the turn of heroic poetry in this poem i must tell him that if he has not read horace i have studied him and hope the style of his epistles is not ill imitated here the expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural and yet majestic for here the poet is presumed to be a kind of lawgiver and those three qualities which i have named are proper to the legislative style the florid elevated and figurative way is for the passions for love and hatred fear and anger are begotten in the soul by showing their objects out of their true proportion either greater than the life or less but instruction is to be given by showing them what they naturally are a man is to be cheated into passion but to be reasoned into truth                                         dim as the borrowd beams of moon and stars   to lonely weary wandering

much as fair quarter from a reader of the opposite party all men are engaged either on this side or that and though conscience is the common word which is given by both yet if a writer fall among enemies and cannot give the marks of their conscience he is knocked down before the reasons of his own are heard a preface therefore which is but a bespeaking of favour is altogether useless what i desire the reader should know concerning me he will find in the body of the poem if he have but the patience to peruse it only this advertisement let him take beforehand which relates to the merits of the cause no general characters of parties call them either sects or churches can be so fully and exactly drawn as to comprehend all the several members of them at least all such as are received under that denomination for example there are some of the church by law established who envy not liberty of conscience to dissenters as being well satisfied that according to their own principles they ought not to persecute them yet these by reason of their fewness i could not distinguish from the numbers of the rest with whom they are embodied in one common name on the other side there are many of our sects and more indeed than i could reasonably have hoped who have withdrawn themselves from the communion of the panther and embraced this gracious indulgence of his majesty in point of toleration but neither to the one nor the other of these is this satire any way intended it is aimed only at the refractory and disobedient on either side for those who are come over to the royal party are consequently supposed to be out of gunshot our physicians have observed that in process of time some diseases have abated of their virulence and have in a manner worn out their malignity so as to be no longer mortal and why may not i suppose the same concerning some of those who have formerly been enemies to kingly government as well as catholic religion i hope they have now another notion of both as having found by comfortable experience that the doctrine of persecution is far from being an article of our faith  it is not for any private man to censure the proceedings of a foreign prince but without suspicion of flattery i may praise our own who has taken contrary measures and those more suitable to the spirit of christianity some of the dissenters in their addresses to his majesty have said that he has restored god to his empire over conscience i confess i dare not stretch the figure to so great a boldness but i may safely say that conscience is the royalty and prerogative of every private man he is absolute in his own breast and accountable to no earthly power for that which passes only betwixt god and him those who are driven into the fold are generally speaking rather made hypocrites than converts  this indulgence being granted to all the sects it ought in reason to be expected that they should both receive it and receive it thankfully for at this time of day to refuse the benefit and adhere to those whom they have esteemed their persecutors what is it else but publicly to own that they suffered not before for consciencesake but only out of pride and obstinacy to separate from a church for those impositions which they now judge may be lawfully obeyed after they have so long contended for their classical ordination not to speak of rites and ceremonies will they at length submit to an episcopal if they can go so far out of complaisance to their old enemies methinks a little reason should persuade them to take another step and see whither that would lead them  of the receiving this toleration thankfully i shall say no more than that they ought and i doubt not they will consider from what hand they received it it is not from a cyrus a heathen prince and a foreigner but from a christian king their native sovereign who expects a return in specie from them that the kindness which he has graciously shown them may be retaliated on those of his own persuasion  as for the poem in general i will only thus far satisfy the reader that it was neither imposed on me nor so much as the subject given me by any man it was written during the last winter and the beginning of this spring though with long interruptions of ill health and other hindrances about a fortnight before i had finished it his majestys declaration for liberty of conscience came abroad which if i had so soon expected i might have spared myself the labour of writing many things which are contained in the third part of it but i was always in some hope that the church of england might have been persuaded to have taken off the penal laws and the test which was one design of the poem when i proposed to myself the writing of it  it is evident that some part of it was only occasional and not first intended i mean that defence of myself to which every honest man is bound when he is injuriously attacked in print and i refer myself to the judgment of those who have read the answer to the defence of the late kings papers and that of the duchess in which last i was concerned how charitably i have been represented there i am now informed both of the author and supervisors of this pamphlet and will reply when i think he can affront me for i am of socratess opinion that all creatures cannot in the mean time let him consider whether he deserved not a more severe reprehension than i gave him formerly for using so little respect to the memory of those whom he pretended to answer and at his leisure look out for some original treatise of humility written by any protestant in english i believe i may say in any other tongue for the magnified piece of duncomb on that subject which either he must mean or none and with which another of his fellows has upbraided me was translated from the spanish of rodriguez though with the omission of the seventeenth the twentyfourth the twentyfifth and the last chapter which will be found in comparing of the books  he would have insinuated to the world that her late highness died not a roman catholic he declares himself to be now satisfied to the contrary in which he has given up the cause for matter of fact was the principal debate betwixt us in the mean time he would dispute the motives of her change how preposterously let all men judge when he seemed to deny the subject of the controversy the change itself and because i would not take up this ridiculous challenge he tells the world i cannot argue but he may as well infer that a catholic cannot fast because he will not take up the cudgels against mrs james to confute the protestant religion  i have but one word more to say concerning the poem as such and abstracting from the matters either religious or civil which are handled in it the first part consisting most in general characters and narration i have endeavoured to raise and give it the majestic turn of heroic poesy the second being matter of dispute and chiefly concerning church authority i was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly i could yet not wholly neglecting the numbers though i had not frequent occasions for the magnificence of verse the third which has more of the nature of domestic conversation is or ought to be more free and familiar than the two former  there are in it two episodes or fables which are interwoven with the main design so that they are properly parts of it though they are also distinct stories of themselves in both of these i have made use of the commonplaces of satire whether true or false which are urged by the members of the one church against the other at which i hope no reader of either party will be scandalized because they are not of my invention but as old to my knowledge as the times of boccace and chaucer on the one side and as those of the reformation on the other                                        part i    a milkwhite hind immortal and unchanged   fed on the lawns and in the forest

 but shunning long disputes i fain would see   that wondrous wight infallibility   is he from heaven this mighty champion come   or lodged below in subterranean rome   first seat him somewhere and derive his race   or else conclude that nothing has no place     suppose though i disown it said the hind                         0   the certain mansion were not yet assignd   the doubtful residence no proof can bring   against the plain existence of the thing   because philosophers may disagree   if sight by emission or reception be   shall it be thence inferrd i do not see   but you require an answer positive   which yet when i demand you dare not give   for fallacies in universals live   i then affirm that this unfailing guide                              0   in pope and general councils must reside   both lawful both combined what one decrees   by numerous votes the other ratifies   on this undoubted sense the church relies   tis true some doctors in a scantier space   i mean in each apart contract the place   some who to greater length extend the line   the churchs afteracceptation join   this last circumference appears too wide   the church diffused is by the council tied                          0   as members by their representatives   obliged to laws which prince and senate gives   thus some contract and some enlarge the space   in pope and council who denies the place   assisted from above with gods unfailing grace   those canons all the needful points contain   their sense so obvious and their words so plain   that no disputes about the doubtful text   have hitherto the labouring world perplexd   if any should in aftertimes appear                                00   new councils must be calld to make the meaning clear   because in them the power supreme resides   and all the promises are to the guides   this may be taught with sound and safe defence   but mark how sandy is your own pretence   who setting councils pope and church aside   are every man his own presuming guide   the sacred books you say are full and plain   and every needful point of truth contain   all who can read interpreters may be                                0   thus though your several churches disagree   yet every saint has to himself alone   the secret of this philosophic stone   these principles your jarring sects unite   when differing doctors and disciples fight   though luther zuinglius calvin holy chiefs   have made a battle royal of beliefs   or like wild horses several ways have whirld   the tortured text about the christian world   each jehu lashing on with furious force                             0   that turk or jew could not have used it worse   no matter what dissension leaders make   where every private man may save a stake   ruled by the scripture and his own advice   each has a blind bypath to paradise   where driving in a circle slow or fast   opposing sects are sure to meet at last   a wondrous charity you have in store   for all reformd to pass the narrow door   so much that mahomet had scarcely more                             0   for he kind prophet was for damning none   but christ and moses were to save their own

misjoins the sacred body with the bread   yet lady still remember i maintain   the word in needful points is only plain     needless or needful i not now contend   for still you have a loophole for a friend   rejoind the matron but the rule you lay   has led whole flocks and leads them still astray   in weighty points and full damnations way   for did not arius first socinus now                                0   the sons eternal godhead disavow   and did not these by gospel texts alone   condemn our doctrine and maintain their own   have not all heretics the same pretence   to plead the scriptures in their own defence   how did the nicene council then decide   that strong debate was it by scripture tried   no sure to that the rebel would not yield   squadrons of texts he marshalld in the field   that was but civil war an equal set                                0   where piles with piles    and eagles eagles met   with texts pointblank and plain he faced the foe   and did not satan tempt our saviour so   the good old bishops took a simpler way   each askd but what he heard his father say   or how he was instructed in his youth   and by traditions force upheld the truth     the panther smiled at this and when said she   were those first councils disallowd by me   or where did i at sure tradition strike                             0   provided still it were apostolic     friend said the hind you quit your former ground   where all your faith you did on scripture found   now tis tradition joind with holy writ   but thus your memory betrays your wit     no said the panther for in that i view   when your traditions forged and when tis true   i set them by the rule and as they square   or deviate from undoubted doctrine there   this oral fiction that old faith declare                           0     hind the council steerd it seems a different course   they tried the scripture by traditions force   but you tradition by the scripture try   pursued by sects from this to that you fly   nor dare on one foundation to rely   the word is then deposed and in this view   you rule the scripture not the scripture you   thus said the dame and smiling thus pursued   i see tradition then is disallowd   when not evinced by scripture to be true                            0   and scripture as interpreted by you   but here you tread upon unfaithful ground   unless you could infallibly expound   which you reject as odious popery   and throw that doctrine back with scorn on me   suppose we on things traditive divide   and both appeal to scripture to decide   by various texts we both uphold our claim   nay often ground our titles on the same   after long labour lost and times expense                         00   both grant the words and quarrel for the sense   thus all disputes for ever must depend   for no dumb rule can controversies end   thus when you said tradition must be tried   by sacred writ whose sense yourselves decide   you said no more but that yourselves must be   the judges of the scripture sense not we   against our churchtradition you declare   and yet your clerks would sit in moses chair   at least tis proved against your argument                          0   the rule is far from plain where all dissent      if not by scriptures how can we be sure   replied the panther what traditions pure   for you may palm upon us new for old   all as they say that glitters is not gold      how but by following her replied the dame   to whom derived from sire to son they came   where every age does on another move   and trusts no farther than the next above   where all the rounds like jacobs ladder rise                       0   the lowest hid in earth the topmost in the skies      sternly the savage did her answer mark   her glowing eyeballs glittering in the dark   and said but this since lucre was your trade   succeeding times such dreadful gaps have made   tis dangerous climbing to your sons and you   i leave the ladder and its omen too      hind the panthers breath was ever famed for sweet   but from the wolf such wishes oft i meet   you learnd this language from the blatant beast                    0   or rather did not speak but were possessd   as for your answer tis but barely urged   you must evince tradition to be forged   produce plain proofs unblemishd authors use   as ancient as those ages they accuse   till when tis not sufficient to defame   an old possession stands till elder quits the claim   then for our interest which is named alone   to load with envy we retort your own   for when traditions in your faces fly                               0   resolving not to yield you must decry   as when the cause goes hard the guilty man   excepts and thins his jury all he can   so when you stand of other aid bereft   you to the twelve apostles would be left   your friend the wolf did with more craft provide   to set those toys traditions quite aside   and fathers too unless when reason spent   he cites them but sometimes for ornament   but madam panther you though more sincere                        0   are not so wise as your adulterer   the private spirit is a better blind   than all the dodging tricks your authors find   for they who left the scripture to the crowd   each for his own peculiar judge allowd   the way to please them was to make them proud   thus with full sails they ran upon the shelf   who could suspect a cozenage from himself   on his own reason safer tis to stand   than be deceived and damnd at secondhand                          0   but you who fathers and traditions take   and garble some and some you quite forsake   pretending churchauthority to fix   and yet some grains of private spirit mix   are like a mule made up of differing seed   and thats the reason why you never breed   at least not propagate your kind abroad   for home dissenters are by statutes awed   and yet they grow upon you every day   while you to speak the best are at a stay                         0   for sects that are extremes abhor a middle way   like tricks of state to stop a raging flood   or mollify a madbraind senates mood   of all expedients never one was good   well may they argue nor can you deny   if we must fix on church authority   best on the best the fountain not the flood   that must be better still if this be good   shall she command who has herself rebelld   is antichrist by antichrist expelld                                0   did we a lawful tyranny displace   to set aloft a bastard of the race   why all these wars to win the book if we   must not interpret for ourselves but she   either be wholly slaves or wholly free   for purging fires traditions must not fight   but they must prove episcopacys right   thus those led horses are from service freed   you never mount them but in time of need   like mercenaries hired for home defence                            0   they will not serve against their native prince   against domestic foes of hierarchy   these are drawn forth to make fanatics fly   but when they see their countrymen at hand   marching against them under churchcommand   straight they forsake their colours and disband     thus she nor could the panther well enlarge   with weak defence against so strong a charge   but said for what did christ his word provide   if still his church must want a living guide                       00   and if all saving doctrines are not there   or sacred penmen could not make them clear   from after ages we should hope in vain   for truths which men inspired could not explain     before the word was written said the hind   our saviour preachd his faith to human kind   from his apostles the first age received   eternal truth and what they taught believed   thus by tradition faith was planted first   succeeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed                         0   this was the way our wise redeemer chose   who sure could all things for the best dispose   to fence his fold from their encroaching foes   he could have writ himself but well foresaw   the event would be like that of moses law   some difference would arise some doubts remain   like those which yet the jarring jews maintain   no written laws can be so plain so pure   but wit may gloss and malice may obscure   not those indited by his first command                              0   a prophet graved the text an angel held his hand   thus faith was ere the written word appeard   and men believed not what they read but heard   but since the apostles could not be confined   to these or those but severally designd   their large commission round the world to blow   to spread their faith they spread their labours too   yet still their absent flock their pains did share   they hearkend still for love produces care   and as mistakes arose or discords fell                            0   or bold seducers taught them to rebel   as charity grew cold or faction hot   or long neglect their lessons had forgot   for all their wants they wisely did provide   and preaching by epistles was supplied   so great physicians cannot all attend   but some they visit and to some they send   yet all those letters were not writ to all   nor first intended but occasional   their absent sermons nor if they contain                            0   all needful doctrines are those doctrines plain   clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought   they writ but seldom but they daily taught   and what one saint has said of holy paul   he darkly writ is true applied to all   for this obscurity could heaven provide   more prudently than by a living guide   as doubts arose the difference to decide   a guide was therefore needful therefore made   and if appointed sure to be obeyd                                0   thus with due reverence to the apostles writ   by which my sons are taught to which submit   i think those truths their sacred works contain   the church alone can certainly explain   that following ages leaning on the past   may rest upon the primitive at last   nor would i thence the word no rule infer   but none without the churchinterpreter   because as i have urged before tis mute   and is itself the subject of dispute                                0   but what the apostles their successors taught   they to the next from them to us is brought   the undoubted sense which is in scripture sought   from hence the church is armd when errors rise   to stop their entrance and prevent surprise   and safe entrenchd within her foes without defies   by these all festering sores her councils heal   which time or has disclosed or shall reveal   for discord cannot end without a last appeal   nor can a council national decide                                   0   but with subordination to her guide   i wish the cause were on that issue tried   much less the scripture for suppose debate   betwixt pretenders to a fair estate   bequeathd by some legators last intent   such is our dying saviours testament   the will is proved is opend and is read   the doubtful heirs their differing titles plead   all vouch the words their interest to maintain   and each pretends by those his cause is plain                       0   shall then the testament award the right   no thats the hungary for which they fight   the field of battle subject of debate   the thing contended for the fair estate   the sense is intricate tis only clear   what vowels and what consonants are there   therefore tis plain its meaning must be tried   before some judge appointed to decide      suppose the fair apostate said i grant   the faithful flock some living guide should want                    0   your arguments an endless chase pursue   produce this vaunted leader to our view   this mighty moses of the chosen crew      the dame who saw her fainting foe retired   with force renewd to victory aspired   and looking upward to her kindred sky   as once our saviour ownd his deity   pronounced his wordsshe whom ye seek am i   nor less amazed this voice the panther heard   than were those jews to hear a god declared                        00   then thus the matron modestly renewd   let all your prophets and their sects be viewd   and see to which of them yourselves think fit   the conduct of your conscience to submit   each proselyte would vote his doctor best   with absolute exclusion to the rest   thus would your polish diet disagree   and end as it began in anarchy   yourself the fairest for election stand   because you seem crowngeneral of the land                          0   but soon against your superstitious lawn   some presbyterian sabre would be drawn   in your establishd laws of sovereignty   the rest some fundamental flaw would see   and call rebellion gospelliberty   to churchdecrees your articles require   submission modified if not entire   homage denied to censures you proceed   but when curtana    will not do the deed   you lay that pointless clergyweapon by                             0   and to the laws your sword of justice fly   now this your sects the more unkindly take   those prying varlets hit the blots you make   because some ancient friends of yours declare   your only rule of faith the scriptures are   interpreted by men of judgment sound   which every sect will for themselves expound   nor think less reverence to their doctors due   for sound interpretation than to you   if then by able heads are understood                               0   your brother prophets who reformd abroad   those able heads expound a wiser way   that their own sheep their shepherd should obey   but if you mean yourselves are only sound   that doctrine turns the reformation round   and all the rest are false reformers found   because in sundry points you stand alone   not in communion joind with any one   and therefore must be all the church or none   then till you have agreed whose judge is best                      0   against this forced submission they protest   while sound and sound a different sense explains   both play at hardhead till they break their brains   and from their chairs each others force defy   while unregarded thunders vainly fly   i pass the rest because your church alone   of all usurpers best could fill the throne   but neither you nor any sect beside   for this high office can be qualified   with necessary gifts required in such a guide                       0   for that which must direct the whole must be   bound in one bond of faith and unity   but all your several churches disagree   the consubstantiating church and priest   refuse communion to the calvinist   the french reformd from preaching you restrain   because you judge their ordination vain   and so they judge of yours but donors must ordain   in short in doctrine or in discipline   not one reformd can with another join                              0   but all from each as from damnation fly   no union they pretend but in nonpopery   nor should their members in a synod meet   could any church presume to mount the seat   above the rest their discords to decide   none would obey but each would be the guide   and face to face dissensions would increase   for only distance now preserves the peace   all in their turns accusers and accused   babel was never half so much confused                               0   what one can plead the rest can plead as well   for amongst equals lies no last appeal   and all confess themselves are fallible   now since you grant some necessary guide   all who can err are justly laid aside   because a trust so sacred to confer                                      shows want of such a sure interpreter   and how can he be needful who can err   then granting that unerring guide we want   that such there is you stand obliged to grant                       0   our saviour else were wanting to supply   our needs and obviate that necessity   it then remains the church can only be   the guide which owns unfailing certainty   or else you slip your hold and change your side   relapsing from a necessary guide   but this annexd condition of the crown   immunity from errors you disown   here then you shrink and lay your weak pretensions down   for petty royalties you raise debate                                0   but this unfailing universal state   you shun nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight   and for that cause those promises detest   with which our saviour did his church invest   but strive to evade and fear to find them true   as conscious they were never meant to you   all which the mother church asserts her own   and with unrivalld claim ascends the throne   so when of old the almighty father sate   in council to redeem our ruind state                             00   millions of millions at a distance round   silent the sacred consistory crownd   to hear what mercy mixd with justice could propound   all prompt with eager pity to fulfil   the full extent of their creators will   but when the stern conditions were declared   a mournful whisper through the host was heard   and the whole hierarchy with heads hung
