the town before you a comedy as acted at the theater royal covent garden  by mrs cowley  london printed by g woodfall for t n longman paternosterrow        to mrs frushard calcutta madam i seldom write dedications whenever i have written one it has been from an impulse of veneration or of tender gratitude the belles stratagem i dedicated to her majesty the town before you is dedicated to you  the virtues which you practice in your elegant pavilions at gassary have reached the british shores their reputation now echoes back again to those of the ganges and i would persuade myself that i may be the cause of extending it still farther yes i would hope that this humble pen may speak to those of after times and tell them that you quietly perform such acts of graceful goodness as open a thousand mouths in your praise whilst you persuade yourself that all is secret and that no one finds you out to be more amiable and respected than the generality of human creatures  this self deception is a little helped on by him to whom of all earthly beings you are bound to look up he aids your charming impositions  he assists you in fixing fetters of gratitude on all around you and then persuades himself and you that heaven alone is privy to the deed but you could not hope always to go on in this sort of concealment  at length you are unveiled  i am unable to measure the extent of my private obligations to you but may this public acknowledgement of them convince you that they throb in my heart and that i must be  ever madam your faithfully devoted h cowley  preface the following is rather the comedy which the public have chosen it to be than the comedy which i intended some things have been left out and some have been added since the first representation in short the comedy has been new classd  it has been torn from its genus  it is hoped however that there may be found characters in the town before you to interest and situations to attach and that those events which were vivacity in the theater will not be dullness in the closet  but it must be noticed that the scene in the second act between tippy and his landlady and that in the fifth act between tippy and the bailiff were no part of my original design they were written during the illness of mrs pope after the piece had been played several nights alas i am sorry to remark that no scenes in the comedy to use the stage idiom go off better  an acute critic lately said in one of those assemblies where conversation though sometimes light is seldom without meaning a comedy to please in the present day must be made not written it requires no great expanse of comprehension to perceive the meaning of this dogma the truth of which i am equally ready to acknowledge and to deplore but should it want illustration it may be found every week in a popular piece where a great actor holding a sword in his left hand and making awkward pushes with it charms the audience infinitely more than he could do by all the wit and observation which the ingenious author might have given him and brings down such applauses as the bewitching dialogue of cibber and of farquhar pants for in vain  the patient developement of character the repeated touches which color it up to nature and swell it into identity and existence and which gave celebrity to congreve we have now no relish for the combinations of interest the strokes which are meant to reach the heart we are equally incapable of tasting laugh laugh laugh is the demand not a word must be uttered that looks like instruction or a sentence which ought to be remembered  from a stage in such a state it is time to withdraw but i call on my younger cotemporaries i invoke the rising generation to correct a taste which to be gratified demands neither genius or intellect  which asks only a happy knack at inventing trick i adjure them to restore to the drama sense observation wit lesson and to teach our writers to respect their own talents  what mother can now lead her daughters to the great national school the theater in the confidence of their receiving either polish or improvement should the luckless bard stumble on a reflection or a sentiment the audience yawn and wait for the next tumble from a chair or a tripping up of the heels to put them into attention surely i shall be forgiven for satirising myself i have made such things and i blush to have made them  o genius of a polished age descend  plant thy banners in our theaters and bid elegance and feeling take place of the droll and the laugh which formerly were found only in the booths of bartlemy fair and were divided between flocton and yates with actors capable of giving force to all that is intellectual is it not pity to condemn them to such drudgery they are no longer necessary let sadlers wells and the circus empty themselves of their performers to furnish our stage the expense to managers will be less and their business will be carried on better the understanding discernment and education which distinguish our modern actors are useless to them  strong muscles are in greater repute and grimace has more powerful attraction  prologue mrs mattocks ah ah youre here and comfortably tight well squeezed and pressed i see  from left to right waiting the moment when the curtain rises gasping for plots adventures and surprises were i a poet  a dramatic wit and by the stage tarantula were bit my prologue should as was the good old way a word or two upon the subject say hint a loose outline of the scene within and let you guess the whole ere we begin in present times the prologue and its play are as near kin as michaelmas and may  confined then not to say a word of that i will tell a story  and i have one pat a boniface of late placed near his door good larders here of genuine wines rich store in gold the gaudy invitation hung and to the shifting zephyrs gently swung it chanced a traveller with stomach keen leapt from his rozinante tired and lean talkd of his supper with an eager air  resolved for once in no expense to spare i will have stewed carp he cried and chicken roast and bring me of the burgundy you boast y  e

dear  odds bobs her shrill alarm cannot reach here at length came back the pretty simpering kate and placed  two eggs upon his lonely plate our traveller amazed the landlord called host host in angry accents loudly bawled he came  where are your ducks your lobsters turkey hare why there you have them  in the bill of fare there you have game and fowl and fish well dressed and neat old port to give the whole a zest my house affords no other sir believe me i scorns i am sure to go for to deceive ye the guest fatigued enraged the inn forsook and the road slowly to another took there without promise all was neat and clean his food was wholesome and his room not mean so  not to raise high hopes we cannot meet we trust this nights plain fare is fresh and sweet and should you like the

leserve the town before you a comedy act i scene i  a plain apartment with a few books fancourt sits reading  mrs fancourt at work at some distance fancourt how well those fellows wrote those ancients how finely they satirize the rich and what respect they have for virtue in rags my dear i will translate the passage  off hand now do you hear off hand rises and reads  poliarchus the rich athenian wantoning in gluttony looks with contempt on the poor cassander cassander reposing on his bed of straw thanks the gods that he has health and virtue and prays to be preserved from the misfortune of being rich like poliarchus whose floors are stained with the wine of drunkenness and whose silver couch is constantly crowded by physicians   mrs fancourt are you sure that is a just translation mr fancourt   mr fancourt what madam do you doubt my knowledge of greek some people can hardly read english at sight i can translate at sight thanks to the milk i sucked in at oxford doctor johnson and i were both oxford men  i like to read that old quiz he was so fond of us oxford fellows but he had too much respect for riches  he liked rich people   mrs fancourt to say truth i have a little of his way of thinking i had never much respect toward those philosophers who are always throwing sarcasms on the rich    fancourt interrupting i do maintain madam that the rich are the vilest    mrs fancourt come come mr fancourt your extravagancies have rendered you poor and therefore you are always raving thus and pouring your philipics on people of fortune  as though vice and folly could only be found in palaces and virtue in garrets   fancourt hey day why maam  why    mrs fancourt for my part i believe there is as much goodness amongst persons of fortune as amongst the poor  and i do not see why the power of dressing elegantly and living in well educated society should debase the heart or weaken the understanding   fancourt you do not see why you are the greatest  the most abominable  upon my soul you are the most provoking fool that ever    mrs fancourt my dear sir i do not doubt it  you have repeated these opinions too often for me not to be convinced of their justice but really now between ourselves rising and laying down her work as opinion is nothing without example i will take the liberty to quote yourself in support of mine   fancourt me quote me   mrs fancourt even your great and mighty self mr fancourt when i married you you were not poor  not so poor as you are now and i think at that time you had no particular vices but as dissipation has brought poverty upon you i have observed that by little and little your shallow virtues have disappeared till    fancourt impatiently till what   mrs fancourt till you are capable of almost any action that will not endanger your neck nay i no longer mind your threatening looks  i am so convinced of what i have said that my heart feels horror   fancourt i will make it feel something else   mrs fancourt you cannot all other power over my heart is over you can afflict it no more but observe my deduction i state you to yourself as a proof that poverty is sometimes the source of wickedness and that squalid wretchedness is as capable of debasing the heart as affluence and splendour   fancourt very well woman very well still the noise of that child there  going to the door what an odious squaling it keeps   mrs fancourt it is not easy mr fancourt to still the noise of children who are hungry though they are the children of the first mrs fancourt it pierces my heart to hear them  why will you not do something to get bread for them   fancourt what would you have me do i was not bred to stand behind a counter nor to cry  chairs to mend in the streets you know all that  what did you marry me for   mrs fancourt alas because i loved you the sweetness of your manners disguised the emptiness of your heart and i romantically thought that poverty could never be an evil when two hearts fondly shared its difficulties but now  permit me to ask why you married me   fancourt because you had a modicum of a fortune  a score of hundreds and i had not so many shillings   mrs fancourt that little modicum might have been a bank if properly managed and    fancourt pshaw  stuff i hate such cant what do you want   enter a female servant servant a person left this parcel sir and said there was no answer exit   fancourt such abominable cant untying the up parcel i am as tired of it as i used to be of my grandmothers spelling through hannah glasss art of cookery and i believe in my conscience  the devil here is gold   mrs fancourt gold   fancourt keep off  you are too good too pure to want such vile trash twenty guineas by jupiter  ah ah shaking the purse   mrs fancourt here is a note dropped takes it up and reads accept this purse sir from one who is sorry to see such merit in confined circumstances and who was charmed with your delicate manner of revealing it   fancourt who is it signed by   mrs fancourt robert floyer   fancourt ay sir robert floyer a fine old welchman who got himself made sheriff then a knight  those two dignities generally follow like the old bailey and a whipping i made the old blockhead believe that i was deeply versed in welsh antiquities  that snowden was once a burning mountain and that the ap morgans and ap shoneses were lineally descended from king priam you see i know how to turn my wits to account  i can make money though i cannot make shoes   mrs fancourt yes and you see there is generosity where there is no poverty and that but for the beneficence of a man of fortune a rich man your children today would have wanted a dinner   fancourt psha what merit is there in the generosity of a rich man a fellow who takes out a handful of guineas from his store as you would dip a bucket into a well give me the virtue of the poor man who divides his last shilling  his last twopence with his friend who takes his pint of porter from his thirsty lips and shares it with his poorer neighbor   mrs fancourt ah here is your poor sister  i will go and receive her  you can now assist her distresses  what pleasure it will give you   fancourt none of your documents  if she is in distress let her pawn her superfluities as other poor people do going out there is some difference between sharing ones last twopence with a friend and ones last twenty guineas

rascal stay so you found mr fancourts house   servant yes sir in one of the retired streets near bloomsbury   sir robert well i am glad i sent him those few guineas fancourt seems to be a lad of merit and when he opened his distresses to me he did it in such a delicate modest way he is an excellent companion and he has a pretty taste for antiquities  i like antiquities   servant so i guessed sir by the vast quantity of old wormeaten furniture you have at home which you never make any use of but to show to strangers all from the old castles belonging to your forefathers sir i take it   sir robert yes all from my forefathers castles hum aside my grandfather was the first man of his family who ever went to bed or got up his own master   servant two or three rooms of precious rotten furniture sir

why sir it is my belief you would have loitered six hours if you had seen what i have seen and heard what i have heard   sir robert what have thou seen and heard   humphrey why in my way to bishopsgatestreet i saw folks go into that old fashioned house where gog and and magog stand up to guard the mincepies whilst the lord mayor dines   sir robert guildhall   humphrey yes gilthall  it is all over gilt and finery so i followed a gemman into a great chamber and there  o my eyes there i saw beautiful angels coming down through the clouds on purpose to hold up the glass candlesticks thus stretching out his arm   sir robert seriously gad i should like to see them   humphrey and the gemmen were debating yes  o my ears i heard a city debate and they called one another mr deputy  and one of them with a fine red double chin got up and said i am sorry to differ from mr deputy speaking gruffly but i contend that these innovations bode no good to our constitutions the hour for dining since my time was two it has been three four and six and i suspect shortly it may be eight  hum i move therefore that a petition be presented to the lord mayor  hum  hum   on which a little squinting gentleman rose and said in a shrill quick voice i support the worthy deputy who spoke last these late hours are ruinous to the body corporate on lord mayors day we dined so late that when i went afterward to fishmongershall to supper the turbots were gone nay the second course was demolished the sweetmeats were pocketed and nothing remained but cheese and pickles   sir robert you are a pickle get out  here is a great lady coming  get out of her way  go exit humphrey enter lady charlotte what madam is your ladyship going has not my daughter had the honor to see you lady charlotte   lady charlotte yes and i have left her with a person of much greater consequence  she is in deep consultation with her milliner to a girl of eighteen sir robert a milliner is of as much importance as an aidducamp to a general i knew my distance when she entered and immediately took leave  pray sir order my chair to the first servant who goes off   sir robert madam forgive me if before you go i just plump one question what do you think of mr conway   lady charlotte ha ha ha think of mr conway that he has all the advantages which belong to fashion without its vices he has certainly some vanity but more good sense his friends are well chosen he admires beauty he loves goodness and there is a young lady  archly adieu sir robert your anxiety about mr conway i perfectly understand and i hope you are satisfied exit   sir robert bowing repeatedly what a thing it is to have a lady of quality so familiar with one  georgina enters hastily followed by jenny well georgina what now what now

hortons i do love to go there and what do you think i long to be i long to be a sculptor   sir robert i dont understand ye   georgina o lady horatia does look so charmingly whilst at her labors her sweet white hands appear like the very marble she is at work upon   sir robert did i hear right at work upon marble   georgina bless me why did i never tell you before that she is a sculptor she has a large room full of fine things of her own work o dear i wish she would teach me her art i could spend my life amidst fine statues but pray papa when am i to be presented i am not in town till i am

wings to it   sir robert nonsense you a dukes daughter indeed a pretty figure you would make as a dukes daughter   georgina figure where the difficulty i can do it exactly  you shall see now  when i was last at lady horatia hortons a countess from the opera came in thus striding across and sitting down abruptly  bless me lady horatia how could you be at home tonight i galloppd sixty miles today have killed one coachhorse and spoiled another merely to hear the banti  o the banti   sir robert the bantling why whose bantling was it   georgina o her upper tones  and o her under tones whilst she was flying from b to c hanging upon g running into cantabile from e and sinking down by just gradations to d the whole house were magnetized  i saw a general faint  a minister of state take out his smelling bottle and a prince of the blood blew his nose   sir robert blew his nose very affecting indeed and countesses are charming creatures but dear georgina the warmth of thy imagination would disturb my peace did not thy extreme giddiness prevent its fastening on any one object for more than ten minutes together hah take care of thyself my dear georgina thou art treading upon mentraps and springguns thy paths though seemingly covered with flowers are full of thorns prickles and adders   georgina thorns prickles and adders law papa why people never seem to feel them and i dare say i shall dance over them as lightly as my neighbors exit   sir robert yes dissipation thou art the enemy of female honor it is on thy accursed altar that the peace of the wife the repose of the husband and the welfare of whole families are continually offered up o shield my child lifting up his eyes and hands from the corruption of dissipation exit   scene  asgills lodgings conway enters preceded by a servant servant my master is engaged sir but i will acquaint him that you are here exit   fancourt runs in fancourt hah conway i saw you come in so i followed you up  i know you are at home in asgills lodgings   conway are you acquainted with mr asgill   fancourt no notwithstanding he keeps good company and is nephew to a rich old sir simon in the city who between loans and lumber makes money faster than he tells lies but there are an odd sort of three cornered mortals one can never close with  they present a point at every turn you may as easily come into contact with a porcupine i know all the people in town except himself and i came in on purpose to ask you to make us intimate   conway that will be impossible pray fancourt how do you get acquainted with every body for  let me say it in a whisper  your reputation is not of the very first water not whispering   fancourt pho what men are diamonds in the way of reputation french paste does as well and one is not so much afraid to damage it if i were such a fellow as you with a character of the true water i should be in eternal anxiety  never dare to turn to the right or the left  fearful of a speck here of a flaw there as it is i brush on through the world  my french paste makes a show and if i lose it  why i lose a thing of no value   conway amazing   fancourt hang me if i would be troubled with a first rate character any more than with a first rate beauty  it would only create envy and my friends would never rest till they had robbed me of it   conway o that talents should be thus enlisted in the service of vice   fancourt that i swear you learnt from our old oneeyed proctor of brazen nose  i remember the very words i have heard them fifty times whilst i stood on his blind side o that a man should thus live on the scraps of others all his life and never dare coin a principle for himself so you will not introduce me to asgill conway shakes his head very well  very well  i will introduce myself to an archbishop before i am a week older and get myself made a prebend in revenge   exit enter asgill conway asgill i am come to disengage myself from the hunt i cannot be with you tomorrow   asgill very well  i shall not enquire your reasons nor shall i pretend to guess that there is a little welsh diana in the way of the hunt  you have not seen her i dare swear   conway be not so daring  i have seen her but i have only seen her she is as wild as one of the kids on her fathers mountains   asgill where have you met with her   conway at lady horatio hortons but her volatility is so great that it would be as easy to catch quicksilver   asgill i cannot say i think so  she does not want life but it is the sweet pensiveness of her character that charms me  a thousand graces hang about pensiveness which mere animal spirits destroy   conway i have not seen her in that humor   asgill and then her fine taste   conway her taste is as fine as other peoples i dare swear but she will bear a little polish   asgill she bear polish  ha ha ha where will you find such a mind such an understanding   conway i have no doubt of its native excellence and i hope to have the pleasure of improving it   asgill you what do you mean sir of whom are you speaking   conway of whom do you speak   asgill of lady horatia horton  did you not name her   conway ha ha ha so this is confidence by chance dear asgill i have blundered on your secret very undesignedly  i was speaking of the daughter of sir robert floyer   asgill but you mentioned lady horatia and the moment her idea is presented to me every other is swallowed up o conway she engrosses my whole soul  to see her is bliss and the sound of her voice is rapture   conway heyday   asgill you have the secret by chance but you are welcome to it and i am prepared for all your jests on my passion for a woman who is devoted to sculpture   conway faith i perceive no room for jests i think it must be charming to see a fine woman sit with a chissel and bring out of a block of marble a form as graceful as her own every feature glowing with animation beneath her eye and every stroke of the mallet warming the cold mass into mind and expression   asgill smiling and catching his hand i thank you but your eulogy is not complete for the purity of my horatia chastises the art she loves the subjects she selects delicacy itself would paint out with an enchanting modesty she seeks for models only in the graces of her own sex the daughters of britain and the matrons of greece   conway very well but you are a son of britain  does lady horatia    asgill eagerly yes  no  i can not tell she treats me with rigor yet i think her heart has passion i sometimes fancy i see it shine like the sun in november  unwillingly and by starts   conway why do you not lead to an explanation   asgill i cannot for she is rich and i am as you know dependent on the will of an uncle   conway he has the reputation of being a croesus   asgill true but a fortune whose basis is commerce may be doubled or dissolved in a month   conway well pray for me my dear asgill that i may catch my little welsh fawn i have no prayers to make for you for i perceive yours is one of those sober passions that end as it may your mind will keep its equilibrium o how delightful it must be to love with so much good sense exit laughing   asgill o how he mistakes it is in souls like mine that love rages with all his fury the gay the volatile can scarcely maintain a passion but in the serious and reflective mind love raises a despotic throne and like the burning sun of africa he pours his chiefest ardors upon slaves  enter perkins perkins how now your looks alarm me what news from the city   perkins o sir   asgill my good friend speak you very much distress me something is amiss   perkins would i could say your fears were unfounded something is amiss  your uncle    asgill nay speak at once i can bear any thing rather than suspense   perkins then summon all your fortitude your uncle the good sir simon has sent me to tell you that  he  is  undone   asgill oh pressing his forehead with his hand undone did you say so perkins did you   perkins the misfortunes which have shaken the trade of europe have at last reached him he who lately ranked on change a two hundred thousand pound man may not when his creditors are satisfied be able to command one thousand pound   asgill after a distressful silence your news is heavy very heavy leave me dear perkins i want to ruminate on my misfortunes alone exit perkins throws himself into a chair my worthy my unhappy uncle the tide of affliction must roll heavy on him arises after a pause it is determined  i see lady horatia no more no  never more  sighing deeply never shall her delicacy be insulted by seeing a beggar court her to his arms walks backwards and forwards but what can i do bred to no profession knowing nothing ignorant of every art by which independence or even bread may be obtained i am thrown a vagabond upon the world o my too indulgent uncle when you sent me to cambridge had you placed me rather in a counting house i might now have been in a situation to have softened all your afflictions  instead of which  o horror my soul sickens  my head is dizzy  i sink to death goes off reeling   end of the first act act ii scene i  a lodging house tippy walks hastily

judgment is asked  my satire is feared  i am courted and hated  o its a glorious thing to be a critic   fancourt why you dont pretend that you are really a connoisseur   tippy i pretend to any thing that will either get me into a dining parlour or a wine cellar i pronounce on paintings and tokay  on statues and old hock i know exactly the grapes from which the one was pressed and the age in which

the strong likeness i bear to lord beechgrove   fancourt the resemblance is astonishing  they call you his polygraph   tippy you are mistaken they call his lordship my polygraph   fancourt i stand corrected but how have you lived on this resemblance has he taken you up for the sake of the likeness   tippy taken me up you are cursed unlucky in your phrases today no no  he has been useful to me

rejoice to see you they did not tell me you were here   charlotte i have been here a long while delighting myself with your charming works but how full of labor is the amusement you have chosen   lady horatia i do not find it so   lady charlotte so different from fashionable life   lady horatia o the labor of a fashionable life would kill me i should sink under it chipping marble is playing with feathers compared to that   lady charlotte how so   lady horatia the discipline of a life in fashion is by no means of the mildest sort smiling consider for instance the necessary vigils and abstinence of a gamester it is expedient that she works hard and lives sparingly for if she does not keep her spirits perfectly cool instead of cheating her friend her friend may cheat her this reflection is copied pretty nearly from the elegant doctor horn  my labors are less and more innocent than hers   lady charlotte o i perceive you will be able to defend yourself   lady horatia in the next place reflect on the toils of a determined beauty whether she wakes or sleeps whatever she does wherever she goes it is all with relation to the one great object which engrosses her meditations after hours wasted murdered in the hard work of the toilette away she springs her wheels thunder rapidly through the streets  she flies from assembly to assembly does the music of the concert fascinate her no does polished conversation interest her no some other beauty has been the belle of the evening her heart has been torn with envy she returns home drags off her ornaments in disgust and throws herself on a sleepless bed in anguish are my labors less pardonable than hers   lady charlotte you will be too hard for me in argument so i drop your statues to talk of yourself something i see is wrong what is it tenderly come be explicit  you will not speak in plain language when did you see mr asgill   lady horatia not this week  no  not for a whole week i will conceal nothing from

breaking   lady charlotte how do you account for his absence   lady horatia tired with my haughty coldness he has forsaken me i die with jealousy and selfreproach he has found an object more amiable and more tender i knew he loved me and i gloried in my conquest  yet still i tried each fickle art importunate and vain and whilst his passion touched my heart i triumphed in his pain o asgill thou art revenged   lady charlotte what hearts we possess always too cold or too feeling my dear horatia stonify yours a little as you give spirit to marble transfuse the marble to your heart see here is your little welsh friend   enter georgina georgina o lady horatia i am so rejoiced bless me you are weeping  what has happened   lady charlotte a favorite goldfinch has happened to die my dear

times and as to your kneeling one finds such things in novels but no man who really loves thinks of such fooleries   conway rising how do you know that   georgina i am sure of it there was a young man

talked of no one but me   conway who told you so   georgina his sister told me so   conway and did you not pity him   georgina yes i pitied him because i could not love him   conway o that saves my life aside and where is he now   georgina i dont know but i have heard he is recovered and makes a very great figure somewhere they always get over it   conway but if you should not love me i should die   georgina love i would not love for all the world miss gwatkin was in love once and she grew as pale as horseradish foolish creature if she had kept her color perhaps the gentleman would have liked her   conway o let me teach you to love i see you are yet as ignorant of it as    georgina as that fine mr tippy was of sculpture ha ha teach me to love what teach me to be wretched to weep to be sleepless to lose my bloom o if i ever thought it possible that i could love you i should hate you beyond all bearing  i would fly from you and never see you more runs off hastily   conway she

lady horatia horton   sir simon heard of her  yes  i have heard of her   lady horatia it is believed sir that mr asgill has some regard for her   sir simon i hope not my nephew i believe knows better than to regard such a gillflirt   lady horatia gillflirt lady horatia horton a gillflirt   sir simon yes  the greatest gillflirt i ever saw in my life   lady horatia  rising ah he means georgina who saw him yesterday i am so confused i know not how to explain  aside   sir simon my nephew in love with a stonecutter   lady horatia sir   sir simon a hewer of marble why he may as well live in a quarry   lady horatia monstrous  aside   sir simon her study is a workshop  her drawing room a masons sawyard   lady horatia  aside insupportable can this be the uncle of sidney asgill   sir simon there she chissels out womens faces with young serpents hanging in drop curls by way of a new fashioned tete   lady horatia  in great warmth nay i can bear it no longer sir this more than gothic ignorance is a disgrace to the age in which we live and to your own situation the head of the beautiful medusa is amongst the wonders of the art o the more than martial skill which could make beauty horrible   sir simon hey the dumb lady cured what is she crazy   lady horatia at the same place you saw  with enthusiasm the touching niobe mourning over her children  the light atalanta flying from her lover  the graceful ganymede caught up to olympus for his beauty did none of those strike ye none of those awaken your adoration for the sublime art  for sculpture whose long enduring beauties bid defiance to time and laugh at ages   sir simon  singing i am mad bess believe me   lady horatia your coarseness sir is hardly to be borne how different from yours is the mind of your nephew he has sat whole hours admiring those wonders of the art and patiently watching the strokes of the chissel which presumed at distant imitation   sir simon it is the first instance of his folly i ever heard i thought sidney had been a different sort of a man   lady horatia i suppose you have been employing your talents to the more exalted purposes of importing verdigrease and blubber and in making monopolies   sir simon monopolies no madam never there is one monopoly and only one to which i give my assent  may the posterity of englishmen continue to monopolize this little island as long as the sea fills its channel or the winds blow upon its rocks have you any commission for me madam   lady horatia commission  sir  i came  i intended  it was my design  no sir i have no commission   sir simon when you have madam i shall be happy to see you again but i really have not had time to read my letters which i must beg to do directly order the ladys carriage   lady horatia sir  i really feel myself so insulted that  perhaps sir  but no matter perhaps you are right  yes sir you are very right  goes out weeping yet with dignity   sir simon perkins come in perkins  he enters why i was never so stunned in my life here is a woman comes on pretense to speak about my nephew and then begins some gibberish about sculpture  and talks of ganymede and atalanta and olympus and such vile trash as lads learn out of ovid books that if i was a member of parliament i would bring in a bill to make it felony for any bookseller to vend   perkins it would do you more honor sir than any canal bill bill for roads or any other improvement that was ever brought before the house   conway enters sir simon hah mr conway what news  what news  running toward him   conway alas none sir i have followed our poor sidney by every possible clue that i could obtain but he has passed away like a vapor  not a trace remains  sighing   sir simon o fie  o fie  shaking his head with a melancholy air   conway i suppose lady horatia horton has been here to make enquiries   sir simon who   conway lady horatia horton she stepped into her carriage as i came up to the gate  but she seemed to be weeping so i avoided her   perkins bless me sir  there has been some mistake  to sir simon   sir simon i dont know  i am all in a wood why was that lady in mourning lady horatia horton   conway assuredly   sir simon why it is quite a different person from her i saw yesterday at her house   conway  smiling o yes ha ha  i have heard about that the lady you saw was quite a different person   sir simon gad i hope i shall never have the luck to see her again   conway why sir   sir simon i cannot endure her   conway  angrily sir not endure her why she is the most charming of her sex that lady sir has more sweetness of disposition more playful innocence of heart and more beauty than half the women in the world   sir simon i hope i may form a different opinion mr conway   conway no sir  no man shall form a different opinion  or if he does he must take care to conceal it in my presence   sir simon i shall take no care sir i will use the freedom of an englishman to speak all i think of you and of every man and of every woman too how dared she assume a character she was not  how dared she say such things of my nephew to my face   conway sir whatever that lady says i make myself answerable for   perkins o gentlemen let me entreat you  you will both be sorry  you have been both too warm   conway i advise you to persuade sir simon that he has been so  i shall expect his apology   exit sir simon  staring why what is in the wind today perkins i affront every one who comes near me without designing it i am sure   perkins your temper has been a little ruffled sir you are sore about mr asgill   sir simon sore indeed and my heart will be sore soon as well as my temper if i do not hear of him but about this lady horatia  it is very odd what could bring her here perhaps she came to tell me some news i think i will go to her   perkins it would be best sir   sir simon i certainly will  after change but i hope i shall not see her marble monsters again  they will put me out of sorts if i do what a taste   perkins dear sir any taste is better than no taste and a lady who employs her thoughts and her chissel on works of art is at least not idle and therefore as doctor johnson says not in the

the chapter   lady horatia the person who told you so sir took an unwarrantable freedom   sir simon why you told me so yourself would any lady fly into the city to talk to a cross old fellow about his nephew if she had not set her heart upon him pho pho that spoke your sentiments pretty plainly   lady horatia weeping with vexation o dear i tell you i hate your nephew   sir simon do you o you woman you downright woman i see how it is when he was rich you loved him when you looked forward to fine equipage splendor and expense you acknowledged his merits but now that you have heard he is poor you despise him o woman woman   lady horatia  with heat sir it is false you injure me in every part of your opinion when he was rich he never knew that he had caused a tender thought in me it was only his poverty that made my passion break out without disguise it was his distress that made me feel and acknowledge i adore him   sir simon what then you do love him   lady horatia  much confused what have

dividing it with him   sir simon huzza huzza here is a woman for ye madam he is not poor i will put down for asgill thousand for thousand as long as you please and when i die leave him a plumb   lady horatia sir   sir simon it was all a sagacious trick of mine i wanted to try if the dear lad really loved me and if he possessed real worth of soul sentiments truly noble he often uttered but noble sentiments are uttered by scoundrels who do not possess one feeling which if brought to the touchstone would not disgrace humanity   lady horatia mr asgill not poor  pausing nay then i understand the flimsy contrivance a pitiful plot to force me to reveal a secret which i chose to bury in the bottom of my heart presuming  haughtily make me a dupe now sir know that your nephew rich and your nephew poor are two distinct persons i detest his art and recall all i have said the rich mr asgill i shall teach myself henceforward to despise exit   sir simon whu why what is in the wind now upon my soul

pride of an englishwoman   lady charlotte lady horatia you are all smiles i declare i should not so easily have forgiven a man  looking on asgill who could fly from me to the boisterous ocean and

me when i trod the deck of the victory can never be chilled in the glorious tars around me valor intrepidity heroism shone forth with all their fires they flashed through my heart and i swear that should my country need my assistance i will again resume the trowsers and sail before the mast wherever she bids her cannon roar or her proud pendants fly  advancing forward ah repose on us and when
