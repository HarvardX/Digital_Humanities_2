ode in honor of the nuptials of their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales  ode in honor of the nuptials of their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales written and composed by mr dibdin    london printed by the author and sold at his warehouse  in strand opposite the adelphi  to her gracious majesty the queen of great britain as an humble mite toward the universal admiration of the domestic virtues of that most exemplary of wives and mothers this ode is inscribed with the profoundest deference and respect by her majestys faithful subject and devoted servant c dibdin  preface the following poem is not more an effusion of loyalty than it is a public congratulation the relative happiness likely to result from the union it celebrates is seriously and solemnly interesting to every british subject since the equivocal tenure of regal power in other countries must naturally render every additional link to the chain of public security here an object of considerable magnitude and as hereditary right is the strongest support of the constitution and the fairest ornament of the crown as experience has given us proof upon proof how dangerous to this nation is a doubtful right every honest man must of course bless an event likely to ensure the english throne to the present family  as to the poem itself it may perhaps be necessary to say something in explanation of it for i am willing to acknowledge that warmth and fancy seldom permit me to conform to mere rule and that in general i have better succeeded when my hand has obeyed my conception than when cold correctness has shrouded my ideas in a regular arrangement of words  i call it an ode as the most unexceptionable description i can give it it is not however an ode strictly speaking for i do not clog myself with the dull regularity of making my strophe turn to the left my antistrophe to the right or my epode sing before the altar it is not lyric except in the best sense of the acceptance that of being written for music of the dithyrambic it certainly possesses the rapture but not the phrenzy it is not pindaric for though it has flights in plenty it aims at no sublimity but that which is the offspring of simplicity  in some respects it resembles the epithalamium but not in all for that species of panegyric generally taken is purchased praise performed in the presence of the bride and bridegroom circumstances that will not be attributed to me or to my poem for all the world should not buy my commendation and the work itself will sufficiently vouch for me that there is too much of the heart in it to savor of solicitation  its irregularities however are its advantages for they furnish a bolder scope to the imagination and give additional force and effect to the most enchanting of all mediums that ever conveyed pleasure to the heart in a word i have gone for strength without heaviness praise without adulation figure without distortion i have endeavored to be playful not ludicrous bold not daring easy not quaint but the most prominent feature in the picture is rapture to which perhaps i may have given a latitude somewhat bordering on that extravagance which on ordinary occasions literally taken might be called hyperbole but which upon the present occasion applied figuratively is appropriate and in place  i think i shall be allowed some credit for the construction of the poem there is a novelty in commanding the attendance of the muses and their mission to the celestials and the groupe bending from olympus to behold the landing of the princess would not make an unworthy figure upon canvass the salutation of britannia is interesting and her leading the bride in nuptial pomp to the temple of hymen surrounded by an admiring populace is still more so nor can englishmen hear unmoved that prophecy of fame at the conclusion which i for one wish with all my soul may be literally verified  as to the music itself it is composed not constructed written to the heart not to the head i have made melody my outline and through the wide range of that field of fancy i have endeavored to excite feeling create interest and convey pleasure as to the harmony no more now than upon other occasions have i any thing abstruse for though i have plenty of modulation yet i have taken every possible care cautiously to avoid an obtrusion of discord into the temple of hymen  in short i have written as i felt i am rejoiced at this event because i am an englishman because the true security of english freedom that my father taught me to venerate that i liberally enjoy and that will constitute the best happiness of my children will be promoted by it therefore be my ode lyric dithyrambic or pindaric a mixture of all or a likeness of none it is honest and sincere and comes warm from the heart thus though i only shall have manifested my admiration of those who are more immediately concerned and my gratitude to the public who are collaterally interested my labor will not have been in vain for i shall have gratified an ardent zeal and added one shout though but a feeble one to the willing and merited acclamations of a loyal and happy people  ode in honor of the nuptials of their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales recitative accompanied descend and consecrate ye sacred nine the nuptial rites of george and caroline nor courted nor invoked but wing your way yourselves inspired my mighty theme to obey and first sweet polyhimnia muse of sound verbrate thy lyre and while thou spreadst around trembling ether sweetly filling thy rapturous airs so soft so thrilling possess me rule each sense at thy control strain following strain again and yet again come with thy melody entrance my longing soul air in gliding measure charm to thee the playful nymph terpsichore with ease and grace and look askance her panting bosom burning as twining twisting turning in winning guise she leads the mazy dance now soft and soothing be thy strain to ease the fond eratos pain whisper that in her realm no more false fickle love shall she deplore bid her behold with glad surprise her mistress in loves tender arts a princess comes to bless our isle whose form shall captivate all eyes and whose example fix all hearts bid her the trembling tear to dry to dissipate the deepheavd sigh to smooth her lowering brow and smile and join accompanied by thee the playful nymph terpsichore with ease and grace and look askance her panting bosom burning as twisting twining turning in winning guise she leads the mazy dance recitative accompanied now change the strain and to thy spell mighty calliope compel  displaying ample historys page  bid her urania bring a virgin and a sage who skilled in science wondrous lore can suns and worlds and heavens explore and  a triumvirate to fill  bid clio her celestial skill to aid the glorious purpose join and while the trumpets silver notes proclaim so great so mighty so august a name bid them transmit to fame those truths divine that speak the glory of the brunswick line but hark upon the ear what rustic strain cleaves the free air it is gay euterpes train that sylvan faun and hamadriade lead with horn and flageolet and oaten reed air and first the horn whose mellow sound wakes echo in the hollow rocks to inspire the fleet sagacious hound where to unearth the subtle fox the flageolet shall imitate the feathered songster by his mate sequestered in the conscious grove impervious to all eyes but love and now as the lorn nightingale mourns sadly in the pensive vale days labor at an end rustics the winding dance shall lead to the cadence of euterpes reed and mirth with sadness blend air and thou melpomene appear whose woes find no relief whose minds best joys the social tear whose luxury is grief behold her  dim each sorrowing eye  but let the torrent flow be hallowed that sweet sympathy that mourns for others woe air nor thou thalia gay and trim skulk where behind thy mask you are peeping come forth with frolic wit and whim rouse sluggard dullness as he is sleeping with honest gibe and moral jeer and humor honors cause adorning come dissipate thy sisters tear as cheers the sun an april morning say as her grief thou bidst her dry each passions virtue in its season that as it is folly loud to cry so laughing loud is sometimes reason recitative accompanied begone disperse like air to blue olympus fly there placed on high as the celestials in their roseate bowers play with the smiles and count the dancing hours strike the loud spheres your voices raise and charm their captured ears proclaiming carolines unequalled praise her wisdom bid minerva fear bid her who young endymion embraced blush and resign the name of chaste tell lovely venus and the dimpld graces to yield to truth and own all sweet all beautiful as are their faces her face perfection boasts alone all all while sitting in celestial state that which they cannot equal bid them wonder at and as your mandate they attend and from the silver clouds astonished bend bid them behold with a benignant smile the rapture that pervades great britains happy isle march fired with my theme thus gave i nature law willed at a wish and what i fancied saw air i saw the gods in troops attending well pleased from high olympus bending while playful neriedes gaily gave the splendid yatch to neptunes wave i heard old jove by styx declare he never saw mortal half so fair while juno owned he would never known strife could she like her have proved a wife minerva said proud to extol her she would always been her aptest scholar again her mirror and again venus regarded but in vain then rubbed the surface twas not right at last she broke it out of spite one called for nectar go and sip cried hebe nectar from her lip mars proudly said he saw a race of future heroes in her face while roughhewn neptune smiling swore never had his billows borne before a lovelier venus to a happier shore recitative accompanied and truly neptune swore scarce smiled the fair to thank old ocean for his anxious care but troops of bards burst forth in one fond lay  for light is light and day we still call day  and as the obvious truth fell from each tongue by each proud heart inspired they felt and sung air hail lovely wonder honors meed rule every heart that virtue prizes eclipse each fair as stars recede when from old ocean venus rises haste haste with sacred love and truth grace smiling hymens blessed communion haste and reward the only youth whose virtues merit such an union ii see pictured in her face her mind beauty and goodness never asunder while envy now no longer blind grows kindness and subsides to wonder roses bloom beneath her feet cupids for a smile implore her while zephyr steals a kiss so sweet it perfumes all the way before her recitative accompanied mute admiration that had hushed the crowd yielded to acclamations warm and loud for lo a sight that ever shall impart strong strong emotions to each british heart scarce had the princess on the peopled strand admired the beauty of fair freedoms land when in majestic grandeur stood revealed bright as her crest refulgent as her shield britannia  with a tender zeal impressed as tutelary guardian of her lovely guest and oh ineffable was the angelic smile that bid the glorious stranger welcome to her isle nor ended there those shouts that rent the air but as distinctions honors on the way still courted some solicitous delay their longing eyes pursued the splendid train nor lost them till they reached fair hymens fane whom they addressed in fervent prayer air sacred hymen on this night thy torch with fire celestial light and in thy smiling crown of flowers symbol this pairs delicious hours let floras rose the wreath adorn deprived of each intruding thorn let the fond heliotrope be there and venus myrtle fresh and fair mars for his laurel next invoke and blend it with the civic oak so bliss fame constancy shall prove their lot bestowed by thee and love recitative accompanied here let me pause ye powers or let me claim than inspiration some superior name give me to speak the force of every grace perfection ever bestowed on form or face with all the gifts concentred in the mind when gods their essence blend with humankind so my strong zeal shall disappoint despair so shall i sing the worth of this illustrious pair air so shall i paint in conflict tender as fear and joy alternate strove that form that bid her heart surrender while burning blushes spoke her love not sol that
