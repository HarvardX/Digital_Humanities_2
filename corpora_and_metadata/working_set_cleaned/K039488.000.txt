theater royal in drury lane  london printed for t becket the corner of the adelphi in the strand       advertisement the author of this musical farce begs leave to inform the readers if there should be any that it was merely intended to introduce the little gipsy to the public whose youth and total inexperience of the stage made it necessary to give as little dialogue to her character as possible her success depending wholly upon her singing  this reason added to another which is that the piece was produced at an early part of the season when better writers are not willing to come forth is the
