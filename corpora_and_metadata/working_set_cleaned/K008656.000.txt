a treatise of the venereal disease  plainly discovering and directing both sexes how they may become their own doctors  teaching them plainly and perfectly to know their own condition and degree of infecton be it what it will from the slightest gonorrhaea to the most extreme and deplorable degree of it  and how to cure themselves of any such disorders quickly safely and secretly and at a very small expense without making their case known to any by pleasant and agreeable medicines mild in their operations and without confinement or hindrance of business  also to heal all gleets proceeding from former ill cures seminal weakness or genital imbecilities  to be had of the author richard rock in kingsarmscourt ludgate hill price   d  a treatise of the veneral disease i shall not amuse the reader with accounts how this distemper had its first rise or how it was brought into europe and to england in particular or the several ways by which it is contracted but shall proceed to give you a true description of every stage of this disorder and the several methods of cure in a most certain safe and expeditious manner and so plain that every one may understand their own case and cure themselves without making it known to any  the symptoms which formerly attended were the falling out of the eyes teeth and nails etc which has not lately happened to any body  several others are not now so common or severe as formerly such as the falling off of the hair crusts all over the body caries of the bones foul ulcers of the palate uvula jaws and nostrils nocturnal pains etc  there are now only four symptoms left and these are a gonorrhaea a bubo chancres and peri or warts which seem to comprehend the whole disease  generally it consists of a gonorrhaea only nor indeed do the other symptoms show themselves unless the cure is neglected or managed by unskilful persons  the gonorrhaea admits of an easier cure than formerly and is often carried off without medicines inwardly if timely taken in hand and a due care taken in the regimen  as for the other three symptoms though they require a more elaborate treatment yet they are now much less obstinate than formerly all which shall be discussed of in their proper places and order  of the gonorrhaea the first degree of infection appears in men with a gentle running or dropping from the urinary passage producing a pleasant sensation and as it were glewing up the orifice the extremity of the urethra grows hot and gapes wider than usual the parts of generation are affected with an uncommon titulation especially at the time of making water without pain but with a sense of heat that daily increases  if the infection spreads or is not so mild the tention and induration of the penis come on with pain thick drops of the more fluid part of the semen or seed flow in greater quantity of a yellowish or greenish color often with heat redness tenderness small pustles blisters and ulcers both within and without the urinary passage with great sharpness and sense of heat through the whole urethra after making water  the next symptoms are more violent the perineum swells grows painful the urine scalds with frequent provocations to make water and but a little at a time with a distortion and bending of the penis called a cordee with frequent and involuntary erections occasioning great pain to the patient on every such occasion and when warm in bed a violent running phimosis or paraphimosis that is when the foreskin is either so swelled as it cannot be brought forward to cover the nut of the yard or that it cannot be drawn backward one or both of the testicles or stones swelled and enraged with pain increasing as the gleet or running is obstructed sometime causing cold trembling and fainting but as they abate so the running multiplies and comes away more freely of an ash color sometimes marked with specks streaks or threads of blood stinking yellow green and corrupt and these are the usual or common claps  women the case is almost the same in women but this is to be observed that after the infection is received the female parts of generation are wet with an unusual moisture and are troubled with frequent itching and heat almost painful and daily advances  the heat burning redness and pain of the vagina or urinarypassage being increased the admission of the penis is scarcely to be endured the urine is sharp and scalding but in general not so sharp as in men the running plentiful like matter bloody yellow green and stinking and by the tention of the pudendum and vagina bring on great pain  if the running is of a clear white or ash color and any thing ropy shows the infection slight  if of a saffron color dark yellow or brown from being mixed and discolored with blood is the second degree of a clap  if a yellowish green green or very dark green mixed with matter plainly shows that the inflammation is attended with ulcers and is the last stage of a clap  all these different symptoms appear but vary according to the temperament of body habit and constitution of the patient and the greater or lesser degree of the infection and the distance of time since the injury was received  you are to observe that the greater the degree of the venereal poison is the sooner it appears but a slight hurt will remain for sometime before it shows itself but the sooner it appears the easier is the cure performed from what has been said it plainly appears that there are three distinct species of the gonorrhaea which only differ in degree the first will easily degenerate into the second the second into the third if the vehemence of the symptoms be not quickly restrained  these three degrees are divided into four stages that is the beginning increase height and declintion  neither man or woman can indulge in the use of venery whilst they are in this state of a gonorrhaea without violent pain and what is worse without manifestly increasing the disease  the first thing to be considered is to learn and understand your own case by observing the nature of it therefore it is expedient to remark what effect the venereal poison has on the body according to the several symptoms herein before discribed whereby you will plainly discover the degree of infection and by that means be directed in the method of cure  i proceed now to give proper directions to each person to cure this disease in its several stages and shall trace them all in a regular manner but observe that every gonorrhaea if medicines are timely administered is free from danger and easily admits of a cure sooner or later in proportion to the vehemence of the symptoms the acrimony of the infection and the constitution of the blood but if neglected and come to a great hight is sometime before it will yield to any medicine therefore too early an application cannot be made for cure  an information therefore follows of such antivenereal remedies as are endued with all the natural qualities requisite to perform a speedy and safe cure in all the cases herein described and that the patient may be directed and readily know how to be furnished with all such medicines and be secure from all bad preparations sold at several shops in london by authors who conceal their names which they would have no occasion to do did their preparations answer what they pretend for them    the first degree of this distemper being exterior and only in the top of the urinarypassage may be cured by external means for as that part is of a spongy nature it as easily imbibes any liquid as the venereal poison for which the incomparabe lotion or wash is recommended as the most easy and private method of cure whatsoever  and this is performed by only pouring some of the liquid into a cup washing the part with it and soaking it therein two or three times a day for two or three minutes together or longer as you have an opportunity but be sure to let the water cover the nut of the yard and to take fresh liquor for every washing surely no person that is not in love with pills bolus and electuaries will refuse so easy a cure as this and so soon performed  this remedy must be of singular benefit to all travelers who cannot possibly take physic on their journey therefore this lotion is advised to them let the degree of infection be what it will for if not to be cured by this remedy alone yet it will most certainly prevent their growing worse until they have an opportunity of taking other medicines which must be of great advantage to them  those who are taking physic if they use this incomparable lotion will soon find it to forward the cure to admiration by drawing out the infectious venom while the internal medicines by their anodine and detergent qualities assuage the pain and cleans the ulcers of the seminary receptacles  this lotion is to be had only of the author rihard rock at his house in kingsarmscourt ludgate hill and ready to be delivered to any messenger by asking for a bottle of water for the scurvy price   s   d where you may have advice and proper remedies prepared by the author in all other disorders  as sometimes the cure will not be performed perfectly by the lotion only by reason of the disposition of the parts of generation for some venom may lay hid in the wrinkles of the frenum or prepnce and the least seeds of morbifick matter being introduced into a sound body in the smallest quantity will by degrees increase in bulk form and efficacy and sooner or later infect and corrupt the whole mass of humors  therefore for fear of such an accident and to make the cure certain and safe the infallible antivenereal bolus is recommended which is pleasant to take and will most certainly eradicate any lurking poison which the water may not happen to reach two or three of which will be sufficient to perform the cure without any danger of return to be had as before directed by asking for the bolus for the rheumatism price   s each those who suspect they have received an injury or have any relicts of a former disorder may by taking a dose or two be perfectly freed from such apprehensions  this medicine has no unpleasant taste never causes any sickness gripeings or other disorders of the body especially after the first dose or two but as the very name of physic is nauseous to some persons they may wet a piece of wafer in a spoon by dipping it into water then put in the bolus and cover it with the wafer and then there can be no taste but of the water only in taking it these wafers are to be had at every confectioners you may have a great many for   d  be sure to abstain from all acts of venery whilst under cure for one single act will increase the disorder more than three doses of physic can rectify  the less wine or strong liquor that you drink the better but spirituous liquors must not be touched yet you may in the evening drink a glass or two of wine to support the spirits if you find occasion always remembering the less you drink of strong liquors the better neither should you eat any highseasond meats pepper or other spice and the more spareing you are in diet much the sooner will the cure be perfected for the more impure bodies are nourished the worse they grow always but to drink plentifully of smallbeer or milk and water a little warm when the physic is not working is good and water gruel or green tea at all times of any of these liquors you cannot drink too much  you may go abroad while you take physic but be careful to guard against wet windy or very cold weather at such times it is best to confine yourself if your affairs permit   d for the second degree of infection the person that has this disorder must take a bolus every other day very early in the morning until he finds the heat of urine gone and the running decreased or but little in quantity neat clear and white and become somewhat ropy which will appear by touching some of it with your finger and thumb and pulling them assunder gently and if it draws out in strings or ropy in such case you may be assured the cure is near perfected and nothing then remains but to strengthen the weakened parts so then he must leave off taking any more physic and take of the balsamic restrictive elixir  0 drops betimes every morning at four in the afternoon and at night going to rest always fasting an hour before and after taking it and this you must continue until the running is wholly ceased  it neither purges or gives any manner of disorder but keeps the body in a due temperament strengthening all weakness of the back genitals and reins seminal and urinary vessels and thereby most certainly prevents a gleet which frequently happens after a venereal injury for want of taking such restrictive and strengthening medicines  if the heat of urine should be violent during the time you are taking physic or that you are troubled with a stranguary or difficulty in making water besides the bolus he must take of the following diuretic powder drinking plentifully as often as you can too much you cannot of thin water gruel green tea or milk and water a little warmed sweetened to your taste with sugar and this must be continued until such uneasiness and pain is gone  this will occasion you to make water in a considerable quantity at each time and clear or of a pale color if of a high color it is for want of drinking so much of those liquors as you ought  the diuretic powder salt prunella half an ounce fine loafsugar an ounce and half mix them together and keep them in a dry place and take as before directed   d now if from the great acrimony or quantity of the received infection from the neglect of applying proper remedies in time to check the disorder from great irregularity in drinking or diet from the previous acrimony of the blood or from the weakness of the parts the symptoms increase then arises the hight or last stage of a clap  for the cure of which the patient must observe all the rules and directions before given in the slighter cases of this disorder and ought to take the quantity of a small nut on the point of a knife every other morning of the most noble antivenereal electuary or so much as he finds will give him five or six stools until the heat of urine is gone and the running appears clear etc as before and then the balsamic elixir is to be taken as in other cases by taking of which and observing all former directions in a very short time the heat of urine all soreness and pain will be perfectly removed and all other uneasy symptoms  in some persons six doses of this most excellent electuary will carry off all the malignant disorder in others  0    or more are required according to the teperament of body or the stubborness of the disease and as the party shall be more or less abstinnous  i would not have any think the cure long for nothing can be more pernicious to the patient than too short a cure if it may be termed so for by stopping the running so suddenly the blood and juices are infected the patient poxed and probably he and his posterity ruined whereas when all the degrees of this disease are wholly taken off not too suddenly but by a due method and proper remedies which is the onle safe and sure way there can be no danger of any ill consequences following which this electuary i aver will perform  one thing more i have to offer that is whoever takes of this electuary will never be troubled with a gleet which most of the other common purging medicines will do the price of this electuary is   s a pot enquire for a pot of electuary for the gout  as we have given particular instructions for curing the three degrees of a gonorrhaea in order that the party afflicted might the better understand the different applications necessary for each disorder and shown how easy the cure may be made by the use of the beforementioned medicines but because some few people amongst the other symptoms of the disease herein before discribed are afflicted with buboes chancres phimosis paraphimosis and swelled testicles something shall be said on each of them in particular  of buboes and method of cure venereal buboes are tumors of the conglobate glands which are situate in the groins are painful hard and tending to suppuration of the size of pigeons or henseggs sometimes as large as a mans fist some immediately appear after coition in either or both groins sometimes they are occasioned by a suppressed gonorrhaea and lastly by a latent pox  upon the increase of a bubo arise pain in the inguinal glands and as it is impossible to walk unless the muscles of the leg and thigh pull them forwards which cannot act without pressing upon the tumid glands of the groin therefore the action of walking cannot be performed without pain  to heal this disorder before it comes too large painful or inflamed the purging antivenereal electuary must be taken every other day as before directed and besides that must foment the disordered parts night and morning for half an hour at a time afterward applying a cataplasm which must be secured to the swelling  the way of using the fomentation is after this manner make it very hot and then having provided two pieces of flannen full large enough to cover the diseased parts dip them into it and take one out again and squeese it apply it to the place as warm as can be endured without scalding when it begins to cool take out the other piece and put that into the liquor again that you used first and foment in like manner consinuing this until the swelling abates and disperses  if the yard is to be fomented follow the above directions only observe to wrap the flannen round the part  but if the swellings do not disperse but tend to suppuration then a ripening poultice must be applied and an apperture made by a caustic or incision the party afflicted must omit purging and eat and drink freely as usual until it is come to a due disgestion and then proper dressings must be applied to promote the running cleanse and heal the sore which must not too suddenly be closed  you may have the ingredients for the fomentation cataplasm poultice and proper dressings at my house for a small charge  of a chancre and the cure at first arises a small miliary red pointed hot itching pimple the top of which by degrees grows whiter and more even and at last opens with a small opperture from whence a small quantity of ichor is discharged occasioning a swelling and inflammation of the parts the ulcers increasing are surrounded with callossities dense or hard and abounds with a thick viscid pus and frequently excites ulcers of the same kind in the neighboring parts  they are situate in men upon the internal face of the prepuce upon the back or sides of the glans but sometimes upon the extremity of the urethra  women in women upon the internal face of the labia often upon the clitoris sometimes on the root of it or on the prepuce with which the clitoris is covered upon the nymphae carunculae vagina and extremity of the urethra  some arise immediately from impure coition others come on without any suspected venery at least of a late date and are brought on by a pox that has been concealed for some time  in case the ulcers proceed from an injury of long date they must be treated in a rougher manner and by a skilful hand and therefore shall say no more on that head only assure those persons who shall apply to me for cure of these or any other difficult disorders that i will under god restore them to their former state of health and in as short a time and safe a manner as any person whatsoever by the best and most approved methods now in practice both in physic and surgery  those of a fresh date the patient must foment as before directed until all swelling and inflammation is gone and the part quite easy which must be kept very clean washing it with warm milk and dressing the sores with some of the detergent unguent spread on lint which is to be repeated every day until the chancre is healed with which and every other day taking of the antivenereal electuary you will be perfectly cured in a little time you may have this unguent of me price   s the box ask for the ointment for wounds  of the phimosis and paraphimosis when the prepuce is swelled so that it embraces the glans that it cannot by no means be drawn back this in greek is called phimosis that is to say a binding sometimes it is so corrugated and lightened behind the crown of the glans that it cannot be brought forward this is called paraphimosis that is to say a ligature round about  where these cases happen there frequently springs up upon the face of the glans which is laid bare in the paraphimosis or upon the margin of the prepuce with which it is covered in the phimosis several watery bladders filled with a thin or thick limph sometimes cccupying the crown sometimes the extreme point and sometimes the side of the glan nay they sometimes arise upon the prepuce or frenum and is attended with pain inflammation and strangury  women in women the labia nymphae clitoris prepuce and the carunculae myrtiformes which beset the mouth of the vagina being afflicted with malignant ulcers are swelled or inflated in the same manner as the prepuce and glans in men  the cure if the parts are much inflamed frequent bleeding at the arm is necessary and to foment the diseased part with milk wherein the flowers and bark of elder have been boiled at least twice a day for half an hour at a time besides this if the patient has time it will will be of great service if after having washed the penis clean he soak it in some bread boiled in milk of a thick substance as hot as he can bare it for a quarter of an hour which will effectually remove the swelling and inflammation and by taking every other day of the antivenereal electuary all other symptoms will vanish  but if the swelling and inflammation should prove so obstinate as not to be removed by the aforesaid means which does not happen to one in twenty it will be necessary to use an anodyne cataplasm and some emolient relaxing paregorical applications are to be made and if the party is disturbed from rest by pain a narcotic must be taken all which remedies may be had of me at a moderate price  tumor of the testicles it frequently happens in a gonorrhaea that one or both of the testicles swells from the restraining or suppression of the virulent semen that ought to flow from the seminary vesicles in the gonorrhaea from this an inflamatory tumor of the testicles is produced  if the venereal poison has concealed itself in the blood the semen will be frequently thickened and stick to the sides of the spermatic vessels in an infinite number of hard knobs from hence proceed the distention and swelling of those vessels and the inflamatory tumor of the testicles this disorder is not accompanied with a gonorrhaea and arises from a hidden pox  the cure to abate the inflammation bleeding in the arm should be frequently repeated according to the age strength and constitution of the patient the testicles must be fomented as in other cases immediately after each time applying a hot cataplasm and on that one of the hot cleaths used in fomenting which keep close to the part night and day unless when fomenting drink of the ptisan and the other liquors proposed before for the gonorrhaea in great plenty the patients diet must be very low that is only of small chicken or veal broth the body if costive with emolient clysters  all purging and stimulating medicines internally and all astringent and repelling externally must be laid aside and anodyne lotions fomentations or cataplasms substituted in their room and if the pain should be acute use narcotics  when the inflammation abates the patient may take a gentle cathartic dispersing the humors by degrees with cataplasms  antivenereal remedies may also now be administered as in the case of a gonorrhaea which by correcting the venereal poison may restore the semen to its native fluidity and heal the disorder  during the application of these remedies the testicles should be supported in a truss least from their weight the the spermatic vessels should be stretched and by that means hinder the dispersing of the semen besides it will be of great ease to the partys walking  what has herein before been related of the several degrees of a gonorrhaea and the method of cure i think may be a sufficient direction to all persons afflicted with any kind of this disorder to cure themselves without being exposed or making their case known to any one  to prevent any symptoms or signs that may show themselves by the running appearing on the patients linen and thereby discover the disorder i advise them to wear a piece of linen three or four times double at the least under the shirt night and day to prevent its being stained and seen by those who wash it which must be secured to the place in such manner as to receive the dripping matter by strings or otherwise as the party shall find most convenient  i imagine if a small opening was made in a sponge of a reasonable size so that the head of the yard might be received in it and the cloth placed over that it would be the securest way to prevent a discovery for the sponge by its nature will imbibe the running and being washed at least twice a day in warm water will always keep clean and be ready to receive the gleeting humor  when you introduce the top of the penis into the sponge have it bare and remember to wash it well every time you clean the sponge  of a dry gonorrhaea or rather the dry venereal dysuria these are disorders that but rarely occur and therefore are but seldom treated of yet i think with good reason that a particular account of these complaints ought to be set forth that all persons who are afflicted with this distemper may be informed of it and the method of cure which being neglected will soon disperse it self through and corrupt the whole mass of blood to the utter ruin of the party and perhaps destruction of a whole family which may be hereby prevented  in this case the patient is afflicted with a sharp burning difficulty in making water without making any discharge of purulent semen or seed or at least with an exceeding small matter for at that time the internal parts of the urethra or urinarypassage suffering great tention and inflammation occasions very acute pain from the urine that flows over it the very urine in the bladder contracts great heat from the inflamed parts  the strangury comes on which is attended with heat pain redness and swelling of the perineum sometimes of the whole penis at other times you have only pain in making water without any other symptoms but without any running and these are either the forerunners of a very vehehement and virulent gonorrhaea or the consequence of a bad one suddenly suppressed by a pretended cure  a third sort of gonorrhaea this is frequently met with in men and is called spurious and in which a thickish purulent matter flows not from the urethra or urinarypassage but from the crown of the glans or extreme part of the penis or yard which is painful and inflamed but is not discharged in so great a quantity as in the common gonorrhaea but yet plentiful enough  women women are also obnoxious to this species of gonorrhaea in which the venereal humor is discharged not from the vagina or urinarypassage as in the common cases but only from the external part of the pudendum or upper part of the privities with a pain and heat in the parts  the cure plentiful and frequent bleeding all the parts of generation should be fomented with warm milk or a decoction of marshmallowroots and linseeds and if baths were prepared after this manner it would greatly forward the cure  as it is impossible that a person should remain always in a bath or be continually fomenting the diseased parts anodyne cataplasms or a poultice of white bread and milk and the yolk of an egg or the pulp of cassia which should be spread largely over the disordered parts so as wholly to cover them and must be frequently changed to prevent their drying  a cooling and anodyne clyster must be given to the patient as occasion requires  it is proper to drink freely of a cooling ptisan and the other liquors before directed  an injection should be thrown up the urinarypassage if it can be without any considerable increase of pain which must be gently tried at first with the anodyne syrup all which may be had of me separate or together and those who are desirous to have a sufficient quantity of medicines for the cure of a gonorrhaea may have them put up together price one guinea  the violence of the disease being abated the wished for seminal discharge or running follows and then must be treated as other virulent venereal disorders before mentioned  in case there should not be a proper discharge or running which for the most part happens in a weeks time more stricter rules must be followed and not to be administered by the parties themselves therefore if those who happen to be thus afflicted will apply themselves to me i promise under god to make a perfect cure of them in the most expeditious manner that the nature of the disease will admit and in so secret a manner as not to be suspected of having any such disorder  spurious the spurious gonorrhaea is to be managed in the same manner as the second degree of infection only with this difference that the parts must be fomented twice a day and kept clean by washing with the lotion recommended for the cure of the first stage of the venereal disorder  of the confirmed pox having given a description of the gonorrhaea i come now to treat of the worst disorder of the venereal disease called a pox in which not one or two parts of the body are disordered but almost every part of it is infected and comprehends such a number of different symptoms that it rather appears to be a world of distempers than one and therefore i shall attempt no farther than to discribe the nature form and disposition of this disease   st the diseases of the parts of generation either increase or break out again from neglect ill short or rather pretended cures of the gonorrhaea by ignorant and unskilful persons otherwise arising anew   d if with the confirmed pox the patient has a violent gonorrhaea the discharge increases callosities or swellings arise in the semenary vessels and urethra from whence proceed impostumations and ulcers   d they break out again where they have been cured the parts of generation afflicted with chancres ulcers warts near the anus arise fci or excrescencies about the fundament in the groin buboes or swellings in the groin tumors or swellings in the testicles of different kinds   th they arise anew where they have not been before   th the color of the skin is altered with pain and spots especially on the breast and between the shoulders of a rose purple yellow or livid color sometimes spreading wide scabs ringworms tetters and many sorts of dry or running pustles   th chops in the hands and soles of the feet itching running with a thin ichor the skin coming off in several pieces like scales   th it is troubled with hard knobs or pustles not rising high but ulcerated at the top for the most part dry but sometimes moist are common on the corners of the lips the sides of the nose about the forehead eyes and temples and behind the ears from whence they spread over the whole head and by degrees occupy other parts of the body but chiefly those that are furnished with hair   th the nails become uneven and being ulcerated drop off   th the internal parts of the mouth throat and nose are disordered all parts of the mouth suffer pain heat and inflammation are eat into by ulcers and a caries is communicated to the bones of the palate by which they are in a short time distroyd which penetrates as far as the nose by which means the spongious and triangular bones thereof with the vomer by which it is supported sink in   th from hence arises a hoarsness loss of speech gums eroded and ulcerated from whence proceeds pain loss of teeth and stinking breath   0th frequent and violent pains especially when warm in bed in the bones joints and tendons which swell out in greater or smaller degrees sometimes soft sometimes hard and truly bony with violent pain at an other time easy to be borne which destroys the substance of the bone  women women are troubled with complaints that are proper to themselves as cancers of the breast suppression or imoderate flux of the menstrua whites hysteric fits inflammations impostumations gangreen ulcers cancer of the womb barrenness or frequent abortion and child born half rotten  from some of which disorders overstraining or weakness of the back and such like a running frequently appears and is not so easily discovered from that which proceeds from an impure coition or other way of venereal contagion which often misleads and deceives the truly virtuous fair who have received such injuries from the ill conduct of their husbands and at the same time are ignorant of it who to conceal their wicked practices never inform their wives of the reality of their disorders by which means they mistaking their disease it daily increases on them and i fear too often ends in their destruction which if timely discovered might have been cured with very little trouble  for prevention of all such sad consequences i advise all females to duly consider their own case and examine it by all the symptoms herein before discribd of a gonorrhaea and also to observe if they have any white flux continue during the time of their menstrual discharge in such cases they may depend upon having received the venereal infection but if the white flux wholly stops during the time of menstruation and returns afterward it then proceeds from some other disorder and not from a gonorrhaea  be sure not to use any astringent medicines before you are duly satisfied of your ailment for should your case be venereal instead of a white flux the gleeting matter being stopped you infallibly bring on a pox  but dont imagine that all these symptoms ever occur at one time or in the same person neither do the worst of them rarely happen to any yet i thought proper to collect them all together the more clearly to show the several degrees of this deplorable disease and that all people afflicted with this extreme part of the venereal disorder might at once view and understand their own case  the cure all sorts of poxes admit of cure many with great ease by the help of mercurial unction which is a most efficatious method of rooting out the venereal poison  but since this tiresome method is generally dreaded we are forced for the most part to attempt a cure after another manner though a great length of time is required in the performance yet with ease and safety to the patient  although whoever follows the instructions given for the cure of a gonorrhaea will never be afflicted with any of the before mentioned symptoms of this last stage of the venereal infection yet as there are many people who have not had the benefit of my neverfailing medicines have fallen into the hands of unskilful persons or neglected to cure themselves at first either by such neglect bad or short or rather pretended cures are arrived at this last degree of the disorder and may want proper instructions to relieve themselves from such complaints without the use of a mercurial unction i shall therefore proceed to give such persons all necessary directions that their case requires  to cure this height of the disease without danger or confinement or weakening the body as little as possible may be accomplished by the great medicine i have for so many years made use of the incomparable specific pills by taking two every other night will abate the venereal poison by degrees until it is entirely rooted out of the body which though it takes longer time to complete yet the patient will be fully recompensed by the easiness safety and pleasantness of the operation and by his being freed from the confinement that must necessarily accompany a salivation these pills are to be had of the author price   s each dose enquire for the pills for the dropsy  the same rules in taking these pills which are wonderful mild in working are to be observed as directed for the other purgative medicines both in the operation and respect to diet until the cure is perfected  there remains a fourth species of the venereal disease to be added to those which we have already described to wit the verrucoso excrescencies of the puaenda which sometimes succeed impure coition but for the most part follow other pocky disorders that have been ill managed  in men they arise upon the whole penis but more particularly upon the prepuce and glans at the corona or near the frenum  women in women upon the whole pudendum but especially upon the labia clitoris prepuce of the clitoris and nymphae in pathies they spring up from the verge of the anus lastly in nurses who receive the disease in giving suck they beset the papillae of the breast  they differ in figure as well as situation if they are oblong slender and round they are called prri if they are round but shorter they are termed verrucae but if they are very smooth and extend into an an oblong area they take the name of condylomata lastly if of a large size and spread in fimbriae and form excressencies like leaves they are known by the title of cristae  sometimes they dry up of themselves and fall off leaving a root behind them from whence they spring up afresh sometimes they are permanent but are flaccid soft and almost void of sense sometimes hard dry rigid horny destitute of sense and perfectly callous but sometimes they are painful discharging something ichorous from their heads and seem to be of a cancerous nature  the cure the patient must bleed take of the specific pills once or twice a week also alternants diluents and attenuants which will correct the heat acrimony and viscidity of the blood using different methods according to the difference of the weather or the disordered state of the fluids  if there is reason to believe that the pox is concealed a regular course of mercurial unction is to be entered upon if your affairs will admit of confinement if not or that you are unwilling to submit to such operation you must be obliged to use internal remedies for a great length of time before the cure will be obtained for which be pleased to consult the author  causticks may be used to consume these excressencies but the pain is hardly to be endured and frequently brings on inflammations therefore to take them off with a knife or scissors is the most certain and easiest way for then the affair is finished in a moment otherwise the pain must be very acute for some length of time but if the patient dreads the knife or scissors he must be indulged with the use of cathaeretics after the incision the sore is to be treated in the same manner as a green wound  all which medicines causticks and dressing may be had at my house on writing for them  concerning gleets they often proceed from former ill or rather imperfect cures sometimes from a seminal weakness and imbecilities of the genitals etc  these disorders are generally the distroyer of virility in men and fertility in women and in length of time cause a whole decay of nature which are infallibly cured by the balsamic restrictive elixir which is neither unpleasant to the taste nor occasions the least disorder to the patient price   s the bottle  this elixir is of so strengthening and sanative a quality that it not only strengthens and comforts the spermatick vessels but revives the spirits warms and restores the genital parts in both sexes not only prompting a desire of coition but also furnishing materials for the performance of the act  women females may hereby most assuredly cure themselves of that troublesome disorder the whites and all other weaknesses of the womb back and urinary vessels only observing not to take it when their monthly visits happen or a day or two before they are expected  we have nothing more to add to this discourse but that the patient relying on the operation of the medicines recommended in this book and the account and character herein before given of them respectively and will punctually observe the directions given in the taking of them and have a due regard to his regimen will be absolutely cured of either gonorrhaea confirmed pox or stubborn gleet and all other imbecilities in the genitals with the greatest privacy as little trouble charge or hindrance of business and perhaps much better cheaper and sooner than by any other medicines now in use and prevent the sad and dangerous consequences of an ill or pretended cure  and by reason neither these nor any other medicines whatsoever will always have the same operation and effect upon ll people but will vary according to the different temperament of the several bodies they have to work upon therefore that all persons who shall purchase my inestimable remedies for all or any of the herein before treated of disorders may surely meet with the desired effect of a speedy certain and safe cure i desire they will from time to time communicate to me by a line the manner their physic operates and the progress of the disease describing the manner and color of the gleet and all other symptoms attending the disorder and they shall receive all proper and suitable instructions and directions from me how to behave and such alterations made in their medicines if any are wanting as the exigency of the case shall require or if they choose rather to call upon me at my house they shall receive such instructions as are necessary for their direction in the method of cure and perhaps more satisfactory than can be done by writing and the rather since i may understand their case the better on a personal view than they may happen to apprehend or be able to discribe themselves  this last favor i request of all my patients for their private good that they may not be delayed and hindered of a cure and then they will assuredly find that my medicines will fully answer the ends for which they are proposed and what i have promised for them which i think will be evidence enough to denote their real worth and excellency as well as the honest and sincere meaning of the author as would be attested by some hundreds that have been cured by them in my two and twenty years practice were it proper in such cases to send one patient to another  those who send letters from the country are desired to send them post paid and they will be answered  errata page    line   for so suddenly read too suddenly page    line    for with emolient clysters read must be loosened with emolient clysters  finis
