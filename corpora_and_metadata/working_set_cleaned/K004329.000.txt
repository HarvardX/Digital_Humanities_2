henry and rosamond  a tragedy  dedicated to sir john philipps bart  by william hawkins m a and fellow of pembrokecollege in oxford  omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se crimen habet quanto major qui peccat habetur juven london printed for william owen at homers head near temple bar  m dcc xlix  to sir john philipps bart sir as the following play comes into the world under some disadvantage i am happy in your permission to shelter it under your name  but though it did not stand in need of your favor and patronage upon many accounts yet it should be remembered that in point of propriety you have an undoubted right to these sheets whether you are considered as a person sincerely attached to the university of oxford or particularly interesting yourself in the welfare of pembrokecollege to the regard and affection of which society you have a double claim both as an ornament and a benefactor  the common topics of panegyric are obvious and i have here a fair and agreeable opportunity of taking notice of those many amiable qualities which adorn you in public and private life and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed but my inclination is corrected by a seasonable thought that most writers of the present age have in this respect a particular advantage over me as it is infinitely more easy to make a character than to describe one  besides it would be needless to enter into a detail of those praises which are already in the mouth of every wellwisher to his country but i cannot resist the impulse of gratitude which points to that part of your character which more immediately affects me your goodnature and condescension to which i am indebted for the honor of your acquaintance and friendship and for your favorable acceptance of the following poem  give me leave to assure you sir that if i am anxious for the fate of this tragedy one principal motive for it is the amusing hope of transmitting to posterity a monument of the regard and veneration i have for the person and character of sir john philipps i am  sir your much obliged and most humble servant william hawkins pemb coll oxon march         advertisement this tragedy having been offered to the managers of drury lane theater who declined accepting it for reasons which appeared to the author to be rather evasive than satisfactory he thinks proper to submit it to the judgment of the public and as he is not conscious of having had the least intention to give offense and no particular passage has been excepted against he begs no other prepossessions in its favor on this account than the reasonable allowances of a candid and impartial disposition the play has indeed received some considerable alterations since it came from mr garricks hands but as these alterations have no manner of connection with what the author presumes was the principal objection to the whole for having had no clear intimation he can only speak by conjecture he does not think himself obliged to explain himself further on that head  dramatis personae men king henry the second prince henry duke of cornwall earl of salisbury lord clifford earl of leicester earl of winchester earl of surry women queen elinor rosamond harriana guards and attendants  scene in and near canterbury  henry and rosamond act i scene i enter the earl of leicester leicester if there is that some call eternal justice  let not the coward thought perplex my soul my bosom entertains two lordly guests strongplumd ambition and hellgenderd lust the voice of conscience against their wild domain is but a whisper to the whirlwinds blast henry plantagenet has balkd my hopes i stand the outcast of his peevishness and disappointed rival of his love but i have deeply laid my plan of vengeance i have been long young harrys oracle his shallow friends walk in my leadingstrings if fate give him the crown i will bear the rule and through the gate of power shall find access to love and rosamond but see lord surry  enter earl of surry surry my lord of leicester have thou seen the prince  leicester no what of him  surry o he is seeking thee thou have fast wedged thyself within his heart he calls thee valiant faithful just and good his greedy ear devours thy eloquence he now demeans himself as we could wish talks of high fame and hardy feats of arms thou have inspired his soul he swears the crown whose glories fade on henrys withered head would better flourish on his youthful brow in troth he is a mettled youth my lord and nature meant him well  leicester ay or how else could we have taught him his own worth or ours or hope to raise our honors from the dust faint hearts will call this treason but my lord it is injured merits cause and we will work to turn the current of our lowebbd fortunes into a fuller channel but he comes and i have joyful tidings for his ear  enter prince henry and earl of winchester p henry well our good friend and trusty counselor what from our uncle scotland  leicester this my liege in princely terms he greets your royal highness and well approves the alliance you have offered but words so please your grace in forced extent are but the texture of fine rhetoric plain action is sinceritys best proof he has encamped his troops on english ground a peerless force of twenty thousand strong the earl of chester with your fathers powers is in full march to meet him  p henry say my lord on what pretense makes he this armament for we must wait the issue of a battle before we can avow ourself his friend  leicester his claims distinct from yours he does demand full restitution of the frontier towns your father wrested from him in the wars and thus he seems no party in our cause while we as time shall serve may back his quarrel  p henry why these are noble tidings and well suit our royal purpose this looks well my lords i will no longer bend me to the brow of this old king my father leicester surry winchester friends companions of my fortunes give me your hands your hearts and trust me lords we bravely shall outface these perilous times assisted by your loves  surry my hasty will is on the wing mocking ability and zeal outstrips performance  winchester and so in honesty of heart says winchester  p henry thanks to you both but my good lord of leicester are these same scots our newcontracted friends such as our honor may lean safe upon  leicester better never mounted glorys steep ascent sir they are bold as the first sons of nature ere pomp and luxury debauched the world bred in a land of poverty and want they live by free uncultivated virtue ease were unnatural to their iron hearts for labor is the business of their lives and when they are summoned forth to serve their prince dreadful they march embodied in the field as the fell storm or deathdispersing bolt that rushes on and levels all before it  p henry it is good and henceforth will we mould our person into the attitude of majesty  winchester it fits your highness well  p henry thou have seen me leicester in the bloom of youth amidst the joys of a voluptuous court where folly spread her silken net before me there softening beauty breathed the amorous sigh there melting music tuned her siren voice and the highflowing bowl foamed with rich wines soliciting even abstinence to taste let me not turn my gallant thought that way when virtues balanced on so nice a poise one breath of inclination turns the scale farewell for ever pleasures nerveless tribe welcome the manly pomp of crimson war the heavenscaling noise of charging foes the piercing groans of bravery laid in duft and all the dangers all the sweets of glory  leicester spoke like a candidate for this worlds empire old harrys foremost boast is only this that he is father to a prince like you  p henry goto he is weak he is weak and peevish leicester and yet it is current conversation here that he has well acquitted him in france to martial chivalry  surry true it is my liege in open field heas twice overthrown their powers and now returns   leicester  ay like a fugitive rather than conqueror the doting hero comes whining like an infant for his toy o he is worse than distaffd hercules where is the honor of your saxon house if harlots make a tool of majesty fame shall record harry succeeded rosamond not harry harry  p henry by the immortal name of my great ancestors it is too much   leicester o give that noble indignation room have you not friends and justice on your side did we not all swear fealty to your highness convened in full assembly by your father or was it but a show of majesty a solemn farce of state for boys to shout at  p henry hold there  for every word thy love has uttered rebukes my tardy soul  o it is most true as spiritless and dulltemperd as i seem this head has born fair englands diadem you all remember twas at winchester in presence of the states of the whole realm the royal grant was made when on this brow rested the imperial crown which should confer high dignity and share of sovereign sway it was the free donation of our father  leicester henry has sure forgotten him of late for then your royal highness may remember he well discharged an office that became him  p henry ay thou do well remind me of it leicester twas at the sumptuous banquet then prepared i sat enthroned the foremost of the feast lord of that glorious day twas then my father stepped forth obsequious like a vassalprince tending my kingly board and sure he cried no monarch ever was served so honorably i whispered in his ear his grace of york that born a prince i thought me not much honored by this same ministry of that dukes son my father was no better  leicester nor is now but in our foolish fears was that same crown you just now spoke of but a may day garland bestowed as on an idiot in mere pastime unnatral insult by the blood that is in you if you have hand or heart or sword revenge revenge yourself your country and your friends your friends for you dishonored slighted scorned your country softened by effeminate rule yourself the stalking shadow of a king  p henry enough my towering fancy grasps the skies hence give the word to fate gird on my sword thou faithful guardian of my wavering youth i will go where thou and honor point the way where are these trusty scots quick let us join them i will unfold my banner to the sun and pour my vengeance on this parentfoe  leicester well said but i must cool this burning vein or this mad youth will hurry us to ruin aside i meant not this i pray your grace be calm  p henry yes as the sea that quarrels with the wind who is it can tame the hungry panthers rage glory has still an appetite more keen harry contends not for a vulgar prize it is a crown repeat it to the heavens with the big mouth of war it is a crown o you should rush like lightning from my presence and boldly pluck it from the tyrants brow  leicester your highness knows our hearts and duty yours but zeal thus premature were worse than treason our growing cause is yet too young to combat with this tempestuous time if fortune bless our good allies with victory the crown is yours by covenant and your right proclaimed by scotlands king till when lie we in secret like the unseen insinuating flame that creeps while it destroys without this caution we are not safe an hour  your father comes and youre withdrawn from court  hah how sounds that  p henry as i love honor i do fear him not  leicester no  but the less suspicions baleful blast breathes on our counsel it takes root the deeper  p henry what would thou urge me to  leicester come come my lord you must yourself to court to meet the king and when he questions you of your departure be you not too submissive nor too high we can find reasons plausible enough besides this disaffection  as  do you mark  the treatment of your mother  the foul scandal of a licentious palace  and the like all provocations gross and sir of this you shall be more advised anon  p henry say so i thank thy penetration  i was hot but thou art wise and brave this craft shall prosper the staunchest hound of state that ever traced the wily doublings of conspiracy in this same chase shall lose his baffled scent and yelp his balkd sagacity in air  leicester may fortune say amen  p henry my lord of leicester we must dispatch some fresh instructions strait for scotlands king then for the court away we will pursue this business come what may exeunt scene ii enter the earl of salisbury and lord clifford salisbury yet hold good clifford  clifford it is an old mans weakness was it not i that trained him up to war that taught his feeble arm to grasp the sword and pointed out the paths that lead to glory was it for this he robbed me of my daughter  salisbury forget it learn to scorn this royal robber and be at peace  clifford it is impossible had he reduced me to the beggars lot or stripped me of the honors of my race i could have smiled at his ingratitude but to deprive me of my greatest hopes to steal away my choicest sweetest flower to tempt young innocence with hellish arts  it is more than pain  it is  what is it not  o it is too much for an old man to bear but can assure me he returns so soon  salisbury each morn expects to see him crowned with laurels and rich with spoils fortune still takes his part wherever he marches palefaced terror stalks with giant strides and leads his van of battle  clifford let me do justice to the man has wronged me my lord of salisbury from his dawn of youth i traced the symptoms of an active soul suited for warlike deeds and brave achievements but then his turbulent passions work so strong his character is ever an extreme a hero or a dotard in excess this day with a deep sense of honor stung halfconvert to fair virtue and the next born by fierce appetite a slave to vice  salisbury his generous temper one day may prevail for fate still throws occasion in his way to put his noble qualities to proof an unexpected tempest from the north hangs lowering over his head and the young prince who breathes a mighty and right royal spirit has with some noble followers left the court  clifford he is ensnared by guileful leicesters art the king thou know has banished him his presence he meditates revenge in all its venom and since arose the league twixt him and harry  salisbury report has said this lord on terms of honor wooed your fair daughters love  clifford he did profess so but much i fear me with a vile design and for full satisfaction but this day i have penned a note in female characters as from my daughter full of blandishments and cordial invitations from her love if i surprise him at the place assigned i shall detect his baseness to his face perhaps i but transcribe the sentiments of her abandoned heart  that as it may  salisbury think not too meanly of thy beauteous daughter henry it is true engrosses all her soul yet in her lonely solitary hours sad she regrets her ruined innocence and mourns like the first fair her fallen state  clifford it is superficial grief a barren soil where reformation never can take root o that an only child should be a curse but let us hence the thought encroaches on me in pity to myself i would divert it cousin this way i have yet more to tell you of what my soul is purposed toward the king exeunt scene iii enter rosamond and harriana harriana this coolness is untimely  rosamond harriana the unpleasing thought will sometimes steal upon me great as they seem all these are dearbought pleasures even henrys love has cost me many a pang peace is the glorious privilege of virtue the harmless country maid that lives retired beneath the covert of a homely hut and knows no view beyond her daily bread has more hearts ease than i  harriana prepostrous melancholy is not the world and its first master yours nature thy handmaid still supplies thy wishes lavish of all her stock as who should say thou shall be happy  rosamond these are mean suggestions know i never sold my virtue but to love the massy store of the wealthpregnant earth the pomp and eyeattracting blaze of courts and all the gilded baits of female pride were bribes my henrys love disdained to offer such as it is this beauty won his heart how he won mine  i know not  but he won it  for him i threw away my innocence and am the scoff of every scornful tongue for him i have stained the noble name of clifford and pierced his aged soul who gave me being for him even now my heart with transport beats his presence ever calms my troubled breast stills each dull thought and bids all sorrow vanish  harriana once more he comes victorious from the field o meet him with thy loves sincerest welcome  rosamond yes he returns and thought adieu for ever hence i defy that tyrant of the mind my love wants not a plea henry my lord is great and generous he is the pride of fame and fortunes darling henry lulls my soul in soft unfelt captivity  harriana but hark yon trumpets voice proclaims him near at hand  rosamond o sweetest music to my ravished ear now every thing begins to smile about me bright seems the season as the newborn spring when every flower put forth its earliest fragrance and infant nature breathed her sweets around  harriana it is now thou risest to thy proper self thy charms are summoned all thy graces dawn and every sparkling beauty beams anew but lo the royal hero  i retire exit harriana enter king henry k henry take me once more my love into thy arms thus let me clasp thee to my faithful breast thus feed my eyes upon thy glowing beauties and pour my soul in transports out before thee what what is fame or victory to this adieu the pomp and pageantry of war and love resume the empire of my soul  rosamond speak not my eyes the language of my heart or shall i open my rich hoard of fondness with all the soft impertinence of love why has my lord so long been absent from me methinks i now receive thee in thy tent dreadfully graceful from the field of blood the manly dew still reeking on thy brow o let me sooth my hero to his rest then kindly chide his eagerness of valor and bid him sheath the sword for love of me  k henry to thee i am devoted from this hour i will give mankind my loose superfluous moments but love shall claim my more substantial care no petty monarchs shall divide us more france and her king have felt the wrath of harry i flew on wings of victory to war and like celestial fire consumed the foe then halted in the mid career of glory conquest was waste of time quick i returned and left the business of the world unfinished  rosamond forgive me henry if i shed a tear a tear at once of pity and of love gaze not thus fondly on me whilst i speak it is a fatal fondness and betrays thee possessed of me art thou not lost to honor where is the native greatness of thy soul thy generous thirst of everlasting glory o had thou never fixed thine eyes on me fame on her brazen tablet had displayed thy royal name and shown it to the stars but i shall blot thy memory for ever  k henry thy kind concern is far too nice my love o rosamond it is but the dream of pride kings and their subjects all are natures children and ermind greatness on the throne must own it what is the monarch more than other men his appetites and passions are the same he hates revenges hopes and fears as they do or does he love o does he love like me it is glory it is ambition to pursue the heavenly fair and win her to his wishes is it not pride to hang upon thy smiles is it not triumph to enfold thee thus art thou not all and is not this world nothing  rosamond i could for ever listen to thy voice whenever thou speak reason gives up the cause and nature whispers what thou say is right  k henry be love the theme and i could talk for ever  rosamond be love the theme i could for ever hear thee  k henry o come my rural goddess to my arms well lie upon the flowrenamelld turf the garlandwreath shall be our diadem the leafclad bower our canopy of state our music the sweet matin of the lark then bless me with the sunshine of thy beauty till i forget my royal occupation the task of greatness and the toil of power and every sense be full of love and thee  rosamond how does thy language charm my listening ears yet must i dread this indolence of thought the scotchmen and their king are up in arms and if report say true the invasion boasts the countenance of your son  k henry fear not my love my better genius shall protect me still lend me thy lip  danger seems nothing now o lead me to some peaceful close retreat where all is calm and gentle as thy breast let hostile war advance and faction rage i will not deign to give mankind a look but safely rest within thy faithful arms so when the pilgrim views the storm arise to the kind shelter of some grot he flies and in that sweet recess securely lies fearless he hears the dreadful tempests roar and madding ocean bursting on the shore the heavens in vain their flaming terrors spread and thunders roll unheeded over his head exeunt the end of the first act act ii scene i enter king henry duke of cornwall and attendants k henry comes on our brother scotland  cornwall yes my liege he means to give my lord of chester battle  k henry be it so our arms shall tame his insolence where is our son his uncurbd spirit of late gives cause of some suspicion yet we hope in humble wise he will confess the fault of his abrupt departure his new friends no friends to me though foes i fear them not he must abandon and mean time we trust a look of our displeasure shall control his heedless folly and enforce his duty  cornwall my liege the queen  k henry i would have shunned her for she awes my soul i know her still a tender faithful wife wronged as she is it is my eternal guilt that love i cannot where i must esteem she comes  why starts my breast  i must assume the cruel port of shameproof villainy enter queen excuse my freedom madam if i ask what business has the queen of england here  queen i come by virtue of a better title was elinor no more than queen of england she had not thus disturbed you with her presence am i naught else my lord  k henry ay you are my wife a name that sounds offensive in my ear  queen why did thou teach me twas a pleasing name importing peace and harmony and joy you loved me when you made me what i am and yet you loved me but to make me wretched  k henry love you have learnt and so all women can did thou ever learn obedience to a husband  queen can malice say i ever failed in that  k henry i prythee then be dutiful and leave me  queen this treatment is unkind is that the voice that often has chid me for a moments absence does it displease thee to behold me thus blame not the weakness which yourself have caused it is griefs allowed prerogative to mourn for sure it is no crime to be distressed  k henry away thy womans tears are lost on me why do thou plead against necessity it was in spite of me i loved thee once and twas in spite of me that i forsook thee the tie of marriage is but personal for love alones the cement of the heart yet grant that contract good my falsehood voids it i am no husband why art thou a wife the bond is cancelled be as free as i am and take thy heart from this ungrateful object  queen can the swift current to its spring recede or elemental fire to earth descend then only my fixed thought can turn from thee my love though ill repaid shall shine a pattern of faith unmoved without reproach for ever henry though cruel yet is henry still what was it but my love that sent me hither i thought i durst not come  but still i came unwelcomd slighted stranger as i am  k henry i see thy virtue and respect it elinor but what is virtue in the eye of love fate wrongly joined us and mismatchd our hearts thou art framed tender innocent and good for private comfort and domestic joy my restless spirit ranges uncontrolled as fancy sways or lawless passion guides  queen and yet thou can be true though not to me that restless spirit rosamond can rule the mistress of my property thy heart throw that detested wanton from thy breast the pride of womans nature sues for this o do not wrong me in the face of day and i will bear thy hate with cheerfulness  k henry thou have the license of an injured wife and it is a womans privilege to rail else let me tell thee elinor twere treason what thou have just now said  queen i ask your pardon i had forgot how dearly henry loves her and it is my duty to promote his joy nor justly can i hate even her my rival woman is frail and henry more than man be happy then blessed pair while i am undone a jealous wife no more shall spoil your loves i will not taint your peace with one upbraiding but lay me down without a groan and die  k henry this tenderness reproaches me yet more than all the just invectives thou could offer o live to scorn the man has wronged thee thus provoke i not thy utmost enmity  queen thou can provoke my sorrows not my hate  k henry have i not given thee cause be but my foe i shall enjoy the sharpness of thy malice but goodness undeserved unasked torments me love honor pity tear my laboring soul aside  queen life had been happy with thee  but it is past and i submit  live and be happy thou  k henry by heaven this moves my stubbornness of temper and rosamond and elinor distract me must i then ruin one whom laws divine and my free choice decreed mine own for ever and coolly mark her close her eyes in death or can i leave the gentle rosamond that tender prime of youth that spring of beauty first won by promise of eternal love painful extreme of madness either way for either way i am doomed to be a villain  queen seek not excuses for thy broken vows i freely give those sacred pledges back nor shall i ever ascribe the pangs i suffer to henrys crime but heavens afflicting hand i know thee great and noble still by nature thou will hereafter reverence my name and praise the woman whom thou could not love  k henry o heart heart heart why art thou not my own had thou attacked me like a fiend from hell armed with keen malice and severest wrath i had not shunned the conflict but as now thou shinest angellike and allforgiving thou do perforce convict my guilty soul and sink my thoughts in black despair for ever o elinor my queen  but soft some news  enter guard my liege the young prince henry waits without and asks admission to your majesty k henry he comes in proper time let him advance enter prince henry well thou young man  with what a lordly look thou make approach  do thou not know me harry  p henry yes sir you are my father and my king names sacred both but still more sacred those of faith and honor these are what enroll the monarchs name in glorys noble list and stamp substantial royalty upon him the imperial robe the brightdeckd diadem the lifted brow the worldcommanding nod ay and the loudtongud voice of acclamation that bears up frail mortality to heaven these all are majestys appendages the dress but not the substance that disgrace the undeserver and but lift him high to a preeminence of splendid shame  k henry what art thou come to preach to us thou boy are these the obsequious terms of filial duty but mark i henceforth warn thee to obedience and therefore satisfy our royal pleasure why thou did leave the court  p henry that is a plain question my mother could have answered  k henry hah our queen thou seem surprised is that a face of guilt speak speak for my shocked soul has formed a thought too black for uttrance  queen by my hopes of heaven for there perhaps i shall at last have peace i only know that i am innocent  p henry i know no more than that and that is enough shall i beseech awhile your royal ear to give me patient audience  k henry well i will hear thee  p henry did henry leave the court not so my liege for henry left a brothel not a court loose riot and intemperance dwelt there softseated indolence and female foppery and pampered jollity with fullblown cheeks keeping high festival and jubilee was it for me to trust my spring of youth that takes impression like the yielding wax with such licentious characters as these was it for me to sink in luxury to see a dimpled harlots wanton reign while banished from your house your board your bed the best of women languishd time away at once a widow and at once a wife i saw her griefs i heard her just complaints i left by her advice thunhallowd roof lest i should seem to abet the injury and triumph over the woes of her that bore me  k henry woman has not her match on this side hell fool to believe a scorned abandoned wife less subtle or malicious than the devil is this the praying dying elinor curse on thy fawning honeysteepd deceit what do thou practice with my secret foes in devilish league do thou foment rebellion say woman do thou  queen what shall i say will thou thou rash hardhearted youth undo me revoke the impious slander of thy tongue and save thy mothers name from foul dishonor  k henry it is too late  i see confedrate mischief this stripling traitor has betrayed thy counsel thee i had long since hated now despise for you our sometime son but that i scorn to waste a thought upon thee i could humble that lofty spirit till its fallen crest should crouch and offer homage to the dust but majesty is fenced with adamant proof against treasons darts that but recoil and mock the force that threw them  it is thus the ocean does but fret upon the strand and the storm breathes against the deepbasd tower  queen will it avail me to appeal to heaven o may its choicest stores of wrath consume me if ever in word or thought i urged this variance he has abused thee with a wellfeignd tale screening some dreadful purpose  k henry peace i say you have fooled me once and would you make me mad hah who shall tame me then by heaven if thought but halts a moment in suspense to doubt thee fullsated sense rebukes it  queen o my son the pain thou gavst me once was ease to this why was thy birthday hailed with general joy why did i bless the sun that saw thee first why did i fondly rear thy feeble age is thy heart flint o yet unweave thy craft ere the sad scheme be ratified above and fate has signed the warrant  p henry let not these fearindited words deceive the king while on my knee i call to witness the guardian powers that shield the lives of princes that not in persnal pique or private grudge or peevishness of appetite restrained or the wild policy of high ambition i sought this breach but in an honest view of duty to a mothers just request and hope to reconcile you to her love  k henry thou lie as well as she  you both meant more  p henry abuse fairspoken honor and even love becomes a malecontent  k henry damned hypocrites ye homebred plagues ye vile intestine mischiefs o had rebellion bellowed in the field and boldly challenged forth the lords anointed i could have calmly met its hottest battle but to reflect on unsuspected treason most unsuspected as unnatural  spreading its poison even within my walls insulting in the sacred name of justice or stabbing with the smiling look of love this grinds my thought  now let confusion reign all order and relation be dissolved and thou o nature turn aside thy face crimsoned with blushes  all my firm resolves are brittle now and patience turns a fury who is there our loving wife and loyal son  queen thy loving wife but most disloyal son to me and thee let me appeal my lord to the fair judgment of your former love did i not ever make your will my law was i deceitful treacherous artful then it is true my wrongs are great but sure no wrongs can alter nature or invert the mind my wrongs call for revenge but sure a queen could well revenge a nobler way than this o take my all my liberty my life but leave me leave me my good name untainted  k henry woman no more have i not heard thy son  queen he is no son of mine  p henry what would the queen so poorly yield her wellcontested right i know thy cause and know my duty better  queen take heed ere yet an injured mothers curse fix on thy bloom of youth  p henry her grief distracts her yet let me quit my honor to the king wherein is my complaint unwarrantable is it rebellion sir to sue for justice which the poor country hind if he but lose his starveling scrap of property demands is this denied your son be the king sure i know my right and knowing dare maintain it  k henry thou have no right to move to speak to breathe but with our royal license cease thou fool to parley with our high authority thy traitorous friends have poisoned thy young ear harry i know them well but mark i charge thee forsake for ever all that vermin tribe or know their rotten counsels will undo thee  p henry forsake my friends hear me allconscious heaven while i renounce the base unmanly thought forbid it justice and forbid it honor not one of them but lives in my best love dear as the vital stream that warms my heart great are their virtues and their persons sacred let the whole world be told my life protects them and here i swear not all the powers combined of earth or hell shall drive me from this purpose  k henry hah did thou ever see thy king in wrath if my large weight of vengeance fall upon thee twill crush thee like an insect into dust what am i braved by thee shall henry walk within the scanty sphere of thy prescription fame stop thy mouth nor be it known abroad that he whose wide circumference of sway in its vast fold embraces nations round was tutored by a boy droop thy head greatness if striplings shall give law to power like mine be wise in time and know young counselor our wisdom pities thy raw youth but learn more low demeanor or thou wilt fire my blood and damn thyself for ever  p henry words are wind still noisy but not hurtful it is that blood that blood of thine that sparkles in my veins forbids capitulation could i brook terms of high challenge i were not your offspring shall i be frighted when an old man storms or fear a peevish father in my foe let majesty shine forth in all its power i dare unmoved behold its fiercest blaze and like an eagle face this burning sun so take thy unregarded threatenings back  k henry still so untamed young man  what hoa our guard enter guard p henry stand off ye ministers of tyranny who dares with impious hand to touch our person i spurn to hells black center  ye vile slaves be motionless at our supreme command see ye not sacred majesty about us sir we well know our sovereign dignity when thus infringed  the crown your grant bestowed with our best force we will till death defend  k henry it is enough  hence from our sight for ever  p henry a last farewell to duty youre obeyed and know if ever more i greet your ear twill be with thunder and the voice of war exit prince k henry impetuous in his folly let him go this notice has diminished majesty see you this night arrest the earl of leicester to the guard i know him well the pillar of the faction our queen still here  in tears  she is innocent  ay and the devils not black  away false woman follow for shame this hero of thy own or curse thy disappointed fraud at home  you have vexed my heart  but rosamond with love shall heal it  to her arms i fly  what do i gall thee with that envied name thank heaven my utmost hate is justice now o elinor farewell rave and despair then die and be thy name forgot for ever exeunt king etc manet queen and shall i then expostulate with heaven mpious and vain no rather let me die perish for him for whom alone i lived and selfacquitted leave the world in peace the watchful eye of providence that sees through nights most sable shade and well discerns each dark intrigue each crevice of the heart shall one day vindicate my innocence and crown my injured love with praise immortal then when i am laid in dust my cruel lord over my cold grave shall shed a pitying tear and own i well deserved a happier fate exit scene ii enter king henry and rosamond rosamond and will you go  k henry but for this night my fair  rosamond this night how many hours are in this night how many minutes in each tedious hour methinks i dare not trust thee from my arms  k henry thou know my love the solemn vow i made i must do penance at the sacred shrine of becket ere i close mine eyes in sleep the holy father of the church enjoined it if i refuse i draw upon mine head curses anathemas and execrations and all the artillery of angry priesthood this once performed i am thy own for ever  rosamond o let my lord excuse my selfish fears for what is henrys safety but my own  k henry why we shall live to triumph over both this traitress queen and fierce hotheaded son but i forget them while i view thy beauty sole comfort adequate to kingly care the soothing freshness of the vernal breeze the lulling notes of dying harmony the rapturous calm of good mens golden dreams bring not such balmy quiet to the soul as thy sensestealing softness  rosamond can my love stray but a moment even in thought from thee joy of my life and sovereign of my wishes such sighs as these within your bosom heaved such lively fondness sparkled in your eyes such tuneful accents trembled on your tongue when first transported at my feet you sighed my royal captive and there swore you loved  k henry thy charms had caught me but some days before let me

members of mankind this monastery is to us our world yon melancholy cells thou see our home there every night in pensive meditation we watch the lamps dull gleam and when we sleep it is but what nature steals from rigid duty till the shrill cock the usher of the morn awakes us to the discipline of day our homely meals are low and regular and while we stay the rage of appetite we starve the dainty palate to be brief wealth business pleasure honor we renounce and all of us are wretches by engagement it is thus we struggle with mortality rather than live what think you of our state  k henry it is all that man can do toward earning heaven it is extremity of wretchedness but yet   clifford ha ha ha  k henry what can provoke thy mirth  clifford your ignorance for in this light thou

the field wellpleased i toiled a rural life away and joyful saw my golden harvests rise but plenty peace and comfort are no more her coward virtue stooped to brutal love i could not bear the shame i left my house the fugitive of choice and not of fortune sick of this worthless world at length i sought this cloister of religious poverty and here i mean to lay down life and sorrow  k henry thy loftiness of soul amazes me who was the villain that abused thy daughter perdition on his head  clifford that cuts me deep my most invetrate foe had spared my fame but him that ruined it i called my friend he was the man i honored from my soul i thought him honest noble just and true but found him treacherous wicked false and base  k henry what means my heart thou had a daughter clifford aside

folly again to riot in my henrys arms and in each fit of wanton dalliance to lisp and prattle over the dismal tale then kiss and make him swear it is pitiful by heaven it makes imagination mad  rosamond witness the power supreme that sees my shame i here renounce for ever henrys love though life itself would thus be dearly bought but i have a fearful reckoning yet to make much from my soul

 rosamond let me but live is that so great a boon i will wander in the world a vagabond turned loose from humankind forlorn and wild each scornful tongue that hailed my happier days shall mock my abject fall i will owe my life to common charity from door to door i will beg subsistence and be proud to feast upon the refuse of gorged appetite and when the wrath of heaven is satisfied and the full term of all my woes expires on the cold flint i will stretch my wearied limbs and bless thy name and die  queen shame of thy sex whom can thy blessings help or curses hurt why do i trifle thus it is resolved inexorable justice claims her right  rosamond it is cruelty not justice thirsts for blood  queen be it which it will it must be satisfied  rosamond what can thou gain by killing me  queen

brand thy name with infamy for ever my hapless lot shall find a gentler treatment and aftertimes indulgent to the weakness that present censure magnifies with malice shall rank me high among heroic

brightest bloom twas that betrayed thee to eternal shame and died thy soul in complicated guilt but tears shall wash the scarlet stains away  rosamond thy charitable care and mild address bespeak my warmest thanks  say my good lord where is my injured father may i hope for once i knew him of a gentle nature he can have pity on an only child wretched and sad as sin and shame can make her for oh  despair will sink me if i die beneath the terrors of his righteous curse  salisbury there yet remains a dismal tale to tell alas my friend thy father is no more but yesterday he died by leicesters hand in his last moments he remembered thee think it an earnest of forgiving heaven he owned his daughter in that fatal crisis and blessed thee with the fervency of prayer  rosamond this was my deed i killed this best of fathers i drove his hoary age to desperation and made his being painful  so is mine  for i am now a burden to myself  yet he forgave me  ponder that my soul it is growing matter for eternal thought  my lord thou know my doom am i to die  salisbury you must prepare to live last night the queen but hypocritical in cruelty beneath the mask of vengeance meant thee mercy that dreadful guard that bore thee from the palace as to thy fate when they conveyed thee hither fulfilled their whole commission in this convent thou must commence the votary of heaven and bid adieu to all the world for ever  rosamond confess my heart the hand of providence plain though unseen in all its acts of mercy here let me first in pious gratitude implore a blessing on her royal head who though my rival was not less my friend may peace and joy and love crown all her hours and when her length of life is fully spun let not death seem a king of terrors to her but like a smiling angel sent to guide her fleeting soul to realms of endless bliss  salisbury thy grateful prayer is just and now o think think what a lesson thou must teach thyself can thou forget the luxury of courts the softening joys of vanity and ease and pleasures sweet enchantment of the mind say can thou quench the fire of youthful love and blot the name of henry from thy heart can thou devote thyself to pious deeds to painful rigid holiness of life to meditation at the midnight hour to constant watchings and long abstinence religious toil that mortifies the sense this is the physic of a sickly soul that labors to redeem its forfeit peace  rosamond o terms of life severe yet merciful the wholesome discipline of penitence shall reconcile me to offended grace will thou thou good old man solicit for me thy pious intercession well shall speed my tardy vows and waft them up to heaven hence i give up the world without a sigh the world what is that i give up henry too the bubble breaks the painted scene is closed and now the calm and sadlypleasing view of peaceful innocence and purer joys and virtue blasted like a beaten flower shocks my remembrance and upbraids my soul  salisbury sense of past vice is future virtues basis and selfconviction at the bar of conscience more awes the wakened mind than the tribunal of solemn justice and the pomp of law methinks i hear the host celestial shout and praise the noble purpose thou have made heaven is not deaf to sorrows piercing voice relenting it beholds the wounded breast and kindly sheds the healing balm of mercy  rosamond thy words distill the honeyd sweets of peace a beam of comfort chears my sinking soul and brighter prospects open to my view folly has sullied my renown of youth but strict severity of thought and action shall change the black complexion of my guilt to snowwhite purity ages to come shall hear my tale with pity not reproach and those who curse the shameful name of mistress shall bless the convert and admire the saint  salisbury if the blessed lot of righteous men above admits of augmentation it will glad thy fathers spirit to perceive this change and give a better relish to his heaven  rosamond from my example let the fair be warned to shun the pleasing snares of lawless love as they would fly the serpents bitter tooth its sweetest pleasures leave a sting behind to virtuous minds religions path is smooth but she that falls like me like me must tread the thorny road of sad remorse and sorrow hail gloomy mansions hail here will i dwell in lonely cloisters and a dreary cell a sad recluse i will waste my youth away steal from mankind and shun the face of day exeunt scene ii enter king henry and attendants at length the holy task is full performed and my freed soul is clear of beckets murder now we may view our royal state at home our brother scotland is our prisoner if we think good we seize upon his crown or bid him reign the monarch of our nod let him attend the sentence of our will for our proud son we trust this late defeat and leicesters death shall clip his towering wing of him we shall think further at our leisure for now more tender thoughts possess my soul to loves soft influence all its motions yield and every passion owns its sovereign master queen of my heart my rosamond i come enter the duke of cornwall hah cornwall why that terror in thy look cornwall pardon my liege the
