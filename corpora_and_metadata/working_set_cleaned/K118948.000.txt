a defense of the ancient legal and constitutional right of the people to elect representatives for every session of parliament viz not only every year once but also more often if need be as expressly required in the old statute and confirmed by the general usage of ancient times demonstrated by the evidence of the original writs for election in a letter to a member of the surry committee  by granville sharp  london printed by galabin and baker number   ingramcourt fenchurchstreet mdcclxxx  copy of a letter to a member of the surry committee dear sir  i have paid all the attention that the shortness of the time would permit in searching and procuring authorities to enable you to oppose the objections lately made to annual parliaments as stated in your kind letter of the   th instant  with respect to the first i e their incompetency now that the empire is so vast and foreign connections so interwoven with us i beg leave to remind you that the empire is not now more interwoven with foreign connections i mean those of europe which alone have power to affect us than they were when annual parliaments and more often if need be were the established law of the land i mean in the glorious reign of king edward iii when several of the richest and most populous provinces of france were the hereditary dominions of the family upon the throne and when the remainder of that mighty and extensive empire with the exception of a very few provinces the great duke of burgundy himself doing homage for his estates belonged absolutely to the crown of england by the right of conquest but the true constitutional answer to the objection is that all foreign dominions acquired by the crown of england ought to be governed by free parliaments of their own duly elected by the inhabitants of each distinct country respectively who have not only the best right but the best knowledge and abilities how to prescribe laws for their own government safety and necessities this is the only true means of removing all difficulty from the government of distant dominions because in the first place it is the only means that is strictly consistent with the natural rights of the inhabitants in each dominion separately considered and also  dly the only means of preventing the inhabitants of such distant dominions or colonies from invading the natural rights of each other which is the source of civil war and disunion and if this most essential principle of our constitution and of natural equity had been regarded by administration agreeably to what i have stated in my declaration of the peoples rights respecting ireland we should not have lost america  the only true means for instance to preserve the british empire in east india which still remains to us is to instruct the sooders and lower casts of the indian tribes concerning their natural right to a share in the government of those countries which they inhabit that their duly elected representatives in a general assembly may have confidence to reject and confute that detestable lie of the bramins by which they are holden in slavery and rendered the prey of tartarian as well as european wolves and tigers  the english company of merchants aided by the british government have at present both power and influence sufficient to effect this and restore them to their rights this would be an obligation never to be forgotten and which would establish trade upon its proper basis and remove all difficulties as well as expense from the government of that vast empire but if the opportunity be too long neglected it may be suddenly lost for ever  with respect to the second objection  the apprehensions of disorder on too frequent elections  the evidence of experience confutes it as i hope i have already proved in the two little tracts see the legal means of political reformation in two tracts p    and    also    and    see also the three last paragraphs of the memorial of the deputies from the several petitioning counties etc wherein it is declared concerning annual parliaments that they were ever described as consistent with the greatest peace and most peaceably conducted and of which the preamble to the wicked act of the  th of king henry vi is itself an ample testimony the legal means etc p     0 because the perverters of the constitution at that time could not say that manslaughter riots batteries etc had then happened as they really do now at our septennial elections but only in the future tense that they shall very likely arise and be they could not complain that there were a number of outrageous people at county elections and therefore they perversely and deceitfully complained only of an outrageous and excessive number of people the epithet outrageous was not applicable to the people and therefore they have deceitfully branded the innocent substantive number with the charge of being outrageous the reason of this is plain the manner of wording the act as it now stands has the effect of an insinuation against the behavior of the people that is to a careless reader and thereby it answered the deceitful purpose of those who framed or translated the act which would have been null and void for want of truth had the adjective outrageous been applied to the other substantive i e people for falsehood in a preamble has the unquestionable effect of destroying the force of any statute  but if the people really were outrageous at elections as well as excessively numerous yet it is certain that they had right on their side and intended the good of the kingdom in general because they have the evidence of all antiquity that the majority of these excessive numbers were generally for sending to parliament the best and most respectable men they could find among them which is not only proved by the testimony i quoted from prynne in p    and    of my first little tract for a more equal representation etc but also by the evidence of that learned antiquarian brown willis esquire who tells us in the preface of his notitia parliamentaria that the knights of shires viz those that were chosen by the outrageous and excessive number of people have ever in all counties been chosen out of the principal gentry and quality and though says he the citizens and burgesses were heretofore elected out of their respective communities and were only the chief and most eminent merchants etc of their own communities or corporate bodies yet in king edward ivs time we find a great many of them distinguished by titles etc this affords a farther answer also to the first objection against annual parliaments  for who are so fit to judge of public affairs now that the empire is so vast and foreign connexions so interwoven with us according to the objectors stating as the principal gentry and quality out of the counties and the chief and most eminent merchants out of the trading cities and boroughs and more especially such knights citizens and burgesses as those of ancient times whose conduct in parliament procured them the honor of being annually returned and sometimes more often for several years together  thus the two first objections against annual elections are manifestly without foundation and with respect to the third that it never was the law of the land so far is this objection from the truth that the deputies from the several petitioning counties etc have in their memorial declared that shortening the duration of the sitting of parliament can only be done consistently with the constitution or with the best policy on any enlarged view by shortening it to the period of a year and they afterward cite the ancient acts which ordained that a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be it savours either of such deplorable ignorance or of such barefaced falsehood and effrontery as scarcely deserves an answer  if i have made any error or misrepresentation in either of the little tracts let the objectors point it out and they will not find me backward to submit to truth for that is my duty to god and man  but to condemn the doctrine in the lump without deigning to give a single reason or proof against it though it is supported by the most unquestionable historical evidence of which many even of the original documents i mean the annual or rather sessional writs themselves do still exist in our public records to this day is such a detestable perversion of truth such a depravity of human nature in the baneful service of our great natural enemy the father of lies that i should hardly have believed my own ears had i been present when the objection was made  persons who discover such impotent malice against truth must be warned of their spiritual danger lest they should be lost for ever  that you may be able more easily to confute such objectors i have sent you brown williss notitia parliamentaria where you will find in the very first table of writs viz that for the county of bedford examples of annual elections for twenty years together in continual succession except in one single instance which omission will be the more easily excused if it be considered that there were two general elections in the year which preceded the year of omission as also two general elections in the year which followed it  the period i refer to is between the   th of king edward ii and the   th of king edward iii in the  th year of the latter reign there were three new parliaments two in the  th two in the  0th two in the   th two in the   th two in the   th and four in the   th year it was an ancient usage of our saxon ancestors to hold provincial parliaments or shiregemots regularly twice a year  for the assembling of parliament which by the institution of king alfred was to assemble twice a year see the speech of sir george crook justice of the kings bench in hampdens trial on ship money anno         and    car two schiregemot or two county parliaments are expressly ordained to be holden on gear i e in a year by the  th law of king edgar and the   th law of canute see lambards archionomia p    and     this affords ample proof not only that new parliaments should be holden every year once but even more often if need be the book contains a great abundance of other examples and though the annual elections were sometimes omitted yet this affords no proof against the peoples right to have them another learned antiquarian mr gurdon informs us in his history of the high court of parliament page     that new summonses were to go out for a new parliament the continuance of parliaments for a longer term without reelection seems to have been begun in the reign of king edward iv after the people had been so cruelly harrassed by civil war that they had no spirit or perhaps power left to oppose that dangerous usurpation of their parliamentary rights by royal prorogations  in preceding times the adjournments or prorogations which words had then the same meaning were seldom for more than a few days   richard ii the same saturday the parliament for certain causes by the commandment was adjourned until monday ensuing and on the same monday it was adjourned until tuesday next following for the like cause at the kings commandment see sir rob cottons abridgement of the records in the tower p  0   n b these adjournments being made by the kings command were manifestly what we now call prorogations at a time and that only on extraordinary and unavoidable occasions as sickness the absence of the king or great lords the neglect of certain sheriffs in not returning their writs   king richard ii the same friday being the  0th of april for that the duke of lancaster and other lords were not returned from the north and for that also certain sheriffs had not returned their writs the parliament was adjourned until the wednesday following and in the mean time the commons were willed to go together to choose their speaker ibid     etc or when the representatives promised to travel to their countries to hold farther conference with their constituents concerning any new device    king edward iii the commons made answer that they knew and tendered the kings estate and were ready to aid the same only in this new device they durst not agree without farther conference with their countries and so praying respite until another time they promise to travel to their countries  ibid p    this last is the very best reason that can ever be given for the prorogation of parliaments as this alone can reconcile with the peoples just rights the reassembling of a parliament without a previous reelection that is when the representatives travel to their countries for the express purpose of conferring with the people and to receive their instructions    once a year at the least this book i have also sent for your perusal and likewise an historical treatise of cities and boroughs by dr brady who bears ample testimony to the means which i have proposed in my first tract for obtaining a more equal representation for he proves that in several counties the citizens and burgesses were chosen in the countycourts with the knights on the day of the knights election in the same court and jointly returned in one indenture especially before the statute of the   d of king henry vi and in some after that etc p     it would be too tedious to give you more proofs respecting the law of the land in answer to the third objection and in answer to the fourth objection  that the whole constitution must be newmodelled to that idea i shall be still more brief having only to add that we are far from desiring that the constitution may be newmodelled we only pray that the unjust usurpations made without the consent of the people the corruptions and other such abuses may be taken away and reformed and then the ancient constitution of annual elections and more often if need be will recover its full vigor without any other alteration  i remain with great esteem dear sir your affectionate friend and humble servant granville sharp oldjewry march       0 to   esquire
