a letter to lord onslow as chairman of the meeting at epsom june         convened to address his majesty on the late proclamation  by thomas pain  london printed for j parsons no    paternoster row  price sixpence        to lord onslow london june   th      sir i have seen in the public newspapers the following advertisement to wit   to the nobility gentlemen clergy freeholder and other inhabitants of the county of surrey at the requisition and desire of several of the freeholders of the county i am in the absence of the sheriff to desire the favor of your attendance at a meeting to be held at epsom on monday the   th instant at    oclock at noon to consider of an humble address to his majesty to express our grateful approbation of his majestys paternal and welltimed attention to the public welfare in his late most gracious proclamation against the enemies of our happy constitution  signed onslow cranley   taking it for granted that the aforesaid advertisement equally as obscure as the proclamation to which it refers has nevertheless some meaning and is intended to effect some purpose and as a prosecution whether wisely or unwisely justly or unjustly is already commenced against a work entitled rights of man of which i have the honor and the happiness to be the author i feel it necessary to address this letter to you and to request that it may be read publicly to the gentlemen who shall meet at epsom in consequence of that advertisement  the work now under prosecution is i conceive the same work which is intended to be suppressed by the aforesaid proclamation admitting this to be the case the gentlemen of the county of surrey are called upon by somebody to condemn a work and they are at the same time forbidden by the proclamation to know what that work is and they are further called upon to give their aid and assistance to prevent other people from knowing it also  it is therefore necessary that the author for his own justification as well as to prevent the gentlemen who shall meet from being imposed upon by misrepresentation should give some outlines of the principles and plans which that work contains  the work sir in question contains first an investigation of general principles of government  it also distinguishes government into two classes or systems the one the hereditary system  the other the representative system and it compares those two systems with each other  it shows that what is called hereditary government cannot exist as a matter of right because hereditary government always means a government yet to come and the case always is that those who are to live afterward have always the same right to establish a government for themselves as the people had who lived before them  it also shows the defect to which hereditary government is unavoidably subject that it must from the nature of it throw government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capacity james the iid and many others are recorded in the english history as proofs of the former of those cases and instances are to be found almost all over europe to prove the truth of the latter  it then shows that the representative system is the only true system of government that it is also the only system under which the liberties of any people can be permanently secure and further that it is the only one that can continue the same equal probability at all times of admitting of none but men properly qualified both by principles and abilities into the government and of excluding such as are otherwise  the work shows also by plans and calculations not hitherto denied nor controverted not even by the prosecution that is commenced that the taxes now existing may be reduced at least six millions that taxes may be entirely taken off from the poor who are computed at onethird of the nation and that the taxes on the other twothirds may be very considerably reduced  that the aged poor may be comfortably provided for and the children of poor families properly educated  that fifteen thousand soldiers and the same number of sailors may be disbanded and allowed three shillings per week during life out of the surplus taxes and also that a proportionate allowance may be made to the officers and the pay of the remaining soldiers and sailors be increased and that it is better to apply the surplus taxes to those purposes than to consume them on lazy and profligate placemen and pensioners and that the revenue said to be twenty thousand pounds per annum raised by a tax upon coals and given to the duke of richmond is a gross imposition upon all the people of london and ought to be instantly abolished  this sir is a concise abstract of the principles and plans contained in the work that is now prosecuted and for the suppression of which the proclamation appears to be intended but as it is impossible that i can in the compass of a letter bring into view all the matters contained in the work and as it is proper that the gentlemen who may compose that meeting should know what the merits or demerits of it are before they come to any resolutions either directly or indirectly relating thereto i request the honor of presenting them with one hundred copies of the second part of rights of man and also one thousand copies of my letter to mr dundas which i have directed to be sent to epsom for that purpose and i beg the favor of the chairman to take the trouble of presenting them to the gentlemen who shall meet on that occasion with my sincere wishes for their happiness and for that of the nation in general  having now closed thus much of the subject of my letter i next come to speak of what has relation to me personally i am well aware of the delicacy that attends it but the purpose of calling the meeting appears to me so inconsistent with that justice that is always due between man and man that it is proper i should as well on account of the gentlemen who may meet as on my own account explain myself fully and heartily thereon  i have already informed the gentemen that a prosecution is commenced against a work of which i have the honor and happiness to be the author and i have good reasons for believing that the proclamation which the gentlemen are called to consider and to present an address upon is purposely calculated to give an impression to the jury before whom that matter is to come in short that it is dictating a verdict by proclamation and i consider the instigators of the meeting to be held at epsom as aiding and abetting the same improper and in my opinion illegal purpose and that in a manner very artfully contrived as i shall now show  had a meeting been called of the freeholders of the county of middlesex the gentlemen who had composed that meeting would have rendered themselves objectionable as persons to serve on a jury before whom the judicial case was afterward to come but by calling a meeting out of the county of middlesex that matter is artfully avoided and the gentlemen of surrey are summoned as if it were intended thereby to give a tone to the sort of verdict which the instigators of the meeting no doubt wish should be brought in and to give countenance to the jury in so doing  i am sir with much respect to the gentlemen who shall meet their and your obedient humble servant thomas
