now submitted to the public of the encouragement he experienced on that occasion it might be highly improper to speak with confidence at this moment lest the sincerity of his motives should be misconceived whether he is entitled to expect the like degree of countenance as before must rest alone with the candid reader to decide for his own part he will be content to say that the favorable reception which the epitome of the insects of china met with was an irresistible inducement with the author to undertake a similar illustration of the insects of india and that whatever may have been ultimately his success he has not been less solicitous to render it in every respect as interesting and complete as the former work  various arguments might be adduced in behalf of the present publication to one of which we cannot refrain adverting it becomes our peculiar province at this time to awaken the public curiosity to a subject of no mean importance we are about to consider with attention the entomological productions of a country for which we ought to cherish the liveliest and deepest interest as being connected intimately with the prosperity the dignity and honor of the british empire  in a word of british india that invaluable portion of territorial domains so long retained in our possession and finally confirmed to us by the brilliant career of glory that has so recently crowned the exertions of british valor in the eastern world not that the author can be disposed to attach any greater degree of consequence to the subject of indian entomology in particular than it may really merit from the contemplation of events of such vast political magnitude as those alluded to he is only inclined to entertain the opinion that a work professedly treating upon the natural history of a country in which as a nation we have such an immediate interest will not be thought destitute of some legitimate claim to public protection further still he must believe that a work which from the extent of its design and style of embellishments is calculated to display the entomology of india to advantage will not prove unacceptable and as no attempt has been hitherto made to elucidate this beautiful tribe of creatures in a similar manner that the present work may become hereafter of some utility at least to many individuals who reside in india as well as to the naturalist in this country  that the epitome of indian insects is not entirely confined to those found in such parts of india as are in the british possession should be clearly stated since it embraces on the contrary the most choice selection possible of those which inhabit every other part of that vast continent and also the islands situated in the indian seas the far greater number of insects included in this selection are described and figured from specimens in the cabinet of the author that were originally collected by the late duchess of portland mr tunstal governor holford many

linnaeus and published at upsal in the year      under the title of bigas insectorum etc this paper contains likewise a description of the diopsis genus which together with the pausus are unquestionably two of the most singular genera of the many tribes of insects hitherto discovered both may possibly derive some additional celebrity also from the recollection that the dissertation in which they are inserted concluded the entomological labors of that distinguished naturalist it was the last he ever published in the department of zoology  in the dissertation alluded to the pausus genus is exemplified by the species microcephalus diopsis by ichneumonea a plate with figures of both which drawn by j afzelius and engraved by berquist accompany the descriptions it is to this plate and the original descriptions of linnaeus that fuefly is indebted solely for the account he gives of both these genera in his archiv der insectengeschichte printed at zurich in      the figures are precisely copies of those engraved by berquist as are likewise those contained in the french translation of that work which afterward appeared in paris indeed as professor afzelius has suggested from the repeated errors that appear in those works in translating the linnaean observations defining the character of the pausus genus etc it is very likely that neither fuefly nor his translators herbst gmelin and some other writers who have treated on it ever saw an insect of the pausus genus the same might be truly said of the diopsis genus also  thunberg during his travels through the country of the hottentots in      found two coleopterous insects which he conceived with much propriety ought to be referred to a new genus neither of those established previous to his departure from europe by linnaeus being calculated to admit them but on his return to sweden he found that linnaeus in his absence had described that of pausus or as he called it paussus to which they might be referred an account of these was afterward inserted in the transactions of the royal academy of stockholm for      this paper is accompanied with a figure of only one of the insects mentioned lineata a species very aptly named from the distinct longitudinal streak on each of the wingcases and which is clearly of the same natural family as the linnaean pausus microcephalus the other insect described by thunberg he calls ruber  fabricius consigns these with the linnaean insect to his genus cerocoma  the latest history of the pausus genus is from the pen of professor afzelius a learned copious and elaborate paper inserted in the fourth volume of the transactions of the linnaean society he describes pausus microcephalus and also another kind which he found in africa and names sphaeroides we may justly regret on the perusal of this excellent paper that only two species of the pausus were known to this writer  neither of those insects are allied to the four following species which appear to be entirely undescribed for this important accession of new species to a genus heretofore so little known and in consequence so imperfectly understood we are indebted to the active and praiseworthy zeal of mr fichtel in compliment to whom one of them is named fichtelii they were all found in the vicinity of bengal  pausus denticornis is clearly of the same natural family as the rest having the same kind of biarticulated antennae the club is even much larger in proportion than in the others and the lateral pointed process more conspicuous yet according to the character laid down by afzelius this should not be admitted into the pausus genus the number of joints in each of the tarsi or feet amounting only to three and on the contrary in the three others they are five in number notwithstanding that without very close inspection they appear to consist only of four from this circumstance we are of opinion that the linnaean character while it passes clear of the prolixity of that established by afzelius is perfectly sufficient antennae clavatis biarticulatis clava solida uncinata or with the omission of clava solida it might be still more applicable  pausus thoracicus specific character

fichtelii are pretty nearly alike in other respects and may be of the same species differing only in the sex the most striking difference prevails in the structure of the antennae the excavation in

constantly contrasted with another of crimson and which as the violet changes to blue or green alters its aspect to a still more vivid expanse of gold each of those colors the blue and red are

other cabinets of exotic insects and ventures to deem his specimen unique  in the course of our remarks on the fulgora so abundant in china f candelaria our attention was naturally directed to the astonishing property some insects of this genus are known to possess that of emanating light and it was to this insect we alluded in particular when speaking of one from interior india that enabled us to extend our observations on that property the trunk is large of a dark purple thickly sprinkled with spots of white phosphoric powder and the apex which is scarlet and somewhat pellucid still retains a reddish glow that almost convinces us the creature when living could diffuse light both from the apex and the spots in admitting this conjecture without wandering into the mavelous its nocturnal appearance must be infinitely more singular than either of the known species of fulgorae lampyrides or any other luminous insect yet discovered for when on the wing the illuminated apex would resemble a globule of fire or heated iron and the numberless phosphoric spots on the tube form a train of glittering stars to accompany it as it may be thought improbable that any insect can exhibit such an extraordinary appearance the words of olivier on some species of lampyrides may not be unsatisfactory the insects are certainly very distinct but reports of travelers countenance an opinion that the phosphoric emanations are analogous in the species of both genera the phenomena produced by a natural phosphorus is still more wonderful in some foreign species in which the males shine and being provided with wings will produce in their rapid flight a thousand small stars  olivier histoire des insectes   the only figure of a fulgora in any respect resembling this species is

described by the accurate linnaeus and dr shaw exhibited the like appearance the specimen of the winged insect in our cabinet has been preserved however with more than usual care immediately after the death of the creature as we have reason to suspect the abdomen had been opened and so nicely excavated that no portion of the entrails or oily fluids which would have inevitably destroyed the true

anterior part of the abdomen and legs ferruginous two spines on the posterior extremity of the thorax  diopsis ichneumonea nigra capite abdomine antice pedibusque ferrugineis thorace postice bispinoso  the appearance of this curious insect is peculiarly striking nothing can be more singular than the disposition of the eyes which are situated at the extremity of two long immovable pedicles arising from the head most exactly in that part which in other insects bears the antennae in this particular the diopsis differs not only from other insects of the kindred genera but also from all the other kinds we are acquainted with some few of the cancri etc have indeed the eyes placed at the extremity of elongated pedicles as is for example instanced in the cancer angulatus yet these are obvious dissimilar in construction for they are moveable at the base and may be directed toward any object at the will of the animal with the utmost facility but to accomplish this the motion of the pedicle in the diopsis must be necessarily accompanied by that of the head or even of the whole body the eyes of the latter are notwithstanding so conveniently stationed at the globular extremity of the pedicles as to embrace a far more comprehensive range of sight than is usual with the generality of insects  to the inexperienced entomologist the diopsis would rather seem to be furnished with remarkable horns and be destitute of eyes although the latter are so very conspicuous when they are pointed out it is on the contrary the true horns or antennae that are so minute as to be most likely to escape attention for each of these consists only of a single setaceous hair or bristle seated on a very small tubercle just beneath the eye  it has been previously intimated in the description of the pausus denticornis that the first account of the diopsis was inserted in a small tract published by linnaeus at upsal in      from this we learn that both the diopsis and the pausus were found by andreas dahl among a parcel of insects in the possession of dr fothergill of london by whom they were sent to linnaeus these consisted chiefly of insects collected in north america and guinea but the habitat either of the pausus or the diopsis in particular it is very certain was by no means exactly known fuesly notwithstanding describes the latter upon this ambiguous authority only as a native of cayenne and after him gmelim notes the same insect from south america and guinea perhaps with as little reason latreille tells us it is from the coast of angola on the information of perrin a zealous naturalist of bordeaux our own specimens and they are most assuredly the diopsis ichneumonea of linnaeus were brought from bengal where it was discovered by mr fichtel who has thus established the habitat of this singular creature beyond dispute  linnaeus to whom only this individual species of diopsis was known as usual with him under such circumstances does not assign to it any specific
