view with an inn enter carlo air though up to the ears in sore disasters poor servants must obey their masters still born to move at their command must neither lie nor sit nor stand nor speak nor think but as they are told but headlong go through hail and rain and frost and snow nor once complain though trembling quaking shivering shaking they catch their death with cold it is now eight days since here we come i thought to have been quite at home but for a whim to pleasure him slapdash am i sent back to rome but pleasures are his only guides while i am bruised head back and sides having put up my horse my next care is to see after my master signor lelio who i dare say expects me with impatience twas here i left him  but here he comes   enter lelio lelio ah carlo i am glad thou art returned   carlo i dont doubt it sir for you must have been in a thousand frights and fears but the portrait is found sir it is found and all our cares are over   lelio coldly give it me   carlo there devour it with kisses  seeing lelio put the portrait in his pocket without regarding it heyday how you receive it   lelio as a thing become perfectly indifferent to me   carlo the devil  why whence comes this change when signor ascorino your father gave it you at naples zounds there was no keeping you within bounds you had your best bib and tucker on in a minute   lelio i confess it   carlo the character he had given you of isabella and the sight of her picture had so sired you you must set out to leghorn to see her that very moment   lelio all this is true   carlo it is indeed for away we decamped immediately from naples and came posthaste here on our arrival you perceived you had left the portrait of isabella at our inn at rome so not daring to appear before her without it away i was dispatched as if the devil was in me to fetch it i have brought it back to you and now you put it in your pocket without looking at it   lelio i agree to this i will even tell thee that impatient to see her so far from having the resolution to wait thy return the very day after thy departure i set out to her house though i had not the portrait   carlo i guess what followed the painter was remarkable for taking handsome likenesses i warrant you   lelio no i have not seen her on my way i met with a person who took away all my inclination   carlo a person   lelio yes a very respectable person a young gipsy who offered to tell me my fortune   carlo oh i understand you she looked at your line of life and found there certain crosses something in the shape of horns   lelio no no carlo twas in looking in my face she did the business not in my hand   carlo how do you mean   lelio that my heart was stolen by the charms of this beautiful gipsy who appeared to be a divinity   carlo oh some pilgrim i suppose who knows very well how to sell her cockleshells   lelio thou art deceived she has not less wisdom than beauty imagine to thyself all the attractions all the graces together this is spinetta she receives your praises with an honest disdain and if you are too free she opposes to your vivacity an agreeable severity   carlo that is as much as to say she holds the sugarplumb as high as she can   lelio alas why is not her birth equal to her merit   carlo that is right signor lelio push the matter further be a perfect hero in this business and persuade yourself she is some princess in disguise whose misfortunes have reduced her royal highness to stroll about the country to tell fortunes and steal pigs and chickens   lelio truce to pleasantry  i confess it agrees but little with my birth to have a passion so delicate for a gipsy but i am so entirely conquerred that let what will be the consequence i can think of nothing but her and the means of pleasing her  air why am not i that fragrant flower near to her heart spinetta placed which proudly living a sweet hour died on that bosom it had graced why am not i that gentle gale which plays around her coral lips her breath like violets to exhale which there eternal nectar sips why am not i that crystal wave at sultry noon with pride which heaved to which her heavenly form she gave which though twas venus it received gods had i been the limpid stream  but whither do my senses rove sunk in a dear delicious dream i would be all to please my love  carlo oh brave and where does this wonderful creature live pray sir   lelio just here with a brother named clarin an honest and worthy lad   carlo oh like sister like brother i dare say   lelio and they are at the head of a band of gypsies   carlo who are also very honest no doubt  zounds you are got into a great deal of very honest company since i left you   lelio peace i see spinetta coming this way with laura her companion  how my heart beats  draw aside a moment before we accost them   lelio and carlo retire enter spinetta and laura spin yes laura lelio pleases my brother and i love him but that is not enough i must have every proof of his affection while he believes me a gipsy twill be a painful trial but it is necessary   air loves a cheat we overrate it a flattering false deceitful joy a very nothing can create it a very nothing can destroy the lightnings flash which wondering leaves us obscured and darker than before the glowworms tinsel which deceives us a painted light and nothing more laura i approve your delicacy what joy for lelio when he finds    spin hush he is here leave us exit laura signor lelio i was searching for you to bid you adieu   lelio how adieu   spin my brother is determined to leave leghorn immediately   lelio ah my dear spinetta what frightful news and with what barbarous tranquillity you tell it me   spin would to heaven i could be as indifferent as you think me but it is time to discover my sentiments i cannot depart without telling you that i am not insensible to your love   lelio i will follow you to the end of the world   carlo the mans gone mad   spin no lelio i forbid you after the confession i have made what must you think of me you must forget me   carlo hang me if she is not a very sensible girl   lelio alas i cannot your cruel kindness has taken away every hope let me follow you   spin my delicacy will not permit me   carlo the delicacy of a gipsy oh dear  smothering a laugh lelio my life depends on it   spin and my virtue which is as dear to me as my life will not suffer me to let a man accompany me who is not my husband   lelio that shall be no objection   carlo the devil it shant   spin the son of a nobleman marry a gipsy   carlo very true my little dear twould be a damned shame would not it   lelio love confounds all ranks   spin suppose i consented how would it look for you to put on the habit of a gipsy and live like us   lelio how spinetta  surely after you were my wife you would not think of continuing the state of life in which i see you at present   spin you are mistaken i cannot resolve either to quit my brother or his fortune we must therefore part it is a cruel stroke but fate will have it so besides how can i flatter myself that your love is any other than the effect of youth and vivacity   air praise is a mirror that flatters the mind that tells us of goodness and virtues and graces as that on our toilet instructs us to find the dimples and smiles which appear on our faces to which our attention we cannot refrain though we draw off confused yet but see its attraction in spite of ourselves we return back again regard are abused and receive satisfaction i know i am deceived and i say to my heart you believe that sincere which is naught but profusion call pleasure what soon will severe make you smart and hug that for a substance you will find but delusion your praises are flattery i know it as plain as if you had said i am false and deceive you but truth reason every thing argues in vain for such is my weakness i blush and believe you exit carlo this is all very well now sir i suppose i must go to isabella and announce your arrival must not i   lelio i will marry her   carlo isabella sir   lelio spinetta blockhead   carlo oh lord sir all the court of naples will be charmed to hear what an honorable choice you have made   lelio say another word and i will   drawing his sword carlo upon his knees dear sir i beg your pardon you are right perfectly right sir please yourself get little gypsies and let the world talk and be hanged   lelio alas carlo instead of insulting me with railleries and reproaches pity me rather do you believe i yield without remorse to this passion no it is impossible to describe the conflicts in my mind betwixt reason and love   reenter spinetta spin well lelio i have consulted my brother and he thinks as i do that we ought to part and is coming to bid you adieu   lelio no spinetta i can never part with you i consent to all you ask   in pronouncing these last words he pulls out his handkerchief and drops the portrait of isabella carlo picks it up and endeavors to hide it spin what is that   carlo nothing at all   spin i suspect something and will see snatching it out of carlos hand ah it is a portrait and of a very pretty woman too   carlo lord it is only the portrait of his grandmama when she was in her teens   spin you seem uneasy lelio what ought i to think of this   lelio dont judge too rashly hear me a moment   spin i will hear nothing   lelio let me undeceive you   spin i am undeceived   carlo nay hang it madam gipsy you are a little unreasonable this bout to refuse to hear is not the way to know the truth let me get between you and i will set the matter to rights in a moment  when he sings to lelio he imitates spinetta and when to spinetta he imitates lelio air what villainous trick you inconstant young log to pass on me thus do you mean to lelio none at all or may i be hanged like a dog my pretty egyptian queen to spin then tell me what slamekins picture is this which out of your pocket you drew to lelio it is a cousin i have left i sweart by this kiss attempts to kiss spin to run round the country with you to spin youre in love with her then and shall i but have part your nasty eyes out i could claw to lelio no beautiful flower of that garden my heart isabella i never yet saw to spin were i certain indeed that it is true what you say and that this is not one of your nimps  to lelio it is true love or may i be taken away by the devil and all his imps to spin this being the case your anger abates and then you kiss and are friends   lelio he tells you the truth   spin this i must search into   lelio i desire no better   enter clarin clarin signor lelio i come  but you seem moved both of you have you any cause of dispute   spin yes brother and this is the subject lelio dropped a portrait which he says is that of a cousin he has never seen and to whom he was to have been married   clarin heavens it is the portrait of isabella and do you really prefer my sister to so much beauty   lelio was my cousin a thousand times handsomer i would make her that sacrifice with pleasure   clarin and for me i would prefer your cousin to all the women i ever saw   lelio you prefer my cousin what does he mean   clarin your astonishment will cease when i inform you i have seen your cousin that i had the good fortune to do her a material service that i have resolved to pay my addresses to her and that this habit only has prevented me from having had a second interview with her   spin but that obstacle is now removed and you may see her whenever you choose if signor lelio will consent to it   lelio who me  you joke spinetta   spin not at all as you have never seen your cousin my brother may very easily pass for you   lelio for me it cannot be   spin why not he need but have the portrait to introduce him he can deport himself like a gentleman i assure you sir nor will isabella have any suspicion of the trick   lelio a man of the calling of your brother i cannot consent to it   carlo nor i neither damn me they have a design against the whole family  would you wish maam that any body should marry his father he is devilish rich i assure you   spin well what do you say lelio   lelio dont oblige me spinetta to represent to you the absurdity of this project   spin your resistance betrays you lelio you have an attachment for isabella   lelio it is not that you take that for the effect of love which is only a principle of honor the disparagement is too great a lady of quality marry a gipsy   carlo oh ho you begin to feel it now   spin say no more i exact nothing from you keep your noble pride you have need of it yourself i would have abandoned for you the greatest princes upon earth and you are always refusing every thing i request of you   lelio but consider    spin go ungrateful you dont merit the heart of spinetta leave me and vaunt to isabella your scrupulous attention to her honor she will pardon the contempt you have had for her charms come my brother  adieu noble lelio if you think your cousin ought to disdain a gipsy such as my brother believe me a gipsy such as i am can disdain you in her turn  air go proud lover go take your heart back again for me it is too low too unworthy a chain be haughty imperious this gipsy despise you rise but to fall while i fall to rise true love never erring has no selfish fears that the more it is conferring the nobler appears it has no sordid views no vile ends for its guide it is ungoverned by interest uninfluencd by pride  exe spin and clarin carlo what a devil of a spirit she has   lelio i will persist even if i lose her   carlo that is right sir   lelio i will after and reason her out of her absurd folly   carlo zounds sir dont go to spoil all   lelio never fear i will represent to her the extravagance of such an idea   carlo ah that is as much as to say you will consent to whatever she pleass   lelio no no this has waked my senses out of the lethargy in which they have been entrancedstay here while i bid her adieu for ever  air yes yes thank heaven i have broke my chain and while my liberty i gain while i my heart redeem indifference succeeds at last and my egregious follies past appear an idle dream thus from a perfidious snare the linnet timid unaware hardly escapes with pain the feathers he has left behind are lesson to him to remind not to be caught again the warrior bravely counts each scar describes the peril of the war well leasd his dangers over the slave at last exempt from pain with smiles beholds that very chain which held him to the oar  exit enter laura carlo a noble resolution and courageously taken what a pity it is that one hypocritical tear should overturn it  the devil fly away with all the gypsies upon earth i say   laura i thank you for the body in general and myself in particular   carlo you are welcome my dear if it was ten times as much   laura then this gipsys dress that i have brought for you i may take back again   carlo you may indeed   laura and why so

as my master   laura and that is saying a great deal   carlo it is done i sacrifice my aunt my cousin my grandmother and all the whole shop   laura what a happy woman am i   carlo yes well go and leap over the stick as soon as you please  but all that troubles me is how the devil you do to tell peoples fortunes   laura oh there is nothing in the world so easy   air when we promise an heir or a miser this gold that his fathers free land we pause and look grave to seem wiser and his fortune read in his hand if miss at fifteen would discover when she will like her mother be wise to promise a handsome young lover her fortune we read in her eyes but if husbands with jealousy quaking would know if they are  you know how we consider  our heads gravely shaking  and their fortunes read on the brow carlo so according to this i have only to tell a married woman her husband will die before her a young girl that she will soon get married a physician that he will have a great many patients a

only cause of our putting on these fools frocks   isab heavens is not this lelio then   carlo no more madam than it is your great grandpapa it is the brother of this pretty lady and he has taken my masters name to impose upon you   enter the governor and attendants gov to lelio it is you i suppose who are at the head of these gypsies   lelio why that demand sir   gov i have an order from the grandduke to pass you into sicily where you are expected   clarin my lord it is to me you ought to address yourself i am alphonso that unfortunate prince for whom you seek i vainly believed by my flight and my disguise to save my life from the cruelty of the king of sicily he is not content to have executed my father for his attachment to manfroy he demands my life and you may take it   gov my lord i am not come with any such disagreeable news the king is dead and the son of manfroy is placed on the throne the new king who loves you knowing you were flown with the princess matilda your sister having made search for you every where at last discovered that you were both at leghorn with your faithful domestics disguised as gypsies in consequence of which he has written to the grandduke from whom i have an order to offer you on his part all that may be necessary to convey you to palermo   carlo oh these ragamuffins turn out to be princes after all   clarin charming isabella will you

lelio ah madam may the amorous lelio flatter himself that the princess matilda will approve the tenderness of spinetta   spin doubt it not when i told you i would abandon princes for your sake you little believed i had done so already   carlo now for me and will the amiable laura first lady of honor to the princess matilda deign to cast a twinkle of affection upon the lovestricken carlo as lord of the bedchamber   laura as you have followed the example of your master i think i cannot do better than imitate my mistress   finale isab our vessel has its port in view if here no hovering tempest lours we have others fortune told  but you must be the arbiters of ours do not our wishes disapprove but let them have their freest scope our piece has the effects of love for subject and for moral  hope  lelio hope scorns misfortunes the most rude with hope the veriest wretch is blessed and poets write that every good is better  hoped for  than possessed hope cheers the most dejected hearts can even despair itself control it is on that course the lover starts of his desires to reach the goal  spin of sand a poor neglected grain bewailing did its fortune curse i am the vilest atom lain upon the face of the universe but succouring heat and fruitful showers this atom to a diamond brings  and now in brilliant pride it towers upon the heads of persias kings  carlo thus the effects of hope we preach but words alas are empty air for while that height we fain would reach your frowns would sink us to despair one kind resounding cane or hand to flattering hope gives instant birth applause will raise our humble band and give the gypsies real worth    finis
