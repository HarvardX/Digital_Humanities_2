the northernstar a poem  written by mr hill  london printed for e berington at the crosskeys near essexstreet end in the strand and j morphew near stationers hall mdccxviii price one shilling  the preface to mr pope sir i am so little inclined to trouble even men of merit with the address of such trifles as these that it was impossible i should so much as have thought of yourself with that view if honest bernard your bookseller had not informed me that you i suppose it was out of the fullness of your known zeal for our church and constitution had taken upon you to assert that printing any thing in praise of the czar of russia would be received as a satyr on the government  it is possible that under this disguise of opinion your excess of goodbreeding may have concealed your dislike of the performance for i find it a difficulty to conceive how so whimsical an objection could come into a head so well stored with judgment as we are to conclude yours to be from your essay on criticism  let either of these sage cases be the right i consider their importance as equal and take this occasion with a frankness like your own to assure you that my esteem for your genius as a poet is so very considerable that it is hardly exceeded by my contempt of your vanity  what led me to embrace an opportunity of knowing your opinion was a disposition which two lines in your essay abovementioned shall explain for me  trust not yourself but your defects to know make use of every friend  and every foe i could not i confess consider you as a friend having that very great misfortune to languish under of not being reckoned in the number of your acquaintance but in the last of the two lights i presumed i might regard you since mr dennis for whose skill in judging i profess an esteem has assured us that you are a kind of foe to every body but yourself and on that foundation supports his rough attempt to pull the lyons skin from a certain little ass he there mentions and i fear he means you sir  when i considered you in this character i made no doubt but any poem would have had the good fortune to come out of your hands well examined that i should have heard of rough verse improper sentiments and a world of poetical errors but i profess your penetration overshot all my fears and i cannot find words to express my astonishment at your capacity when mr lintott lispd out that mr pope said there were several good things in the northernstar but it would be taken for an insult on the government for though the czar is king george s ally yet we are likely to quarrel with sweden and muscovy whispered bernard lies he says in the north  if this pleasant discovery was your real opinion we must i am asraid learn to pity the weakness of a judgment which i know is heroic enough to wish rather for envy though a sturdier passion and agree with you heartily that  a little learning is a dangerous thing but if you disliked the poem as a poem why did you not fairly avow the disrelish i could have owned a conviction of error with the same satisfaction i feel when i repay a civility shall i put you in mind that dislike not owned openly stands condemned by a judge whose sentence mr pope of all mankind will be the last to appeal from  be niggards of advice on no pretense for the worst avarice is that of sense with mean complacence never betray your trust nor be so civil as to prove unjust pope s essay on criticism  i must by no means imagine that a supercilious result from neglect of examining into the merits of a cause he pretends to decide can he charged with any justice on the author of the following lines unless he was religious enough to write them with design to lash himself by way of penance  of all the causes which conspire to blind mans erring judgment and misguide the mind what the weak head with strongest bias rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools whatever nature has in worth denied she gives in large recruits of needful pride in short if i writ verse often enough to make my vanity rampant i should shrewdly suspect that you were mightily taken with this poem since you thought it worth your while to give it an ill character for you who rever iie have told the world and i suppose you assert nothing but from your own knowledge  that still the worst with most regret commend and each bad writer is as bad a friend and while selflove each jealous writer rules contending wits become the sport of fools but if i was not afraid that you would think me illnatured i would observe in your favor on this occasion that though all these foregoing verses are your own words they way posibly be very different from your sentiments for i remember that among the rest you tell us by way of warning  that men of wit may their own rules invade  as kings dispense with laws themselves have made  i will therefore take advantage from my having been pretty conversant with your writings to seek a better reason yet for the oddness of your notion that this northernstar is a satyr on the government your abovementioned cabinet of sentences is so well furnished that like a masqueradeshop at venice it will give a man what face he pleases in a twinkling but i presume i have hit the right nail when i stop at the following simile  all seems infected that the infected spy as all looks yellow to the jaundicd eve but however tho as teague in the comedy finds his mouth run from one side to the other and cannot for his life say ladyship to mrs day without laughing in her face i cannot without much difficulty grow grave when i compare the judge with the sentence yet to allow all possible fair quarter let us suppose that the czar as he is not were now actually our enemy  are his merits less shining does his glory depend on his friendship for britain contemptible meanness of thought is it necessary toward becoming a patriot among the english that every thing must be hated that is foreign at that rate the toto divisos orb britannos would be more applicable to our humor than it is to our sitvation  next to deserving well ourselves it is the noblest perfection of nature to admire and applaud those who do so but to have no ear open to renown at a distance were base vain and brutal equally distasteful to humanity and wisdom we may talk what we please of our natural advantages there is one natural defect which will shadow them all and which makes it impossible to widen our power till we enlarge our conceptions  i am apt to believe that nothing has contributed more to this narrowness of mind than the flatteries of our poets who generally writing for a precarious subsistence can no way so easily succeed as by falling in with the weakness and bias of mens natures and hence all our women are nymphs angels or goddesses our men demiheros all our soldiers are invincible all our generals beyond caesar all our kings like augustus and every lord who has a penny in his pocket and a crotchet in his imagination a very mecaenas  a poet should sometimes stand high and look wide for a subject if he is always domestic he will be often unnatural virgils celebrated praise of his italy had been falsehood and fattery applied to great britain he knew and admired the delights of his country and acted as became him when he justly commended them but our highwaypoets whose utmost reach of skill is a poor imitation forget that they make themselves contemptible instead of ornamenting their subject when peace in our climate is dressed in her olives when pan fills our woods and tritons our seas and our shepherds sit piping like the swains of arcadia  a mere poet that is to say a wretch who has nothing but the jingle in his brain to ring chimes to his vanity and whose whole trade is rhymejobbirg such a creature is certainly the most worthless encumbrance of his country his arrogance is the only thing more remarkable than his ignorance the fantastical merit that swells him is like other illhumors the more noxious for its thinness useful science is an air much too gross for his intellects biting scorn and universal neglect turn their points on his conceitedness and while the whole world strives in vain to correct him by disgrace and reproaches all that tempest to him is no more than blowing wind in a bladder the stronger the puff the more boisterous the swelling  all this mr pope must reeds know between his double capacity of poet and critic and if so he has given a judgment as well corrupt as ridiculous in attributing to party the endeavors of justice but if after all it was not the subject but the poem that found no favor in his eyes i will take upon me to assure him it sues not for the blessing let him like it as ill as he pleases i dare at least undertake it shall easily defend it self against any attack of his making which pray sir inform him since you are his greatest admirer and oblige  your most humble servant a hill  the northern star a poem born in an age when virtues vigor fails where praise is dumb or speaks as change prevails where struggling courage stoops to wants control and fortunes every tide oerwhelms the soul where hardpressd poverty the contest flies and with low flattery shameful succor buys where illjudgd worth by power and wealth is weighed and servile poets make their art a trade rise genrous muse and let the wandrers know it is base to praise where they no praises owe that justice scorns an undue fame to sell and nothing claims renown but doingwell that he dishonours verse who bows his theme to great mens fortune or to rich mens phlegm that through all forms the muse should merit trace a blessing unconfined to rank or place that narrow minds conceive not virtue right and worlds not realms should be the poets flight extend thy truthplumd wings unbiased muse discern with caution but with boldness choose if in some dusky corner thou shall find a ragged fortune hide a noble mind disperse the cloud and be the labor thine to teach such shamefacd virtue how to shine or where thou see some wealthy churl withold the enlivening use of his imprisoned gold if meanly proud the wretch disdains to weigh the wise mans wants against the treasured clay with pointed satyr pierce his stubborn soul till sense of shame does pride of heart control over statesmens actions keep a watchful eye the stains they make assume the blackest dye if raised by chance some wretch not formed for sway exerts the covered beast and hunts for prey if all untaught in power he drives with rage and blustering shakes his temporary stage whisper unwelcom notice in his ear that where abuse spreads wide revenge is near but stay to nobler aims address thy view and mark the mighty deeds which monarchs do their good example sways unfixd mankind and dimeyd princes make whole nations blind when godlike caesar ruled ungrateful rome and budding empire shot a fragrant bloom his virtues made those slaves more blessed than he who murdered him to be unsafely free when bloody nero filled that caesars throne corrupted justice durst no virtue own degenerate rome became the villains post and he was safest there whose guilt was most undreading therefore when occasion calls enter proud palaces imperious walls there good or ill detect the reigning fact for truth is truth however princes act sublimely fired i snatch the glorious aim it is great indeed to give the royal fame but where o spotless light of reasons eye where among princes shall i virtue spy shall my own sovreigns praise enrich my lines no  with known force domestic glory shines vain were the thought and needless the design to say to angels heaven is all divine northward unbridld muse direct thy flight where a new sun adorns the land of   night where arts and arms a rising empire sound doomed to refine the world and girt it round thou mighty czar in that   contracted name shall outweigh caesar in thy power and fame led by thy forming hand victorious still and almost newcreated by thy skill intrepid legions wait thy doomful nod as hosts from moses watched the will of god thou god like object of my muses praise thou best invoked inspire my rising lays kindle my glowing soul with fire like thine and lend me bluze to make thy wonders shine though right to mark how towering eagles fly requires the sharpness of an eagles eye though highraisd view does best a prospect show which he can ill describe who stands too low yet if aspiring to the theme i find thy glorys luster strike my opening mind o prince the grateful arrogance forgive no genuine muse so charmed can silent live perish that narrow pride from custom grown that makes men blind to merits not their own briton and russian differ but in name in natures sense all nations are the same one universe claims one creators care and man is reasons subject everywhere while untracd nile with swelling torrent strays and oozy wealth in annual floods conveys memphias rich plains confessed improvement know and to the spreading stream huge harvests owe yet does not egypt singly praise the nile which greatly partial does on egypt smile egypt and all the world the river claim egypt in influence and the world in fame so russia nearest feals the inbred heat but the warmed world the distant brightness greet ages obscurely passed unmarked by fame had almost robbed this empire of its name unmeasured states lay hid in noiseless reign and russia took up half our world in vain weakly inspired the mass did slowly roll like some huge giant with a pigmys soul till ripening time an equal genius sent divinely sized to suit the vast event he breathed prolific vigor over the land and molded order with his skilful hand the swelling energy of power spread wide and bore down proud obstruction like a tide in sudden state a dreadful empire rose which late no hope and now no danger knows in marble quarries thus to swell their gain men blow up hollow rocks with nitrous grain too weak at first the blast often fails its end and frustrate clouds with forceless flash ascend but when well suited to the caverns size a stronger heap the experienced artist tries no more in vain the expandid thunder breaks but bursting all impetuous passage makes the groaning mountain nods with rugged state and yields reluctant to its forceful fate the cave unroofd with sudden splendour bright glitters with mingled rocks and newborn light did not o prince thy love of arts soft charms ungrind the keener influence of thy arms well might the jealous world malign thy sway and anxious wink against thy stream of day but thy great soul has taught thee that the brave wish not to conquer but with view to save that it is a monarchs task to steer his reign betwixt the wild extremes of mean and vain to curb presumptions childhood with restraint and punish treason while it is called complaint the noblest way to make his subjects free they safe in property in empire he knowledge with joy should consecrate to fame the lucid clearness of her champions flame his doublegrasping hand at once displays the martial laurel and the peaceful bays beneath his shade where no bold tempests blow safely they twine together as they grow not so of old when fierce in horrid arms the needy north poured forth her gothic swarms roughly they warred on worth they could not taste and blindly laid the tracks of learning waste this heaven remembered and with kind command called for atonement from the barbarous land the conscious prince disdainful of the crime guiltless springs forward to uncurse his clime and nobly vows to teach the nations more than the worlds empire ruined lost before illustrious nature fitly framed for power so gods for incense did their blessings shower so russias chief himself a god in this rewards subjection with unmeasured bliss how vast the engine and the force how great that can so swiftly move such ponderous weight enormous man who while his boundless sway oerspreads a crowd of nations every way measures not greatness by his countrys length nor will to kneeling millions owe his strength but heavnlike selfdependent vigor shows and gives not takes what power from number flows divinely stored with views and rich in schemes for loading fame with everlasting themes with glories he enamels over a land which almost owed distinction   to his hand from frozen climes where nature stiff with cold nourished no hope and without joy grew old warmed by the monarchs worth we rising saw a spring of virtue and a bloom of law doubly supreme this prince with wide control directs the body and impowrs the soul while common kings their views supinely scan and measure what they will by what they can thou do at once with overpowring sway command and make men able to obey transporting thought let me indulge thee long thou show what cause makes crowns and kingdoms strong no more by civil broils let nations bleed for fancied benefits they do not need those subjects the most glorious freedom share whom we call slaves in such a sovereigns care slaves are low wretches who deceived by names promote unknowingly their spoilers aims who dream rebellion makes a nation free and hug new chains mistook for liberty till waking into thought they miss their gain and kick against some fellowtraytors reign if just athenians by their theseus led theseus who gave their scattered limbs a   head in lasting praise embalmed his cherished fame when naught of his was left em but his name if wise licurgus is immortal grown he whom laconia proudly called her own whose worshipped ghost kept living power in awe and gave a long descent of heros law if romulus lives glorious to this day for pointing out to rome her future way for calling courage in from private harms to mightier mischief in united arms what praise prodigious

that glittering that immortal name aspired to rule and panted after fame age copying age strove with progressive will to push the same design with equal skill and when eight    hundred laboring years were past the late propitious fortune smiled at last not such slow rise o prince thy russia fears thou see not glory through such depth of years at once resolved at once the columns rise which lift thy dreadful fabric to the skies form and degrees let earthy spirits need thy soul excentric moves with inbred speed makes nature shake and raises in a day what with less ease in ages shall decay so when young time in chains existence kept and huddld nature in dark chaos slept the eternal word to set distinction free but spoke the almighty fiat  let there be millions of ways the starting atoms flew like clung to like and sudden order grew sruggling in clouds awhile confusion lay then died at once and lost it self in day explanatory notes referred to in the poem   i call russia the land of night not only literally as its general distance from the sun occasions tedious and uncomfortable winters but also in a metaphorical sense because an almost total absence of the arts till this czars reign had wrapped the country in a night of ignorance    in that contracted name czar is a contraction of the word caesar and is used to signify a king or emperor not only in the russian tongue but the sclavonian and some others and no doubt derived its rise from that title of the roman emperors nor is there any other difference in the words than the contraction only since the ancient latin pronunciation was not caesar as we speak it but the c being pronounced as a k made kaisar and in that manner it was undoubtedly spoken by the romans the germans have no other title for the emperors to this day than kaisar which the smallest variation changes into czar according to the russian appellation    almost owed distinction to his hand though the czars of russia have for many ages been possessed of very large dominions and a power as extensive and unbounded as most other princes yet partly by their distant situation and partly by their want of skill in arms and arts it is certain that they are but lately become known to these parts of europe and were never formidable till they owed it to the genius of their present monarch    gave their scattered limbs a head every body knows that theseus gathered the athenians into a body from a dispersed and solitary way of living and founded and peopled the city of athens which was before but a little village though a kingly seat where he brought them to a relish of society and usefully instructed them in the knowledge of improving their united power    nations numberless as lybian sands the hyperbole may plead more than poetical license to excuse it for if according to the practice of great part of the east and the west indies each distinct tribe or herd may be indulged in their ambition to be thought a particular nation as most writers have practiced then may the petty herds of tartars almost every where surrounding russia added to the wild variety of inhabitants in siberia samoieda etc who depend upon the czar be called numberless without much help from the hyperbole    the shaggy samoid the samoiedes are a people subject to the czar and inhabiting a large tract of land from nova zemla to the neighborhood of archangel and extending along the tartarian sea they neither plough nor sow their country being too cold to produce corn so that they live chiefly on dried fish and turnips and the flesh of a kind of deer which feeds on the moss of their heaths and with the skins of these deer having a very thick warm fur they cloth and defend themselves from the sharpness of the frost and covering themselves all over keep the snow from blowing in at their necks and live three months in the year without sight of the sun    over lands where scarce the russian name has past notwithstanding the just notion which europe has conceived for some years past of the formidable power of the russian arms yet is their country so little known to the generality of other nations that it is almost universally called muscovy though that is only the name of its old capital muscow and the english might with the same justice in foreign countries be called by no other name than the londoners    thence sudden fleets have shadowed distant seas it is known that the cza has on a sudden covered the baltic with a powerful fleet of men of war and galleys which was sufficiently seen when he transported his army to join with the king of denmark in the intended descent upon schonen and on the other side of his dominions he has built a fleet against the turks to serve upon the blacksea most of which ships being of very great force were built at veronize a town seated on a branch of the famous tanais and falling into the palue maotis not far from the city of azoph    the vrgin caspian the czar has caused ships to be sent down the volga into the caspiansea to make discoveries on the side of georgia persia armenia and independent tartary and a considerable trade for the products of the east indies is already carried on from several ports in that sea to astracan and thence dispersed over russia by the volga and the don this sea is called the virgincaspian because it has no known communication with any other being the largest lake in the universe about five hundred miles long and in breadth four hundred and by means of this sea the czar has at all times an inlet into the heart of persa and the indies whenever he shall think of extending his conquests that way   0 a rival power in naval struggle tried the turks till the reign of this illustrious prince the czar possessed entire dominion in the euxine but the russian fleets can now dispute their title and of this the turks have had experience ever since the year      when the loss of azoph was the consequence of an overthrow at sea by the russian galleys commanded by the czar in persn the terror this defeat occasioned at constantinople was so great that they built new castles on the bosphorus and took all possible precautions to prevent some future attempt that way by the russian navy but so much in vain that i am convincd and could justify it by reason and demonstration that if the czar should as it is now likely he will declare war against the turks he may with the smallest expense or hazard imaginable begin his success by laying constantinople in ashes or possessing it if he pleases and maintaining it against all possible efforts of the ottoman power     yoked hellespont the passage of this famous chanel is guarded and made as the turks falsely believe impossible to be forced by two old castles called the dardanelles one seated on the asian side the other on the european about three quarters of a mile asunder and having each a platform of prodigious outofsize artillery carrying stone bullets of two or three foot diameter     now greet their russia by an untried way if constantinople were in the hands of the czar and the hellespont by that means subject to him his ships from the south parts of his dominions bordering on circassia might through the bosphorus propontis hellespont and aegean pass into the mediterran an and coming through the streights mouth sail northward and reach russia again at the port of archangel     feel their pride shake etc the chinese though vastly distant from russia have been warred upon by that nation and made to conceive very different ideas of them from those which their pride had before suggested to them and the czar duly sensible of the many advantages which may arise from a perfect discovery of that immensity of desert which divides him from china has completed that design and built forts and large towns all the way at proper distances for the defense and entertainment of his subjects who travel every year from one empire to the other by land carrying out and bringing back such commodities as are most in demand by the merchants of both nations they set out when the winter has covered all the country with snow and the surface of that snow is so hardened by frost that they are drawn with great swiftness over it in sleds by a large kind of deer they who ride in the sled being covered with thick and warm furs for defense against the severity of the cold     where proud discovry has so often been lost abundance of ships have been lost and great numbers of excellent mariners been frozen to death in the search of a north eastern passage to china and japan by the way of nova zemla and the great sea of tartary if there is such a passage as there must be unless the russian dominions are joined on the north to america the czar has a design to discover it and will undoubtedly succeed in it because his situation affords him an advantage which no other monarch is master of     prophetic greece rehopes her own there has long been a prophecy among the greeks that their redemption from the turkish yoke shall be owing to a fair white haird people from the north and they are strongly and universally persuaded that the russians are the people meant in the prophecy     and when eight hundred laboring tears were past though the romans assisted by the strength of their national virtue in the infancy of their power grew suddenly glorious yet they reached not the height of their empire till the days of trajan which summit of authority is hinted at by the aspiring to rule and panting after fame in the poem  finis
