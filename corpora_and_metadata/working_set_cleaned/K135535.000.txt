respect which i feel for your character and talents but i render justice also to the superior excellence of the poetry itself for those productions will necessarily be allowed to possess intrinsic merit and to deserve their fame which have received the sanction of the best critic the first scholar and the most admired genius of the age  i have the honor to be sir your most obedient humble servant the editor dec  0      preface the reputation of the following poems is so well established that it would be useless to say more of them at present than what may be necessary to gratify future curiosity it is therefore sufficient to observe that through the medium of a daily print they were first presented to the public and obtained that general notice to which they are so eminently and so justly entitled  it ought however to be recorded of the celebrated correspondence between della crusca and anna matilda that its genuine enthusiasm arose entirely from poetical sympathy for till immediately before the publication of the interview they were totally unacquainted with each other and reciprocally unknown  the adieu and recall to love go idle boy i quit thy power thy couch of many a thorn and flower thy twanging bow thine arrow keen deceitful beautys timid mien the feigned surprise the roguish leer the tender smile the thrilling tear have now no pangs no joys for me so fare thee well for i am free then flutter hence on wanton wing or lave thee in yon lucid spring or take thy bevrage from the rose or on louisas breast repose i wish thee well for pleasures past yet bless the hour i am free at last but sure methinks the altered day scatters around a mournful ray and chilling every zephyr blows and every stream untuneful flows no rapture swells the linnets voice no more the vocal groves rejoice and even thy song sweet bird of eve with whom i loved so often to grieve now scarce regarded meets my ear unanswered by a sigh or tear no more with devious step i choose to brush the mountains morning dews to drink the spirit of the breeze or wander midst oerarching trees or woo with undisturbed delight the palecheekd virgin of the night that piercing through the leafy bower throws on the ground a silvry shower alas is all this boasted ease to lose each warm desire to please no sweet solicitude to know for others bliss for others woe a frozen apathy to find a sad vacuity of mind o hasten back then heavenly boy and with thine anguish bring thy joy return with all thy torments here and let me hope and doubt and fear o rend my heart with every pain but let me let me love again della crusca june         to della crusca the pen o seize again thy golden quill and with its point my bosom thrill with magic touch explore my heart and bid the tear of passion start thy golden quill apollo gave  drenched first in bright aonias wave he snatched it fluttering through the sky borne on the vapor of a sigh it fell from cupids burnished wing as forcefully he drew the string which sent his keenest surest dart through a rebellious frozen heart that had till then defied his power and vacant beat through each dull hour be worthy then the sacred loan seated on fancys airbuilt throne immerse it in her rainbow hues nor what the godheads bid refuse apollo cupid shall inspire and aid thee with their blended sire the one poetic language give the other bid thy passion live with soft ideas fill thy lays and crown with love thy wintry days anna matilda july  0      to anna matilda i know thee well enchanting maid i have marked thee in the silent glade i have seen thee on the mountains height i have met thee in the storms of night i have viewed thee on the wild beach run to gaze upon the setting sun then stop aghast his ray no more to hear the impetuous surges roar have thou not stood with raptious eye to trace the stary worlds on high to observe the moons weak crescent throw over hills and woods a glimmering glow or all beside some wizard stream to watch its undulating beam o well thy form divine i know  when youthful errors brought me woe when all was dreary to behold and many a bosomfriend grew cold thou thou unlike the summer crew that from my adverse fortune flew came with melodious voice to cheer my throbbing heart and check the tear from thee i learnt twas vain to scan the low ingratitude of man thou badst me fancys wilds to rove and seek the extatic bower of love when on his couch i threw me down i saw thee weave a myrtle crown and blend it with the shining hair of her the fairest of the fair for this may every wandering gale the essence of the rose exhale and pour the fragrance on thy breast and gently fan thy charms to rest soon as the purple slumbers sly the opening radiance of thine eye strike strike again the magic lyre with all thy pathos all thy fire with all that sweetlywarbled grace which proves thee of celestial race o then in varying colors dressed and living glory stand confessed shake from thy locks ambrosial dew and thrill each pulse of joy anew with glowing ardours rouse my soul and bid the tides of passion roll but think no longer in disguise to screen thy beauty from mine eyes nor deign a borrowed name to use for well i know thou art the muse della crusca july         to della crusca thou bidst   my purple slumbers fly days radiance pours upon my eye i wake  i live the sense oerpays the trivial griefs of early days what though the rosebud on my cheek has shed its leaves which late so sleek spoke youth and joy  and careless thought by guilt or fear or shame unsmote my blooming soul is yet in youth its lively sense attests the truth o i can wander yet and taste the beauties of the flowery waste the nightingales deep swell can feel whilst from my lids the soft drops steal rapt gaze upon the gemdeckd night and mark the clear moons silent flight whilst the slow rivers crumpled wave repeats the quivering beams she gave not yet the pencil strives in vain to wake upon the canvas plain all the strong passions of the mind or hint the sentiment refined to its sweet magic yet i bow as when youth decked my polished brow the chisels feathry touch to trace through the nervd form or softened grace is lent me still still i admire and kindle at the poets fire  my torch at della cruscas light and distant follow his superior flight o time since these are left me still of lesser thefts even take thy fill yes steal the luster from my eye and bid the soft carnation fly my tresses sprinkle with thy snow which boasted once the auburn glow warp the slim form that was adored by him so loved my bosoms lord  but leave me when all these you steal the mind to taste the nerve to feel anna matilda aug        to anna matilda and art thou then alas like me offspring of frail mortality must ruthless times rude touch efface each lovely features varying grace and must toward earth that form incline and even those eyes forbear to shine yet when with icy hand he throws amongst thine auburn locks his snows the freezing influence never shall dart to chill thy warmlybeating heart and scorning deaths oblivious hour thou shall exult  beyond his power methinks as passion drives along as frantic grown i feel thy song eager i would traverse lybias plain the tawny lions dread domain to meet thee there nor flagging fear should ever on my cheek appear for even the forest king obeys majestic womans potent gaze or left on some resourceless shore where never ceasing billows roar which teeming clouds and heavy hail and furious hurricanes assail far to the pole  while half the year on ebon throne sits night severe and to her solitary court seafowl and monsters fierce resort  even there matilda there with thee impending horrors all should flee thy luster of poetic ray should wake an artificial day sure thou were never doomed to know what pangs from care and danger flow but fairest scenes thy thoughts employ and art and science bring thee joy the quickening sense the throb divine fancy and feeling all are thine it is thine by blushing summer led a shower of roses round thee shed to hie thee forth at morns advance in wild excess of rapturous trance and see the suns proud deluge stream in copious tides of golden beam while faint his sisterorb on high fades to a vapor of the sky when gradual evening comes to hide in sabling shades creations pride when heaving hills and forests drear and lessening towns but scarce appear while the last lingering western glow hangs on the lucid lake below then trivial joys i deem forgot thou love to seek the humble cot to scatter comforts balm around and heal pale povertys deep wound drive sickness from the languid bed raise the lorn widows drooping head render the newmade mother blessed and snatch the infant to thy breast o anna then if true thou say thy radiant beauties steal away yet shall i never fail to find eternal beauties in thy mind to those i offer up my vows and love which virtues self allows unknown again thou art adored as once by him thy bosoms lord della crusca aug         elegy written on the plain of fontenoy chill blows the blast and twilights dewy hand draws in the west her dusky veil away a deeper shadow steals along the land and nature muses at the death of day near this bleak waste no friendly mansion rears its walls where mirth and social joys resound but each dim object melts the soul to tears while horror treads the scattered bones around as thus alone and comfortless i roam wet with the drizling shower i sigh sincere i cast a fond look toward my native home and think what valiant britons perished here yes the time was nor very far the date when carnage here her crimson toil began when nations standards waved in threatening state and man the murderer met the murderer man for war is murder though the voice of kings has styled it justice styled it glory too yet from worst motives fierce ambition springs and there fixed prejudice is all we view but sure it is heavens immutable decree for thousands every age in fight to fall some natural cause prevails we cannot see and that is fate which we ambition call o let the aspiring warrior think with grief that as produced by chymic art refined so glittering conquest from the laurelleaf extracts a general poison for mankind here let him wander at the midnight hour these morbid rains these gelid gales to meet and mourn like me the ravages of power and feel like me that victory is defeat nor deem ye vain that ever i mean to swell my feeble verse with many a sounding name of such the mercenary bard may tell and call such dreary desolation fame the genuine muse removes the thin disguise that cheats the world whenever she deigns to sing and full as meritorious to her eyes seems the poor soldier as the mighty king alike i shun in labored strain to show how britain more than triumphed though she fled where louis stood where stalked the column slow i turn from these and dwell upon the dead yet much my beating breast respects the brave too well i love them not to mourn their fate why should they seek for greatness in the grave their hearts are noble  and in life they are great nor think it is but in war the brave excel  to valor every virtue is allied here faithful friendship mid the battle fell and love true love in bitter anguish died alas the solemn slaughter i retrace that checks lifes current circling through my veins bathed in moist sorrow many a beauteous face and gave a grief perhaps that still remains i can no more  an agony too keen absorbs my senses and my mind subdues hard were that heart which here could beat serene or the just tribute of a pang refuse but lo through yonder opening clouds afar shoots the bright planets sanguinary ray that bears thy name fictitious lord of war and with red luster guides my lonely way then fontenoy farewell yet much i fear wherever chance my course compels to find discord and blood  the thrilling sounds i hear the noise of battle hurtles in the wind from barbarous turkey to britannias shore opposing interests into rage increase destruction rears her scepter tumults roar ah where shall hapless man repose in peace della crusca oct         stanzas to della crusca hushed be each ruder note  soft silence spread with ermine hand thy cobweb robe around attention pillow my reclining head whilst eagerly i catch the golden sound ha what a tone was that which floating near seemed harmonys full soul  whose is the lyre which seizing thus on my enraptured ear chills with its force yet melts me with its fire ah dull of heart thy minstrels touch not know what bard but della crusca boasts such skill from him alone those melting notes can flow  he only knows adroitly thus to trill well have i left the groves which sighing wave amidst novembers blasts their naked arms whilst their red leaves fall fluttering to their grave and give again to dust mays vernal charms well have i left the airembosomd hills where sprightly health in verdant buskin plays forsaken fallow meads and circling mills and thymedressd heaths where the soft stock yet strays obscuring smoke and air impure i greet with the coarse din that tread and folly form for here the muses son again i meet  i catch his notes amidst the vulgar storm his notes now bear me pensive to the plain clothed by a verdure drawn from britains heart whose heroes bled superior to their pain sunk crowned with glory and contemned the smart soft as he leads me round the ensanguind fields the laureled shades forsake their grassy tomb the bursting sod its palid inmate yields and over the immortal waste their spirits roam obedient to the muse the acts revive which time long past had veiled from mortal ken embattled squandrons rush as when alive and shadowy fulchions gleam over shadowy men ah who art thou who thus with frantic air flyst fearless to support that bleeding youth bindst his deep gashes with thy glowing hair and die beside him to attest thy truth his sister i an orphand pair we grieved for parents long at rest within the grave by a false guardian of our wealth bereaved  the little all parental care could save chill looked the world and chilly grew our hearts oh where shall poverty expect a smile gross lawless love assumed its ready arts and all beset was i with fraud and guile my henry sought the war and dropped the tears of love fraternal as he bade farewell but fear soon made me rise above my fears i followed  and fate tolls our mutual knell chaste maiden rest and brighter spring the green that decorates the turf thy bloom will feed and oh in softest mercy twas i ween to worth like thine a brothers graves decreed the dreadful shriek of death now darts around the hollow winds repeat each tortured sigh deep bitter groans still deeper groans resound whilst fathers brothers lovers husbands die turn from this spot blessed bard thy mental eye to hamlets cities empires bend its beam twill there such multiplying deaths descry that all before theell but an abstract seem why waste thy tears over this contracted plain the sky which canopies the sons of breath sees the whole earth one scene of mortal pain the vast the universal bed of death where do not husbands fathers dying moan where do not mothers sisters orphans weep where is not heard the last expiring groan or the deep throttle of the deathful sleep if as philosophy does often muse a state of war is natural state to man battles the sickness bravery would choose  noblest disease in natures various plan let vulgar souls stoop to the fevers rage or slow beneath pale atrophy depart with gout and scroupula weak variance wage or sink with sorrow cankring at the heart these be to common minds the unwishd decree the firm select an illness more sublime by languid pains scorn their high souls to free but seek the swords swift edge and spurn at time anna matilda sat nov   th      to anna matilda on the seashore with folded arms i stood the sun just sinking shot a level ray luxuriant crimson glowed upon the flood and the curled turf was tinged with golden spray far off i faintly trackd the feathry sail when thy sweet numbers caught my yielded ear borne on the bosom of the fluttering gale they struck my heart  and roused me to a tear yet flowed no bitter anguish from mine eye a while remembrance left my wayward state and the soft cadence of thy warbled sigh poured healing balm into the wounds of fate what though grim winters desolating frown the wild waves uproar when rough eurus blows the tangled forest and the desert down be all the folace della crusca knows yet from matildas pure celestial fire one ruby spark shall to his gloom be given lured by its light his fancy may aspire and catch a ray of bliss  a glimpse of heaven vain in the morn of life and thoughtless too he rushed impetuous as strong passion drove but soon each flattering prospect fled his view deceived by friendship much but more by love yes he has loved to transports dire excess has felt the potent eye inflict the wound has felt the female voice each pulse oppress and grown a breathless statue at the sound but why recall the moments that are fled for ever fled like yonder sweeping blast with love each active principle is dead and all except its sad regret is past ah had he met thee in his happier hour ere yet he languishd in the gripe of care thy minstrel then had fondly owned thy power thy minstrel then might have escaped despair o different lot for he who daily grieves then with thy beauty blessed and generous mind had not like sallow autumns falling leaves been shrunk alas and scattered in the wind happily he had not roamd for lingering years on many a rugged alp and foreign shore he never had known the cause of all his tears the cherished cause that bids him  hope no more he would have led thee with attentive gaze where the brown hamlets neighboring shades retire have hung entranced upon thy living lays and swept with feebler hand a kindred lyre while the dear song stress had melodious stole over every sense and charmed each nerve to rest thy bard in silent ecstasy of soul had strained the dearer woman to his breast or had she said that wars the worthiest grave he would have felt his proud heart burn the while have dared perhaps to rush among the brave have gained perhaps the glory  of a smile and it is most true while times relentless hand with sickly grasp drags others to the tomb the soldier scorns to wait the dull command but springs impatient to a nobler doom though on the plain he lies outstretchd and pale without one friend his steadfast eyes to close yet on his honored corse shall many a gale waft the moist fragrance of the weeping rose over that dread spot the melancholy moon shall pause awhile a sadder beam to shed and starry night amidst her awful noon sprinkle light dews upon his hallowed head there too the solitary bird shall swell with longdrawn melody her plaintive throat while distant echo from responsive cell shall often with fading force return the note such recompense be valors due alone to me no proffered meed must ever belong to me who trod the vale of life unknown whose proudest boast was but an idle song della crusca dec        to della crusca i hate the tardy elegiac lay  choose me a measure jocund as the day such days as near the ides of june meet the larks elabrate tune when his downy fringed breast ambitious on a cloud to rest he soars aloft and from his gurgling throat darts to the earth the piercing note  which softly falling with the dews of morn that bless the scented pink and snowy thorn expands upon the zephyrs wing and wakes the burnished finch and linnet sweet to sing and be thy lines irregular and free poetic chains should fall before such bards as thee scorn the dull laws that pinch thee round raising about thy verse a mound over which thy muse so lofty dares not bound bid her in verse meandring sport her footsteps quick or long or short just as her various impulse wills  scorning the frigid square which her fine fervor chills and in thy verse meandring wild thou who art fancys favorite child may sweetly paint the long past hour when the slave of cupids power thou could the tear of rapture weep and feed on agony and banish sleep ha did thou favored mortal taste all that adorns our lifes dull waste have thou known loves enchanting pain  its hopes its woes and yet complain thy senses at a voice been lost thy maddning soul in tumults tossed ecstatic wishes fire thy brain  these have thou known and yet complain thou then deserve never more to feel  thy nerves be rigid hence as steel their fine vibrations all destroyed thy future days a tasteless void never shall thou know again to sigh or on a soft idea die never on a recollection gasp thy arms the air  drawn charmer never grasp vapid content her poppies round thee strew whilst to the bliss of taste thou bidst adieu to vulgar comforts be thou hence confined and the shrunk bays be from thy brow untwind thy statue torn from cupids hallowed niche but in return thou shall be dull and rich the muses hence disown thy rebel lay  but thou in aldermanic gown their scorn repay crimsoned and furred the highest honors dare and on thy laurels tread  a plump lord mayor anna matilda dec  0      ode to prudence where did thou hide thee cautious power when first my venurous youth began thou came not to the festive bower nor at the genial board were found and when the liquid grape went round thou never showdst thy warning face the wantonness of mirth to chase and tell of short lifes shadwy span nor then did prophesy of woe to chill my breasts impetuous glow but provident and shrewd from me afar thou sunkst to sober rest with days retiring star it is true indeed i thought with scorn thy miserable maxims quaint were but of sour suspicion born let selfish souls i madly cried submit to such a coward guide be it mine to seek the sportive vale with friends whose truth can never fail and banish thence each base restraint dull that i was  i feel it now and offer late the imploring vow too well convinced who dare thy vengeance urge can never alas escape an agonizing scourge ah will thou deign then to receive thy foe professed for many a year and will thou teach him not to grieve forget the weakness of past time when frantic passion was his crime when to imperious charms a prey his morn of life stole swift away yet gemmd by loves delicious tear that bathed his bosom with delight though sometimes on the gales of night he heard thy whispered threat aspire how could he heed it then  was not his heart on fire but now to gain thy frugal smile each wonted transport i forego no more shall beautys self beguile although her blue orbs softer stream than the clear moons enchanting beam though her still varying charms arise as to the hastening travllers eyes helvetias summer prospects show or should meek worth to me repair and tell a tale of deep despair i would strive to bid each fond emotion sleep yes i would turn away  but i would turn to weep then as with decent step and mien i tread the path of fair repute thy civic hand shall often be seen to freight me with the sordid ore which most thy votaries adore then then shall flagging fancy die then all my loved illusions fly then will i break my rustic flute and as the marblehearted crowd be vainly rich and meanly proud until i fix like yonder blighted thorn that decked with golden beams no vernal sweets adorn della crusca  ode to death thou whose remorseless rage nor vows nor tears assuage triumphant death  to thee i raise the bursting notes of dauntless praise  methinks on yonder murky cloud thou sitst in majesty severe thy regal robe a ghastly shroud thy right arm lifts the insatiate spear such was thy glance when erst as from the plain where indus rolls his burning sand young ammon led the victor train in glowing lust of fierce command as vain he cried with thundering voice  the world is mine rejoice rejoice  the world i have won thou gavst the withering nod thy fiat smote his heart  he sunk  a senseless clod  and art thou great  mankind replies with sad assent of mingling sighs sighs that swell the biting gales which sweep over laplands frozen vales and the red tropics whirlwind heat is with the sad assent replete how fierce yon tyrants plumy crest a blaze of gold illumes his breast in pomp of threatening power elate he madly dares to spurn at fate but  when night with shadowy robe hangs upon the darkened globe in his chamber  sad  alone by starts he pours the fearful groan from flattering crowds retired  he bows the knee and mutters forth a prayer  because he thinks of thee gayly smiles the nuptial bower bedecked with many an odorous flower while the spousal pair advance mixing often the melting gaze in fondest ecstacy of praise ah short delusive trance what though the festival be there  the rapt bards warblings fill the air and joy and harmony combine touch but thy talisman and all is thine the insensate lovers fix in icy fold and on his throbbing lyre the minstrels hand is cold it is thou can quench the eagles sight that stems the cataract of light forbid the vernal buds to blow  bend the obedient forest low  and tame the monsters of the main such is thy potent reign over earth and air and sea yet art thou still disdained by me and i have reason for my scorn  do i not hate the rising morn the garish noon the eve serene the freshning breeze the sportive green the painted pleasures thronged resort and all the splendors of the court and has not sorrow chose to dwell within my hot hearts central cell and are not hopes weak visions over can love or rapture reach me more then though i scorn thy stroke  i call thee friend for in thy calm embrace my weary woes shall end della crusca  elegy on the thirtyfirst of december mdcclxxxvii yes i will climb yon rough rocks giddy height that over the ocean bends his brow severe  and as i muse on times neglected flight wait the last sunshine of the parting year why do the winds so sadly seem to rave why broods such solemn horror over the deep it is that fancy points the yawning grave  and sickening shudders at the ponderous sleep for o since last decembers hoary head bowed to oblivions wave and sunk beneath from this strange world what fluttering crowds are fled to throng the caverns of relentless death and every transitory shade is lost that in its course was fondly called today springs sweets are gone and summers flowery boast and autumns purple honors passed away and now though winter in rude mantle dressed extends his icy scepter over the plain soon shall he sink on aprils dewy breast and laughing may shall reassume her reign but man when once his bright days slush is over and youths toofleeting pleasures take their wing must on lifes scene revegetate no more but leap its gulf to find a second spring and can that something each man calls himself midst this wide miracle of earth and sky waste the swift moments in the toil for pelf  nor raise one thought to natures majesty on the globes surface creep a groveling worm nor joy the noontide radiance to behold  nor trace the mighty hand that guides the storm  but deem existence relative to gold ah since this awful now remains for me to think to breathe to wonder at the whole to move to touch to taste to hear to see to call the mystic consciousness my soul fain would i seek awhile the sportive shade ere the scene close upon this doubtful state catch every painted phantom ere it fade and leave the vast uncertainty to fate but grief is mine  yet can i quit the crew whose bosoms burn with avarice and pride in yon blue vault to quench my thirsty view or tell my feelings to the boisterous tide for are there not as journeying on we go with pilgrim step through an unfriendly vale oppression malice cruelty and woe and do not falsehoods venomed shafts assail were it not nobler far with social love as fellowtravlers in a rugged road that each the others evils should remove and with joint force sustain the general load o while such fancied happiness i trace a glow of gladness runs through every vein raptures warm tear steals silent down my face and thus i wake the philanthropic strain long long may britains generous isle be blessed with foreign fame domestic joys increase at every insult shake the warlike crest then weave her laurels in the bower of peace blessed be her sons in hardy valor bold and all who haunt meek learnings sacred shade the aspiring young and the reposing old the modest matron and the enchanting maid and may the bard upon himself bestow one humble wish that soon his cares shall end with the dead year resign his weight of woe or with the thorns of life at least some roses blend della crusca  invocation to horror far be removed each painted scene what is to me the sapphire sky what is to me the earths soft dye or fragrant vales which sink between those velvet hills yes there i see  why do those beauties burst on me pearldropping groves bow to the sun seizing his beams bright rivers run that dart redoubled day hope ye vain scenes to catch the mind to torpid sorrow all resigned or bid my heart be gay false are those hopes  i turn  i fly where no enchantment meets the eye or soft ideas stray horror i call thee from the mouldering tower the murky churchyard and forsaken bower where midst unwholesome damps the vapry gleamy lamps of ignes fatui show the thickwove night where morbid melancholy sits and weeps and sings and raves by fits and to her bosom strains the fancied sprite or if amidst the arctic gloom thou toilest at thy sable loom forming the hideous phantoms of despair  instant thy grisly labors leave with raven wing the concave cleave where floats self borne the dense noctural air oh bear me to the impending cliff under whose brow the dashing skiff beholds thee seated on thy rocky throne there midst the shrieking wild winds roar thy influence horror i will adore and at thy magic touch congeal to stone oh hide the moons obtrusive orb the gleams of every star absorb and let creation be a moment thine bid billows dash let whirlwinds roar and the stern rockypointed shore the stranded bark back to the waves resign then whilst from yonder turbid cloud thou rollst thy thunders long and loud and lightenings flash upon the deep below let the expiring seamans cry the pilots agonizing sigh mingle and in the dreadful chorus flow horror far back thou datst thy reign ere kings the historic page could stain with records black or deeds of lawless power ere empires alexanders cursed or faction maddning caesars nursed the srighted world received thy awful dower whose pen jehovahs self inspired he who in eloquence attired led israels squadrons over the earth grandly terrific paints thy birth the almighty midst his fulgent seat on high where glowing seraphs round his footstool fly beheld the wanton cities of the plain with acts of deadly name his laws disdain he gave the irrevocable sign which marked to man the hate divine and sudden from the starting sky the angels of his wrath did fly then horror thou presidedst over the whole and filled and rapt each selfaccusing soul thou did ascend to guide the burning shower on thee the omnipotent bestowed the hour twas thine to scourge the sinful land twas thine to toss the fiery brand beneath thy glance the temples fell and mountains crumbled at thy yell once more thou wilt triumph in a fiery storm once more the earth behold thy direful form then shall thou seek as holy prophets tell thy native throne amidst the eternal shades of hell anna matilda  to anna matilda to thee a stranger dares address his theme to thee proud mistress of apollos lyre one ray emitted from the golden gleam prompted by love would  set the world on fire adorn then love in fancytincturd vest camelion like anon of various hue by  penseroso and  allegro dressed  such genius claimed when she idalia drew i see

the day whilst the sun darts a torrid ray the humble daisy sinks her head and faints upon her lowly bed but when moist eve has quenched his fire and treads the fields in cool attire the daisy spreads again her bloom and offers up her mild persume thus your recuscitating praise breathed life upon my dying lays reynolds admires flattery so sweet with blushing vanity i meet but bard polite how hard the task which with such elegance you ask when dido bade eneas tell the woes he knew to paint so well  did he not tell the queen she tore his closing wounds and drew fresh gore from stabs that time had almost healed  such reuben such the thorn concealed within your verses slowry spell which barbarous dares my pen compel yet how describe the various god to whom proteus selfs a heavy clod differing in every differing heart scorning to play a constant part a tiger  tyrant  such is he whom painted with bandeau you see with downy wings and childish face as though of the blessed cherubs race  but oh a serpent in disguise and as the lynx his piercing eyes a raging fire a deadly pain that gentlest heart strings most will strain a fever tempest madness he  of all lifes ills  a dread epitome ha do thou fear and will thou run the little monster try to shun and will thou reuben too succeed  and shall thy bosom never bleed never his poisoned ranckling dart quiver within thy burning heart oh hapless man  oh wretched fate fly to loves altar ere too late and deprecate the doom accursed or bid that heart with sorrow burst welcome the deadly fiery pain that gentlest heart strings most will strain  madness is his  but it is replete with all that makes lifes blessings sweet  a tyrant he but oh his chains are richer than an empires gains sweet the delirium which by love is spread whatever the paths his raptured votries tread he paints the mist which hangs upon the eve with colors clearer than the sun can give it is he who lends the nightingale its trills when her rich pipe the empyrean fills oh it is the softness in his heart which makes the lover in her song take part and faint upon each touching pause and lengthen out each added clause till rapt attention strained too high rolls down its gushing tear and breathes its gentle sigh charming to love is mornings hour when from her crystal roseate tower she sees the goddess health pursue the skimming breeze through fields of dew charming the flaming hour of noon when the sunk linnets fading tune allures him to the beechy grove or when some craggd grotesque alcove sounds in his ear its tinkling rill and tempts him to its mossgrown sill most charmed when on his tranced mind is whispered in the passing wind the name of her whose name is bliss or when he all unseen can kiss the fringed bank where late she lay hidden from the imperious day oh ye rapt glades which glittering luna decks whose stretching shadows her resulgence checks oh ye soft floods that hang upon the peak of lofty rocks and bound in wanton freak where thirsty meads your rushing streamlets crave and crowd their flowers around to drink your wave  what are ye all should love withhold the dart which wakes nice feelings in the torpid heart where is the heart that would such feelings fly or fear the enchanting maddning cup to try must i speak more of love the boundless theme might run beyond the edge of lifes short dream his spells are blessings  witchries so sublime they triumph over distress and fate and time would ask the joys of love oh change the prayer thou little know his power to fasten there let the mean bosom crave its loves return thine shall with more distinguished ardors burn to know the passion  yes be that thy strain invoke the god of the mysterious pain whatever thy nature  gentle  fiery  rough  to love  learn but to love  and thou have bliss enough anna matilda  ode to mrs siddons thee queen of pathos shall my proud verse hail illustrious siddons should i go whether to zemblas waste of snow or aetnas cavernd height or tempes vaunted vale or where on caucasus the fierce storm blows or near the violated flood of ganges blushing often with blood or where his rainbow arch loud niagara throws for not the exulting monarch on his throne though grateful nations round him bow is more a potentate than thou feeling and sense and worth and virtue are thy own and even thy mighty spell the soul can sway while sympathy with melting eye hangs on thy bosoms fervid sigh and finds the unbidden tear down her hot cheek to stray lo at thy voice from solitary cave with hair erect peeps forth pale fear nor will he longer wait to hear but flies with culprit haste a visionary grave amongst the hollow mountains shadowy cells darkbrowd revenge that strangely walks and to himself lowmuttring talks while with convulsive throb his breast unsated swells and gelid horror in the haunted hall that with dread pause and eye stretched wide marks the mysterious spectre glide nor dare his flagging knees obey the phantoms call and lost despair with desolating cry that headlong darts from some tall tower on fire at thick nights saddest hour when not a watchman wakes and not an aid is nigh these own thy power  and baresool madness too dancing upon the flinty plain as though twere gay to suffer pain that sees his tyrant moon and raving runs to woo alike the mild benevolent desires that wander in the pensive grove pity and generousminded love to thrill thy kindred pulse shoot their electric fires ah let not then my fond admiring muse restrain the ardor of her song in silent wonder fixed so long nor thou from humble hands the homage meet refuse and i will hasten often from short repose to wake the lily on moist bed reclining meek her folded head and chase with amorous touch the slumber of the rose then will i bathe them in the tears of morn that they a fresher gale may breathe then will i form a votive wreath to bind thy sacred brows  to deprecate thy scorn but should thou still disdain these proffered lays which choked alas with weedy woe like yon dull stream can scarcely flow  take from britannias harp the triumph of thy praise della crusca  ode to simplicity addressed to mrs wells o come ye fragrant gales that sweep the surface of the summer deep nor yet refuse to waft my lay and with it fan the breast of may for humble though it be it hails benign simplicity why do we haunt the mountains side ere yet the curly vapors glide why mark the opening buds of spring or trace the shrill larks quivering wing it is that then we see meek natures sweet simplicity the lengthened shades that evening draws of calm repose the general pause the stream that winds yon meads along the nightingales transcendent song borrow each charm from thee o softeyd nymph simplicity then to thy brow loved wells is due a lasting wreath of various hue hung with each perfumed flower that blows but chief the cowslip and the rose for surely thou art she thyself  benign symplicity and when thy mimic powers are shown each others talents are thy own appropriate to thyself we find the thrilling voice the wounded mind the starting tear we see in natures pure simplicity have thou beheld the infant moon hie to her couch ere nights full noon then have thou heard the lover train in tones of sad regret complain so absent all agree to mourn for lost simplicity so when upon thy wellwrought scene the curtain drops its closing green we grieve the mirthful hour is past and murmur that it fled so fast we wish again to see the beauties of symplicity and loveliness delights to dwell upon thy bosomss snowy swell to bid the streamy lightnings fly in liquid peril from thine eye and to each heart decree the triumph of simplicity ah though i venurous pour the verse unskilled thy praises to rehearse yet may thou kindly smile to hear for o the tribute is sincere the offering paid by me in genuine truths simplicity della crusca  ode to miss farren from her own garden beauty chose in all its bloomy pride the rose and from the feathered race the dove then farren on thy cheek she threw the blushing flowrs enchanting hue then formed thy temper from the bird of love ah though i am doomed to roam afar yet shall the mornings beamy star yet shall the placid glow of eve recall thy charms to bless my mind dear charms with dearer virtues joined so shall my heart at times forget to grieve and often will i loitring stay till the dark mountains veil the day while thus delicious fancy cheers  for then more sweet on every plain the linnet trills her farewell strain and then more lovely natures self appears and sure the happy youths who gaze upon thine eyes resistless blaze where gay lifes polished circles shine or view amid the comic scene thy dimpled smiles and graceful mien shall find their bosoms sympathize with mine whether thou showst with matchless skill unsteady fashions froward will as heartless maid or heedless wife truth nature sentiment prevail and through the mirthinspiring tale all fiction seems absorbed in real life oh what delight to hourly trace the fine expression of thy face thy winning elegance and ease to see those teeth of lustrous pearl thy locks profuse of many a curl and hear thy voice omnipotent to please with thee to pace the mountains side or mark the rushy rivlet glide that murmuring rolls a scanty stream till winding in the vale below it seems texult with vainer glow and gaily wanton in the lunar beam still might the seasons change  with thee not winters self could dreary be nor sultry summers heats offend the howling winds the pelting shower could not disturb my rapturous hour nor ever gloom my mind  with such a friend at midnight then no more i would stand where oceans surges lash the land nor fondly list the screechowls tongue  ah me i dream  the illusions over  henceforth in silence i will adore and thou sweet nymph forgive the ardent song della crusca  the slaves an elegy if late i paused upon the twilight plain of fontenoy to weep the freeborn brave sure fancy now may cross the western main and melt in sadder pity for the slave lo where to yon plantation drooping goes the sable herd of human kind while near stalks a pale despot and around him throws the scourge that wakes  that punishes the tear over the far beach the mournful murmur strays and joins the rude yell of the tumbling tide as faint they labor in the solar blaze to feed the luxury of british pride even at this moment on the burning gale floats the weak wailing of the female tongue and can that sexs softness naught avail  must naked woman shriek amid the throng are drops of blood the horrible manure that fills with luscious juice the teeming cane and must our fellow creatures thus endure for traffic vile the indignity of pain yes their keen sorrows are the sweets we blend with the green bevrage of our morning meal the while to love meek mercy we pretend or for fictitious ills affect to feel yes it is their anguish mantles in the bowl their sighs excite the britons drunken joy those ignrant suffrers know not of a soul that we enlightened may its hopes destroy and there are men who leaning on the laws what they have purchased claim a right to hold  cursed be the tenure cursed its cruel cause  freedoms a dearer property than gold and there are men with shameless front have said that nature formed the negroes for disgrace that on their limbs subjection is displayed  the doom of slavery stamped upon their face send your stern gaze from lapland to the line and every regions natives faily scan their forms their force their faculties combine and own the vast variety of man then why suppose yourselves the chosen few to deal oppressions poisoned arrows round to gall with iron bonds the weaker crew enforce the labor and inflict the wound it is sordid interest guides you bent on gain in profit only can ye reason find and pleasure too  but urge no more in vain the selfish subject to the social mind ah how can he whose daily lot is grief whose mind is vilifyd beneath the rod suppose his maker has for him relief can he believe the tongue that speaks of god for when he sees the female of his heart and his loved daughters torn by lust away his sons the poor inheritors of smart   had he religion think ye he could pray alas he steals him from the loathsome shed what time moist midnight blows her venomed breath and musing how he long has toiled and bled drinks the dire balsam of consoling death haste haste ye winds on swiftest pinions fly ere from this world of misery he go tell him his wrongs bedew a nations eye tell him britannia blushes for his woe say that in future negroes shall be blessed ranked even as men and mens just rights enjoy no more be either purchased or oppressed  no griefs shall wither and no stripes destroy say that fair freedom bends her holy flight to cheer the infant and console the sire so shall he wondering prove at last delight and in a throb of ecstacy expire then shall proud albions crown where laurels twine torn from the bosom of the raging sea boast midst the glorious leaves a gem divine the radient gem of pure humanity della crusca  monody addressed to mr t  if ever for fictitious grief my soul a transient sorrow knew if sometimes i have heaved a sigh but to behold the virgin leaf of the lost lily withering die sure tenderest sympathy is due to thee from whom each cherished bliss is fled who mournst by day and night thy own maria dead o t  in the murmuring gale often have i found thy plaintive voice prevail when the wet fingers of the morn shook the cold pearldrops from the bending thorn or when at close of day to the lone vale i took my way the sad vibration of faint echo s breath brought to my heart the dirge of death then all dejected have i paused to hear and felt a kindred pang sincere sincere as erst thy fathers parent proved when for the addison friend he loved he wove a cypress wreath and poured the verse that soothed the poets shade and hung upon his hearse ah let me take my simple reed and seek the moonlight mead or where amongst rocks the headlong stream flashes the lucid beam woo calm reflection in her sober bower as pondring at the midnight hour she flings her solace on each passing wind that wafts the heavenly balm to heal the wounded mind so may her mighty spell thy desolating anguish quell so may thou quit at length the forests gloom nor thus for ever dwell upon the sainted tomb o think when wandering on the shore thou markst with musing eye over the rude cliffs the tempest fly and rouse to sudden rage the howling main think she thou love has left a world where jarring elements are hurled and where contending atoms roar to join midst endless joy the adoring seraphs strain yes she was mild and lovely as the star that in the western hemisphere afar lifts its pure lamp above the mountains head to light meek evening to her dewy bed and as the waning moon displays with mirror clear morns rising rays she in decay showed virtues orb refined reflected fairer from her angel mind till at the last too fierce a blaze was given and then she shrunk from sight and faded into heaven yet do not mourn be grief away for see how swift the dark clouds go soon silence drinks the linnets lay and yonder sapphire waves shall cease to flow scared by the hissing brand of thirsty summers sultry hand from the lorn wood the leaves descend and all of nature as of art must end sad consolation true yet why if soon must close the languid eye since a short moment but remains for all our fears and all our pains why should we fondly brood on care ah why devote us to despair but time assiduous loves to urge our footsteps to his utmost verge because that there a rapturous scene appears where anguish never throbs nor sorrow sinks in tears meanwhile forbear not to disclose the scions of that beauteous stem and though the parent rose was prematurely lost by a remorseless frost o view the opening buds and smile at least for them della crusca  ode to indifference oh nymph long sought of placid mien with careless steps and brow serene i woo thee from the tufted bowers where listless pass thy easy hours  or if a naiade of the silver wave thou rather love thy pearly limbs to lave in some clear lake whose fascinating face lures the soft willow to its pure embrace or if beneath the gelid rock thy smiles all human sorrows mock wherever thou art in earth or air oh come and chase the fiend despair have i not marked thee on the green roving by vulgar eyes unseen have i not watched thy lightsome dance when evenings softened glows advance dear goddess yes and whilst the rustics mirth proclaims the hour which gives wild gambols birth supine i have found thee in the elm rows shade lulled by the hum returning bees have made who chary of their golden spoils finish their fragrant rosy toils with restinviting slumbrous song as to their waxen couch they throng chaste nymph the temple let me seek where thou residst in luster meek my future life to thee i give  irradiate every hour i live it is true no glowing bliss thy votries know from thee no poignant ecstacy can flow but oh thou shieldst the heart from rankling pain and misery strikes when blessed with thee in vain wan jealousys empoisoning tooth and love which feeds upon our youth and holy friendships broken tie never dim the luster of thy eye for thee it is all nature blooms for thee the spring new charms assumes nor vainly slings her blossoms round nor vainly bids her groves resound her music colors odours all are thine to thee her months their richest gifts consign to thee the morn is bright and sweet the ray that marks the progress of the sinking day each change is grateful to thy soul for its fine taste no woes control the powers of nature and of art alike entrance the easy heart and oh beneath thy gentle dome which the calm comforts make their home that cruel imp is never found whose fame such idle songs resound  dread sensibility  oh let me fly where greenland darkness drinks the beamy sky or where the sun with downward torrid ray kills with the barbarous glories of the day i would dare the excess of every clime grasp every evil known by time ere live beneath that witchs spells with whom no lasting pleasure dwells her lovely form deceives the heart the tear for ever prompt to start the tender look the ready sigh and soft emotion always nigh and yet content the insiduous fiend forbids  oh she has torn the slumbers from my lids often roused my torpid sense to living woe and bid chill anguish to my bosom grow she seals her prey  in vain the spring wakes rapture through her groves to sing the roseate morns hygean bloom fades down unmarked to evenings gloom oh sensibility thy scepter sad points where the frantic glance proclaims thee mad strained to excess reason is chained thy slave or the poor victim shuns thee in the grave to thee each crime each evil owes its birth that in gigantic horror treads the earth savage untamed she smiles to drink our tears and where is no solid ill she wounds with fears riots in sighs is soothed when most we smart  now while she guides my pen her fangs within my heart anna matilda jan         ode to anna matilda o cease matilda cease the strain that wooes indifference to thy arms for what are all her boasted charms but only to be free from pain and would thou then her torpid ease her listless apathy to know renounce the magic power to please and lose the luxury of woe why does thy stream of sweetest song in many a wild maze wind along foam on the mountains murmuring side or through the vocal covert glide or among fairy meadows steal  it is because thy heart can feel alas if peace must be unknown till every nerve is turned to stone till not a teardrop wets the eye nor throbs the breast for sorrows sigh o may i never find relief but perish in the pang of grief think not i reason thus my fair a stranger to corroding care ah if thou seldom findst repose  i rest not on a bed of rose despair cold serpent loves to twine about this helpless heart of mine yet though neglected and forlorn i scarce can check the smile of scorn when those the vulgar call the great bend the important brow of state and strive a consequence to find by seeming more than human kind well let them strut their hour away till grinning death demand his prey meanwhile my anna let us rove the scented vale the bending grove mix our hot tears with evening dews and live for friendship and the muse yes let us hasten hand in hand where the blue billows lave the land and as they quick recoiling fly send on the surf a lengthened sigh that strikes the soul with truth sublime as twere the whispering tongue of time for thus our short lifes ebbing day murmurs awhile and hastes away or let us seek the mouldering wall of some lone abbeys gothic hall recline upon the kneeworn stone and catch the north winds dismal moan that midst his sorrows seems to boast of many a gallant vessel lost friends and lovers sunk in death  by the fury of his breath what though at the imagined tale thy altered cheek be sadly pale never can such sympathy annoy for it is the price of dearest joy when far off the night storm flies let us ponder on the skies where countless stars are ever rolled which yet our weak eyes dare behold adore the selfexisting cause that gives to each its separate laws that when the impetuous comet runs athwart a wilderness of suns tells it what mandate to obey nor ever wander from its way till back it hastens whence twas brought beyond the boundaries of thought let not the studious seer reply  attraction regulates the sky and lends each orb the secret force that urges on or checks its course or with his orrery expound creations vainly fancied round ah quit thy toil presumptuous sage destroy thy calculating page no more on second causes plod it is not attraction but it is god and what the universe we call is but a point compared to all such bliss the sensate bosom knows such bliss indiffrence never bestows though small the circle we can trace in the abyss of time and space though learning has its limits got the feelings of the soul have not their vast excursions find no end and rapture needs not comprehend it is true we are ignrant how the earth wakes the first principles of birth with vegetative moisture feeds to different purpose different seeds gives to the rose such balmy sweet or fills the golden ear of wheat paints the ripe peach with velvet bloom or weaves the thick woods mingling gloom  yet we can wander in the bower can taste the fragrance of the flower drink the rich fruits nectareous juice and bend the harvest to our use  then give thy pure perceptions scope and sooth thy heaving heart with hope hope shall instruct my sorrwing friend the souls fine fervor never can end but when her limbs by death are laid beneath some yewtrees hallowed shade then shall her soaring spirit know the seraphims ecstatic glow then shall the essential mind confess that anguish has the power to bless that feeling was in bounty given and own the sacred truth  in heaven della crusca jan  0      ode to della crusca o thou who from  a wilderness of suns can stoop to where the low brook runs through space with rapid comets glow or mark where soft the snowdrops grow o thou whose burning pen now rapture paints then moralizes cold with saints now trembling ardors can infuse  then seems as dipped in cloistered dews  o say thy being quick declare art thou a son of earth or air celestial bard though thy sweet song might to a seraphs strains belong its wondrous beauty and its art can only touch not change my heart so heavensent lightning powerless plays and wanton throws its purple rays it leaps through nights scarce pervious gloom attracted by the roses bloom the illumined shrub then quivering round it seems each scented bud to wound morn shakes her locks and see the rose in renovated beauty blows smiles at the dart which past away and flings her perfume on the day thy lightning pen it is thus i greet fearless its subtle point i meet never shall its spells my sad heart move from the calm state it vows to love all other bliss i have proved is vain  all other bliss is dashed with pain my waist with myrtles has been bound my brow with laurels has been crowned love has sighed hopeless at my feet love on my couch has poured each sweet all these i have known and now i sly with thee indifference to die nor is thy gift  dull torpid ease the minds quick powers thou do not freeze no blessed by thee the soul expands and darts over newcreated lands springs from the confines of the earth to where new systems struggle into birth the germ of future worlds beholds the secrets of dark space unfolds can watch how far the erratic runs and gaze on della cruscas suns in some new orb can meet his starry mail and him on earth unknown in heaven with transport hail anna matilda feb        to anna matilda nor will i more of fate complain for i have lived to feel thy strain to feel its sunlike force divine swift darting through the clouds of woe shoot to my soul a sainted glow yet yet matilda spare to shin one moment be the blaze suppressed lest from this clod my spirit spring and borne by zephyrs trembling wing seek a new heaven upon thy breast but say does calm indifference dwell on the low ead or mountain swell or at gray evenings solemn gloom bend her bosom to the tomb or when the weak dawns orient rose in silvry foliage decked appears tell me if perchance she goes to the fresh gardens proud array where doubtful of the coming day each drooping flowret sheds translucent tears ah tell me tell me where for thou shall find me there like her own son in vestment pure with deep disguise of smile secure so shall i once thy form descry for once hold converse with thine eye vain is the thought for at thy sight soon as thy potent voice were found could i conceal the vast delight could i be tranquil at the sound could i repress quick raptures start or hide the bursting of my heart let but thy lyre impatient seize departing twilights filmy breeze that winds the enchanted chords among in lingering labyrinth of song anon the amorous bird of woe shall steal the tones that quivering flow and with them sooth the sighing woods and with them charm the flumbring floods till all exhausted by the lathe he hang in silence on the spray drop to his idol flower beneath and midst her blushes cease to breathe this alludes to the idea of the nightingale being enamoured of the rose so frequently expressed in persian poetry  warned by his fate twere surely well to shun the fascinating spell nor still presumptuous dare to fling my rude hand over the sounding string as though i fondly would aspire to match matildas heavenly fire yet may i sometimes far remote hear the loved cadence of her note and though the laurel i resign o may the bliss of taste be mine della crusca march          does calm indifference dwell on the low mead or mountain swell o tell me where for thou shall find me there  to della crusca yes on the mountains haughty swell and in the prostrate dell and where the dryades fling their shades  there may thou meet the maid serene or trace her on the zephyrd green whilst days carnation gently fades does nature make the prospect vast with rocks oerhang and rivers cast tumbling headlong to their base do seas stretch out their foamy plains compelling with their crystal chains wide continents to embrace all these attract the smooth browd fair or where can art evince her powers where science strew immortal flowers and gay indifference  haste not there whilst passion narrows up the heart taste can no ray of bliss impart one strong idea grasps the mind extends itself through all the soul through every vein its furies roll and tears with fangs unkind when newton trod the starry roads and viewed the dwellings of the gods and measured every orb  did silly love his steps attend his mighty purposes suspend or his grand mind absorb when intellectual lock explored the souls sad vacuum where no hoard of budding young ideas lay  oh tell thus robbed in wisdoms stole did loves coarse torch his view control or light him in the darksome way ha della crusca cease to feign thy cheek with red repentance stain for having feigned so long quick seize thy lyre sweep each bold string over every chord thy music fling  to calm indifference raise the song propitiate first then with her haste over the globes peopled motley waste watch character wherever it runs drink newer air see fiercer suns seek the bland realms where first the morn pours dawnlight from her beamy horn pours scent and colors over the vale and wakes its song and wakes its tale mark how confucius feeble race whose records vast fail not to trace to imitation still confine their powers nor deviate from its line their fourteen thousand glowing springs passing through their yearly rings not one suggestion left behind no art nor virtue more refined philosophy no inroads made but mute within its awful shade its thoughts occult arrangd  whilst learning blindfold in its pen this costly precept gave to men  be wise but be unchanged haste  leave the insipid herd  away where egypts sons imbrown the day for there primeval wisdom formed her wreath and science first was taught to breathe o linger here the classic clime demands and will reward thy time here shall thou seek the immortal dome where pleasure triumphed over rome and tread where cleopatra trod and moisten with thy tear the sod where taste and love their banners waved snatching from the grave old time  whose life fastfading rapture saved and phoenixlike renewed its prime then find the myrtled tomb the now unenvied lovers home but lest thy pensive steps should stray to guide thee in the unknown way the moon her bright locks quick unshrouds her veil of gossamour thin clouds dissolves

of my love and could thou think twas my design calmly to list thy notes divine that i responsive lays might send to gain a cold platonic friend far other hopes thy verse inspired and all my breast with passion fired for fancy to my mind had given thy form as of the forms of heaven  had bathed thy lips with vermil dew had touched thy cheek with mornings hue and down thy neck had sweetly rolled luxuriant locks of mazy gold yes i had hopes at last to press and lure thee to the chaste caress catch from thy breath the quivering sigh and meet the murder of thine eye ah when i deemed such joys at hand remorseless comes the stern command nor calls my wandering footsteps home but far and farther bids me roam and then thy vestal notes dispense the meed of cold indifference cursed power that to myself unknown still turns the heart i love to stone dwells with the fair whom most i prize and scorns my tears and mocks my sighs yes anna i will hasten forth to the bleak regions of the north where erickson immortal lord poured on the dane his vengeful sword or where wide over the barbarous plain fierce rurick held his ancient reign then once more will i trace the rhine and mark the rhones swift billows shine once more on virgils tomb i will muse and lauras gemmd with evening dews once more romes via sacra tread and ponder on the mighty dead more eastward then direct my way to thirsty egypts deserts stray fix in wonder to behold the pyramids renowned of old fallen near one of which i ween the hieroglyphic sphinx is seen the the overslowing of the nile always happens when the sun is in leo

relentless care thy days destroy but every hope be ripened into joy and o farewell to distant britains shore which i perhaps are doomed to see no more where valor wisdom taste and virtue dwell dear land of liberty alas farewell  yet often even there by wild ambition tossed the souls best season settles in a frost yet even there desponding late i knew that friendship foreignformd is rarely true for they whom most i loved whose kindness saved my shattered bark when erst the tempest raved at home even with the common herd could fly gaze on the wounded deer and pass him by nor yet can pride

each to each remained  a shadow and a shade della crusca may         to della crusca oh stay oh stay thy rash speed check not yet ascend the flying deck nor europes hemisphere forsake nor from thy nations pleasures take a bliss so exquisite and chaste  a feast so dear to polished taste as that thy lyre correctly flings as that they feel when della crusca sings alas you are gone and to my straining eye thy bark seems buoyant on the distant sky  see in the clouds its mast it proudly laves scorning the aid of oceans humble waves well may it soar and bear aloft the prize whose verse immortal links him to the skies well may it scorn rough neptunes rocky way which bears the genius of the god of day and now matilda bind thy lyre with cypress wreathes the lambent fire thou kindlest at his fervid rays can gleam no more thy future days lost to the muses and to taste each torpid hour will joyless waste in vain each morning now will glow  in vain soft maias music flow and to my pillow force its way and on my wakning senses play her notes my wakning senses fill and conscious slumbers own the trill but when at length remembrance bids the filmy slumber quit my lids saying the world its wit has brought its various point its well turned thought but della crusca lends no ray  oh what is morning  what is may yet hold some solace yet remains and pensive joys await my pains i

which promises the boasted bliss  no bard beloved the hope is this that there thy footsteps i may tread press the same turf where sunk thy head sip the quick stream thy thirst has slaked and greet the dawn where thou have waked fancyng her waves of mazy gold never with such rich refulgence rolled and when her tints of various dye burst from the pallid sickly sky there rush in violet there in green here in soft red imbue the scene then lose themselves by growing bright till swallowed up in one vast flood of light  thus shall i say he saw her rays thus was he roused to adore and praise oh sympathy of birth divine descend and round my heart strings twine touch the fine nerve whenever i breathe where della crusca dropped his wreath lead me the sacred way of rome lead me to kneel at virgils tomb where he the enduring marble round with fresh wove laurels graceful bound then guide where still with sweeter note than flowed from petrachs tuneful throat on lauras grave he poured the lay amidst the sighs of sinking day then point where on the sod his tear fell from its crystal source so clear that there my mingling tear may sink and the same dust its moisture drink thus dying swans are said to sing and their last breath in numbers fling over the dear liquid shining plains which nursed their joys and soothed their pains like them my muse pines fast away and this her last her closing day when one blessed word her lips has sealed in lasting silence she will be veiled expiring still her notes the same she murmurs della cruscas name  the sacred world ye heard it spoke  her book is closed  her lyre is broke anna matilda may   th      a tale for jealousy a recent event in catalonia loud shrieked the wind hoarse struck the hour when from his couch alphonso rose bedecked with gold his splendid bower  gold had his couch but not repose the night sat brooding on the hill beneath the sable rivers rolled not glistring now the tinkling rill its stream opaque its spirit cold his chamber long with restless feet the lord alphonso traversed over here once he tasted slumbers sweet but slumber sweet he knows no more his roused domestics strait obey the signal of their lord unlovd their torches flash a second day as through the costly rooms they moved his favorite from the obsequious train was to his inmost closet led there heard confessed the amorous pain which tore him from his midnight bed oh thou were near alphonso cries when in the progress late we made gonsalves daughter in our eyes bade every other virgin fade her noble mien her blushes mild the burnish of her traces bright her age  but just no longer child her rosy mouth her graceful height all these have in my timeworn heart lighted a youthful amorous fire  i sink beneath the poignant smart i faint with eager strong desire often did i try her soul to melt but ignrant she of cupids power  his ecstacies she never felt  but now is come her fated hour with flames illicit i essayed to touch her iced unwakend heart let hymen sooth the bashful maid she will wakened play a softer part strait to her fathers speed thy way the fleetest mules with haste prepare and ere tomorrow scans his day thou wilt reach the village of my fair these pearls these dimonds speak my truth woo her with treasures to my arms when love no longer boasts of youth riches may plead their meaner charms oh how unlike the rapturous hour when love is bought by love alone when a soft look a touch a flower is prized beyond inds brightest stone but go and to her parents bear thy lords designs  his hopes unfold plead with due force his meaning fair and in thy promises be bold much more the lord alphonso spoke his servants mind the whole retains whose lashes soon the mules provoke the mules skim over the distant plains the awakened night with streaks of gold her jetty robes begun to lace her drowsy car far off she rolled  the blithe sun urging to the race and ere his wheels had run behind the western mountains giddy slope julia with meekness all resigned had listened to alphonsos hope not so resigned but that her thought recoiled at such unequal love till by parental wisdom taught she learned to bear and then approve the sire attends his darling child for so alphonsos pride allows and with the transport almost wild saw her receive a grandees vows he saw that form where speaking grace gave soul to beauty most refined the robe of dignity embrace by taste magnificent designed her hair which floated over her dress a dress which to be seen demands its rich luxuriance to repress they tie in folds with diamond bands but the soft curls which haply fell upon her bosoms heaving snow were suffered there unbound to dwell and spread their wavy golden glow thus the fond parent saw her rove through gaudy halls and rooms of state whilst humble trains at distance move and from her nod receive their fate succinct the time in which such joy around his aged heart might play bitter oh bitter the alloy and set full soon his pleasures day for lord alphonso names the hour when he the sumptuous dome must quit and seek again the humble bower  for birth like his a mansion fit tells him to take a last farewell of her more dear than sense or light bids him never hope again to dwell where filial julia blessed his sight his daughter overwhelmed with woe the haughty cruel order hears she sees

plaintive pipe and fondly pour the song of suffrance to subdue thy heart or have been seen at infant dawns first gleam carving thy name upon the polished beach the boast the wonder of the rustic race

him from despair he saw the beauties once he prized all wither in their bloom by lawless passion sacrificed untimely to the tomb for how could injured honor look its author in the face or how could suffering virtue brook invective and disgrace no sorrows could afford relief no penitence atone the sigh she gave to others grief she wanted for her own the partners of her youthful years unpitying

the lovers thus described parted with  emotions the story gives them the dialogue only is fanciful it is the form which the author adopted as the best method of conveying to the public  the repentance of passion he and does my harriet still adhere to wear afflictions garb alone still does she hold her spoiler dear and prize his peace who broke her own still will she strive his pangs to heal who all

contemplation joys to trace the classic feature and the form of sense and hail the muse sublime and patrioi eloquence these are the plains that fancy loves over these white cliffs she wanders free and scatters in the floating gale her long array of fairy pageantry while melody in some far vale weaves on the air a lengthening line of cadence soft and swell divine what time the maniac rapture roves his jet locks dripping with the vapry shower that evening weeps upon each solded flower as down the shadwy hills her lessening car tracks the slow progress of her idol star then here in sweet delirium

burning eye balls round and as far off his shield he hurled with naked breast defied the world scarce was the mystic strain begun when from his eastern tent the sun leapt forth in arms and reared his crest sublime the prototype of time how lovely then were natures charms glittering ocean never ending ruby rocks and forests bending bending to the lawns below where countless flowerets countless tints bestow wide lakes their lucid mirrors spread upon whose banks the white flocks fed and seemed their silvry fleeces to adorn with the last luster of the moon of morn art alike transported straying was her rival power displaying over the sleek wave she bade a numerous sail stretched the fair canvas to the wafting gale  from shelving hills triumphant cities rise and towers and columnd domes usurp the skies  bade meadows smile with many a cultured bower and bursting fountains toss the spangled shower such was the scene when the rapt maiden sung ah who shall tell the music of her tongue the undulation of the stream low murmuring on the pebbly shores the warble of her favorite theme that philomel incessant pours from solitary loved retreat when starlight drops a tissued veil over the clear brook and moistened dale  such sounds were never half so sweet as when she told of roseate blisses tender smiles and vermil kisses nor half so thrilling battles call that sends defiance from the assaulted wall as when she told of honors merit glories that the brave inherit how the exulting breast disdains selfish pleasures  selfish pains from couch where downy peace had spread a jasmine pillow for his head borne upon translucent wings love the wanton cherub springs and flutters round in mazy play enthusiastic at the lay but soon he hies him to the cypress grove where jealousy retires to rove and chase soft slumbers from the virgins brow and tell her timid heart of many a broken vow then the benign consoler leads her fearful steps over fringed meads where hope indulgent freely throws fresh either from enchanted rose he brings her to the tearbathd stone where all repentant and alone in settled anguish of despair her lover lies  he brings her there and on quick pinion brushing by breathes the languor of a sigh the youth revives  with eager bound clasps his speechless fairone round while from her eye the swift drop rusnes in vain to quench her burning blushes o now the goddess of the potent lyre proves at her heart the sympathetic fire invokes the dryad and the fawn the fabled people of each wood and lawn and those that in the bright stream lave their glossy breasts or skim the occean wave she wooes them to the scene to show how near allied are bliss and woe how sweetly powerful to move the silent sentiment of love but soon the measure changed and slow she draws her elegiac trill with doleful sweep and at each sadlypenetrating pause teaches the meek morality to weep she sung of those to happiest fortune born whose downcast looks a dire reverse reveal who long too long neglected and forlorn had known to suffer and had learnt to feel by ling ring sorrow softened to excess of many a genial consolation flown who still regretted most the power to bless and others pangs lamented as their own of those who often when days proud torch was sped held wayward converse with the wintry wind who found on some cold rock their craggy bed and met a

gloom of the grave but far different cares shall they hasten to prove and press the rich grapes of the vintage of love then let us not languish my friends though it is true that when you want others they never want you though pleasures will pass yet the short time they stay to shun them is error it is sense to be gay does the fullmoon less sweetly enamel the plain because she is inconstant and destined to wane or do flowers when gathered less odor bestow than those that are suffered to fade as they grow in the calm of enjoyment then think not of sorrow nor brood on the storm that may

playmates haste away nor loiter here with fond delay when morn unveiled her radiant eye you hailed me as i wandered by returning at the approach of eve your meek salute i still receive benign enquirer thou shall know why here my lonesome moments flow it is said thy countrymen no more like ravning sharks that haunt the shore return to bless to raise to cheer and pay compassions long arrear it is said the numerous captive train late bound by the degrading chain triumphant comes with swelling sails mid smiling skies and western gales they come with festive heart and glee their hands unshackled  minds as free they come at mercys great command to repossess their native land the gales that over the ocean stray and chase the waves in gentle play methinks they whisper as they fly juellen soon will meet thine eye it is this that soothes her little son blends all his wishes into one ah were i clasped in her embrace i would forgive her past disgrace forgive the memorable hour she fell a prey to tyrant power forgive her lost distracted air her sorrowing voice her kneeling prayer the suppliant tears that galled her cheek and last her agonizing shriek locked in her hair a ruthless hand traild her along the flinty strand a ruian train with clamours rude the impious spectacle pursued still as she moved in accents wild she cried aloud my child my child the lofty bark she now ascends with screams of woe the air she rends the vessel lessening from the shore her piteous wails i heard no more now as i stretched my last survey her distant form dissolved away that day is past i cease to mourn  succeeding joy shall have its turn beside the hoarseresounding deep a pleasing anxious watch i keep for when the morning clouds shall break and darts of day the darkness streak perchance

mr jerningham the bard  to miss farren on her being absent from church while wondering angels as they looked from high observed thine absence with an holy sigh to them a bright exalted seraph said blame not the conduct of the absent maid wherever she goes her steps can never stray religion walks companion of her way she goes with every virtuous thought impressed heaven on her face and heaven within her breast the bard  the voice we love soft is the zephyrs breezy wing and balmy is the breath of spring when over the silent dewy vale its variegated sweets exhale stolen from the freshned flower glistning with an evening shower from the vilets nectard dew  from the rose of blushing hue and from sweet thyme empurpling all the ground it gathers rich perfume and sheds the odours round yet say what sweets can half so fragrant prove as the soft breath of those we fondly love go listen to the softest lute  the most persuasive magic song and hear the sweet responsive slute the wild melodious strains prolong attend awhile the soft impassioned lyre that melts the frozen heart and kindles fond desire simplicity thy steps shall lead to the simple verdant mead for to humble plains belong the oaten pipe and pastral song untutored in the school of art they breathe the impulse of the heart  hear the strain and mark it well  there true love and honor dwell whispering from among the trees sighing to the passing wind echoing back the evening breeze the soft eolian harp you will find mark its wild uncertain measure this is fancys sweetest treasure there she reigns and while she sings fairy fingers kiss the strings  there the blueeyed pleasures meet  there is loves most favorite seat  there of hope the loved retreat and every thing that is soft and every thing that is sweet of all the rapt melodious tones that heavendescended music owns recall the dear the magic strain that seemed to vibrate on thine heart and could a transient joy impart as the wild numbers lingered through the plain then say fond youth upon thy pensive breast is not this truth indelibly impressed  no dulcet sounds can so harmonious prove as the soft accents of the voice we love cesario  henry deceived god of the bow how blind art thou surely the fillet on thy brow is coarser wove than was the case when mortals viewed thee face to face for well we know thine eyes celestial when seen of old by belles terrestrial were decked with bandeau light and airy as might become a summer fairy their soft blue orbs so slight were bound thy piercing glance no hindrance found the gossamours transparent skin reposing on the lucid air appeared no longer light or thin if with thy veil it should compare then was thy sight like eagles keen nor gods nor men escaped thine eye nor cavern dark nor beamy sky  nay thoughts scarce born by thee were seen but now  oh dull of eye and heart thou know not whence loves ardours start and when stiff  s lines appear thou whisperst in my henrys ear that they are emmas henry believes  henry admires he thinks he sees his emmas fires dart vigorous through each labored page  he knows and feels her tender rage then asks   and can a man like me call forth such poetry in thee believing that the pen is mine he faints with rapturous pause on each delusive line thou henry never can learn the wounds i felt whilst you unconscious such barbed satire dealt midst your fond praise my pierced heart inly bled and shame bowed down your emmas sorrowing head what to be loved for wit i never owned and by a strangers verse to be dethroned how did i hate the graces of her song  the clustered sweets that round her soft lute throng which like the bees of hyblas yellow woods appeared to pour their wealth in golden floods my fancy pictured richer notes than fell from him of old who to the verge of hell led forth the wife he loved  but ah when read mad jealousy and childish envy fled the harmless lines i saw without one sigh and smiling wonder flashed across my eye mistaking henry look once more again read  s verses over should i complain of love betrayed i write like some forsaken maid  whilst the warm blood within thy veins flows but for me whilst emma reigns supreme within thy inmost soul and distant yet can still control its inmost movements and desires and knows herself sole object of its fires should she in dismal ditties mourn whilst love and truth so brightly burn mistaking henry look once more  again read  s verses over were i the poet thou the theme think thou like here is my verse would gleam with sunny rays and misty hills any myrtle groves and foamy rills oh no thyself  henry thyself alone should stand confessed on loves eternal throne round thee the brightness of my verse should shine round thee my living lays for ever ever twine if verse descriptive warms thy heart if that bids throbs of passion start i could seize fancys various clue untired her shifting steps pursue i would call nights lamp a crystal bow  bid her her silvry shafts bestow upon the tufted emerald plain or shower them over the shining main or when the full orbd jolly moon rode dull and thoughtless to her noon i would swear she dressed her whitelockd hours in choicest hue  and called forth flowers of softer tint and mild perfume wove in her own translucent loom to deck the world over which she hung  an amorous raycrownd hovering dove but when all this is said or sung it is not foolish henry love i would bear thee to the mountains height reared midst the sparkling dome of night observe the court of heaven hung round with drops of flame on azure ground show where bright venus rolls her car and where chill saturn  monstrous star through thirty years drives torpid on and all these summers counts as one bid thee regard almost with scorn our trisling system  where is borne in fond attractions airy chain the mighty planetary train for oh beyond that systems bounds  where that in all its various rounds never shed the faintest ray  where the vast suns unmeasured light in rushing floods in boundless flight never imitated day far far beyond new orbits trace in wider heavens in grander space their gorgeous way in flame and these again in turn shall shrink abashed amidst creation sink and hardly own a name all these may adoration move  with strong devotion touch the soul bid piety her incense roll  but still my henry it is not love in future know when vagrant verse shall any other strain rehearse though the rapt pen may nicely blend all truth or fiction ever could lend to elevate the lay though all apollos fire should seem to illume the page with sacred beam and bless the bard with bays  yet if love thrills not in each turn nor seems along the line to burn nor gives each verse the touch divine  they are not wrote to thee nor are their glories mine emma  to emma was it the shuttle of the morn that wove upon the cobwebd thorn thy airy lay  or did it rise in thousand rich enameled dies to greet the noonday sun  and glow with brighter beams than he can throw or was it wafted by the austral breeze that bathes him in the wild perfume of every roses liquid bloom  that hangs upon the lilys lip  her silken beverage to sip  tell me  o tell me emma which of these how burst the music on my ear the only music henry bears to hear i felt it  each strong nerve inflame like a new soul usurp my heart and rage and burn in every part ah sure not even deaths cold spell could the fierce fury of my passion quell but springing from this earthly dross far to the winds my cares i would toss and swear before the living shrine where seraphs worship truth divine that still i loved but thee  and thou were still the same ah wonder not a stranger song should cheat me thus  i own it wrong low in the dust my head i bow as if i could have falsifyd my vow yes  banish from thy thoughts surprise  for thou art ever present to my eyes at each successive varying hour thou whisperst in the softening shower  the linnets trill  but tells of thee thou smilst upon the summers sea and when the jolly full moon laughs in her clear zenith to behold the envious stars withdraw their gleams of gold it is to thy health she stooping quaffs the sapphire cup that fairy zephyrs bring which gay intoxicating bliss with dewy glances paused to kiss where frolic love has dipped his purple wing then let the harp thy mad touch prove and sing  and sing again  of love sing  till faint evening drops to rest on weeping twilights downy breast till greyhaird melancholy dawn culls the loose vapors from the shadowy lawn and only check the rapturebreathing sound when faithful henry at thy feet is found yes yes i come wit lightning speed i fly to meet the enchantment of thy melting eye to kneel before thee  to subdue thy blame for still i love but thee  and thou art still the same henry  we preserve the following poetry in this edition for two reasons it was the first poetic offering ever made to the memory of the unfortunate it mourns and because it came from a pen whose fervor and tenderness would prove it without a signature to be that of anna matilda  monologue o chatterton for thee the pensive song i raise thou object of my wonder pity envy praise bright star of genius  torn from life and fame my tears my verse shall consecrate thy name ye muses who around his natal bed triumphant sung and all your influence shed apollo thou who rapt his infant breast and in his daedal numbers shone confessed ah why in vain such mighty gifts bestow  why give fresh tortures to the child of woe why thus with barbarous care illume his mind adding new sense to all the ills behind thou haggard poverty whose cheerless eye transforms young rapture to the ponderous sigh in whose dear cave no muse ever struck the lyre nor bard ever maddend with poetic fire why all thy spells for chatterton combine his thought creative why must thou confine subdued by thee his pen no more obeys no longer gives the song of ancient days nor paints in glowing tints from distant skies nor bids wild scenry rush upon our eyes  ceckd in her flight his rapid genius cowers drops her sad plumes and yields to thee her powers behold him muses see your favorite son the prey of want ere manhood is begun the bosom ye have filled with anguish torn  the mind you cherished drooping and forlorn and now despair her sable form extends creeps to his couch and over his pillow bends ah see a deadly bowl the fiend concealed which to his eye with caution is revealed seize it apollo  seize the liquid snare dash it to earth or dissipate in air stay hapless youth refrain  abhor the draught with pangs with racks with deep repentance fraught oh hold the cup with woe eternal flows more  more than death the poisonous juice bestows in vain  he drinks  and now the searching sires rush through his veins and writhing he expires no sorrowing friend no sister parent nigh to sooth his pangs or catch his parting sigh alone unknown the muses darling dies and with the vulgar dead unnoted lies bright star of genius  torn from life and fame my tears my verse shall consecrate thy name anna matilda  a fragment addressed to  touched by thy wit my souls on fire my bosom throbs with young desire what though thy form i never saw is there to man devulgd a law that only what he sees must touch his heart the vulgar rule i disallow and in my passion feel even now that wit like beauty gives the tender smart methinks thy form i would not know nor to thy face the pleasure owe of these delicious melting pains which when a mortal once attains he knows the greatest bliss for man designed no to my fancy i will apply there find thy form thy air thy eye and feast my frenzy with a zest refined when in a pensive mood i sit and melancholy takes her sit mild

of arragon without the information we now give  the following lines were addressed to mr humphrey the celebrated miniature painter on his  portrait of miss farren by lord derby o thou whose pencil all the graces guide whom beauty conscious of her fading bloom so often implores alas with harmless pride to snatch the transient treasure from the tomb pleased i behold the fair whose comic art the

fragrant incense the soft breath shall rise and smooth thy passage to thy kindred skies severely kind o why did adverse fate grant such vast bounties with so scant a date give such sweet fragrance to this shortlived flower the virtues of an age to last an hour it gave her wit might grace a muses tongue the charm of numbers and the power of song the angelic touch to strike the trembling string and tune such notes as heavens own seraphs sing but o oerbounteous with that sacred art it gave each nicer movement to the heart and her soft breast with strong sensation fired felt the keen impulse which those arts inspired too great a portion of celestial flame strained the frail texture of her weaker frame the subtle fire too powerful forced its way through the soft yielding mould of mortal clay as

heavens gate thy sister angels thy arrival wait swift to conduct thee to thy parents breast for heaven has heard and granted thy request advertisement since the printing of the first edition of these works the correspondence between della crusca and anna matilda has been renewed  the editor therefore thinks it proper to continue their respective writings up to the present time as also to insert the beautiful poems by laura and the one she called forth from leonardo etc these latter additions are necessary on account of the subsequent allusions to them and because the lines signed leonardo appear to have been produced by the pen of della crusca  to anna matilda in vain i fly thee  it is in vain the swift bark bears me over the boisterous main for mid the giant shades that sweep the heaving bosom of the deep when rushing clouds lashed by the gale spread over the sun their transient veil thy form appears  i see thee haste lightly athwart the wildring waste and shake thy burnished locks and smile i see thee  and adore the while do i adore thee  ah my fair since first thy sweet song soothed my heart i have never known a bliss a care but thou matilda gavst a part when in helvetias groves i lay for thee my hot sighs stole away and often with thee methought at  mornings hour seated in crystal roseate tower i saw the goddess health pursue the skimming breeze through fields of dew while the high lark with quivering poize told the gay story of his vernal joys and often as twilight on the western edge had twined his hoary hair with sabling sedge imagination fondly turned to thee and sought the solace of dear sympathy nor yet the yellow rhines impetuous wave a short oblivion of my passion gave heedless i trod the sportive banks of rhone for anna o i live i live for thee alone and when to lauras tomb i came glowing with petrarchs purest flame as the first drop my pity shed i started as if thou were dead but hark what cruel sounds are these which float upon the languid breeze which fill my mind with jealous fear ah see  and anna matildas answer which are inserted  forty forth pges but which della crusca had never read  before his writing the above reuben is the name i hear for him my faithless anna weaves a wreath of rose and myrtle leaves on which the winged amorous boy has freely wept with tears of joy  and binding soft her favrites brows she mingles her tootender vows hence sounds severe  no more intrude  leave me to peace and solitude leave me to tread lifes varying slope  leave me awhile to cherish hope for even cold critics have conceived so much alike our measures run and even the gentle have believed that anna and that i were one  would it were so  we then might prove the sacred settled unity of love o supposition vain alas i have seen seven fleeting lustres pass and now the flush of life is over and if i ever could please i please no more yet though my hasty youth is flown anna i worship thee unknown  and check for thee my wandering course and yield to thy mysterious force  and i again will take my flute when slumbering natures self is mute save where perchance the aspin wood that whispers over yon midnight flood shall drop its shattered honors round in seeming sorrow at the sound and as my faithful voice i raise with all the fervency of praise o may i lure thee from thy secret bower to cheer once more my melancholy hour  so shall i grateful bless strong fates decree that bids me still return to poetry  and thee della crusca october         to him who will understand it thou art no more my bosoms friend here must the sweet delusion end that charmed my senses many a year through smiling summers  winters drear o friendship am i doomed to find thou art a phantom of the mind  a glittering shade an empty name an airborn visions vaprish flame and yet the dear deceit so long has waked to joy my matin song has bid my tears forget to flow chased every pain soothed every woe that truth unwelcome to my ear swells the deep sigh recals the tear gives to the sense the keenest smart checks the warm pulses of the heart darkens my fate and steals away each gleam of joy through lifes sad day britain farewell i quit thy shore my native country charms no more no guide to mark the toilsome road no destined clime no fixed abode alone and sad ordained to trace the vast expanse of endless space to view upon the mountains height through varied shade of glimmering light the distant landscape fade away in the last gleam of parting day or in the quivering lucid stream to watch the pale moons silver beam or when in sad and plaintive strains the mournful philomel complains in dulcet notes bewails her fate deserted by a faithless mate inspired by sympathy divine i will weep her woes  for they are mine driven by my fate wherever i go over burning sands over hills of snow or on the bosom of the wave the howling tempest doomed to brave wherever my lonely course i bend thy image shall my steps attend each object i am doomed to see shall bid remembrance picture thee yes i shall view thee in each flower that changes with the transient hour thy wandering fancy i shall find borne on the wings of every wind thy wild impetuous passions trace over the white waves tempestuous space in every changing season prove an emblem of thy wavering love torn from my country friends and you the world lies open to my view new objects shall my mind engage i will explore the historic page sweet poetry shall sooth my soul philosophy each pang control the muse i will seek  her lambent fire my souls quick senses shall inspire i with finer nerves my heart shall beat touched by heavens own promethean heat italias gales shall bear my song in softlinkd notes her woods among upon the blue hills misty side through trackless deserts waste and wide over craggy rocks whose torrents flow upon the silver sands below sweet land of melody it is thine the softest passions to refine thy myrtle groves thy melting strains shall harmonize and sooth my pains nor will i cast one thought behind on foes relentless  friends unkind  i feel i feel their poisoned dart pierce the life nerve within my heart it is mingled with the vital heat that bids my throbbing pulses beat soon shall that vital heat be over those throbbing pulses beat no more  no  i will breathe the spicy gale plunge the clear stream new health exhale over my pale cheek diffuse the rose and drink oblivion to my woes this poem was written by mrs robinson laura nov         to laura laura i heard thy warbled woes at fading twilights solemn close they met me in yon dreary vale just as the ringdove ceased her tale a tale like thine which seemed to speak that soon her wounded heart would break was it perhaps she sought the grove in lone solicitude of love was it like thee a faithless mate she mourned too sadly and too late surely it was  for with the note i found such melting anguish float that watery vapors dimmed my eye and all my soul was sympathy nor wonder that i so was moved for i have suffered i have loved have felt the truest passion burn have known the ecstatic blessed return have watched the look of languor cast to show the rigrous hour was past then have i pressed the blushing fair with pangs  how different from despair yet was the bliss so pure so chaste that seraphs might the rapture taste alas the joy was doomed to fade like days proud flush in evening shade  the eye so settled once would range  the longfixd heart began to change ah then i thought with thee  to try the only refuge left  and fly on many a foreign shore to roam and leave my rending cares at home yes i have trod the alpine steep by rushing po have stopped to weep on the loud danubes banks have stood and eastward crossed the caspian flood it is but illusion  yet remains unfaded memory of pains the circle widning for relief has still the central point of grief then from the alluring thought recoil  it is desolating fruitless toil but most avoid italias coast where every sentiment is lost where treachry reigns and base disguise and murder  looking to the skies while sordid selfishness appears in low redundancy of scars o what can musics voice bestow or sculptured grace or titian glow to recompense the feeling mind for british virtues left behind here rather here thy ills confound to list the billows roar around to see the misty phantoms glide on the choked rivers willowy side when the young moon aspires to stream her scanty crescents feeblest beam then wistful mark the drenching showers that foil gav summers fairest flowers scorn the fierce storm the season dare and learn to triumph or to bear but if thy sorrow softened heart in vain resists the venomed dart with mine thy deep afflictions blend and for a lover lost receive a friend this poem though signed leonardo is from the pen of dilla crusca leonardo dec         to della crusca and time and youth and love must pass away creech whilst i danced gaily in the round of folly on her fairy ground and played and sung and laughed away the feathry hours of lifes short day thy invocation like the flame which starts from the electric frame struck on my heart i sighed i turned and anna yet for della crusca mourned when wounded pride sussusd its blush and over my nerves its tremors rush never will i  leave my secret bower to cheer thy melancholy hour secure within i will remain and smile at thy factitious pain and when thy poetry so sweet shall next my wandering glances meet i will spare a sigh to moments fled  but anna shall to thee be dead see  to my couch i laughing turn  poetic passions vainly burn the freshest roseleaves for my head shall form a blushing scented bed the elastic camomile unprest invite the sickening heart to rest flora shall every gift shower round and bid her bright gems deck the ground the myrtle only there shall never unfold its odorous boughs never flaunt its blossoms fair frail and alluring as thy vows it is loves devoted tree  oh bid it seek some other home nor spread its sweets for me nor shed its poison round my dome hah did thou hope i should not trace the mental features of thy face did thou believe the thickest veil could della cruscas brow conceal oh how impossible a task to hide thy radiance in a mask thy living fires destroy the skreen thou standst contest  thy form is seen yes write to laura speed thy sighs tell her her della crusca dies in sweetest measures sing thy woes and speak thy hot loves ardent throes  and when it next shall please thy heart toward some other fair to start the gentle maidens versed in cures for every ill fond love endures she  drinks oblivion to its pains  and vows to stain her pallid cheek with juices of red grapes so sleek and sings adieus in bacchanalian strains false lover truest poet now farewell hark in yon curfews sound is tolled the knell of our departed loves the pensive tale the surging aother floats across the vale the elegiac sound sooths my sad ear and the moist lid sustains a trembling tear the crimson veil which decked yon mountains brow and glided into gentlest tints but now already blackens down its swelling side and soon the beauties of the plain will hide  the outstretchd beauties where salubrious to calls food and riches from the sterile soil o wondrous magic shall great labors name remain unhallowed by the voice of fame creative labor whose allbounteous hand drops slowrs and fruits and forests over the land who bids the indented river curving sly or fix a silvry lake beneath the eye but these all sink before the falling night who tries to sezie the flitting beams of light but the proud light its amorous touch eludes and a dim shadow over the landscape broods soft drizzling rain the patterd trees confess and chilling breezes on my bosom press my hair whose curls late floated over my breast weighty with moisture clings around my vest  where  where is the hand to press those tresses dry the fond encircling arm the cheering eye why sigh the winds tumultuous through the woods why weeps the night in such impetuous floods it is the loss of della cruscas muse which thus with sorrow every plant imbues for never shall again his  golden quill with magic passion every bosom thrill he yet may write but anna twas alone lured down his guardian goddess from her throne who whilst she poured the richest of her store and charmed his heart with bright poetic lore phophetic thus his future history read and wreathed it in the laurels for his head if false thou ever matildas heart should wring and to another nymph presume to sing my inspiration thou no more shall know my fire in thee no more divinely flow the goddess spoke her words were marked by fate and della crusca mourns his annas wrongs too late anna matilda feb         laura to anna matilda o anna since thy graceful song can wind the cadence soft among the hearts fine nerves and ravish thence the wondering poets captive sense till warmed by thy electric fire his yielding soul with fond desire glows but for thee  dispel thy fears nor stain thy downy cheek with tears o quit thy blushing scented bed pluck the pale roses from thy head again with native luster shine and round thy polished brow the unfading myrtle twine subdue the haggard witch whose emrald eye darts fell revenge and poisning jealousy mark where amidst her ebon hair the scaly serpents mingling twine while darting through the infected air the murderous vapors shine o turn thee anna quickly turn where della cruscas torch shall burn for thee alone his harp is strung to the soft music of thy tongue no verse of mine his song inspired  thy notes so loved so long admired still vibrate in his glowing heart where every chord is tuned to thy poetic art ah let me for repose repair where sorrow steals to weep her care deep in some cave or craggy cell where the lone screech owl loves to dwell and o my cheerless couch i will spread while spangled with the lunar dew the nightshade and the baneful yew shall wind about my head there will i breathe a strain forlorn and like a lingering wintry morn pale and with chilling rays appear cold glimmering through a crystal tear yet let me della cruscas lays admire still gaze with hallowed rapture on his fire list his soft tones of melting mood sweeter than ringdove ever cood tuneful as metastasios tongue or plaintive petrarchs witching song i feel no wish no selfish joy anothers transports to destroy ambition is not worth the name that meanly shines with borrowed fame no counterfeited bliss my heart shall own the conscious mourner sighs for bayards vows alone since his loved voice first caught my ear often have i tried to calm my woe often have i brushed away the tear  the tear his numbers taught to flow i seize the lyre to sooth my grief court mazy science for relief  vain is the effort it is in vain  the fierce vibration fills my brain burns through each aching nerve with poignant smart and riots cureless in my bleeding heart it is not the bacchanalian bowl can free from pain the sickening soul the brewed enchantments poison fell the mellow grapes nectareous juice suits the base mind its baleful use throws over the sense a torpid spell but lethes pure and limpid stream shall calm the thought from passions dream it is there my breast shall seek repose and drink oblivion to its woes laura march        to anna matilda  at her footstool stands an altar burning with eternal fire unsullied unconsumed akenside heaven of my heart again i hear thy longlost voice but ah the tear steals from my lids and deadly pain creeps in cold langour through each gasping vein and can that mind i love so well thy souls deep tone thy thoughts high swell the proud poetic fervor known but in thy breasts prolific zone can these combine to curse me can that gaze in whose rich orb the fairy fancy plays through which the charms that art and nature show spring to the judgment and there brighter glow can that be changed to anger can thou doom my future wish to dwell upon the tomb can thou so keen of feeling urge my fate and bid me mourn thee yes and mourn too late o rash severe decree my maddning brain cannot the ponderous agony sustain but forth i rush as varying frenzy leads to cavernd lakes or to the diamond meads over which the sultry noonbeams wide dissuse and slake their eager thirst with lingering dews or to yon sullen slope that shuns the light where the black forest weaves meridian night disordered lost from hill to plain i run and with my minds thick gloom obscure the sun for naught to me alas can now avail the freshning vapors of the perfumed dale the distant seawaves variegated green or the soft anguish of nights eye serene they cannot yield me comfort though the spring should shake spontaneous beauty from her wing or guide my footsteps to the enchanted lawn where blushing pleasure hymns the birth of dawn still would i pause to weep still would i turn from scenes like these to the neglected urn that mid some grove in solemn ruin lies and tells how the forsaken lover dies there would i fondly clasp the broken stone and whisper every mental pang i have known repeat the dread inexorable word that stern matilda spoke  matilda most adored when at the last years close of may from thy sweet chains i burst away and dashed my woeworn harp upon the ground still in my flight loves rapturous hope was found but now all soothing hope is past in vain i checked my progress on the midland main in vain to europes continent i came lured by the light of thy poetic flame in vain i bade my wandering toil be over and on matilda called with trembling tongue once more and think thou anna that my love like thine could ever faithless prove that in some female reubens praise i the impassioned verse could raise that i so quickly led astray could wake the warm inconstant lay no  though concealed i struck my lyre when by dull evenings fading fire pale echo sat who as she caught the sound gave the week murmur to the woods around yet twas thy image filled my mind  i heard a tuneful phantom in the wind i saw it watch the rising moon afar wet with the weepings of the twilight star assiduous zephyr told me it was thou and wondering not deceived i breathed the friendly vow if i have wronged thee my hot tears shall melt thy rage or flow for years for oh till then my days shall go in deep regret unaltered woe in mute reflection heavy care and solitudes supreme despair but still for thee my breast shall beat with the most faithful honest heat then save me save me let thy radiant smile again restore me or again beguile with melting music calm my bosoms groan o deign to pity him who loves but thee alone and whither shall i turn from thee for in thy absense all things fade friendship i know is but a glittering shade a sweet deception  strange uncertainty nor could ambitions busy rage an anguish such as mine assuage vain must the worlds best glories prove to fill the vacuum in the heart of love how brightly spreads the opening flower what beauteous life informs the bower how fair the streams of curling silver glide how rich the harvest waves its golden pride it is lights creation all  when that retires the pictures perish and the charm expires so the faint colors of my mimic lays drew their false luster from matildas blaze but soon the tints shall vanish  it is decreed and endless darkness come if she recede then hear my word by that fierce orb whose flame scarce all the skies absorb by every winged blast that goes to its full banquet on the rose by truth eternal undefiled by gentlest sorrows warblings wild by the gay tresses of the morn by earth and sea and heaven it is sworn that never again this hand shall fling its feeble tremors to the string till thou matilda bidst the measure pour till then thy della crusca writes no more della crusca march         to della crusca ambiguous nature formed the female heart so proud capricious cold and warm that much she feared her first command inert would prove throughout the land so gave the counteracting charm  on favored man bestowed sagacious art thus whilst my keen resentment flowed thy vow upon my bosom glowed sage anger instant took her flight and from thy muse a joy so bright dissusd itself through all my veins that hanging over thy charming strains my lips spontaneously unclose and thus the proud petition rose  o monarch of the heavengiven lyre thou who the theban peasant did inspire with radiant knowledge and poetic taste to spread thy numbers over the flinty waste  in my yet darker mind thy beam infuse and let me feel the highinspiring muse give me one spark of della cruscas light teach me like him to think  to paint  to write pour on my pen his rich abounding lay which earth and heaven sublimely can display mark how his varying touch makes ever new objects grown flat on long accustomed view  even truth itself his pencil can command  immutable she bends beneath his hand in differing characters she starts from rust decked in opposing colors yet opposing just thus as i prayed unwelcome slumbers came but lively wakeful thought remained the same  and to apollos temple led my feet the same ambitious wishes to repeat with downcast eyes i near the altar kneel and sacred fervours on my bosom steal my folded hair devoutly i unbound and dashed my onceproud laurels on the ground my robes more white than the soft down which flies over thistled deserts through autumnal skies wide over the tesselated pavement flowed and round the everlasting tapers glowed again i utter forth my fond desire but midst the incense my proud hopes expire the paeand god now shook his beamy throne and through the dome indignant radiance shone  presumptuous anna was the stern reply from him who rolls days orbit through the sky the mighty boon thoust asked shall never be thine parnassus hear record the oath divine yet more  to punish thy aspiriring hope which led thee with my chosen son to cope the small  small portion of celestial flame thou stolst from him of the immortal name hence moulders  fades upon thy darkened soul nor leaves one spark through the chill void to roll shocked at my fate my ready lids unclose and the harsh vision from my pillow rose oh barbarous vision which i live to rue  for though a dream thou were  my doom is true apollos just decree too sure i feel and on my spirit torpid languors steal hah what avails my della cruscas vow poetic ardors fly me now what though the roses morning blush rivals the western clouds which rush to mix their crimson with the gold that round the sinking sun is rolled  what though mays zephyrs in the groves attentive to the harmonious loves of the bewitching feathered race forget to breathe on earths moist face  what though the blossoms in the mead beneath the heifers fragrant tread exude soft balm upon the wind and all their mingled sweets unbind yet shall sad anna never know the boundless sweets which round her flow whether the mountains breath i drink or midst the vales embroidry sink  fancy no more will aid the scene nor flutter over me on the green with liquid step when the pure stream dancing shall through its borders gleam when flora from her rainbow wing shall shake the tints which from the spring when music wanders midst the shade when perfumes airs blue sea pervade a winter over my mind will spread nor tints nor scents nor liquid streams be read hapless my fate unoccupyd unblest sickening with ease  hating the tasteless rest  whilst laura still may dress the lay in all the luster of the day with such sweet pensiveness complain that mortals are in love with pain for ah it falls like aprils snow upon the crocus purple glow soft as the fluttrings of the fainting gale oppressed by leo flaming over the vale but shall not della crusca sue for her who to his muse is true for one who round her heart has wreathed all the rich strains he ever breathed  will he not strive to break the avenging rod  oh fly thou poet blessed and struggle with the god anna matilda paris march         the interview o we have met and now i call on you dark clouds that as they fall sweep their long showers across the plain or mingle with the clamorous main alas i call them here to pour around my head that gathered store while the loud gales which speed away to the far edge of weeping day mid the tumultuous gloom shall bear on their wet wings my sighed despair of late  where confluent torrens crash i paused to view the mazy dash of waters shattering in the twilight beam while often my wandering eye would trace the distant forests solemn grace as over its black robe hung the tawny gleam nor then on joys gone by my memory dwelt nor all the pangs which wounded friendship felt but anna though unknown usurped my mind alone she claimed the tributary tear for every solace every charm combined in the sweet maddnings of her song sincere sudden i turn  for from a young groves shade whose infant boughs but mock the expecting glade sweet sounds stole forth  upborne upon the gale pressed through the air and broke amidst the vale then silent walked the breezes of the plain or lightly wantoned where the cornflowr blows or amongst the odorous wildthyme sought repose or soared aloft and seized the hovering strain as the fond lark whose clear and piercing shake bids morning on her crimson bed awake hears from the greensward seat his favrites cry drops through the heavens and scorns the glowing sky so i soultouchd the impetuous catract leave and almost seem the etherial waste to cleave allured entranced i rush amidst the wood and there the soft musician conscious stood ah twas no visionary fair imaginations bodied air that now with strong illusion caught mental creations fled my thought a living angel blessed my sight strung every nerve to new delight with joys full tide bedewed my cheek twas annas self i saw nor had i power to speak o then i led her to the woven bower where slept the woodbines sheltered flower where bending over the violets bed the rose its liquid blushes shed while near the feathered mourner flung such plaints from his enamored tongue that all subdued at my matildas feet i sunk but with an agony more sweet than favored mortal ever before had proved or ever yet conceived unless like me he loved she spoke but o no sound was heard of the wanton rapturous bird that climbs the mornings upmost sky when first the golden vapors fly but fainter was the moving measure than the linnets noontide leisure lets the sultry breezes steal  dare thou my tongue the tale reveal illfated bard she cried whose lengthening grief had won the pathos of my lyres relief for whom full often i have loiterd to rehearse in phrenzied mood the deep impassioned verse illfated bard from each frail hope remove and shun the certain suicide of love lean not to me the impassioned verse is over which chained thy heart and forced thee to adore for o observe where haughty duty stands her form in radiance dressed her eye severe eternal scorpions writhing in her hands to urge the offenders unavailing tear dread goddess i obey ah smooth thy awful terrorstriking brow hear and record matildas sacred vow never will i quit the undeviating line whose source thou art and thou the law divine the sun shall be subdued his system fade ere i forsake the path thy fiat made yet grant one soft regretful tear to flow prompted by pity for a lovers woe o grant without revenge one bursting sigh ere from his desolating grief i fly  it is past  farewell another claims my heart then wing thy sinking steps for here we part we part and listen for the word is mine anna matilda never can be thine she ceased and sudden like an evening wind rushing some imprisoned tempest to unbind and all regardless of the scenes it leaves skimming over bending blooms and russet sheaves matilda fled the closing night pursued and the cold ingrate scarce i longer viewed her form grew indistinct  each step more dim and now a distant vapor seems to swim her white robe glistens on my eye no more its strainings are all in vain  the fond delusions over all the lines in this poem printed in italics are from the pen of anna matilda  my song subsides yet ere i close the lingering lay that feeds my woes ere yet forgotten della crusca runs to torrid gales or petrifying suns ere bowed to earth my latest feeling flies and the big passion settles on my eyes o may this sacred sentiment be known that my adoring heart is annas own yes all her own and though another claim her minds rich treasure still i love the same and though another o how blessed has felt her softened soul in dear delirium melt while from her gaze the welcome meaning sprung as on her neck in frantic joy he hung yet i will bear it and though hell deride my pangs shall sooth my curse shall be my pride nor can he boast like me o no he found the tranquillizing balm that cures the wound he never knew the loftier bliss to rave without a power to aid a chance to save he never bathed him in the nightshades dew nor drank the poisonous meteors as they flew nor told his rending story to the moon linked with the demons of her direct noon he never smiled distractions ills to share nor gained the exalted glory of despair then be it his for many a year to enfold those charms and wanton in her curls of gold drain the sweet fountain of her eyes fond stream and fancy suffrance but the wretchs dream while i will prove that i deserve my fate was born for anguish and was formed for hate with such transcendent woe will breathe my sigh that envying fiends shall think it ecstacy and with fierce taunts my cherished griefs invade till on my powrless tongue the last matilda fade della crusca june         to philander this poem was in the former editions addressed to della crusca who said when i am dead write my elegy  ibimus ibimus utcunque praecedes supremum carpere iter comites parati  yes i would write the sad command lives in each melancholy throb which lifts my heart thy annas hand when death that melting eye shall rob of the blue flames which flashing there thy burning soul so well declare  thy annas hand that soul shall then disclose and by indulging charm her weary woes forth would i rush whilst nights dim orb the blackest vapors of the sky absorb and should a lingering star with glittering beam send through the air its silvery stream i would tell it that philander was no more  strait would its glittering beam be sad and the wide heavens in darkness clad would join to mourn whom i should then deplore quick to the cypress forest i would hie whose thick gloom never drank the healthful sky and from its deepest central spot where misery had raised her flinty grot a bough i would tear whilst shrieking through the ebon air the night birds voice would dismal echo wake and with its lorn complaints the resting valleys shake then would i find where yewtrees wave over some unhappy lovers grave their desolated shade and from their baleful branches brush the poisonous dews  or madly crush the juices from the riven rind that never again the naked trunk should bind my chosen cypress reed i would then immerse and calling on the muse of melancholy verse with the yews tears i would story all my woe nor should a mingling tear of mine presume to flow no i would scorn to weep the glorious grief should gorge upon my heart and spurn relief how i would write of dear philander dead o i would weave such verse that round my hea the demons of the night arrested in their wheeling slight should learn to pity and to mourn and curse their bounded power which would not let them say return return i would paint his form and every varying grace impressed by feeling on his manly face then should forever live his sapphire eye and though his sensate heart in earth dissolves as time obliterating round revolves that beam at least should never never die but o how should i paint his mind a taste so true and so refined how should i speak of his immortal muse that now can such delight diffuse a muse which forms a nations taste and over the weedy waste of longneglected poetry had thrown a vivid light which so sublimely shone that to its source ten thousand poets flew and formed their songs and tuned their harps anew but yes even of his muse i would speak and though i know the swelling theme would shake my soul till in the extreme of strong sensation every nerve would break yet having then fulfilled my task done what last nights soft shadows heard him ask what could i next but die yes i would court him vainly famed the king of terrors oh how lightly named would he not be my bosoms friend would not the sighs his agonies would rend from my torn heart be passports bright to wing me to the fields of living light where from the rapt seraphic throng my own philanders powerful song would be the first to seize my ear and make me feel that heaven was near come then pale king feed on my feeble breath o come thou stayst too long  too long enchanting death anna matilda june         to a  e b  n think not transcendent maid my woe shall ever trouble thy repose the mind no lasting pang can know which lets the tongue that pang disclose sorrow is sacred when it is true in deep concealment proudly dwells and seems its passion to subdue when most the impulsive throb compels for he who dares assert his grief who boasts the anguish he may prove obtains perhaps the wished relief but o the traitor does not love the lover is a man afraid has neither grace nor ease nor art embarrasd comfortless dimayd he sinks the victim of his heart he feels his own demerits most when he should most aspire to gain and is at length completely lost because he cannot urge his pain but though he be so much subdued and every scene of spirit leave as if he mourned for all he viewed as if he only lived to grieve yet let his fairones wrongs be told sudden he rushes forth to save the forests king is not so bold o if he loves he must be brave and if alas her hand should bless some more attractive youth than he he never would adore the less but glory in his agony he would see her to the altar led and still command his struggling sigh nor would he let one tear be shed he would triumph then  for then he would die a furious modern satirist who cannot in any manner moderate his rage at the success which mr merrys poetry has met with under the signature of della crusca falls soul on him in desperation and actually charges him with the heinous offense of poetical inconstancy for having addressed loveverses to a variety of women the justice of the accusation cannot seriously be denied all we can say is that we
