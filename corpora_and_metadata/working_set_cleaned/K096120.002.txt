redlionstreet clerkenwell and sold by all booksellers  m dcc lxxxviii  advertisement a number of the subscribers to this work having signified a wish that pallass tour should be inserted in the manner in which it was originally printed we trust the remainder of them will be equally pleased at our doing it for though it deviates from that uniform systematical arrangement we began with yet as this tour is novel and curious will be printed so as to be distinct from the rest of the work and as when the tour is completed we shall resume our former method and treat of russia as we have done of norway etc those who wish to preserve that uniformity may separate this part of the work from the rest and not bind it up with it  these travels were printed at petersburg in the german language and consist of five quarto volumes but as the chief part of these volumes is rather an enquiry into the natural history of the country and as such would be tedious to the general reader particularly so to an english one we have omitted what is dry and uninteresting though at the same time we have followed our author throughout his tour and laid his journal before our reader as he himself has done in the original such parts indeed of his natural history as we thought might he entertaining and useful to the many we have preserved omitting none but those physical enquiries into the nature of the country he traveled through and which he was sent out to explore in order to discover what parts of tartary and siberia were worthy colonization where dr pallas has passed over descriptions of people their manners and customs such having been given to the world by other russian travelers as they may not have fallen in the way of our readers we have endeavored to supply the deficiency from those authors but have pointed the passages with turned commas that pallass account may stand unmixed and not mistaken for the accounts of others  the authors preface to the first part of his tour the commands of her imperial majesty to the royal academy of sciences at petersburg issued some few years back for the benefit of science and the preparations made in consequence are too wellknown to the world to be here repeated i had the honor of being numbered among those who were to carry those commands into execution by the plan first designed the natural curiosity of the public would not have been gratified it being proposed not to publish any part of this tour till the return of the gentlemen engaged in it but that love of science which is one of the great ornaments of count orlow director of the academy induced him to gratify the literary world by forwarding the publication of these travels  this first part of my journal contains an accurate but unstudied account of the most important observations in the first two years of my tour without laboring to enhance the value of these sheets by dwelling on the pains i have taken i shall only say that i paid the greatest attention to every thing i met with and i hope my work though destitute of the embellishments of language will not be classed among the number of trifling and superfluous accounts descriptions of unknown countries like the greatest part of those i have traveled through must be entertaining to the enlightened reader let the style be as indifferent as it may the characteristic of a book of travels is the fidelity of the narrative what fell under my own observation i have been particularly exact in and in those accounts i received from others i have endeavored to keep close to truth had i had more leisure i might have been more ample in my remarks but as the business of my journey did not allow me more than two months to review my papers and arrange them for the public eye i trust they will meet with indulgence  i must not omit saying that i have not entered into a very descriptive detail of places situated near capital cities as i would not dwell on things well known already for this reason in my description of some parts of the government of orenburg i have profited by the topography of that place written by mr rytschloff  i must further add that i was directed to measure my journey by the russian werst or verst which is equal to  00 fathoms each fathom seven feet english of course a verst is about threequarters of an english mile and with respect to weight i have used the russian pud of forty pounds which is equal to thirtysix pounds english  usa april       0 travels into siberia and tartary provinces of the russian empire by s pallas m d professor of natural

english part i june         certain business and the necessary preparations for our journey delayed us till toward the end of june however at last being properly equipped messrs lepechin and guldensteat gentlemen who were appointed to accompany me throughout my tour set out one rather before the other and i followed with my attendants on the   st of june the inspection of certain places on this side of moscow was allotted to these gentlemen and i was oreered to astrachan my shortest road therefore was to pursue my way to moscow and to make all the possible speed which my heavy baggage and a change of horses only every  0  0 or  0 versts would allow in order to reach the distant parts i was going to in a favorable season  my journey was chiefly that of a botanist and a mineralogist of course my attention was mostly taken up with examining the soil and the plants of the countries through which i passed but as a description of these would be tiresome to the general reader i shall omit noticing them here and speak only of the face of the country the towns and the people in the places where i went  july   on the  d of july i found myself at twer about     english miles from petersburg from whence we first sat out this was a few years back a miserable wretched village consisting only of a few poor huts but is now under the patronage of the empress raised to an elegant stately city it stands on the banks of the river wolga in which a great deal of fish is caught and conveyed in wellboats to moscow and petersburg by the river oka the fields here are well cultivated and the place seemingly every where in a flourishing condition  it were says mr cox who traveled with lord herbert in      is divided into the old and new town the former is on one side of the volga and consists almost of wooden cottages the latter about fifteen years ago was little better but being in      fortunately destroyed by fire it has risen with luster from it is ashes the empress no sooner informed of this calamity than she ordered a regular and beautiful plan of a new town to be sketched by an eminent architect and enjoined that all the houses should be reconstructed in conformity to this model she erected at her own expense the governors house the bishops palace the courts of justice the new exchange the prison and several other public edifices and offered to every person who would engage to build a house with brick a loan of l 00 english for twelve years without interest the money advanced on this occasion was l 0000 and she has since remitted onethird of the sum the streets which are broad and long issue in a straight line from an octagon in the center the houses of this octagon and of the principal streets are of brick stuccoed white and form a very magnificent appearance this town is not yet finished but when completed will consist of two octagons with several streets leading to them and intersecting each other at right angles  here is an ecclesiastical seminary under the inspection of the bishop and admits  00 students a school of  00 burghers children and an academy for the education of the young nobility admitting   0 scholars the city is a place of considerable commerce and the river is covered with boats it owes it is principal trade to it is advantageous situation being near the conflux of two rivers along which are conveyed all the goods and merchandise sent by water from siberia and the southern provinces to petersburg  the volga which is the largest river in europe rises about eighty miles from twer and begins to be navigable a few miles above the town it is there about the breadth of the thames at henley but exceedingly shallow when it joins the twerze it is broader deeper and more rapid the rising spirit of commerce within these few years has increased the people much they are about  0000 in number the city lies in the middle of a large plain and the country round produces in great abundance wheat rye barley oats buckwheat hemp flax and all kinds of vegetables it is forests yield oak birch alder poplar mountainash pines firs junipers etc  plan of the city of moscow  references   kremlin   bielgorod

about the distance of     miles where i was detained till the   th of july the river moscow on which the city stands is remarkable for the quantity of petrified seasubstances every where found in the environs of this place some inches deep in the banks here are also some physicgardens and pains have been taken to cultivate the genuine rhubarb a large field has been sown with it and there is little doubt as it seems to thrive in this climate but that with proper attention they will bring it to such perfection as to exceed that of the chinese experiments have been made of it in scotland choroschowa a village not far from moscow belongs to the crown and is renowned for it is breed of horses  the city of moscow says mr cox lies in the form of a crescent stretched to a prodigious extent and innumerable churches towers gilded spires and domes white red and green buildings glittering in the sun form a most splendid appearance and yet these are strangely contrasted by an intermixture of numberless wooden hovels we crossed the river moscow on a floating raft fastened to each bank which the russians call a living bridge from it is bending under the carriage this city is certainly the largest in europe it is circumference within the rampart which encloses the suburbs being exactly thirtynine versts or twentysix miles nearly equal to that of pekin in china which including it is suburbs measures twentysix miles and threequarters but it is built in so straggling and disjointed a manner that it is population in no degree corresponds with it is extent it is calculated to have        inhabitants the streets are in general exceedingly long and broad some paved others particularly in the suburbs are formed with trunks of trees or are boarded with planks like the floor of a room wretched hovels are blended with large palaces and cottages of one story stand next to the most superb and stately mansions many brick structures are covered with wooden tops some of the wooden houses are painted others have iron doors and roofs the churches are built in a peculiar style of architecture some have domes of copper others of tin gilt or painted green and many roofed with wood in a word some parts of this vast city have the appearance of a sequestered desert other quarters of a populous town some of a contemptible village others of a great capital  the river moscow from which the city takes it is name flows through it in a winding channel but excepting in spring is only navigable for rafts we hired says mr cox a carriage during our stay at moscow it was a chariot and four horses of different colors we could get no other the coachman and postillion were dressed like the peasants with high cylindrical hats the former with a long beard and sheepskin robe sat upon the box the latter in a coarse drugget garb rode upon the offhorse and behind the carriage was an enormous sack of hay this is the customary vehicle of the city they dont put up their horses here from morning to night but about dinnertime turn them loose into the courtyards of the houses where the master dines and leave them to feed on the hay they carry with them  the palace at moscow is a vast assemblage of numerous buildidgs distributed into many streets and resembling a town and all the timber used in these and other buildings are wholly fashioned with an axe carpenters here never using a saw a chisel or a plane the palace gardens are of considerable extent and contain some good gravel walks in some parts the grounds are laid out in a pleasing and natural manner but in general the old style of gardening prevailed and continually presented us with rows of chipped yewtrees long straight canals and a profusion of preposterous statues  we soon ceased to be surprised that our carriage had four horses nothing being more common than to meet the nobility with complete sets driving about the streets the hackneycoaches are stationed in the streets as with us are without tops have mostly four wheels and are provided either with a long bench or one two or three separate seats like armed chairs placed sideways and their fares are so reasonable that servants often take a coach when they have any distance to go the coachamn generally drives a full trot at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour  nothing can exceed the hospitality of the russians we could never pay a morning visit to any nobleman without being detained to dinner the principal persons of distinction keep open tables and have music during dinner they have also a great number of retainers and dependants mixed with their servants who stand occasionally round their lords chair and seem highly pleased if distinguished by a nod or a smile at an entertainment given us by a russian nobleman we were particularly struck with the quantity and quality of the fruit which was brought in after dinner pines peaches apricots grapes pears cherries none of which can be there obtained but in hothouses and yet served up in the greatest profusion there was a delicious species of small melon sent by landcarriage from astracan though at the distance of  000 miles these melons sometimes cost five pounds each and at other times are sold for halfacrown one instance of elegance which distinguished the desert and which had the prettiest effect imaginable must not be omitted at the upper and lower end of the table were placed two china vases containing cherrytrees in full leaf and fruit hanging on the boughs which was gathered by the company we observed also a curious species of apple not uncommon here it is something larger than a golden pippin has the color and transparency of pale amber and has an exquisite flavor the tree thrives here in the open air without any particular attention to it is culture but degenerates in other countries the russian nobles display a great degree of grandeur and magnificence in their houses domestics and way of living their palaces at and near moscow are stupendous piles of buildings and in the country they live like independent princes as the feudal barons in early times they have their separate courts of justice and govern their vassals with an almost unlimited sway  at the furthest extremity of the suburbs in a sequestered spot is a kind of vauxhall the proprietor of which is an englishman by name mattocks to whom the empress has given an exclusive patent for all plays and public masquerades for ten years here is a fine rotunda the place was well illuminated and the entrance money four shillings  the places of divine worship at moscow are exceedingly numerous including chapels there are above  000 there are     public churches     of these are built with brick the rest are of wood the former are stuccoed or whitewashed the latter are painted red  there are two convents in this city one a nunnery and the other a monastery for men in the principal chapel of the nunnery lie buried several czarinas and princesses of the imperial family in stone coffins ranged on the floor in rows each coffin is covered with a crimson or black velvet pall edged with gold or silver lace and embroidered on the middle with a cross over which on festival days are laid other coverings of gold or silver tissue richly studded with pearl or precious stones having seen the chapel etc as we entered the antichamber the abbess struck the floor with a cane when instantaneously a chorus of about twenty nuns received us with hymns and continued singing as long as we staid  the churches of moscow are divided into three parts the vestibule the body and the sanctuary resembling our chancel in the body are generally four pillars supporting the dome and these pillars are decorated with paintings of the virgin mary and saints the most magnificent church in moscow has an enormous chandelier of massive silver hanging in the center of the dome and weighing    0 pounds it was made in england and a present from the primeminister of russia the skreen that divides the sanctuary from the body of the church is in many parts covered with plates of solid silver and gold richly worked among the many paintings which cover the innerwalls is the head of the virgin supposed to have been painted by st luke and greatly celebrated in this country for it is power of working miracles it is face is almost black it is head ornamented with a glory of precious stones and it is hands and body are gilt  moscow is the center of the inland commerce of russia and connects the trade between europe and siberia the only navigation to this city is formed by the moscow river communicating by the wolga or volga but as the moscow is only navigable in spring on the melting of the snows the principal merchandise is conveyed to and from this place in winter upon sledges the whole retail commerce is carried on in the khitaigorod or center of the city where according to russian custom all the shops without houses are collected in one spot the place is like a fair or market consisting of many rows of brick buildings with alleys between them the tradesman comes to his shop in the morning remains there all day and returns home to his family in the afternoon every trade has it is separate department and they who sell the same goods have booths adjoining to each other furs and skins form the most considerable article of commerce in moscow and the shops which vend them occupy several streets  among the curiosities of moscow i must not omit the market for the sale of houses it is held in a large open space in one of the suburbs and exhibits a great variety of readymade houses thickly scattered upon the ground the man who wants a dwelling repairs to this spot mentions the number of rooms he requires examines the different timbers which are regularly numbered and bargains for that which suits him best the house is sometimes paid for on the spot and taken away by the purchaser or sometimes the seller contracts to remove it and erect it where it is to stand and a dwelling may be purchased removed raised and inhabited in the space of a week these readymade houses are generally collections of trunks of trees tenanted and mortaised at each end into one another and nothing more is required than the labor of transporting and erecting them wooden structures of very large dimensions and handsome appearance are occasionally formed in russia with an expedition almost inconceivable to the inhabitants of other countries a remarkable instance of this dispatch was displayed the last time the empress came to moscow her majesty proposed to reside in the mansion of prince galatzin which is esteemed the completest edifice in the city but as it was not sufficiently spacious for her reception a temporary addition of wood larger than the whole house and containing a magnificent suite of apartments was begun and finished within the space of six weeks this meteorlike fabric was so handsome and commodious that the materials which were taken down at her majestys departure were ordered to be reconstructed as a kind of imperial villa upon an eminence near the city  at the entrance of each street in moscow is a chevauxdefrize gate one end of which turns upon a pivot and the other rolls upon a wheel near it is a centrybox in which a man is occasionally stationed and in times of riot or a fire the sentinel shuts the gate all passage is immediately stopped and any mob or concourse of people prevented  among the public institutions of this city the most remarkable is the foundling hospital endowed in      by the present empress and supported by voluntary contributions it is an immense pile of building of a quadrangular form and capable of receiving  000 children every child that is brought is admitted the rooms are large and lofty each infant has a separate bed the bedsteads are iron the sheets are changed weekly and the linen three times a week no cradles are allowed no swaddling but the children are all loosely dressed the director of this hospital is so beloved and caressed by the children that whenever he enters a room they crowd round him and are as emulous of showing their fondness as if he was their parent they are divided into classes according to their ages after remaining two years in the nursery they are admitted boys and girls together into the lowest class where they continue five years the boys are taught to knit card hemp flax and wool and work in different manufactures the girls learn to knit net and do all kinds of needle work spin and weave lace and are employed in cookery baking and housework of all sorts both boys and girls learn to read write and cast accounts  at fourteen they may choose any branch of trade they like best and for this purpose there are different species of manufactures established in the hospital of which the chief is embroidery silk stockings ribbonds lace gloves buttons and cabinetwork a separate room is appropriated to each trade some boys are instructed in french and german and a few in the latin tongue others learn music drawing and dancing about the age of twenty the foundlings receive a sum of money with several other advantages which enables them to follow their trade in any part of the empire a very considerable privilege in russia where the peasants are slaves and cannot leave their village without the permission of their master  in the hospital there is a theater of which all the decorations are the work of the foundlings they constructed the stage painted the scenes and made the dresses and they perform plays in the russian language i was surprised says mr cox at the ease with which they trod the stage and was pleased with the gracefulness of their action there were some agreeable voices in the opera the orchestra was filled with a band by no means contemptible which consisted entirely of foundlings except the first violin who was their musicmaster they perform also ballets and dance with great taste and elegance the empress countenances this seminary of theatrical representation from a desire of diffusing among her subjects that species of entertainment which she considers as a means of civilization and of enriching the russian theaters with a constant supply of performers  kapawna from moscow i pursued my way to wolodimir through kapawna a village about    english miles from moscow this is a place much celebrated for it is nanufactures and here are several gunpowder mills belonging to private persons the country is covered with pinetrees and the soil is every where full of flints bearing evident traces of petrifactions  wolodimir is a city situated on some highlands along the northern banks of the river kljaschma and though not very populous or well built yet on account of it is delightful and advantageous situation it is having    parishes being partly built with freestone and partly with wood and the houses encompassed with gardens it makes a good appearance and affords a noble view near this city are still to be seen the ruins of the ancient town which extended itself near seven miles from the present boundaries whilst we were here it was fruitseason and we had no rest day or night owing to those who watch the cherryorchards in the middle of each they erect a scaffold from which they strain lines to every corner of the orchard on each of these lines is fastened a rattling hammer which if the line is in the least moved gives a strong alarm during the ripening of the fruit men are appointed to watch these orchards who frighten the birds by striking these rattles and keep off interlopers by flinging at them they have in general but two kinds of cherry except in the bishops garden where are grafted some others and which seem to thrive a large quantity of this fruit vegetables and cucumbers for pickling are conveyed to moscow about    miles distant in the country round wolodimir are many noble mansions the seats of the nobility though the lands consist in general of dry sandy heaths in this neighborhood are some hills of limestone which they dig and carry to twer and moscow to be burnt the countryman fancies that if he covers his cartload of burnt lime but thinly with aspleaves that the hardest and most violent rain cannot injure it  july    mugina from wolodimir on july    we made the best of our way to kasimof through mugina wjoschki and constantinowo beyond mugina the country is woody with a marshy soil so woody that there is scarce any open land to be seen and the villagers are obliged to clear it away near their habitations in order to procure ground for necessary tillage which they do by firing these woods regardless of the consequence whether it burns to the distance of half a mile square or ten miles so that we see standing a number of burnt trunks of trees which they are too indolent to grub up there are however many noblemens seats in this vicinage but they bear the appearance of a lazy and forest economy the timber in these forests is chiefly fir and birch some pines and underwood of various kinds the highways on account of their marshiness are all along laid with the bodies of young firs which make the roads very rough and disagreeable not far from wjoschki are two glasshouses which are at no loss for fire  constantinowo the inhabitants of constantinowo are mostly potters and carry their wares to all the adjacent towns for the land round the villages in this neighborhood is chiefly potters earth  kasimof about   0 miles from moscow kasimof is a meanbuilt town and the lands annexed to it belong to the regency of woronesh notwithstanding an excellent freestone is found here fit for building the inhabitants make no use of it for the whole town is built in the russian mode with timber and what is most ridiculous they lay their streets and highways with boards and timber also and the few churches and large buildings which are erected with stone are built with such mortar as came first to hand  in former times when kasimof belonged to tartarian princes they were not so inattentive to the nature of their stone for we still see some handsome remains of their buildings worth preserving for the admiration of posterity in this tartarian colony for the descendants of the ancient tartar inhabitants are still resident in this town and it is neighborhood who are for the most part affluent furmerchants we see on an elevated spot a high strong roundbuilt tower or misgir of a ruined temple which they are now rebuilding by the empresss order this ancient place of worship is composed of bricks    inches long and it is tower of smoothhewn freestone seemingly taken out of a quarry at eight miles distance the other tartarian remains are situated in an enclosure and some gardens just by the tower and are composed of the same kind of freestone this place seems formerly to have been the residence of the khan or tartarian different tribes of tartars at the mausoleum at kasimof prince and there stood till lately some great buildings and a triumphal arch with gothic ornaments and arabian inscriptions also an oblong squarebuilt mansion and a mausoleum not far from the common burial ground this triumphal arch was for some unknown reasons demolished by the present proprietor and converted into a limekiln so that i could see only it is rubbish and some few of it is ornaments the princes palace has also been pulled down and nothing remains of it but it is base or foundation five feet in height which is converted into a wooden dwelling house this mansion or palace was from north to south about    english feet in length and about    feet wide under this building is a cave strong vaulted running under the whole  southeast of this mansion stands the mausoleum of the khans which the proprietor though in his garden has spared from destruction it has not the least gothic appearance but is a strong oblong squaresided building composed of smoothhewn freestone it has round it is top a plain cornice the plate represents a south view of it the western end contains a small vault or closet designed as i apprehend for private prayer according to the mahommedan custom on the west side is a small entrance paved with rough unhewn stones and on the north side a small window to let in the air the other part of the mausoleum has a vault in which are tombstones these vaults are covered with earth within the walls on which grow some eldertrees the length of the whole building from east to west is above    english feet the breadth from north to south about    feet and it is height about    feet  the little vault on the inside is not much above thirteen feet broad from east to west the entrance to the great vault is on the southern side almost in the middle of the building close to the partition between the two vaults it is a small door not quite three feet and a half wide on the outside increasing to near four feet and a half within but without any appearance of hinges on this door is a table or slab of marble with the following inscription in arabic  to the sole great god  the prince of this place schagalikan son of sultan schich aulear  the   st day of the month ramasan in the year      viz of the hegyra this is if i mistake not according to our calculation in the year    0 the great vault is about twentyone feet wide about seventeen broad and twelve feet high the northern wall has two windows or openings and the eastern wall but one which are like the door narrower toward the outside and were formerly crossed with ironbars which some one has thought proper to remove on the ground within the walls are eight distinguishable gravehills about seven feet long covered with stones one of these is almost square whereby it appears that two bodies have been there interred indeed within the vaults over which these tumuli or hillocks are raised there are nine skulls to be seen at the head or west end of each gravehill was erected a tombstone five or six feet high the top of these stones shaped off in an obtuse angle there is now but two of these stones standing the others are broken to pieces and scattered about these stones on one side were ornamented with flowers and stars on the other was an arabian inscription neatly finished and divided into spaces underneath these vaults is a subterranean sepulchral cave of the same length with the vaults but not so wide the entrance into which is a narrow opening formerly stuffed up with earth and stones in this low sepulchral cave dead bodies have been laid on a wooden scaffold but modern curiosity having troubled their rest nothing now is there to be seen but scattered skulls ribbones hair and some yellow green and brown striped taffaty which has preserved it is texture and color tolerably well  in the neighborhood of this town they gather the birthwort a plant renowned as a familymedicine among the russian peasants it is reported that this plant boiled is an infallible cure for all pains in the limbs and that it is fruit which resembles a fig if eaten raw cures all relapses of fevers  august   i left this place for murom the  d of august and traveled all along the banks of the oka where are a number of luxuriant meadows the russian countrywomen here wear a particular headdress which i saw not in any other place this is a flat stiff cap the top of which forms a pair of horns and round which according to their fashion they wind a piece of cloth which hangs down behind  august     on the  th and  th we passed many lordships for the nearer we approached murom the more villages we saw on both sides just before we enter murom is a chapel built with wood and dedicated to st elias near which is a small house of prayer and an enclosed well which this holy man is said to have dug himself and which the superstitious people believe is of great benefit to the head and eyes if they wash themselves with it is water devoutly  murom about    miles from kasimof murom like the town of kasimof is built close to the river oka and suffers much by the rapidity of it is waters which wash away the bank on which the town stands and occasions many of the buildings to fall in the old inhabitants remember that the houses stood formerly as far out as the middle of the river and that a church among other buildings was once carried away by the stream it even now undermines some house or other annually and some at present stand so near upon the brink of the shore that it is rashness to inhabit them here are also some public buildings two churches and a convent which seem hourly to wait their fall and would have been in the water ere now had they not been supported with large stones placed beneath them were willowtrees planted against the bank the earth would stand firm against the waters and these disasters might be prevented  the inhabitants of this town are more industrious in the cultivation of their gardens than the people generally are in little russian towns for they not only raise culinary herbs of most kinds but also melons and fruits some houses have good appleorchards annexed  it may not be disagreeable to some readers to know that in this vicinage grows the spurge called by linnaeus euphorbia palustris which the people use as an emetic and if the leaves want efficacy they take an extract of it is root made with hotwater this excites but little vomiting and that at one cast nor does it gripe they assured me it was a good remedy in obstinate relapses of fevers and internal durities the dose five russian solotniks in weight  the river oka running here through limy loamy and sandy shores will not be supposed to carry any precious metals but the fact is that there are people in murom that employ themselves during the summer in washing the sand near the town and are richly repaid in what they find this is small grains of gold silver and copper and some pretty small stones i have often seen them at work they dig the sand with a spade and wash it in troughs such grains as they find they put into a quill stop it up and hang it round their necks in these washings i have met with small topazes cornelians and agates these certainly must have been washed down the river from the demolition of old tombs or other accidental circumstances perhaps those grains of gold and silver which they find have the same origin  motmoss not far from this river at a village called motmoss about twentytwo miles from murom we met for the first time in russia people afflicted with wens and though the village is small there are many particularly children and young folks laboring in the highest degree under this disorder they say this evil is not less common in other neighboring villages and as the brookwaters used here are of a martial or halybeate nature and carry many marly particles the hithertounknown origin of this malady might perhaps be found out if those waters where the disorder is common could be discovered of a similar quality  here is a great deal of ironstone dug in this neighborhood one hundred weight of which will yield  0lb of neat iron the method of preparing it for the meltinghouse is to burn it first which they do on stacks of pinetrunks there are ironmills not far off where they cast and forge iron  august    on the   th of august we left murom in our way to arsamas and in a village about twentyfour miles from it i took notice of the use the country people made of the siberian centaury having picked only the broadest leaves they dry them beat them to powder in a fine woolen cloth and use that powder as a stiptic to stop the bleeding of wounds it soon closes the wound and heals it  forest of muran in the forest of muran great plenty of mushrooms are found which the countryfolks gather for food and lay up for the winter these with bread is the chief support of the poor such as they lay up for the winter they salt and dry every kind of mushroom is here eaten except the fly mushroom and that which grows in dung they either eat them raw with salt boil them in oil or roast them but the most remarkable mushroom is that which they call osinowik which implies growing in ashwood as soon as it is gathered and laid in the air or as soon as it is stem begins to ripen the part underneath the head takes on a greasy and blue color if broken in the middle it is body seems quite white but after a few seconds turns bluish in the air and in the end changes into a most beautiful ultramarine break it as often as you will the broken parts will have the same appearance and if it is watery juice is pressed out it is drops in falling have a bluish cast but momentaneously change in an open vessel into the abovementioned beautiful color which will dye linen the same it is a pity however that at the moment of it is highest perfection it should grow gradually pale linen dyed with it and even the juice will go through every shade into a color called saxon green and in the space of twentyfour hours will change into a bluish green which grows paler still and cannot be preserved by any of the usual means if dipped in water it grows pale sooner and almost loses it is whole color when dying  aug    arsamas about  0 miles from murom on the   th we reached arsamas about ninety miles from murom this town stands on an eminence has some trade and it is inhabitants live more by commerce than by husbandry except in the article of onions of which they transport a great quantity into the eastern parts of the empire  however filthy and illbuilt the town of arsamas is on account of the various trades and business carried on in it it is more than ordinary plentiful populous and wealthy which shows how far a little trade and a few manufactures will enrich a state the whole town a few public offices and shopkeepers excepted consists of soapboilers tanners bluedyers and shoemakers the latter work out and transport a great deal of leather here prepared  little but the common sort of leather is tanned in arsamas except indeed a few russia hides which are not in the greatest estimation they tan with the bark of salix arenaria a species of willow and render the skins smooth with the purest and thinnest birchoil which they convey here by the river kama they have no mills to grind their tan but reduce it to powder by beating it with heavy sharpedged hammers as they generally do throughout all russia  the soap here made is white and but of one sort they make their lie of common woodashes only the soap is boiled in iron furnaces so large as to contain from four tons weight english of grease to seven tons and they put ten pounds of salt to  00 lbs of grease the grease is then boiled often upon the lie which they frequently change for ten or twelve days till the surface shows that the soap is completed the furnace then is suffered to cool for twelve days more and the soap is dug out with iron spades of a quantity of grease they generally draw fourfifths of it in soap of the scumsoap they make a sud and if the grease be good it yields pound for pound  the dyers in this town dye only that blue linen so fashionable among the russian women except a little narrow cotton which is here made their method of dying is merely boiling the linen in water in which they put very little indigo and woad with some woodashes smoothing the cloth afterward by pressing it then watering it and stretching it abroad till it is dry before they dye the linen they beat it that it may not take too much color some women dye their cloths red themselves with a wild red they gather in the fields and also green in a dye formed from birchtwigs and alum the yellow chamomile anthemis tinctoria yields an excellent yellow color either for dying or painting  as the streets of this town are narrow and very muddy and all these nasty trades are there carried on the reader may naturally judge of the impurity of it is air and though the inhabitants have no wells nor any water to drink but what they take from a small brook that runs through the town they throw into this brook without hesitation all the filth they make  besides these manufactures they were establishing one for potashes upon a new plan  in all the low lands about arsamas grows the hellebore veratrum album well known to the peasants throughout russia on account of it is noxious quality for which reason they pick it out from the grass when cut but as this is the time of it is seeds ripening the plant should be rooted out or the seeds burnt to prevent the evil increasing young and unexperienced lambs will frequently eat it in spring and occasion their death and some hungry horses if it be left in the hay will also eat it when it occasions griping and foaming at the mouth should it chance to fall into a yard where poultry is kept it is sure to kill them notwithstanding the plant has this deadly quality the peasants use it for a salutary purpose they dry the root powder it and spread this powder over those biles which certain maggots in this country called oestri cause in the skin nay they sometimes take the root fresh internally to expel worms  lopatina about    miles from arsamas upon an eminence opposite lopatina about    miles from arsamas are some vestiges of an old intrenchment which appear to have been thrown up in the early wars carried on in this country against the mordvines  kawara in the village kawara lying east of lopatina is an abyss to be seen which swallowed up a farm and it is inhabitants owing to some subterraneous waters which in their course undermined the ground there was lately also a similar sinking of the earth which is now the channel of a flowing water and there are probably here some subterranean waters as it is well known of a lake in this neighborhood crowded with fish than when they are aware of the net they retire to an abyss the depth of which has not yet been fathomed  these mordvines inhabit the right shore of pjana dwell in some scattered and sequestered cottages and have preserved but few of their ancient customs owing to their being for the most part converted to christianity they speak however a language of their own and have some peculiarities of dress among the women in other respects they are like the russians  the mordvines are of finnish origin were of two tribes says mr took and were a long time in subjection to the tartars but even then had their peculiar khans they compose a very considerable nation and at every numeration of them they have been found to increase in the same proportion as the russian peasants formerly they had a nobility among them but those familes have been a long while extinct before the introduction of christianity a mordvine was not permitted to marry out of his own tribe but at present this is not regarded and they settle in this or that tribe as they please preserving always some principal characteristic several particularities of dress and many distinctive customs  these people resemble more the russian peasants than either the tscheremisses or the tschouwasches of whom we shall speak byandby and conform more to their way of living the mordvines have commonly brown harsh hair a thin beard and lean face it is very rare to find a pretty woman among them they are honest laborious and hospitable but slow and imitate the russians and tartars in several things there are not many unbaptized among them but these eat pork without any scruple whilst all the heathen tschouwasches and all the people of asiatic russia abhor and abstain from it as the flesh of the impurest of animals  since their submission to russia they pursue a life of agriculture and are not fond of towns but always form themselves into little villages and that in and about forests their villages houses farms agriculture and their little flocks their goods their food and their whole economy differ in nothing from the tschouwasches and tscheremisses in like manner the mordvines have a little enclosure near their houses wherein they plant roots and herbs for the kitchen they are not so fond of hunting as their neighbors the mordvine women are employed in the same works as the tscheremissian and have neither less dexterity nor application the state of their families their riches and their taxes are also the same  the dress of the men is that of a russian peasant except their shirts which they pink and embroider about the neck and openings  the dress of the married mordvine women consists of a highstuffed cap sewed with various colored thread with a slap hanging down behind to which are tied several little chains and jingling toys linen shifts and petticoats which they ornament with red and blue dyed needlework according to their taste and fancy they wear also a girdle from which hangs down behind a kind of apron embroidered with worsted of various colors and bordered with fringe tassels corals and other rattling and jingling stuff round about the girdle besides the above they wear several other partycolored fringed pieces those who have such ornamented girdles have their shifts more elegantly stitched and wear a wide linen uppergown with short sleeves halfanell wide these uppergowns are sometimes died yellow their uppershift for they generally wear two is fastened round the throat with a small pin and upon their bosom with a large one from which hangs such heavy collections of corals copperbuttons small little chains medals coins little bells and other jingling things of the like kind that the mordvine dress is not less heavy than a horses harness earrings belong to the every days dress but on particular occasions they wear bracelets wound thrice round the wrist and exactly similar to those worn in india  the girls dress has less of these jingles but in other respects it is the same except that they wear no cap but braid their hair into a tail agreeable to the russian fashion to which are tied some knots of fringes and ribbands the old fashion was to braid the hair in eight or nine small tresses those behind each ear rather larger than the rest having in both a square buckle to which hang medals and other clattering toys but all the tresses were lengthened underneath with woollen strings and passed through the girdle i afterward took notice that even the married mordvine women near the wolga had their hair in a similar way braided into a large tail with black sheeps wool so as to reach down to the knees  although the mordvine women especially those of ersanian origin the difference between this tribe and the mordvines will be explained hereafter  whose dress i have here described are almost the filthiest of all nations throughout the whole russian empire yet the men deserve the praise of being industrious farmers and surpass their countrymen in this particular they breed as many bees as they can and will have says took from  00 to  00 hives those that live about the woods are hardy and expert huntsmen and turn every thing in their way to advantage  some of their customs according to mr took are as follow their marriages are transacted by negotiation and they bargain for their wives as do the tscheremisses the kalym or price of the bride is commonly between eight and ten rubles each ruble about four shillings sterling a proof that this nation is not over rich the time for the celebration of the nuptials being come the father of the young man goes to fetch the bride whose father conducts her by the hand and delivers her to the former her mother on this occasion presents a little bread and salt to the fatherinlaw of her daughter and then the maid takes leave of her parents which is always accompanied with tears her fatherinlaw leading her away covered with a veil on her arrival at the bridegrooms they all sit down to table the young man pulls his cap over his eyes and places himself by her side a cake of three feet in length is placed on the table which the father of the bridegroom takes and presents the pointed extremity of it under the brides veil saying open thine eyes to the light be thou happy in thy children and never destitute of bread immediately after this the bridegroom sees his beloved for the first time whom his father had bought for him without consulting him this done they begin to eat and divert themselves by dances songs and sports to the sound of a pipe but always with the mug in their hands when the young couple prepare for bed the bride makes a great deal of resistance insomuch that the assistants force her to sit down on a mat and then taking up the corners carry her upon it into the bedchamber parents very frequently promise their children while yet in their infancy and as a sign of the engagement interchange the pointed ends of horns which serve them for snuffboxes the young woman however is not bound by this compact but if the lad is inclined to marry elsewhere he is obliged to pay a certain number of rubles by way of fine it is lawful among them to have several wives at once but they seldom use this privilege  a widower always chooses to marry his sisterin law when he can if the parents will not consent to this he tries to slide into her hand under the table a little loaf without being perceived pronouncing at the same time my sisterinlaw shall be kept for me on saying this he must run out of the house as fast as he can for if he is caught he is immediately regaled with a shower of blows as hard and as thick as they can be laid on him but if he has address enough to escape them the fairone belongs to him  among the christian mordvines the brides likewise cover themselves with a veil during the marriage ceremony great care is taken that they do not meet a man in their way to church it being looked upon as an unhappy omen  the dead are interred in their best cloths the company eat cakes and drink beer about the grave and place a portion of each upon it  the greatest part of the mordvines are now christians but those who are pagans call their supreme being by the name of pas the mokscanes call him sky which signifys the sky they have a mother of the gods and a son of god whom they call inilschi pas their master pas is a subterranean divinity not very beneficent the nikolai pas is the st nicolas of the russians whom they hold in great veneration the mordvines attribute to him the prosperity of the russian empire for which reason they light up candles to him in the russian churches and in their houses hold his image in great respect they have no image and their adorations sacrifices and festivals in general are the same with the religious ceremonies of the tscheremisses and the tschouwasches though the pagan mordvines have no knowledge of the religion of the russians they suppose them to have peculiar divinities and to obtain their favor they sacrifice game and make oblations of cakes and liquors every christmas and easter day whenever they hear thunder they exclaim paschangui pourguini pas that is have mercy on us o god pourguini but they make no offering of any kind to this deity their prayers are the same with those of the people we have so oftened mentioned the countenance they put on when they pray the manner of lying with their faces on the earth and several of their other customs seem borrowed from the tartars  august    on the   th of august i left the pjana and pursued my way to saransk this district is remarkable for that rich black soil so common to the sura wolga and other rivers which flow from the east into the wolga in all these parts the happy husbandman has no occasion to manure his grounds and commonly fallows his land but every third crop here are spots where the soil never fails but where if it diminishes in richness there is plenty of ground in the less inhabited parts plenty of lay land which if turned up produces the finest arable imaginable was this rich ground to be manured the corn would be too luxuriant and fall with all these advantages it is to be lamented that they sow neither hemp flax or corn more than they have occasion for their use but only provide for themselves and the next market the people here are also very reprehensible for heaping up their dung as they do on hills the produce of their numerous herds as such enormous dunghills beget monstrous swarms of flies which are very troublesome  arath about    miles from arsamas in the town of arath reside many potters these burn their vessels in a large pot full of holes resembling a tub set in the ground which the russians use by way of oven and when the vessel is redhot quench it in boiling water in which some flour has been thrown they are of opinion this gives the pots a greater solidity and hardness  tolskoi maidan about    miles from arath as we traveled further on we passed villages particularly about tolskoi where their cattle were dying with a plague or contagious distemper it is evident that the chief cause of this disorder is their moist pasture and the little care that is taken to keep the cattle dry and clean  potshinki about  0 miles from tolskoi at potshinki are some fine meadows where there is a breed of horses for the imperial lifeguards to which this stud belongs the stallions are mostly of danish race in order to get large horses the number generally kept is  0 and about   0 mares potshinki is a pretty place a borough town has a garrison three churches and some thousand houses  saransk about    miles from tolskoi sept   on the  st day of september we arrived at saransk and though the farmers were here busy with their harvest we had a strong frost saransk is a small place in the province of pensa and regency of casan and inhabited by husbandmen a few tradesmen and merchants excepted in saransk as in all other little towns in the innermost part of the empire many of the female inhabitants are employed in dying woollen yarn with the juice of some herbs growing in this country and as i wish to communicate any useful intelligence i could meet with that some of my readers may profit by my enquiries i was very inquisitive into the nature of this dye the principal ingredient is a kind of moss which grows very copiously in all the fenny woods of russia and is universally known by the name of seleniza in latin lycopodium complanatum the country people gather it by handfuls tie it in bunches and carry it to market where it is sold very cheap this moss is first reduced to powder and then made into the consistency of pap and very sour with flour the yarn to be dyed remains one or more nights in this mixture which gives it a yellowish cast it is then washed and dried and is fit to receive any other color the common people who know not the use of alum have recourse to this preparation in almost all dies but the mordvines the people of tschuwa and the tartars use either the common yellow pheasantseye adonis verna or the common wormwood with a small quantity of singleseeded broom mixed the genista tinctoria but sometimes they use only the thistle carduus heterophyllus with it is pretty yellowcolouring leaves called by the ersane race of mordvines pishelaomatiksched the green herb with which they boil the wool that has been dyed blue with indigo or woad and give it a beautiful green  the herbs commonly made use of here for dying are the following  for a light yellow the yellow chamomile anthemis tinctoria the singleseeded broom the dyers thistle or melilot serratula weeds growing generally throughout russia  for a fine yellow the waterhemp agrimony bidens tripartita  for a deep red the roots of ladys bedstraw gallium molugo or the woodruffe aperula tinctoria which they call in russ marjona  to attempt scarlet they use the common marjoram origanum  for green they dye blue wool with the abovenamed yellowdying herbs or birch leaves there are also some who possess the art of making a high green by an addition of alum the unblown ears of the reed arundo calamogrostis and a yellow green from the berries of their foultree in russ kruschina the country women know where to gather all these in their proper seasons  for blue they have no other coloring than the wild woad which grows in little russia but they occasionally purchase indigo or logwood from the merchants which they use in their own way  in order to die yellow with the singleseeded broom it is powder is mixed with that paplike preparation i have mentioned but the wool receives first a yellowish tinge by laying a week in that preparation before the broom is mixed with it to brighten the color after the wool has been soaked and dried they wash it at different times in lie the melilot is boiled in water with the addition of a little alum and the yarn after having undergone the first preparation is washed in this dye or liquor they dye silk and sometimes wool with the flower of the yellow chamomile and the african marigold tagetes but with these ingredients the alum is particularly necessary the waterhemp agrimony affords a pretty high yellow if boiled with some alum and this grows still more flaming by the addition of the root of ladys bedstraw and woodruffe and the oftener the article is dipped in this dye the brighter the color this wild red for so i call the root of ladys bedstraw and woodruffe is like most plants used here for dying bruised in wooden mortars and ground to powder with handmills this is made into a paplike consistency with water and placed in a warm oven for one night next day they add more water and boil it and to give brightness to the color boil some oak or birchbark with it sometimes they add ashes to it and when the dye is deep enough and lukewarm they dip their wool two or three times in it and once more when the dye is boiling hot if the color pleases them they next wash the yarn in the river and dry it but the color is commonly brightest when the dye consists of a mixture of waterhemp agrimony the melilot the singleseeded broom and the thistle carduus heterophyllus and the best tincture is made by that deep blackred powder which when the roots are gently beaten comes off at first this being properly speaking the genuine dying bark  the use of the marjoram origanum is different and was thus described to me the flowers and crowns of this plant were gathered whilst in bloom dried in an oven and reduced to powder in the same manner they powder the young springleaves of the apple tree an equal quantity of each of these is taken though some will take twofourths of melilot one of appleleaves and one of boiled malt and well mixed with leaven to make it ferment as soon as it is sour it is squeezed out with the hands and set for a whole night in a warm oven where it is frequently stirred here it is dried this done it is boiled in clean water and the dye is complete some go to work more simply by taking equal parts of the herbs and appleleaves and boil them with alum but with this process the red will not be beautiful the color thus prepared is very bright and will not fade by washing  issa    miles from saransk sept   on the  th of september we quitted saransk and reached issa a village belonging to count woronzo at the distance of about twentyseven miles pretty late in the evening this place is also remarkable for it is breed of horses and of course little grain is here sowed but oats here is also a carpet manufactory and another in an adjacent manor the carpets here fabricated are renowned for their beauty and deserve encouragement was it only because the wool of which they are made is taken from the backs of the sheep here bred the works being carried on by children over whom a skilful country lass presides and the wool being dyed from plants growing in the neighborhood the only foreign color they make use of are the brasilwood which dies crimson if prepared with lie the indigo for dying blue and the logwood for dying violet but these colors are not so lasting as those from the herbs i have mentioned  insara about    miles from issa about twentyfour miles from issa in the high road to pensa we found ourselves at the city of insara this is an abject place built by the people of streliza during the late reign of peter the great whose inhabitants were neither active nor industrious the town is situated on the banks of the river insara which falls into the issa at the upper end of the city the residing sawodshik nikonof has established an iron manufactory built a good house for himself and erected a church with stone which are the best buildings in this place the public offices and cathedral are in the wooden fortress and in poor condition as is another church built with wood the iron utensils made in this manufactory are pots boilers and a kind of large seething vessels which is the chief furniture of a tartar or kalmucks house and which produce a good price they manufacture annually about twenty tonweight of these articles which they carry up the wolga to the markets in little russia  the ironstone that supplys this manufactory is about eight miles distance there is also in this neighborhood a manufactory for making potash  sept   schadin    miles from insa on the  th of september we left insar for pensa and at night reached the mordvine village schadin a distance of eighteen miles the inhabitants of this place are of a different origin from those who are settled near the pjana in the regency of nischegorod they are careful to distinguish themselves from the latter and call themselves mokschanes which expresses in their language the whole race of mordvines and give the others the name of ersanes in these districts inhabited by the mokschanes are very few villages of the other tribe but both are occasionally met with in the same villages and with little difference between them all along the rivers wolga sok and tscheremsham and other neighboring districts belonging to the regencies of casan and orenburg where they were sent with other people to form new colonies the mokschanes still say that before they were dispersed they inhabited the countries about all the rivers near the mokscha or moscow to which they gave their name as far as the river oka and have been governed by their own little princes these are the same people of mokscha of whom stralenberg speaks they resemble the ersanes in many respects particularly in their language and yet differ in many points of female dress and the pronunciation of their words some of which are peculiar to this race  this difference is easily discoverable by comparing the female dress of the ersanes with the annexed representation of the holiday dress of the mokschanian women the latter have in general more elegance and taste their cap is not stuffed so high nor do they hang any rattling toys to it but it is only plainly worked with the needle and the cap tied behind the neck with a string many wear only one band of linen round the head the ends of which are decorated with open needle work and being tied behind hang down more or less upon their backs this dress is very much in vogue about the river wolga in the dress of the women of mokscha the several latchets or strings which are fastened to the cap and hang down on each side of the bosom are ornamented with an old russian silver coin and on the bosom are joined across at their ends by little chains and jingling toys on the breastpin is fastened a kind of shield and which is rendered heavier by the quantity of coral and other clattering ornaments hung to it than that of the ersanes about their neck they wear a collar formed of network composed of many variegated glassbeads from their girdle hangs down before a large needleworked apron divided into four parts from top to bottom each of which is pinned to the other and ornamented at bottom with long tassels glassbeads and a certain species of snailshells chiefly brought from india the cyprea nodosa behind instead of an apron hangs down several black woollen tassels fastened on strings of various lengths they used to stick shells and medals with pins upon the bosom and neck of their shifts to increase the noise but the most peculiar part of the dress of the women of mokscha are some large flying tufts of hair formed by a short stick within the lock and leaving the hair loose at the end many of these short tails are made and hang between other parts of the hair which are braided into little tresses these tufts are now out of fashion and only to be seen on old women who are in fact ashamed to show them and often will not wear them if not induced to it by much flattery and persuasion neither do the women of mokscha when dressed bind up their feet with linen bands but with leather latchets or thongs  the people of mokscha as i observed before being now all converted to christianity remember and retain but few of their former customs and opinions they are said to have differed little from the ersanes they have uniformly assured me that they neither had idols nor subordinate deities but always offered up their sacrifices to an invisible supreme being whom they did not call paas as do the ersanes but schkai or heaven itself and to which they prayed turning their faces to the east they had altars at distant places within the wood in which they sacrificed horses oxen and small cattle at the burial of a deceased person the parents were to perform a sacrifice and the mourners were women they married their children before they were grownup and frequently gave young women to boys under a notion of encouraging female industry and making the wife by her labor maintain her husband men were accustomed to give a portion to their daughters in marriage which was returned them afterward in imitation of all other eastern nations when the marriage ceremony took place the bride in the presence of her own parents and those of her husband was set upon a mat and carried into the bridegrooms bedchamber with these words wot tet wergass utscha that is here wolf take the lamb during which ceremony she was to show no disinclination or shamefacedness at present after the rites are performed in the russian church and the bride is returned she is expected to lament her former situation exceedingly and some indeed do it so sincerely as to tear their hair and scratch their faces most inhumanly she also wears a linen veil of needle work over her face the day after the nuptials the elder of the parents goes in a solemn manner with a loaf of bread on which some little ornament to wear upon the bosom is fastened to give the bride as a present and this is done by setting it thrice upon her head uttering these words zatei mesei pawei in what order he pleases but the word which he pronounces last the bride is to be called by and they give their children an accidental and commonly an adjectival name this is all i could learn from this simple people they appeared to me to be industrious farmers and to breed a great many bees some of them are owners of  00 hives and they are much cleaner in their person than their ersanean brethren reddish and light colored hair is less frequent among them than among the ersanes whose hair is mostly brown their women like those of the ersanes are in general not pretty but they are active diligent and laborious their knowledge of herbs for the use of physic and dying is not small round the porches of their houses you will constantly see some herb or other hanging up to dry with a number of colewort leaves which the mordvines lay under the dough of their bread to be baked with it as they leaven it uncommonly strong and it is apt to run on this account they dry a winters provision of these leaves wetting them a little when they use them among the the medicinal herbs i saw them make use of were the st johnswort hypericum perforatum which they bind over the face in paralytic cases the english marjoram origanum which they dry reduce to powder and strew over wounds and excoriations of children the virgaurea whose ashes they strew over inflammations of the skin called erysipelas the bogbean menyanthes and the aconite aconitum which they use as a poultice for external inflammations and give internally as a remedy for watery swellings the leaves of the rasberrybush rubus saxatilis the clover trisolium spadiceum and the common thyme with water in inflammations of the eyes which they are often afflicted with owing to their smoking cottages the marsh cinquefoil comarum palustre in cases of difficult birth betonies to bathe weak children in the bluebottle centaurea lacea for a bath against the palsy in children the starthistle stellaria dichotoma the yellow holly against the looseness of belly in children and the pheasantseye adonis verna in hysterical disorders and several others  the mordvines do not make their butter in ovens as do the russians but like the finlanders and tartars by beating like the russians however they pot their fresh cheese and pour butter on it to keep it soft they build their houses either in the russian or tartarean method and lay on large and palletbeds according as they live in the vicinage of either of these people the old mordvine houses have their doors to the east as stralenburg justly noticed and their ovens stand on the southwest corner in other respects they are very narrow and inconvenient and are for the most part without chimneys  the face of this country is open hilly and sandy with occasionally thick forests but the lands round the villages are in pretty good cultivation  wjasera in our way to pensa we passed through wjasera about    miles short of it this town has three churches one of which they have began to build with stone among the horses that drew our coach i took notice of a mare whose hair was finer than common and on enquiry found there was a stallion in this neighborhood whose progeny was all like this mare in winter these horses are said to become woolly like sheep  sept   pensa about  0 miles from insara on the  th of september at break of day we reached pensa about seventy miles distant from insara this town notwithstanding it is buildings are but moderate yields on account of it is situation standing on a height near the river sura and it is churches a beautiful prospect trade seems to be the principal turn of the inhabitants and the shops are as well stored here as in any town on this side moscow this has been effected by the establishment of a colony and it being a place where all travelers stop the river sura flows close by the town and receives the little river pensa which runs through one part of it and supplies the market with great plenty of fish they have all the smaller kind and the shad and salmon are caught only in the spring  in the province of pensa are several distilleries of spirits from corn belonging to the nobility which show the richness of this district some noblemen have here considerable studs an attempt was made to establish a vitriol manufactory though i do not know whether the project has succeeded but the enormous quantity of pebbles found in this neighborhood which yield vitriol deserves some attention as they might be worked for the benefit of the state  but what is most worthy notice in the district of pensa is the cultivation of woad which was begun about ten years since by one tawlejef a merchant who has established woadmanufacturies in the villages of korschiman and staroimatschim having been told that the color here prepared was not good for much in dying as it lost it is beauty and liveliness in less than a years time i was induced to enquire into the reason of it i went therefore to the nearest which was upwards of forty miles from pensa the weather since the   th of august had been very agreeable but on the  th of september we had a great deal of thunder accompanied with stormy and heavy rains during this weather i went to korschiman on the   th of september little suspecting the next day to be the first day of winter and we arrived there late at night  sept    korschiman korschiman is inhabited by mordvines of the ersane race as the workmen had not done the least work for the last nine months owing perhaps to the absence of the proprietor i could only inspect the place and the implements and enquire into the manner in which they made it and it appeared to me that the business was not well managed there not being one intelligent and expert man among all the persons employed in it and that it is failure was not owing to the materials as large quantities of indigo and woad are used throughout russia and it is a profitable article of asiatic commerce it were to be wished that instead of purchasing it of strangers they would take some pains to bring these manufactures to perfection it would be a great acquisition to the wealth of the empire though the works were here suspended i did not understand that the proprietor meant to abandon his design but to endeavor to carry it on again on better principles  on our way back the weather was not only rainy but toward night winter began to salute us with a heavy snow the ground was covered to the height of some inches and the young wood being still covered with leaves bent under it is weight young trees if once bent down with snow seldom rise again of course an early premature snow may do a great deal of damage the thermometer stood from the   0th to the    th degrees on the   th of sept the cold diminished some degrees but at night it froze again and the frost was so considerable that the mercury during the   th at night pointed at     degrees and this part diminished but little during the whole winter  sept    this weather induced me to hasten my distant journey and i left pensa on the   th which was as soon as i could procure horses  seliska    miles from pensa beyond pensa we traveled through the extensive forest of sura which reached to seliska near    miles where we were benighted the mordvines of this country keep a great many beehives which they leave exposed abroad and very little sheltered from the rigours of the winter they keep also a great deal of cattle but their sheep are not of the better sort their wool being seemingly interwoven with goathair there being plenty of trees here which yield rosin most of the country people are employed in making tar it froze so much this night that all the rivers were swollen with ice  about sixteen miles further on at a place called julokgorodistche is the remains of an ancient tartarian fortification it stood upon a plain erected in form of an irregular semicircle of about   0 fathoms having a strong breastwork and a ditch in the center is a round pit now sunk probably contrived to hold water for the cattle  we could not reach simbursky before the   d it being almost impossible to travel by night for the badness of the roads even with additional horses the country however abounds with villages mostly inhabited by the people of mokscha the face of the country is a great deal of highland covered with forests of pine in which are many lindentrees very advantageous to bees this tree is the most useful of any tree in russia it is timber is good for a variety of purposes as is also it is bark and it is bast of which they make mats and ropes the leaves and tender slips of the linden when dried is also a good winterprovision for sheep in these places where they keep so many the people were here surprised by the winter and a great deal of hemp and corn that was not cut was buried and lost beneath the snow those fields also which were sown with winterseeds yielded but a dismal prospect for the ensuing year for they were devoured by a kind of catterpillar phaloena frumentalis which in the provinces of casan have for some years past been a universal landplague for they devoured the young plants as they rose to the very root as if they had been fed by cattle however the wet weather and frost had killed many of them for during the day they hide themselves in the surface of the earth there is hardly a better expedient to get rid of these unwelcome devourers than to strew those fields well where they are seen as soon as the seed rises with ashes of buckwheat or peashaulm  about three miles short of the city of simbursky is the line of partition erected from the sura to the wolga in the reign of the czar alexei michailowitsch which is a great bulwark and a deep ditch more considerable than that which is thrown up from the western part of the sura this line is still in good condition though all the places built near it have lost their wooden fortifications  sept    simbursky about   0 miles from sariska we had just reached simbursky on the   d when a most violent storm arose at night from the northwest which lasted till the   th we had then a few days fine weather and i took the opportunity to see the environs of this city this place stands on very high ground between the rivers wolga and swijaga and they are so near to each other as barely to leave room for the city though the latter runs a course of about  0 miles before it empties itself into the wolga the hill on which simbursky stands is a gray clay mixed with pyrites and full of petrifactions the hill gradually falls away on the swijaga side but on the wolga the land is washed away and leaves a very steep bank in the river and it is banks are found a variety of petrifactions and some very transparent crystals and all the country between these two rivers is so full of vitriolic and sulphurous substances that if manufactories of vitriol brimstone and alum were established near casan they might be plentifully supplied with materials  sept  0 we crossed the river tscheremschan at the distance of about  0 miles beyond simbursky on a floating bridge of rafts common in russia on account of the strong swelling rivers in that country in this neighborhood stands a village called bilgar in which name the memory of the ancient bulgarian nation seems to be preserved  the whole district of tscheremschan consists of an excellent black soil with a sufficiency of birchwood for firing of course it is well inhabited and cultivated the inhabitants here consist of tartars and mordvines but chiefly of the people of tshuwa now converted to christianity however i met with some villages where the inhabitants still adhere to their ancient religion and customs  as the language of this people resembles much the tartarian so does the dress of their women they wear coarse linen clothes worked with the needle in worsted in a variety of colors but mostly blue red and black very much like those of the mordvines they have also ornaments like theirs large pins and breastshields girdles and pendant tassels but the cap which they constantly wear even in the house is like that of the tartarian women thickly beset with old silver coins or tin spangles with necklaces of coral beads tied behind with a large needleworked band that hangs down the back to which is fixed a number of medals coins and pieces of tin and fringe which band is tucked into the girdle besides these they wear also two smaller lappets fringed at bottom hanging from the head to the middle of the back one on each side and joined together by strings of coral beads this cap is not like that of the tartarian women coming down upon the forehead or sitting close to the head but widely extended so that both ends of that veil which these women call tastar and put round their neck is crossed under the chin wound round the head under this cap and passed through a hole in the top of it where it resembles a tuft but they have also caps without holes at top these are worn by girls when they are fulldressed the veils they wear are of fine linen embellished with glassbeads and pendant corals the girls dress is less ornamental not wearing the abovementioned veil nor has their cap any flap or train behind but is commonly composed of various colors these braid their hair into two or three tresses and conceal it under their upper shift in winter both women and girls wear a kind of mans great coat made of fur over their dress the mans dress is not very different from that of the russian peasant except that his shirt about the neck is worked with worsted  the features of the people of tschuwa betray a strong mixture of tartarian blood their hair is neither lightbrown nor reddish but commonly black like that of the tartars the features of the women are pretty enough and they are much more cleanly than the mordvines i may say the same of their habitations which in many respects resemble those of the tartars their villages are not generally surrounded with pales but consist of dispersed dwellings and some small huts on eminences where they store their provisions according to the old custom the door is on the east side of the building which is covered with a large roof under which they sleep in summertime within the room is a large bench to sleep on and an oven standing on the right hand near the door frequently without a chimney in imitation of the tartars the better kind of people sleep on good featherbeds but the poor are contented with rushmats  the tschouvasches or people of tschuwa says took make regular meals placing themselves round a table for that purpose before they eat they say thore bar youra that is o god give us bread and after meals thora syrlak o lord cast me not away they cram their guests as much as possible present pieces of meat to them on spoons solicit them to eat till they can eat no longer and consider this as a mark of politeness like the tartars they sleep on broad benches but the better kind of people sleep on featherbeds  when a young among them is inclined to marry he commissions a friend to bargain with a girl who always gets her as cheap as he can the price generally paid on these occasions is from twenty to fifty rubles each ruble about  s english but a good chapman will get one for eight ten and sometimes for five rubles the rich will go as far as eighty and this purchasemoney is called golon oski the brides portion is paid in cattle furniture and clothes and is in proportion to the money paid for her  after these preliminaries follows a ceremony called kosthenas kayas that is the carrying of the presents the bridegroom and his parents visit the betrothed bride pay the purchasemoney and make her friends several sorts of presents as shirts clothes linen etc the girls father on this occasion makes an offering to the sun of a loaf of wheaten bread and some honey accompanied with a prayer for a happy marriage and prosperity to the young couple after this they sit down eat and drink and appoint the wedding day  the nuptials are thus celebrated the bride covered with a veil hides herself behind a screen from which after some time she goes and walks round the eatingroom with an air of solemnity some young girls then bring her beer bread and honey and when she has walked round the room three times the bridegroom enters snatches off her veil kisses her and changes rings with her from this time she is called schourasnegher or betrothed maiden and entertains her company with food she then returns behind the screen and the married women put on her head the matron cap which is more adorned than any she wore before  in the evening when the bride and bridegroom are to undress the lady pulls off her husbands boots and the next morning the friends search for the mosaical proofs of her virginity which if not found a boy who serves as a sort of a paranymph presents a mug of beer to one of the principal assistants in the bottom of this mug is a hole which the lad stops with his finger but takes it away when the person has the mug at his mouth and the beer thus runs down his beard and bosom this makes the company laugh and the bride blush after this no further notice is taken of her misconduct the next day the bride regales her friends and they divert themselves with dancing even those who have embraced the christian faith omit not this ceremony the wedding is often held at the house of the bridegrooms father and is a sort of clubdinner each guest bringing some eatable with him before the meal a loaf is handed about with a hole in it into which such of the company as find themselves so inclined put in a little small money as a present  at the birth of a child the friends of the parents come to congratulate them and the first comers name the infant and give it presents by slipping small pieces of coin into the mug they drink out of this ceremony is called piatschir ghivas or cradling the child  among the tschouwasches the husband is master of the house orders every thing and his wife implicitly obeys him of course domestic quarrels are seldom heard of  at their funerals as soon as the grave is filled up they place lighted torches near it a cake and a piece of roasted hen saying to the dead amenscha palder or that is for thee the persons present devour the rest and conceive they have eaten with the dead then having cast the old clothes of the deceased upon his grave they go and bathe themselves and return to the house of their departed friend and feast  such of the people of tschuwa as are not yet converted to the christian faith keep the friday holy as do the mahometans which they call aernekon but dont pay the least regard to the sunday this and also the abhorrence of swines flesh which some few indeed will now eat is a custom they derive from the tartars though they adhere to no other part of their religion in these villages where they live agreeable to their ancient customs the sotnik a kind of governor presiding over loo people chosen by the village an officer common in russia but these are under the authority of the starost or judge goes about on thursday evening to announce the festivity of the following day on which no one presumes to work every one spends the day in prayer and amusements after which each family but especially the female part of it who are not admitted to be present at solemn sacrifices have said their prayers before a certain sanctuary which they call yerig this yerig is nothing but a bundle of fifteen rods of the wild rosetree about four feet long tied together in the middle with bast from which hangs a bit of tin each house has such a sanctuary which is kept in a clean closet built in the best part of the house no one is to touch it till the fall of the leaf when they devoutly throw it into some flowing water  on the thursday in passion week every father of a family says took places certain eatables in the yard of his house with a lighted torch near them to the memory of each person who died in his house and the dogs as proxies for the dead feast on this provision even those who are converts to christianity conceive that the dead cannot rest in their graves without this ceremony  the priests of tschuwa are called youma and serve in the triple capacity of priests fortune tellers and magicians they call their supreme being thor and give him a wife whom they call thor amysch or mother of the gods they have also a subordinate divinity schaitan is the chief of their malevolent gods and has his residence in the water and in their prayers they never omit to beseech thor that he will vanquish schaitan  their notion of future existence extends to a blissful and miserable immortality good people they say are transplanted after death to a blessed abode called tschemherda or the land of perfect satisfaction where they meet their families and enjoy their property much more than before the wicked they think will be condemned to wander after death as skeletons deprived of flesh in cold and barren deserts shivering wretched and forlorn  at seedtime they have a feast for petitioning the gods to give them a fruitful harvest and after harvest they have another thanksgiving at both of which they sacrifice victims and make oblations of cakes and milk their prayers are always the same and to this effect o god have mercy upon me o god forsake me not give me many sons and daughters o god give me a great quantity of sheaves of corn and fill my barns with provision o god give me bread and honey and drink and victuals and health with tranquillity and rest o god fill my yard with horses horned cattle sheep and goats o god bless my house that i may lodge and entertain and warm the traveller o god give thy blessing to the mistress of the earth for so they call the empress and at the end of every period of this prayer all the assembly say amin  in the neighborhood of their villages generally upon some common near a river they have a sacred place called keremet this keremet is a square piece of ground surrounded with a hedge about six feet high and has three entrances one in the middle of the eastern side another on the north and the third on the west the situation of the place is so contrived that the northern side leads to the spring or river as through this gate all the water used in the sacrifice is fetched the people enter by the western gate and near the eastern is raised a roof or shed under which the sacrificial flesh is dressed before this shed is a large table fixed by fastening boards upon stakes on which the meat etc is laid near the northern gate is another large table whereon they skin and clean the victims  large villages have a great keremet for public sacrifices and a smaller one for private families who sometimes have a keremet within their houses  the people of tschuwa those in the district of the river alatyr erect in the middle of the keremet a little wooden house whose door is toward the east in which they eat the sacrifice standing for this purpose they have long tables covered with cloths in the center of this house is erected a high wooden pole which passes through the roof and has on it is top an iron ring flat at bottom and sharp at top but to this pole is no honor paid nor do they have one in open keremets  in the month of september when their harvest is housed and they are ready to sow the winterseed the public sacrifices take place again at these times they offer up a horse an ox and a sheep i never was fortunate enough to be present at one of these great festivals but i have been told that they lead the victims through the eastern gate and tie them one after the other to three stakes near the place where the flesh is to be dressed until they have said their prayers this act of devotion is performed toward the east with great bowing of all the men their common form of prayer is thor sirlaga thor biter bojant schin bull that is god have mercy god give us food and preserve us but they invoke subordinate deities for whom they have particular prayers the simple folks of tschuwa could not give me any idea of their mythology but the following are some of the names of their inferior deities which i learned keremet is the first after their supreme being besides these they have astyr ksnir pulchs surodon sir sjulsurenirsene chilsir kebe and perhaps many more of which probably it would be tiresome to enumerate the particulars or their propriety it is remarkable that they give many of their gods a wife and a son and call upon each of them three times as for example thor or keremetash the father kermetamyche the mother and keremetuewli the son and so on i heard this from a simple peasant of tschuwa who was unable to give me any further account when prayers are over the victims are immolated by one of the elders chosen by the voice of the people to this office they carefully preserve the blood and proceed as is related in the collections of russian history  the skins of the horse and ox are hung upon two high poles in the northern corner of the keremet but the sheeps skin is hung over a rail fixed on stakes stuck in the ground after hanging two days they are sold among them but the price is to defray the expenses of the sacrificial vessels or else laid out in honey and flour to be made use of at future festivals the care of this and to keep the sacred place clean is entrusted to a man of their own choosing who considers the office as an honorable employment and is called keremet pchagann such sacrifices are also performed when there is a prospect of a bad harvest before the corn is cut  private family sacrifices are performed on many occasions as in cases of sickness domestic distress childbirth and in memory of the deceased the father of the family or the eldest of the relations having said prayers kills the victim which is chiefly some small animal but generally a sheep before it is slain they throw over it a vessel full of cold water as they do indeed at public sacrifices if the animal shakes it off they proceed if not the ceremony is postponed to some other time after they have eaten the flesh and whatever is eatable of the victim they burn the bones and commit the remainder carefully to the bosom of the earth that no sacrificial relick may be profaned  the people of tschuwa bury their dead fulldressed but in a shabby coffin with the head turned toward the west they are also said to put into the grave if the deceased is a man several small tools a form whereon they work their shoes made of twisted bast lapti the instrument with which they are made a knife some bast and a steel to strike fire as they do in lapland the common burialground lies at an equal distance from the village the keremet and the highroad is called masar and the funeral obsequies are performed at three different times by the relations and friends of the deceased on the three following days viz the wednesday in passionweek the thursday before whitsuntide on which day the russians have a similar ceremony and on the  th day of november on this latter day they not only perform a sacrifice on the grave but erect a wooden pillar at the head of the grave having dug a hole for this pillar before they fix it in the ground each person present throws a bit of meat and some of the drink prepared for the funeral into it they then eat the sacrifice drink entertain and amuse themselves in a variety of ways  the collections of russian history mentioned above give a full account of the marriages of the people of tschuwa the marriage portion paid with the bride is to the amount of from  0 to  00 rubles each ruble   s   d english the bride is not suffered to walk on the day of marriage but is to ride or be carried divorces sometimes take place and the custom is for the husband of the woman he leaves to rent her veil in two pieces one of which he keeps to himself and gives the other to his wife  as they apply themselves much to breeding of bees they make a great deal of mead and they also have strong beer with hops for their feasts but drink no whey which the tartars are so fond of their dances are like those of the mordvines similar to those of the tartars and consist of several motions of the arms and body turning round with short steps their feet close together beating and keeping very good time the musical instruments used on these occasions are a bag pipe a kind of little fiddle with three strings and a dulcimer in form of a crescent with about sixteen or eighteen strings  their manner of taking an oath deserves also our notice and is as follows he who is to swear is brought to the keremet and there in the manner of eating the corsned described in english history eats a cake of flour boiled in water and butter imprecating curses on his head and that what he eats may choke him if he utters any thing but the truth hence the expression may this morsel be my last to try a man suspected of having taken a false oath they give him salt water to drink and if he coughs he is declared guilty i will only mention one thing more which is that the people of tschuwa who inhabit the heaths and mountainous part of the country on the left shore of the wolga take the byname of werejal but call themselves chirdijal  betkulowa about  00 miles from simbursky the highest mountains of this country are near the tartarian village betkulowa about  00 miles distant from simbursky and along the banks of the little river scheschma these mountains consist of a gray and white sandstone in which is here and there some copper ore of small allay we rode    miles across these mountains and reached on the  d of october through an unbeaten way in a wet and wild forest the tartarian village kurmuschli sconcekitschuiskoi was a fort formerly belonging to the line of sokam which almost extended itself to the river ik but is now like all other sorts in this district become an open spot here is a poststage on the great road from orenburg to casan here is also a copper manufactory but for want of hands to procure a sufficient quantity of ore and coals is not always worked the ore is dug in this neighborhood and out of  00lb is produced  lb of pure copper  we had just left this coppermanufactory when it began to rain violently which continued the whole day this was followed by so great a storm so much snow and so dark a night that it was with difficulty we could reach the tartarian village scharepkina a distance only of eight miles it froze hard the next day and enabled us to get faster on so that we reached buhulminskaja about thirtyseven miles the same night  buhulminskaja this town is tolerably well built has about  00 houses and two wooden churches with a public office and courthouse belonging to the regency of orenburg on the  th we reached selospaskoje the usual residence of the counselor of state rytschkof a gentleman celebrated for his writings and respected for his personal merits where after a most kind reception and amid the most social and instructive conversation i imperceptibly delayed my journey until the   th  this village is prettily situated upon an eminence surrounded with woody heights above the little rivers that flow between the mountains abound with trout and a delicate kind of small salmon salmo lacustris not uncommon in the uralian rivers and is called kutema as these mountainwaters on account of their rapidity seldom freeze their banks are crowded with a kind of waterbird rarely to be met with in any other country than russia and siberia it is a sort of starling sturnus cinclus what i am going to relate is a fact and i was an eyewitness of the truth these birds called in russia waterstarlings dip or dive to the bottom of the water in search of insects and worms without wetting their plumage if they are shot on the icy banks of rivers and not killed outright they will plunge themselves into the water and dont rise again till they are dead the bird however cannot be said to swim not having the requisite organs for that purpose but properly speaking it flies beneath the water and clings to the ground till it has got it is prey the superstitious countryman fancies that if any part of the body is anointed with the fat of this bird it will be for ever free from any injury from frost some ascribe this virtue also to it is blood there are also in the woods where the water does not freeze in winter a kind of otter mustela lutreola very little known except in russia called in the russian furtrade norka it likes to feed upon frogs and little crabs but in other respects does not differ much in his way of living from the common fishotter  on the borders of the river sok which i reached on the   th of october the country is delightfully pleasant the lands fertile and rich this is the western part of russia where a number of roebucks are about the close of winter caught in snares by the people of tartary and tschuwa who are fond of hunting in snowshoes and can easily overtake them as the deer are hampered in the snow and cannot well get on they are a peculiar kind of animal very different from all the species of european stags except as to color and horns on which there are many warts they are of the size of the fallowdeer and what is most remarkable have no tail instead of which the hinder part of their breech is covered with a little skinny wart their quarters behind are white and i am therefore led to suppose it to be the pygargus of the ancients the russians call it simply dikaja kosa the wild shegoat and the tartars give it the name of saiga in these vast uncultivated wastes are also a number of elks and foxes and some of the latter are ten of a blackish color  this district as are all the mountainous heaths along the rivers sok and kinel is some of the best sheep pasture in all russia for the common russian sheep are larger here than usual  the tartarian village usmanowa or nadyraul as it has been called from some principal person who died a few years since and who intended under a special order and direction from the superior office of mines in the province of orenburg dated at ufa in      to gather the asphaltos found here in order to draw an oil from it for this purpose he had begun to erect a manufactory at the source of the brook kamuschli to which was to be added another upon the river surgut but all these preparations were interrupted and subverted by the unexpected death of this tartar  a mile or two southeast of semenowo situated not far from the source of the river sok is an asphaltos spring on the steep declivity of a mountain overgrown with birchtrees whose soil is a fat and black earth this spring has been cleaned and forms on the mountain a reservoir about three feet wide and three feet deep which is not only constantly full of water without any agitation but flows over and forms a brook the water in this reservoir never freezes even in the most rigorous winter and though sometimes covered with snow the bituminous vapors which may be smelt from far will soon make an opening through it though the water possesses no extraordinary degree of warmth it was morning when i was there and the thermometer when in the water was     degrees when in the air it stood at   0 degrees in this well the surface of the water is covered with a black and very tough asphaltos which has the color and consistency of thick tar and as often as it is taken off will gather again in a few days it had been scummed clean about a fortnight back and yet i took from the surface more than six pounds in weight and a great deal adhered to the sides it lay on the water half an inch thick when the asphaltos is removed a fine and strong oil remains which might be fired and would burn as it lies even the water itself has some inflamable parts in it and makes a solution of litmus read the people in the neighborhood use this bituminous water to gargle their throats and drink in the apthae and other infectious and ulcerous complaints of the mouth and throat they gather the asphaltos and use it as a familymedicine as a salve it will cure recent wounds immediately by the addition of butter as an ointment it heals all sorts of tumors and ulcers but their internal use of it is most extraordinary they take a middling spoonful boiled in milk which renders it thick drinking it warm in violent cholics inward strains and hidden maladies it makes the patient almost giddy throws him into a sweat and is a powerful diuretic the urine smelling strongly of it it is said also that the peasants use it as coomb to grease their cartwheels but the chief use is a medicinal one another property which the asphaltos has tough as it is it is of so very penetrating a power that though i kept it in a cold place it made it is way through a wooden box and in a few weeks eat into a plank some inches thick it might be used to preserve wood from corruption to pay the bottoms of ships and to keep them from the worms  along the stream of the sok the mountains consist of a milkwhite limestone  nikuschkina about  0 miles from semenowo in the neighborhood of nikuschkina about  0 miles from semenowo are some springs which depose a sulphurous matter the people of tschuwa and the rest of the inhabitants use these sulphurous waters as a hotbath against the itch and other distempers of the skin it is certain that the external and internal use of them would be extremely efficacious in all cutaneous disorders and taken internally might cure many chronical ones  about ten miles from this is a remarkable sulphur lake the most considerable in all this district i rode to it by break of day and found it situated deep between two high mountains it is an oblong basin overgrown with birches about   0 yards in length and     in breadth it is aspect is frightful and it is stench which may be compared to the smell of addled eggs and brimstone is to be smelt at the distance of three miles of course it must be very disagreeable to be near it it has no perceptible motion and never freezes and though the weather was cold when i was there i found it  0 degrees warmer than the air hence it is that a visible thick vapor rises from it the water is so transparent that one might discern it is depth for it is not many feet to the bottom was it not for the black and greasy ground about it as it is it looks like a dreadful gulf at the time when the sulphurmanufacturers were here attempts were made to discover the origin of the sulphur in this lake but in vain so that it must be hidden in the bowels of this chalk mountain  from the top of this mountain issues a sulphur spring which runs down into this lake and deposes a sediment resembling a pure white and thick pulp and looks as it runs like thin curds  it is the continuation of this stream from the lake that forms the remarkable river called the whitewater river which emptys itself into the surgut this river as it proceeds from the lake is about six feet deep and it is breadth between    and    feet in this channel the water has the appearance of thin curds but in places where it flows flower than near the lake the surface has a fine scum like that seen upon limy waters and further distant from the lake it is banks when i was there were icy the ice however was not solid but consisted of a number of flakes upon oneanother like the ice that is found in fresh milk  all the matter which the water deposes is but a sulphur mixed with limy particles the whole stream was formerly banked with planks for the use of the sulphur manufactory erected upon the river sok that they might collect the sulphur with more ease but there is now no traces of such bank left the manufactories are removed to the wolga and this whitewater river is neglected  where the earth has been dug out to bank up the river surgat a thick black layer of saltpeter earth is seen and a kind of dust similar to cinders among which lie many limestones full of holes burnt out this appearance leads me to start a conjecture which i will leave to the judgment of my readers whether there may not have been formerly some vulcanic fires in these mountains perhaps some bituminous and sulphurous layers which ran through them are burnt out and has sublimated the sulphurous parts into the cliffs of the opposite limemountains now proportionably washed out by the penetration of springs but this is all conjecture  the cattle seem occasionally to have recourse to these springs as conducive to their health but as they taint the water of the adjoining rivers no fish will live in them  stawropal it was now the   th of october and as the winter approached fast and the weather grew bad i thought it best to return to simbursky and continue there till the spring i went back therefore by the way of stawropal where i arrived on the   th the snow was very deep it having snowed for two or three days we met here with those kalmucks which are become christians and inhabit the greatest part of the province of stawropal wandering with their flocks of sheep to those winter quarters allotted them where in summer is made or procured a winters provision of hay and where they live in their strange way equally in winter as in summer in cots made of felts they are said to have begun cultivating a great deal of land but i persuade myself that cultivation is only to supply their necessary wants for it is not natural to suppose that a nation accustomed to the freedom and indolence of a shepherdlife would change the sweets of such a state for the troublesome and painful condition of a toilsome one in stawropal reside their chiefs who compose their council of war and many officers these go by particular names expressive of their military rank as chorunsha jessaul etc that is cornet adjutant and so on and are all well paid they have here a protopop or chiefpriest subordinate to whom are many pops or priests chosen by the villages and also a physician persons of the first rank among them reside in the town but the kalmucks who are furmerchants and shepherds live either in town or country as it suits them or even in their felthuts though few endeavor to acquire more the advantages of a polite life than those vagrants in the step or waste of wolga the number of converted kalmucks is said now to be increased to   000 among which there are a thousand tents of sjungors who professed christianity immediately on the arrival of sjungordan uluss the missionary from the eastern step the sheep which they breed and wherein consist their chief riches are mostly of the broadtailed sort but they produce no good wool even the russian sheep that are mixed with them degenerate and have a hairy wool like the kalmuck nay the first lambs got by kalmuck rams have their tails either half or wholly bolstered up with fat now as this nation will hardly ever apply themselves to agriculture the best way in my opinion to make them useful to the state would be instead of their present flocks which are fit for nothing but slaughter to give them sheep of a better breed and teach this shepherdpeople the method of shearing especially in those places where there is the best sheep feed  the city of stawropal is agreeably situated on the high eastern bank of one of the arms of the wolga which they call kuneiwoloschka on the land side it is surrounded with delightful hills overgrown with pines and birchtrees on the opposite side of the wolga we see at a distance the lofty limemountains called shigulefski from the village shigulicha that lies between them the middle part of the town represents a fort consisting of some pallisadoes towers and a battery it contains two churches one built with wood but the mother church is handsomely erected with stone besides the mansions of the woiwod or governor there is a courthouse or chancery belonging to the regency of orenburg the dwellings of the chiefs of the kalmucks and other military persons some provision and salt magazines a number of shops and a school above the sort are several streets wherein live the soldiers of the garrison and the cossacks in which place there is a chapel the number of houses amount to about   0  october    on the   th of october i left stawropal in order to reach simbursky before the rapid iceflood came on which the river wolga seemed to threaten us with the first village we passed in our way there was santschalewoi at the distance of about thirteen miles this place is inhabited by diverse sorts of people comprehended under the general denomination of kysilbashes and some of the people of mokscha it appears that since the building of the mordvine villages the descendants of the people of ersania and those of mokscha are mixed and that their language is reduced into one for example the mordvines who inhabit the environs of the wolga dont call their supreme being paas as do the ersanes nor skai like the people of mokscha but use the compound word skipas besides this they have adopted a great many of the tschuwasch and are the cleanliest of all the mordvines they clean their tables forms and walls with a kind of brush which they call ili but the tartars who use the same instrument give it the name of schlan their women wear nothing but a piece of linen tied round their heads both ends of which are elegantly stitched and hang down on the neck behind i saw some whose hair by the addition of black sheepwool was braided into a flat tail of two hands in breadth or in tresses which reached down to the middle of their legs and seems to have been the old ersane ornament some instead of the usual apron worn behind wear a great many black strings hanging down from the girdle  almost all the villages on this road are inhabited by russians near nikolskoe south of the river tscheremschan are the remains of a strong tartarian breastwork and a little behind nikolskoe we cross an old russian line or barrier which must be older than that of sakamia because it is within the latter this line begins at beloijar upon the wolga and goes to the borough of eryklinsk which formerly was fortified and lies at nine miles distance from whence it is said to extend itself over tynsk and biljar to the river ik like the sakamian line the ditch of this line is in some places twentyseven feet wide even in the village nikolskoe are several heaps of rubbish probably the remains of some redoubts  i made the best of my way to simbursky sending my baggagewaggon on before as the heavy frost and the badness of the roads would admit and reached the slobode or suburbs opposite that city on the  0th of october but owing to a northwest wind and the abundance of ice collected on the shore i could not cross the river till the next day when by the help of a boat and walking on the ice i was able to do it the frost here had been so severe that the wolga near a mile broad was almost frozen over this river is most commonly shut up with ice in the first week of december and often much earlier  this winter i found was one of the most constant and uninterrupted frosts the people had ever remembered the snow fell but little and a very remarkable northernlight which was observed on the   th of november was the beginning of a violent frost which raised the mercury in the thermometer about the middle of december to   0 degrees the most common and violent winds which blow always in the winter on the river wolga seem to come from the southwest as these very winds are the most mischievous to the vines and fruits of these parts was the culture of vines to be extended and even to flourish here it must be on such spots and hills only as are sheltered  about fourteen miles above simbursky on the right shore of the wolga are the remains of a fortress supported by a ditch it is said to have been erected by the celebrated old depredator jerasim in this neighborhood coals are found of so bituminous a quality that they will kindle with the flame of a candle in burning they have an agreeable smell similar to gumanime in it is smoke and consume to a gray irony ash these coals are not dug out of the earth but are a kind of bituminous layer that floats upon the river wolga though it is probable if shafts were dug deep enough the same kind of coal would be found in the earth and i am of opinion it would answer the expense as the conveyance by the wolga would be trifling and it might be conveyed to the remotest parts of the empire  it would have been unpardonable had i omitted to visit the celebrated remains of the bulgarian capital brjachimof now called bolgari lying about eighty miles distant from simbursky up the wolga and upon it is left and low shore no description having been given of the old remarkable buildings still standing there  december    on the   th of december i went to this place the celebrity of which seems to have been increased by it is having been honored with a visit from peter the great and the present empress but not being able to go the nearest way on account of the ice with which the wolga threatened my passage i was obliged to go over the mountainous parts which are covered with wood and abound with small game  we crossed the river wolga at tetjuschi a little market town lying upon the highroad about seventytwo miles from simbursky the river here not being so wide the ice was crossed in wagons from this passage to the village bolgari which is built upon the ruins of the ancient city and lies toward the northeast they reckon fourteen miles the road leads partly over some lowlands which the wolga occasionally overflows and partly through a highstanding wood of pines with which the village is surrounded on all sides  it is situation is tolerably high but the land round it is marshy and bushy it is wonderful that so considerable and populous a city as bolgari seems formerly to have been should be so badly situated in respect to it is water which cannot be procured but by wells the wolga runs here in a straight line for the distance of three miles and though the village inclines to the river it does not appear that it ever had it is course near this city  the village now consists of above  00 farms and has been taken possession of by the crown it lies at the distance of about sixty miles from casan in front toward the south it has a plain prettily scattered with resintrees and birchtrees it is now chiefly under tillage and has been the spot on which the city stood this whole plain is encompassed with a bank and a ditch which though decaying is in some places twentyone feet wide the fortification has the shape of an irregular semioval four miles in circuit and adjoins the declivity on which the present village stands we can plainly see that a deep and dry ditch crossed this fortress from southwest to northeast close by the easternside of the village and seems to be formed by nature most of the ancient buildings are within the bank i will give the reader such a description of the most remarkable kirgtisians at the ruins of bulgari ones as the piercing cold and falling snow would allow me  on the eastern side of the village is the site of a cloister with some woodenbuildings and a fine stonebuilt church within the district of this cloister which is encompassed with a hedge and goes by the name of uspenskoi are many pieces of antiquity the most remarkable is a misgir or tower built with smoothhewn freestone rather more than eightyfour feet high in pretty good preservation it has a winding staircase to the top consisting of seventytwo steps each step twelve inches and threequarters high these stairs have been repaired and the tower has been covered with a woodenroof and an arabian inscription within new written the entrance is on the south and has a strong ironhinge remaining on which hung the door in sundry places there are openings to let in the light and adjoining this misgir was an irregular square building strongly erected part of the walls of which is now standing and seems to have been formerly a house of prayer the tower stands on one corner of it this wall is built with stones unequal in size clumsily joined and badly hewn among which one my discern flints lime sand and several kinds of stucco all apparently brought from the mountainous part of the wolga east of this stand the remains of a little tartarian house of prayer solidly built with stones of different sizes with a vaulted roof the lower part is square but the roof is octangular each side is thirtyfive feet long it has been repaired and converted into a popish chapel dedicated to one of their saints called nikolao the miraculous the entrance to this is in the west front and the windows or opening to let in the light on the southern side on other spots of this enclosure are the remains of some old building now converted into a cellar  there are four other ancient buildings within the ditch in good preservation with a great quantity of decayed wallrubbish and vestiges of habitations on the west are the ruins of a considerable building called by the peasants the greekhouse but for what reason i know not  among the great number of erections is a tower standing in a field   0 feet distant southwest from the cloister built with the same material as the one i have named only thicker and about sixtythree feet in height not far from this toward the cloister are the foundations of some spacious buildings among which the house of prayer which belonged to the tower probably stood  five hundred and sixty feet further to the southwest stands yet a little square building made of strong and solid freestone the vaultedroof of which is fallen in on one side it is entrance is on the west and it has a small window on the south in the western front on each side is a false window it has two similar ones on each of the northern and southern fronts with this difference that those on the last two are farther distant from each other than those on the western if supposition may be admitted this seems to have been nothing but a house of prayer  the building of which the principal foundation is now to be seen standing on the southern side of the village and the very center of the citys district is much more extensive and considerable and deserves our attention but it is scarce to be conjectured for what purpose it was erected the country people call it the courthouse and i have no good reason to call it otherwise the square division of rooms of which the foundations may be seen appear to have been entrances from without but not to have had any communication with the apartments in the middle and also not to have been higher than the second story there are three small rooms in the eastern front two larger ones in the southern and an oblong one in the western in it is northern corner is an oblong square foundation which touches it only at it is angle and the northern front of the principal building where the entrance is shows no signs of side rooms  as dr pallas has given us no regular view of the site of this place i have not given all the buildings together but have thrown two of the principal ones into one plate and have given my readers the third by itself an account of which is as follows  the profile   at about  00 feet distance on the south in a straight line from this building is another ancient and strongbuilt one of considerable magnitude it is architecture is still more remarkable and the internal division so peculiar that in order to make it well conceived i have given the reader the groundplot it is northern groundplot or smaller part is built on a foundation of limestone with large tartarian bricks it is entrance is on the east and in the sidewalls are several openings to let in the light by a crosswall it is divided into a square antichamber and an oblong saloon we pass from the latter into the principal part of the building which has no second entrance this part is built except it is top which is of brick with hewn freestone in pieces fourteen inches broad and about   inches in thickness it is greatest space is divided into four closets by walls from the bottom to the top between which is a broad passage in form of a cross this cross passage receives it is light from an octagonal skylight in the roof besides a small window on each side about the large pinnacle or swelling roof are four smaller ones over each corner closet which throw the light into these closets only through an octagonal opening also in the center the insides of all these vaulted roofs are concave and ornamented with stucco the corner closets are exactly square and have their doors in the angle leading into the crosspassage at the southern end of this building is an addition of three rooms the eastern or smallest of which has no entrance or opening except a breach into the southeastern corner closet of the center building but the western which projects from the centerbuilding about seven feet has no communication with that building or the middle room but it is entrance is from the outside like that of the private closet for prayer which has been described in the burialplace of the khans at kasimof under the principal part of this building is a vault in which there is a subterraneous passage from the southern wall as into the sepulchral cave at kasimof but this vault being broken in underneath the southern corner closet rendered my descent impracticable from some pieces of decayed wood laying on it i conceive it to have been a burialplace if i am not mistaken these buildings may have been partly used for a school and partly for a sepulcher like those ancient ones still to be seen in the city of taschkent  near bolgari have been found a great many ancient tombstones chiefly with arabian but some with armenian epitaphs with part of which the foundation of the new church of usprenski are built and the remainder lies scattered about upon the ground these tombstones are of various sizes their figure like those i described at kasimof and some of them are of the same bigness by order of the emperor who showed his love of arts and sciences upon every occasion they were not only exactly copied but a translation was made of all that were legible fortynine have been translated twentytwo of which are dated in the year of the hegyra     of course it is natural to suppose there must have been some epidemic sickness in the city that year the rest are variously dated the arabian ones include only a space of     years that is from the year of the hegyra     to that of     during which time batykhan previovs to his invading the west is said to have reigned here there are three in the armenian language one dated     and two     and     which is in the middle of the sixteenth century comprehending a space of     years these epitaphs contain nothing but a mohammedan sentence not found in the armenian inscriptions with the name birth and dignity of the deceased they are chiefly eminent bulgarians and tartars of both sexes some priests some laymen and perhaps merchants of some it is said they were born in the persian province schamachie and one in skirvan whence it appears that this town on account of it is trade and commerce must have drawn some of it is inhabitants from very distant parts a better conception may be formed of it is trade from the little silver and coppercoins found by the children in the fields among the silver ones are many stamped with a pretty arabian or kufischian inscription they consist of fine silver are very thick but seldom exceed the size of an english groat there are also found some of an inferior silver and badly stamped having on one side stars or other little ornaments f on the others some elevated points a circle or some whimsical mark of the same kind with those used by the baschkirians who are ignorant of the art of writing when they sign their names i have given a drawing of them but these marks are more general on the copper coin particularly within the treble triangle g    besides these coins neat toys wrought in fine gold and silver have also been found though these riches are now almost wholly exhausted they brought me an abundance of jingling things made of brass and iron besides several pointed hatchets fastened to handles with wooden pins instead of nails i saw also some weapons that are seldom met with and which strahlenberg gives a description of and a variety of corals that have been turned with a lathe and afterward burnt having the form of large buttons full of little holes which perhaps may have been used as the beads of a rosary most of them were brickcoloured some whitish and others blackish and also some smaller ones of varied colored glass besides pieces of earthen pots beautifully colored a person who could stay here in summer might giving himself the trouble and gaining the confidence of the inhabitants find out some valuable pieces of antiquity but it was impossible for me to do this in winter and though i took all possible means to ingratiate myself with the people i am persuaded that what i procured was not the most rare and valuable what a variety of these antiquities must have fallen then into bad hands the tartars who come this way in winter purchase the clothes and coins here collected with great avidity and care and i was but just in time to procure some few articles on account of the severity of the frost and the deep and heavy snow it was impossible for me to give that description of this place and it is environs which it deserves and which i wished to do  simbursky the rest of the winter i spent at simbursky examining into the animals and fisheries of this district for the brass and iron manufactories in the neighborhood are scarce worth notice  in the mountainous districts about the wolga the russian marmotes are often met with in whole troops or families great numbers of badgers and very fine ermine and ferrets innumerable but the common weasel which throughout russia and siberia becomes in winter white as snow is not to be found here mr linnaeus was unacquainted with the european weasel only in it is winter fur which changes white at that time of the year in all northern countries like the ermine and the hare see lapland and norway it is fur in summertime is of a blackbrown color but the fur of those which are bred in the southern parts of europe are of a beautiful yellowred i have seen the ermine from the molucca islands which like the weasel in the southern climes never changes it is fur buffon justly asserts that the ermine is an animal peculiar to northern countries alone  the most common animal of all here is the stepmouse mus citillus which in all the open deserts and heaths between the wolga and the don to the   d degree of latitude has a most beautiful spotted fur and as it is easy to be caught i wonder it is not but in all the southern countries situated from the eastern part of the wolga to siberia this animal not only increases in size but it is fur is gray and speckled and it has a bushy tail and resembles the marmot both in appearance and manner these districts swarm with pernicious fieldmice two kinds of which are but little known the mus agrarius and the mus minutus they are generally found in the open fields under heaps of corn set up there in the russian way  the muskrat common in all the lakes about the wolga is also remarkable for it is fur which is very cheap and used only to border common fur clothes notwithstanding this it is wool is soft and fine equal to that of the beaver in softness and brightness and though shorter perhaps might be equally good for the manufacture of hats  of the common sorts of wild fowls there are plenty of the bustard kind tetrix and partridges both are caught during the winter in snares and nets woodcocks are scarce to be found only in the pinewoods about the wolga and a species of grouse t bonasia is sometimes met with but as seldom of rare birds i met here with the woodpecker picus tridactylus the smallest falcon falco minutus which is not much larger than a thrush a kind of gray hawk falco rusticolus called here lunn and a remarkably beautiful kind of blue titmouse parus indicus aldrovandi raj syn av p    n    common from the wolga to siberia and the waterstarling sturnus cinclus may be seen throughout the whole winter in several adjacent rivers which do not freeze as the uren kamajur etc  i dont believe there is a river in europe so full of fish as the wolga including all it is arms or branches it not only serves all the neighboring districts but this river and the jaik supplies the whole empire though the fisheries will be properly described in the lower parts of this river i will mention what i saw here  those fishes which are caught in the wolga only not in it is branches are the sturgeon the hornback the huso or isinglass fish and the salmon the more common kinds are the barble the shad the goldeye and another called tschechon  the bjeluga sturgeon is often caught in this river from thirteen to sixteen feet long and from   00 to   00 pounds in weight but the smallest kind of this fish which is most frequent is five or six feet shorter than the former the hornback ossetr is caught from three feet in length to near six and weighs from twenty pounds to eighty the little huso accipenser ruthenus which is peculiar to the caspian sea and has no other name is not longer when fullgrown than about twentyeight inches and weighs about twelve pounds  they have also here another kind of sturgeon not much bigger than the huso but shaped like a sturgeon and is very rough and thorny they call it kostera but having compared many of these fishes of a different age i am confident that they are only young sturgeons and that the older they grow the more they improve in smoothness and fat  the redsalmon which they have here is only seen in the two last months of the year and is even then very rare in the wolga but the whitesalmon comes up this river from the beginning of january to june they are from twentyone inches to three feet in length and do not exceed  0lb in weight the barbel is somewhat heavier and about four feet in length but the general size is three feet the shad some has been seen here six feet long and   0 pounds in weight it is caught commonly in spring and autumn and is thoroughly a fish well known for his waving motion in order to avoid the net or tear it to rescue other fishes  the goldeye clupea alosa which on account of it is color is called sheleniza or ironfish or from a whimsical opinion that eating it will turn persons mad beschenaja ryba or madfish comes up the wolga in prodigious shoals from the beginning of may to the end of summer and frequently load the nets to the displeasure of the fishermen the russians throw this fish away or sell it at a cheap rate to the mordvines and the people of tschuwa who eat them fresh or dry them for winter provision it is a fish that would eat very well smoked and supply the lower class of people if they could get rid of that foolish prejudice that such as eat it will go mad  the tschechon cyprinus cultratus is caught in spring in vast quantities with the goldeye and is much of the same size but on account of it is dry nature but little esteemed of course it is only eaten by the poor sometimes fresh and sometimes salted  besides these fishes the wolga and all it is branches are full of others generally known perch bream trout etc but the eel is never met with neither in the wolga nor any of the rivers or brooks that flow into it nor in the neighboring lakes nor is it seen in all siberia but instead of the eel they catch the quab plentifully by hooks baited with pieces of fish and laid in the wintertime underneath the ice the wolga is also crowded with crabs of an extraordinary size but of a bad taste the common people cannot endure the sight of them of course they are only eaten by the better class and the inhabitants of great towns who are free from these vulgar prejudices they are caught plentifully in winter by making holes in the ice and letting down a round flat piece of basketwork in the middle of which they tie a piece of fish and when they crawl on it to get at their prey are drawn up  there is scarce a place in the world where they make use of so many whimsical and ingenious machines or instruments for fishing as on the river wolga not to mention their common cast and dragnets their baskets and bownets they use another method which is a kind of snare and deserves to be described choosing such places in the river for this snare where the bed of it is flat to about the middle of the channel at the bottom of such places they drive in stakes about half a yard asunder across that part of the river either in a straight line or an obtuse angle which opens downwards with the stream the top of the stakes standing above the water against these stakes they place hurdles of basketwork as high as will reach from the bottom of the river to it is surface these hurdles are sunk between the current and the stakes and kept in their places by stones and the stream driving against them this is designed to obstruct the passage and make the fish turn aside to seek another way now in some part of this basketwork an opening or entrance sixteen or eighteen feet is left into a square place made in the same manner and closed on three sides with hurdles wherein the fishes swim the third side of this square place being open leads to other enclosures in a kind of labyrinth and all in the course of the stream and inclining to the shore over these snares or enclosures the ice is constantly broke and over the holes a thatched shed is erected to shelter the fishermen who wait here and who have a fire occasionally to warm them the shed is large enough to admit the men to walk round the enclosures  now it is easy to conceive that a fish swimming along the hurdles to find a passage must necessarily go into these enclosures but to know the arrival of such fish and seize it the following method is made use of  a piece of netting stretched on a frame or a piece of basketwork the exact size of the bottom of the enclosure is let down in each with strong ropes fixed to each corner to draw it up when they have occasion over the entrance into these enclosures is a small floating piece of wood with a number of strings that go down to the bottom and are there fixed in a frame cossacks fishing below so that every large fish that enters must necessarily touch some one of these strings which moves the float above and gives the fishermen notice over the opening in each enclosure is a net perpendicularly erected on a frame which they can slide down by means of two perpendicular poles at pleasure and as soon as they know of a fish being in the enclosure they slide down the net and draw up the frame and this net at the same time thus hemming in the fish which they take with hooks this done they let down the frame again three men are employed in this business  but not to be constrained to sit up the whole night watching they have contrived a method that the fish shall ensnare himself and give notice to the fishermen this is by hanging some stones to the bottom of the sliding net or grate that shuts up the entrance and making it drop of itself and this is effected in the manner of the door of the common rattrap by a small piece of wood fixed at the entrance into the enclosure which gives way on being touched by a fish in it is passage and communicating with a piece of mechanism above lets the net or fallgate down and at the same time rings an alarmbell which wakes the sleeping fishermen and gives them notice of the event  this ingenious piece of mechanism is fixed in the river in summertime in proportion to the height of the water and remains there till the ice drives in order to catch wolga sturgeons and other great fishes which swim up the stream when the ice begins to drive it is removed till january and then made use of till the breaking of the ice in spring this being the season of salmonfishing  every spring and autumn says took these hurdle enclosures undergo a thorough repair and in deep waters a number of diverse are employed to examine all the lower parts and amend them  it is impossible for the most lively imagination to represent the extreme fatigue and the different hardships these diverse undergo just before they go into the water they drink a dram of brandy and then get upon an oven made extremely hot near the end of this hurdle fence here they continue half an hour then wrapping their sheepskin shube about them they get into the boat throw off their cloths when they come to the place to be examined make the sign of the cross three times on their forehead and breast and are let down by degrees to the bottom of the river in this suspended state they are alternately drawn up and let down again that they may examine the whole apparatus want of breath obliges them to be drawn up now and then above the surface this they repeat till shivering with cold all over they find their limbs begin to stiffen and refuse to perform their office they then take another dram repair to the oven to reheat themselves and begin their work afresh and they repeat these alternatives of heat and cold till the blood gushes out at their nose and ears and they are cast half dead into the boat which is constantly near them the strongest of these diverse cannot remain more than seven minutes under water nor support these sudden transits from heat to cold more than five times a day and as it generally requires seven days to repair the works thoroughly the diver is condemned during that period to experience all the consequences of being stunned in this most violent and extraordinary manner their health as the reader will naturally conclude is much impaired by this tormenting practice and none of them ever reach the ordinary term of human life but die whilst in their youth no man can follow this dreadful trade longer than ten years and numbers are forced to relinquish it in the third or fourth year  among the various kinds of fishes caught in the wolga the several species of sturgeon and the whitesalmon are the most excellent and profitable as to price the latter as long as the frost continues are transported fresh into the northern parts of russia but afterward salted and smoked like the redsalmon the art of smoking fish however they know but little of if they knew better how to cure it both kinds of salmon would be excellent food  the various kinds of sturgeon caught in this river in summer and autumn are put by hundreds into the large ponds near the wolga which the floods leave in hollow places in the low grounds and are left there all the winter they are dragged to these lakes or ponds by ropes passed through the mouth and out at the gills as soon as the winter grows milder they are taken out with a net from underneath the ice in these lakes and transported in a frozen state  the roe of this fish which is the celebrated caviar as they call it is considered as the greatest delicacy and the nicest part of the whole sturgeon and is conveyed to great distances in this country in wintertime without being salted the largest wolga sturgeons will produce sometimes  00lb of roe and as five eggs of this roe weigh but one grain it may easily be calculated how many millions of eggs the roe of such a fish must contain not less than near eight millions but what is still more remarkable is that though few fishes come up the river to spawn no young sturgeons are ever caught or seen the roes of other sturgeons do not weigh more than thirty pounds in summer they salt and export in barrels large quantities of this roe or cavear the method of salting it is this after the roe is cleaned of it is skin and vessels and well salted they put it into boxes that have holes in the bottom and press it with heavy weights so that the moisture drains from it this done they wring it in linen rags press it into barrels and pour fishfat over it to prevent it is corrupting in other places they preserve the roes of salmon and pike scalding the latter in boiling water before they salt it in order to remove it is viscidity but the plentiful roe of the barbel and bream are considered as unwholesome and given as food to geese and poultry  of the other species of sturgeon they throw no part away it is intestines are partly eaten when fresh a strong tendon which this fish has upon it is back is taken out before it is salted and when dried sold as a great dainty by the name of wesiga of the airbladders they make isinglass for this purpose they choose those of sturgeons in preference as having the strongest viscidity these bladders are soaked in water and after the external skin is taken off the internal part which is the isinglass is rolled up and dried the best sort is rolled up the second best laid together in leaves like a book and the worst sort is merely dried and sold at a low rate farther down the river wolga the make a fine glue by boiling the fresh bladders and cast it in moulds of various forms upon the river oka where they have only the little huso they beat the bladder out thin in the state it is taken from the fish and dry it on the wolga they use shadbladders for this purpose but these they bruise and pass through a sieve the strongest of this sort of glue is used by the joiners they have begun now in some places to make fishglue from the barbel  the shad amongst their large fishes is the least esteemed yet the skin of this fish being thin and smooth like that of an eel when the skins of other fishes are thrown away is spread and dried and sold to the country people especially those among the tartars to form their windows of see lapland being as transparent as horn they use also for this purpose the peritonaeum of animals cleaned and dried i found the shadbladder excellent for covering of bottles in which animal preparations are preserved as it keeps out moisture better than other bladders  tschirikowo by an excursion to the village tschirikowo at the distance of twenty miles from simbursky i met with some other curiosities this village is situated upon the brook birutsh which flows into the swijaga and which is not only remarkable for its trout and motherofpearl which is found in it in common with other adjacent waters but for there having been elephants bones discovered there about the shores i have myself seen some work made of an elephants tooth found  00 years ago in this place which had taken a light yellow color many other bones particularly a skull of an elephant have at sundry times been found in the banks of this river i have also seen some workmanship of ivory made of a tooth found here equal to the soundest ivory only that the point of the tooth was a little decayed so that it may be matter of wonder that a bone could remain after a length of years past memory without decay in several spots human bones they say are also found in great quantity if this be the case it will be no small matter of triumph to some writers who ascribe all the elephant bones found in the northern districts to former wars but there are more probable arguments to ascribe these relics to which are dispersed as far as the icy ocean to some higher and more important catastrophes of the earth       march  0 i left simbursky on the  0th of march a winter journey leaves but little opportunity for useful observation and the road back to stawropal is now sufficiently known to need any more to be said of it the winterroad was over so many heaths and the snow lay so deep that we were obliged to walk the whole night on the  0th and reached stawropal the next evening  march    some little matters i had to adjust detained me at stawropal till the   th the chain of limemountains which compose the shore of the wolga and are upwards of  00 feet high are but barren walls of rocks and torn cliffs but they please the eye by their variety and strike it with wonder the great quantities of birds of prey that inhabit these rocky shores building their nests here in summer are beyond description the whitish eagle vultur albicilla is frequently met with on these mountains even in winter and many beautiful hawks build also their nests in the cavities here is plenty also in summer of a curious kind of wildducks anas rutila whose feathers resemble the color of the redfox there are a few reddish or black bears and also some lynxs in the thick forests of these mountains not many martens but a fine sort of large squirrels inclining to white the fur of this animal is the second best in russia  about forty miles from stawropal near the mouth of the river sok is a highhill called zarew kurgan with a round base from every appearance and every rational conjecture this mountain seems to have been torn from the limemountains on the opposite side of the river and to owe it is roundness to accidental inundations but according to common report it is said to have the following incredible origin the story is differently told but the tenor is to this purpose that in very early days an enormous army passing this district the commander in order to erect a monument to his power is said to have ordered each soldier to carry a capfull of earth upon this spot and that thus the hill rose but what is much against the story is the hills consisting of large pieces of rock which could neither be put within the small space of a cap nor be carried by any one man some increase this mavelous account by adding that the same army went back the same way and having unfortunately lost a great number of men each soldier was commanded to take away a capfull of earth from it and notwithstanding this this large hill is still left  in the neighborhood of this hill near the village podgory a manor belonging to count orlof stands the village sernoigorodok to which the sulphur manufactory was removed in the beginning of this century from the river sok it is built along the steep shore of the wolga at the bottom of that very mountain where the famous massy sulphur is dug and contains about forty dwellinghouses and some buildings belonging to the manufactory  the very day of my arrival at the town of samara it thawed and the weather was so exceedingly mild during the latter days of march that soon after the heights of samara were exposed to the beams of the meridian sun they lost their hoary heads and though it snowed violently on the last day of march and the first day of april it so quickly disappeared the ensuing days that on the   th day of april the meadows began to look green and as the ice upon the wolga daily decreased i made a visit to some of the adjacent parts before all the snow was melted  by the middle of april every appearance of winter was gone spring took it is place the palm and the hazel began to bloom and all the heights were delightfully enamelled with the star of bethlehem the silverweed pheasanteye violets and a kind of windflower the anemone patens the birches and servicetrees put forth their leaves and were followed on the  0th by every other bush before the end of the month the wild apple tree which in this district is considered as the most common bush began to blow and all nature looked gay  the aquatic birds were still earlier seen on the   th and  0th of march we saw wild swans and wild geese and on the   th the open waters were crowded with ducks the lapwings plaintive notes were heard on the  0th and followed before the end of this month by every other waterfowl i took notice that these birds came from the west and northwest as they do in other parts of europe but the birgander onocrotalus the stork of which they have here a white kind and other landfowls came from the south among the landbirds the first that made it is appearance in the middle of march was the crow and at the end of march the wildpidgeon the starling the plover and a kind of lark alauda alpestris which latter was as abundantly to be met with during the whole spring as the sparrow in the mean time the mouse citillus which has already been mentioned crept out on all those spots where the snow was melted and coupled the insects were not visible but with the flowers those i first saw were some butterflies and glowworms but neither these nor the warmth of the days induced a visit from the swallow till the   th of april on which day i saw several with the beeeater merops which convinces me they are birds of passage or they would have appeared as soon as others it has been said that swallows in winter retire to the water but the russians know nothing of this fabulous account or they would contradict it for there is no country that fishes so much and sweeps the waters frozen or not frozen with all kinds of nets the usual autumnal and heavy frosts drive all swallows from these districts early but in the milder parts of europe it may easily be conceived that some of these birds after having tarried too long and become too feeble and disabled from the rigor of the season to take a long journey may creep into the water or some hollow ground  samara before i proceed farther i will give the reader some short account of the town of samara this place is situated on the angle which the northern mouth of the river samara forms with the wolga but stands chiefly on the wolga bank it was formerly a garrison and had a wooden fort but was burnt down in   0  in   0  they erected a new one with defiles on a hill on the eastern side between the wolga and samara which is to be seen the chief support of this town which continues to flourish is breeding of cattle and their great commerce is in fresh and salt fish and roe cavear to carry on this trade when the weather is open and the roads passable they travel over the steps in caravans to the river jaik to fell their provisions to buyers or merchants who come there from all the northern and western districts on account of this commerce they throw a temporary bridge over the samara to a road that leads straight to the capital of the cassanians who live near the river jaik on this road there are many wayhouses at certain distances for the accommodation of travelers  the inhabitants of samara have some fisheries on the wolga at a distance from the town but in certain reaches of the river which they consider as belonging to them besides their own cattle they traffic with the kalmucks for sheepskins and tallow they have no manufactories except a few tanneries without the town and some very inconsiderable ones of hides and silks the citizens or burghers of samara belong to a court dependant on the regency of casan but the people of casan that live in and about samara are numbered among those of the district of orenburg and formerly the whole town belonged to it  in winter samara is full of trading tartars from kasimof who come here with lambskins which they barter for with the kirgians and kalmucks and which they bring here to get tanned and sewed together by the christian kalmucks who reside in this town before they carry them to moscow and other places most of the fine lambskins sold in russia are brought from this place as also the skins taken from the legs of lambs and fewed together by the kalmuck women and which are sold as furs the thread used for this purpose in common is drawn from russian linen in lengths about an ell long but what they use for themselves is made from the divided sinews of animals a kind of fine catgut  the ice no sooner leaves the wolga but a great many ships and barges are seen passing and repassing to and from astrachan into the internal parts of the russian empire and some frequently at anchor here those that sail down the river carry timber and wood of all kinds wooden and earthen vessels iron foreign goods and all sorts of corn those that go up the stream from parts below are laden with astrachan goods hides tallow and salt  the environs of samara consist chiefly of wasteground and heath rising gradually into high hills in the snowdrains that run into the samara are found many beautiful pebbles and flamecoloured agates impressed with figures as if frozen many of these have been long collected and polished at catherineburg  the hills that lie up the river from samara and form it is mountainous shore are so happily situated and have so fit a soil that there is no place in the whole russian empire better adapted for trying the cultivation of vines and such trials if made by experienced vinedressers with such vines as love a loamy soil must surely meet with success here might also be cultivated other things which require a warm climate and thrive in the southern parts of europe but not the least attempt has been hitherto made to introduce any thing of the kind except pimento and the common watermelon the watermelon gardens are upon the heath on both sides the river and are open to the waste they plow the ground sow the seeds and take no farther care of them than occasionally to water them in dry weather and when the fruit is ripe leave it to be gathered by children as they raise a great quantity of this fruit they salt and pickle it as we do cucumbers but i dont remember ever tasting any thing so nauseous some stew them and it is said they are then very sweet  the pimento of which great quantities are raised at astrachan is sold by the name of codpepper or redmustard it is sown in the same way they sow cauliflowers viz in flat boxes raised from the ground in the month of july they remove the seedling plants to beds in a garden prepared for this purpose in rows at some distance from each other and water them till they seem to have taken good root and are pretty strong it seldom happens that an early frost prevents the ripening of this fruit the ripe pods after being dried in an oven are reduced to powder sold at the rate of nine shillings or less for thirtysix pounds weight and are used by the common people as a spice many of these pimento and watermelon plantations are made only about the end of june in those hollows where the water stood all the winter and at this season is dry and yet their fruit ripens they have begun here to plant apple trees which flourish very much about simbursky generally called simbirsk and syfran but the increase of caterpillars and other destructive insects is much against this useful branch of gardening  yet there are many wild fruits apple trees almonds very tall and bushy cherrytrees cerasus pumila and of a very spicy flavor the juice which they squeeze from them is sold very cheap will keep two years and makes a regaling summerdrink they have made a successful attempt to transport it to moscow as soon as the river is open if this juice is suffered to ferment it makes an excellent spicy vinegar and if good is as nice as the best cherry liquor these cherry trees or shrubs and almond bushes are handsome garden hedges on account of their early bloom and for a living fence no better tree can be made choice of than the wildapple which is properly speaking formed so by nature besides here are some remarkable and beautiful shrubs to ornament a northern garden as the maple acer tartaricum the false acacia robinia frutescens the diosma spirea crenata the broom and the upright honeysuckle lonicera tartarica  besides the abovementioned vernal plants the heights about samara produce some remarkable and curious ones that bloom in may and june to some of which there are no english names but i have given such as most resemble them the onosma echioides and simplicissima the clove julyflower dianthus prolifer the virgins bower clematis recta the spurge euphorbia segetalis the sage salvia nemerosa and nutans the sagetree phlomis tuberosa and herba venti the dragonshead dracocephalum thymiflorum and sibiricum the catmint nepeta violacea the french honeysuckle hedysarum onobrychis the milkvetch astragalus pilosus the grandiflorus contortuplicatus the moscow and siberian centaury the thistle carduus cyanoides and the elicampane inula hirta and odorata among these plants none is more known than the onosma echioides which has a long root seemingly dyed on the outside with a beautiful red young maidens gather this root and paint their cheeks with it on which account it is called by the russians rumaniza by the tartars krschab  here grows also spontaneously a wild asparagus but seldom so large as the little finger though it is good to eat the inhabitants are either ignorant or careless of this gift of nature  among the remarkable animals of the district of samara the squirrel sciurus glis which they fatten in italy for the table deserves to be noticed i have found this animal in the rocky cliffs of the eastern mountains and tried to make this and other animals which sleep all winter as the urchin and mus citillus sleep by shutting them up in an icy cave in summertime and succeeded for on looking at them a few days afterward i found them quite insensible  of all the little animals found in these steps or wastes the most beautiful and remarkable is the dwarf kind of hare not larger than a rat almost the color and having all the form of common hares except the ears which are round and shorter this little creature leads a solitary life in spots overshadowed with bushes where it digs holes like a rabbit with several passages leading to them and hides itself all the day at twilight it steals abroad in search of food chirps like a quail and may be heard at night and before dawn at half a mile distance the country people listen to the noise but are at a loss to know from whence it comes being wholly unacquainted with the animal it brings forth toward the end of may from four to six young ones which like young rats are blind and naked in wintertime it makes trenches in the turf and seeks it is food beneath the snow  the muskrat sorex moschatus is another uncommon animal seen frequently on the river samara and the lakes it is generally caught in those baskettools fixed in the river for catching of fish and is commonly found suffocated though it is internal parts are formed for living on the water this animal makes it is nest in holes under water in the banks of the lakes but as they work the hole upwards the further end is above the level of the water and of course lies dry in winter it has no air but what it receives below the ice as soon as this begins to melt it is often seen playing on the surface and basking in the sun it has a very sensible and flexible snout which it can turn into it is mouth and with which it digs up worms and leeches in marshy grounds on which it feeds muddling in water like a duck it is eyes are smaller than the moles if provoked it squeaks like a mouse and bites dangerously it is entrails when fresh have a strong sulphurous smell but the musky scent which proceeds from it is glands beneath the scaly skin of it is tail is more powerful than that of musk itself linnoeus has classed this animal in the genus of beavers but according to it is marks it is a true sorex  it must easily be conceived that so warm a district as samara is in the summer must swarm with insects the common gray and green lizards are here in such quantities that strike a bush and you will drive out numbers they bury in the ground under high grass and their holes have two entrances to each  among the insects i took notice of an uncommon large tarantula with which the environs of samara swarm these insects will make holes two feet perpendicularly in the solid ground where they lie all day and never quit them till night when they seek their prey though this insect very much resembles the apulian tarantula i never heard of any illeffects from it is bite and yet the peasants children frequently digging them from their holes to draw a kind of thread out of their skin are frequently bitten i was once bit myself and a casanian whom i employed to look for some was bit till he bled the wound swelled and was painful for two or three days but this was all  spanish flies are here caught in quantities during the month of may and supply all the apothecaries shops in this country indeed this district is very rich in curious insects and i never saw any where so many of the licekind called acarus reduvius and ricinus the bushes about samara are full of them and one cannot go into the fields without having ones clothes covered with them  among the remarkable things in the district of samara i must notice the bones of elephants and buffalos that are often fished out of the river or found upon it is banks i met with a buffalo horn which independent of the broken point and lower part weighed upwards of six pounds and it is greatest diameter was four paris inches  may   schelechmet the spring being now very favorable i pursued my way at the end of april to sysran about sixty miles distant in my way there i passed through the mordvine village schelechmet where i was present at a nuptial ceremony the most remarkable parts of which were as follow as soon as the bride returned from the church where she was married and from which she was brought back in a wagon with the bridemaid by her side and over which a large white linen sheet was spread she was taken by two friends of the bridegroom and conducted howling to the door of the bridegrooms house where she was greeted by all the neighboring females afterward came her mother with a roundbottomed pan full of dried hops which setting fire to with a match she placed at her daughters right foot and which the bride was immediately to kick away this is done three times each time the pan was filled with fresh hops and fired when she kicks the pan from her they attend particularly to the manner in which the pan is overturned as if it tumbles one way it is considered as portentive of dire disasters to the young couple if it falls another as ominous of future happiness it reeled about and settled with the hollow side upwards this is a token of goodluck and gave joy to the whole company who were pretty well intoxicated and called loudly for more beer which was brought them in a cup into which the bride threw some neat rings many of which she had upon her fingers and before she was suffered to enter the house this delayed much the succeeding ceremonies which i did not think worth while to wait for but i was told that prior to this a spoonful of thick stirabout made of oatmeal was to be distributed to each inhabitant of the village given them either in their hats or on a corner of their coats as most agreeable to the receiver  walofka    miles from samara at a village called walofka about fifteen miles from samara is an extensive tartarian fortress near half a mile in circumference with a treble ditch and bank but there are no buildings on it nor any vestiges of buildings but in ploughing the fields adjoining tartarian bricks are often found perhaps the remains of some hidden graves  the great road to syfran is over some high and open hills but under a species of cultivation their method of husbandry may appear odd to a stranger but what i relate i saw the countryman sows his oats millet and rye on a spot of wild lay land which he conceives not to want manure as if he destined it to be eaten by birds he then plows it and another horse following with a harrow but without a driver compleats the work thus one field after the other is sowed ploughed and harrowed by a single man and two horses in sowing wheat and barley they take a little more pains this being their festival food for they brew their beer with malt as we do and indeed it would not thrive by such a mode of husbandry if the field is very distant from the village the husbandman takes his provisions with him and continues day and night upon the ground till his land is all sown or he is called home by the solemnity of his sabbath on these hills is seen a kind of mouse mus talpinus that lives on certain roots which it seeks by throwing up the ground that covers them  may   on the fifth of may i went to see the wonderful rocky shore of the wolga in the neighborhood of kostytschi this village consisting of obout  00 houses and a wooden church is erected on the steep and rocky banks of this river between fifty and sixty feet higher than the water the wall of the river is near a mile in length and is formed of a yellowish limestone in which are a number of cavities and natural grottos from twenty to thirty feet deep producing a very beautiful effect these excavations can be ascribed only to the dashing waves of the wolga which wash away the earthy layers and excavate the stone itself higher up this rock strikes the beholder with the idea of a dreadful ruin the cliffs are inhabited by ringdoves crows and little birds of prey which do not quit their situation even in winter i found here a beautiful kind of waterwagtail motacilla leucomela no where to be met with but in this rock building it is nest in the cliffs in the waterdrains near this village is found a great deal of saltpeter  the stone of this rock is penetrated very generally with something like a pitchy substance which is certainly brought here by the water in a fluid state and settled it is black and shining and taken out in pieces that weigh many pounds it is very brittle and crumbling but of an inflammable nature and will burn in the candle like sealingwax indeed by an addition which takes away the roughness a beautiful sealingwax is made and i was informed that a merchant who formerly lived there obtained an imperial grant to manufacture sealingwax from it i was told also at samara that this jet with some other dug at tetjuschi was formerly conveyed to the sulphur manufactory at sernoi gorodok where they pressed from it an oil used in the artillery at present this mineral is applied to no other use than for smiths to blacken or lacquer their iron wares  sysran may   i reached sysran on the fifth of may at night the greatest part of this town is delightfully situated on a height which occupies the northern angle between the rivers krymsa and sysranka into which latter the former flows a small part of the town together with a well built cloister lies on the southern bank of the sysranka the rest which is meanly built lies on a flat along the krymsa here is a decayed wooden fortress a stonebuilt church and a courthouse but as the place is not well supplied few of the inhabitants are rich they apply themselves a good deal to gardening and have many orchards of apples they breed a good deal of poultry and with these the astracan swangoose this bird intermixes with the common goose and it is progeny will couple with themselves of course the breed is mixed the pure bastards partake of the nature of both the swangoose and common goose as to size shape and color and mixing further with common geese the young ones are of a blackish hue all their bills are red and bent and have sometimes a little prominence at the upper end  kaschpur   miles from sysran the boroughtown of kaschpur through which i passed is situated on a high hill upon an arm of the wolga this hill forms part of the wolgas left shore it is one of the most ancient russian habitations of this district and as far as is known was built before sysran it has three churches and belongs to the chancery of sysranka at the south end of this town are still remaining four decayed towers of the old fortress and at some little distance there is a watchtower in the middle of this town which lies open and scattered rises a very high chalk hill in form of a sugar loaf which can be seen at a great distance about this hill are some old dunghills mouldered into a rich black soil which by the addition of chalk produces a great deal of saltpeter i found whole tracts so wholly chrystalised with it that it looked on the ground like snow and i could have gathered it in handfuls indeed all the land round this place is so full of saltpeter that the cattle eat the very earth coal is also dug in this neighborhood  may  0 i intended to leave sysran on the  th but not being able to get horses on account of a festival on that day kept in commemoration of st nicolas i delayed my departure till the next day at noon the heat was insupportable but the flying clouds seemed to promise us some refreshing showers the air was like a furnace and the heat so intense that the mercury in the thermometer stood in the most airy and shady place at  0  on the   th of may it fell to    degrees and often in the sun to    degrees a heat so great that it was impossible to continue a minute in the sunshine all nature was languid and panting the soil on the black heath cracked above an ell deep and the apertures were some inches wide i left sysran about five in the evening for it was too sultry to travel in the day and the great swarms of oxflies tabanus bovinus and tropicus were very troublesome and tormenting to the horses while the sun was near the meridian but in this scorching weather i took notice that among the bushes on the wilds bloomed the common piony the fragrant and white dittany and some others  i was detained at the next village by a melancholy circumstance a gun that had been loaded to shoot wildgeese accidentally went off and shot my german servant in the hip shattering it very much humanity therefore required as he was mortally wounded that i should convey him to a place where he could have some assistance and as stawropal was not a great way off i sent him there by water upon the ussa and continued my route without him  at ussolie at the bottom of a mountain is a considerable saltwell which makes this district interesting the spot where the well stands is now overflown with water by an adjoining river but there is still to be seen some remains of the old works by which the salt water was conveyed into pits the principal people of this town in whose jurisdiction this well is ordered it to be filled up with rubbish but the water has puzzled it is way out again in several little veins betwixt the stones and deposes a whitish sulphurous sediment this water has a nitrous appearance and a strong sulphurous smell there are one or two more of these wells at a little distance from the first and certainly issuing from the same mountain  in the course of our journey onward we passed some bare hills where a great number of marmots were every where seen sitting at the entrance of their habitations or holes hissing as if they meant to insult the passengers as they rode by when we came to the village scwrjukowa which takes it is name as is often customary among the tartars and people of tschuwa from him who erected for himself the first dwelling there and is now inhabited by the unconverted people of tschuwa the peasants were preparing a great sacrifice for the next day to solicit heaven in their way for a fertile rain on account of our arrival it was postponed and however desirous i was to be present at such a solemnity i did not find myself disposed to urge them to a compliance contrary to their inclinations  may   d on the   d of may i returned to samara and professor falk with me his design was to have taken another route but not finding himself well he thought stopping at samara for a few days might recover him i must not omit mentioning here the gypsophila panicula which was now in bloom this plant grows upon the heaths and toward autumn when it begins to fade forms itself into a round ball which is often broke from the stem by a gust of wind and rolling over the waste often frightens the horses of travelers  in the neighborhood of samara is a place to which the sulphur works have been removed from the district of sergiesk and consisted of the manufactory a wooden comptinghouse and about forty dwellinghouses spread out in form of a street along the high shore of the wolga in which dwelt the workmen but as these works have been discontinued and the workmen are removed only twelve huts are remaining this sulphur manufactory was subject to the woiwods or magistrates at samara till the year    0 when it was granted to major iwan molostof who was the proprietor to      when the whole was granted to one iwan martof a merchant of petersburgh whose son ceased working them for five years and then deserted them in this manufactory twentytwo superintendants and     workmen chiefly from sergiessk were employed these men relieved each other every month so that about   0 worked at one time the annual produce of this manufactory was full  0000lb of brimstone and might easily have been increased to  0000lb thirtysix pounds weight stands the proprietor in from fifty to eighty copeks  00 copeks are in value  s  d english and conveying it to moscow in winter with hired horses costs him twelve copeks for   lb  the loss of this sulphurmanufactory to the state cannot be enough lamented for as there is plenty of firewood in the place was it properly conducted it might turn out to advantage the buildings of the present works are a melting and refininghouse the meltinghouse is about   0 feet long and contained    brick furnaces some of which now are in ruins the brimstone ore being first bruised is melted in these furnaces in earthen pots from which the pure sulphur is suffered to run into receivingvessels below placed in wooden troughs filled with water in order to refine it it is melted again in ovens and afterward poured into moulds standing in a trough of water when this manufactory was first set on foot the furnaces had no chimnies the consequence of which was that many of the workmen died of slow fevers and consumptions but this is not the case now  the famous mountain in which sulphur is found in masses rises almost perpendicularly from the shore of the wolga opposite the mouth of the river sok or soka to a height of  00 feet the limemountains near it are still higher and the valley between them is covered with wood with villages interspersed the cold in this valley is uncommonly great even in summertime which induces the fishermen who are employed on the river wolga to lodge here at night in order to avoid the flies which dare not venture into this cold air i have been told by some casanians of gurjef that going from the mouth of the river yaik or jaik for the jod j in russia is pronounced like a y along the coast of the caspian sea to astrabal there is at a place called pristan between tukkaragan and tjutkaragan a deep valley between the mountains where these very casanians who were sent from on board to fetch water could not on account of the insupportable cold stand it but were obliged to return to their ship without their errand  in order to ascend this sulphurous mountain which is covered with underwood i was in many places obliged to creep upon my knees no path having been cleared away and it was so exceedingly steep that i was often forced to climb my way it is inconceivable that after working many years here the people have not opened a horseway and rendered the path up it easy by gentle windings in which case they might bring the sulphur down on horses whereas it is now attended with a great deal of labor the men carrying down the stone in masses of  00 pounds weight upon their shoulders and yet though the way up and down is steep and rocky and dangerous to a person passing it without a load i did not hear of any accident happening to the men the sulphur in this mountain lies very deep there is one opening on the top above  0 feet wide and upwards of  0 feet deep they have worked ten years in this pit and the sulphur vein does not seem near exhausted other parts of the mountain consist of limestone stucco and muscovy talc there are springs on it uncommonly sulphurous but clear and ice and snow dwell here the whole year of the underwood growing on it i saw the russian planetree the buckthorn rhamnus catharticus and alpinus and the following plants the hellebore helleborine in quantities the ladys slipper calceolus the windflower centaurea moschata the laserwort laserpitium trilobum the agaric amanta cervaria the chichling vetch lathyris and the vetch vicia pisiformis and also the stock gillyflower cheiranthus erysimoides upon the latter were great swarms of beautiful insects and butterflies the stalks of the cervaria sent forth here a sweet aromatic gum that melted in the mouth which they did not do in any other part of the heath  samara may  0 the weather was now warm and the oxfly very troublesome here were such swarms also of a kind of gnat that often darkened the sky and bit us so deep as to leave the wounds bleeding the inhabitants have no other method of defending their faces from this pernicious insect than by drawing over their head a large netcap soaked in birchoil every person that goes out of town provides himself with such a cap though this insect bites till the blood runs it happily gives no pain on cattle and on birds it gets in among the hair and feathers and runs about like a louse this insect called the moskara leaves them about the end of june but another very troublesome one comes in it is room this is a kind of wasp almost invisible tipula solstitialis which does not sting but flys about in such swarms that a person cannot stand still a moment without having his mouth nose and eyes full of them they call this insect kochra and defend themselves from it by large nets greased with hogslard here also grows in bushy places the campion lychnis chalcedonica which the common people call cuckowsoap and use it to wash their hands and linen  i sent part of my attendants on before me with the heavy baggage from samara across the kalmuc wastes to the river jaik stopping to take a further view of this district myself before i left it i followed them however on the   th of june but before i had got half way to the place i ordered them to a new accident interrupted my progress the wagon in which some persons i had taken as companions rode was overthrown from a height and two of my people were hurt one was exceedingly bruised on the hip and my waggoner had his right hand shattered i sent these men back to samara and proceeded with the rest to orenburg passing through alexieffkoi inhabited by invalid soldiers and casanian tradesmen and farmers from this place to the town of kasakian the road lies straight but there are no regular wayhouses for accommodation a few cottages only excepted scattered here and there but where we could get hay and water the summerroad to orenburg from alexieffkoi is over the hilly or left side of the river samara but in winter between the samara and kinel through alternate valleys and hills for the space of seventy miles i went the winterroad and fancy can scarce paint a prettier district the most beautiful woods of asps and birch relieved by turns with green hills and luxuriant meadows no country surely deserves cultivation more than along the river samara there being plenty of arable land no want of wood and great extent of very rich and beautiful meadow here are a great many wild roedeer without tails cervus pygargus and elks which rove about as far as the river samara  the elk in winter mostly feeds on the young twigs and the bark of the asp and poplartrees but in summertime seeks it is protection and nourishment in the steps or uninhabited wastes the roe is more found on the hilly districts the wind carrying off the snow quicker in winter than in the lowgrounds and thus giving it an opportunity to feed more plentifully the cossacks kill a great deal of this game and the chief season of hunting it is in march the sun then having sufficient power to melt the surface of the snow into a crust on which they can more readily come up with them in their snowscates a contrivance used by the laplanders also whereas the feet of these animals break through the snow as they run and are thereby impeded in their course they are tracked and driven into valleys where the snow lies many feet deep and are thus brought within reach of a gun or are more closely pursued and killed with a lance the roe being a tenderfooted animal cannot run far but the elk which is hunted by dogs will often kill a dog by a kick the roebuck throws off his heavy horns in november after rutting time and gets new ones in spring the female roe commonly brings forth two young ones about the month of april her horns are nearly like those of the buck only more grown in spring but are yet rough and soft their skins are sold very cheap the skin of the elk is worth about  s  d and their meat fetches but a low price  besides the above animals they have farther along the samara great plenty of very fine ermines and a middlesized marten with a bright yellow neck there are also upon the steps or wilds some few beavers or otters as also foxes and those cossacks who are fond of hunting will in autumn lie for some time abroad on these steps to watch for them foxes are less valuable the further south they are found up the samara till they degenerate into those gray step foxes which the kirguisians bring here to barter or truck with the kalmucks the squirrel is rarely seen here but is much sought after on account of it is fur which is of a whitish color  the country along the river kinel is pleasant and varied the large village tscherask has been built since the year      by a colony from little russia who had formerly erected many dwelling places on spots about the boundary at the river jaik but were often plundered by kirguisian robbers the inhabitants of this new flourishing place live after their own country fashion they have neat houses with chimnies good ovens apply themselves chiefly to the cultivation of tobacco and breeding of cattle and live in abundant sprightliness and freedom they are governed by an officer chosen from among themselves and confirmed by the regency of stawropal whom they call ataman and who has an assistant under him called jessaul their dress is like that of the kossacks or polanders the women wear nothing in summer but a shirt worked in the neck with needle work and instead of a petticoat they wear round the waist a piece of calimanco plaided with various colors and woven by themselves very much like the scotch played they wear on the head small caps of varied colored stuff bound on with strings whose ends are worked with the needle and hang down behind girls let not their hair hang down as do the russians but braid it into tresses wind it round their heads and bind it in front with a partycolored band ornamented with coral beads etc their method of courting is not exactly like that of the highlanders of friesland but very similar to it and they have many ceremonies similar to those of the tartars a courtship continues about two years during the first year of which the young man is not suffered even to touch his sweetheart on the day of marriage a kind of flag is carried after the bride on her return from church made of black or red stuff as the bridegroom shall think proper and which he makes choice of to acquaint the world with her conduct it being a signal to say whether she has acted to his liking or not during the last year of their courtship when he is entitled to take more liberties  for the purpose of sheltering and feeding their cattle they erect sheds or stalls here and there on the wastes their chief breed is horned cattle and they generally plough their land with oxen though many of the farmers possess from twenty to thirty horses their flocks of sheep are numerous many keep to to the number of four hundred but they do not consider their wool as the best it being rather long and coarse they do not suffer the ram to be with the ewes till after st petersday which in the russian calendar is at the end of june a good custom to prevent the lambs being dropped too early they are careful to keep their cattle clean and spread hay beneath the sheep in stalls to prevent any injury to the wool which will fetch twelve or thirteen shillings a pud that is   lb they never have any murrain among their cattle the only distemper is a kind of itch which they cure with tobacco water and as a remedy for maggots in sheep they use the agrimony  the cultivation of tobacco is the employment of the women who sow also large quantities of vegetables for their own use but want of rain this year had destroyed not only their gardenstuff but all sorts of corn  from the middle of june to the middle of july women and children are busied before harvest in gathering that kind of cochineal called coccus polonicus they find this insect chiefly on dry barren soils about the root of the common strawberry and the cinquefoil potentilla reptans in little russia they are said to collect them from a plant called smolka which according to the common opinion is the st johns wort they cut out these plants with a knife and open the little blue blisters which hang on the uppermost part of the plant in which the insect is said to be contained there are two or three such blisters on a plant the insect comes to perfection sooner or later in the month of june and in july creeps out this plant is well known to the women but they prefer the insect when it is just ready to leave the plant in preference to those in a less perfect state as it yields a better and a brighter color there is a saying among them that all the eloped insects of a whole district assemble themselves on one bush on a certain day and that those who go out earliest in the morning on the casanian feast day june  th will surely meet with them the cochineal when gathered is cleared through a sieve from the earth that hangs about it dried in a pan over a slow fire or in an oven and then put away in some dry place owing to the great trouble in collecting them they never search for more than they want for their own use in order to dye their girdles or some woollen yarn which they use as an ornament to their dress they soak this yarn twentyfour hours in a very sour decoction in which alum is mixed letting it stand all this time in an oven after this it is wrung and dyed this done the cochineal is bruised in a pot boiled up with water and when all the color is extracted it is strained and the yarn boiled in it with one handful of cochineal they dye about a pound weight of wool but this color does not look better than that prepared from the marjoram origanum it is preferred only because it fades less  in this high and wild country there are marmotes in plenty many bears inhabiting the bushy vales bustards and cranes and in the rivers tortoises  on the boundary of samara there are several forts each garrisoned with about thirty invalids and inhabited by cossacks with some pieces of iron ordnance at one of the forts that of busuluzkaja situated near the brook of the same name the commandingofficer of the line or boundary has a very good house and the houses of the cossacks and soldiers form four cross streets as they do in the other forts the church standing in the center in a kind of square among the cossacks here settled are many tartars who hunt the mountains and deserts and kill wild horses for food these are not the natural produce of the country but the progeny of some tame horses that have run away from their owners they perfectly resemble the horses of little russia except that their heads are thicker the ears more pointed and the nose short upstanding manes and short tails the most common color is a fallow brown though there are some gray and some of a deep brown but no piebald or black they go about in herds from five to twenty consisting of mares colts and one stallion when the stallioncolts grow big the old horse drives them from the herd and they are seen to follow the herd at a distance till they are old and strong enough to become the sire of a herd themselves they are said to scent a man at the distance of near a mile if the wind sets in their favor and will fly from their pursuer but in summertime when they are tormented by the flies they are easily caught they catch wild stallions by leading out a mare which entices them within shot in the fort where i was they had a wild colt but he being too fierce to be broke in they got rid of him he seemed to me to have uncommon strength  there were formerly in this district a great many beavers otters and wildboars but they have been extirpated by the cossacks who are great hunters badgers there are in plenty bears and elks last spring the country was overrun with antilopes though this animal had not been seen here for many years before the dryness of the season having brought them here in large herds or flocks from the southern parts they ventured even into the low grounds and meadows as this animal casts it is young in the beginning of may we saw some young ones and like lambs found they were scarce able to walk for some days after they were dropped some of these have been taken brought up with milk and rendered so tame as to follow their owner about like a dog answer to a name and swim through waters after him as they grow older they will search for their food near the house where they have been fed and if suffered to go at large will not wander far from the village but return at night i could not have believed this had i not been an eyewitness of the fact these tamebred antilopes which resemble a shegoat are not in the least afraid of dogs nor will dogs molest them any more than other domestic animals their flesh if not above one year old would be preferable to that of the roe if it did not smell so strong of wormwood which is their favorite food yet this scent when the meat is roasted and cold goes off the old ones are very disgustful on account of their backs being covered with sores arising from maggots almost as thick as ones finger deposited in their skin in an embryo state by a peculiar species of fly oestrus antilopum so that there is scarce a spot to be found on their backs which is not infected  the mountains in this district are frequented by abundance of eagles and other birds of prey i saw here the yellowheaded black eagle the country people will often take the eagles from their nests built on high trees bring them up and sell them to the kirguisians at a very good price here is also a very rare bird pratincola cram which feeds upon grasshoppers and other insects when they soar they make a shrilling noise some have ridiculously thought this bird a species of swallow but there is in reality no pretense for this his bill is like that of the cuckoo he has a white stripe from the eye about the throat and his flight and flying features are like those of the seaswallow sterna but his feet like that of the curlew  here are many tumuli throughout this country but not raised very high above the ground some cossacks who make it their business to open these graves assured me they found some uncommonly large human bones in them for example a shinbone that set up against the leg of a fullgrown person reached higher than the knee it is said that a kalmuck once out on a shooting party found laying in one of these tumuli a transparent wellpolished stone set in silver which was sold by a third person into whose hands it fell for above  00 rubles each ruble  s  d english all the arrows arms and other instruments found in these graves are made of copper sometimes they find gold and one of the cossacks of tozkaja found upon a corpse a few years since a golden neckring  sorotschinskaja is of all the forts erected on the samarian line or boundary the most considerable and best inhabited it has a ditch and a breastwork with chevauxdefrize in a regular form with some wooden towers besides many good houses belonging to the cossacks the commanding officer has a hotel and here is also a courthouse the commanderinchief of the whole samarian line dwelt here formerly these last two buildings and a wooden church stand in the square and open part of the fort and here is a good bridge built over the samara the river is very inconsiderable and is so shallow and serpentine that it is scarcely conceivable how barges could come up to this fortress from orenburg and that they did is incontestible from the many anchors found here  in my way on at one of the redoubts i was told i had passed a tumulus recently opened on which there stood erected a stone having the face of a man cut on it and another lying with the shape of a man engraved on it this intelligence excited my curiosity and made me desirous of examining further into it i therefore procured a number of workmen with proper tools and went to this place at the distance of    miles on the  0th of june  the opened tumulus on which the stones had lain is one of the most considerable ones in the whole district is near the river samara and just opposite the highest of all the mountains seen on the opposite side of the water they had dug to the depth of ten feet and a half which was the exact height the hill was raised from the ground and it is said they found in it some valuable things i found myself in the ground that was thrown up a little piece of polished and carved motherofpearl which seemed not the least decayed and i found also a great many human and marmot bones within the cave was laid a large flat rockstone which probably had covered the body the stone which i was told lay on the surface and on which was engraved or cut the complete figure of a man was broken into small pieces and from what i could see of it appeared to be of a very soft sandy nature of which a great variety is dug from an adjacent mountain but the other stone which stood at the east end upright is a hard and nearly triangular flat piece of rock about four spans and a half in height and it is upper angle apparently bearing some rough touches of a chizel shaping out the face of a man  in these tumuli are found bad ironwork points of arrows and steels to strike fire with and in some heads of horses they told me that the largest tumuli contain no valuable articles such things being only found in the smaller ones the reason perhaps is that the smaller tumuli were the graves of women to whom some ornaments were sacrificed whereas the higher tumuli seem either to have belonged to the tartars of nagaja or to the kirguisians as their present tombs much resemble these but those that are lined with brick as many are probably belonged to some older nation  about thirtysix miles short of orenburg is the fortress talistschewa situated on a considerable height where the river kamysch samara falls into the jaik it is a regular square walled with timber with chevauxdefrize and wooden batteries and a double church one for the summer and a smaller one with fireplaces for the winter garrisoned by a party of dragoons and settled by cossacks here are good houses belonging to the officers and about  00 wooden dwellings consequently next to orenburg this may be considered as one of the greatest and most populous places of the jaikian line here reside also the officers of the troops quartered in other forts and the commandersinchief of the district i saw the troops exercised and was present at some of their amusements in company with the commanding officer the kalmucks entertained us first with a concert in their own way a tolerable good voice sung various kalmuc lovesongs consisting of distorted and mournful tones and dissonances two others accompanied the voice one with a turkish rebeck with four strings the other with a remarkable kind of flute made of the dry and hollow stalk of the american sunflower umbellata covered with a gut it had three holes at the small end which were stopped occasionally with three fingers of one hand whilst the other hand according to the tune stopped the bottom of the flute or pipe the upperend or orifice without any mouthpiece is applied to the upper teeth and closed between the upper lip and the tongue it requires an extraordinary exertion of the voice to produce sounds upon such a pipe but in the hands of a good player it resembles a fife the kalmucks call it zurr the tartars kurah and the cossacks of jaik who also make use of it give it the name of tschibuisga the rebeck is called biwa by the kalmucks and has no other bottom than a hollow wooden cylinder over which is stretched a dried bladder as parchment over a drum on this a bridge is fixed and over this four lengths of catgut are strained on a long handle it is played with a bow on which two rows of horsehair are strained these pass through the strings in such a manner as to sound two in unison at the same draw of the bow besides the above instruments the kalmucks have a twostringed baseviol a harp like a dulcimer and a large jewsharp which make up their base  next several couples of young lads gave us a specimen of their art in wrestling when at this sport they tuck up their underrobes round their waist and strive to throw each other down and are very clever at this exercise they then shot at a mark with arrows and next into the air and concluded their diversions with a game at chess wherein they followed all the customary rules except advancing at the beginning with three men instead of one  the baskirs could amuse us only with arrowshooting and tartarian dances but what was remarkable a man hoary with age and having only two teeth in his mouth played very masterly on the abovementioned flute and was even so expert as to play two tunes at once the songs of the tartars compared with kalmuck melody were as the italian music is to the french and expressed generally something warlike and manly the tartarian dances consist in a transposition of the feet and some very voluptuous attitudes and motions of the body and limbs accompanied with hissing and clapping of hands  here i met with a plant which i never saw any description of nor ever met with any where else the prenanthes hispida the pheasant is a bird not uncommon here and it is feathers are worn as an ornament in the cap  june  0 on the  0th of june i pursued my journey to orenburg and was obliged to be escorted by relieves of cossacks or some other light troops from post to post to be safe against the kirguisian plunderers and it was at this season the more necessary because for want of sufficient pasture at home they had brought their cattle to pasture here and had taken up their quarters in this district  on the first of july i had about twelve miles to travel to orenburg and set out for that place in the morning the description of this beautiful city and it is environs and also of it is public buildings has been so amply and ably set forth already that was i to say any thing of it i should only be a copyist i will however venture to say from myself that the situation of this place is very advantageous for asiatic commerce they endeavor to make it the center of it and it is perfectly adapted to that end and to be the residence of wealthy merchants and the establishment of such manufactures as the eastern nations are most in want of was such a plan set on foot orenburg would incontestibly become one of the most flourishing and important provincial cities of the whole russian empire yet the profitable trade of this place is chiefly carried on by adventurers from the most distant parts of the empire who after having bartered their goods or sold them return with their gain to their respective countries these people come annually in great caravans bringing with them foreign goods of all kinds which this place itself and it is environs would produce if manufactories were erected and properly conducted  the trade of this city consists now in the sale of all sorts of woollen cloths especially red and scarlet velvet blue and white linens hides copper and iron kettles chiefly brought here from the most distant manufactories of siberia all sorts of ornaments for dress of tin and iron needles thimbles glass and coral beads and other little matters requisite for clothing and for the harness of horses also all materials for dying such as indigo woad cochineal alum vitriol likewise sugar and some kinds of furs particularly beaver and otter fur besides these things the kirguisians purchase of the russian merchants a great deal of cotton stuffs and barter it to the bucharians for furs of course the cottonmanufactories of this country are very profitable and bring in a large revenue to the empire though the russians purchase the materials of which the cotton is made of the bucharians and the people of chiwinza i am well assured that there are many districts in the southern parts of russia where the cottonplant thrives well and it might therefore be an inland production it has not indeed thriven in the districts of orenburg and the sakmara the tartars having made an unsuccessful trial of it but this is owing to the great change from heat to cold occasioned by the adjacent mountains to the poorness of the soil and the dryness of the land were such attempts made on the rivers samara motscha irgis and some of the lower districts of the wolga they would be attended with success  the principal articles which the asiatic merchants who come here in caravans barter for the abovementioned goods are gold and silver chiefly in persian coin and rupees golddust some lapislazuli rubies and other precious stones also a great deal of raw and spun cotton a kind of finer indian callico than what is general readymade gowns of various goodness black and gray fine bucharian lambskins which are sold at a great price two kinds of wild catskins spotted like a tygers tigers skins etc sometimes the bucharians will bring lumps of saltpetre which is found in masses in such parts of their country as were the site of old towns and burialplaces their commerce now in raw silk is very low and all kind of finer indian merchandise is brought but sparingly either because there are not sufficient buyers among the russian merchants or because the bucharians as they themselves acknowledge could not get such a price for them as would be adequate to the expense of bringing them it is also to be considered that the northern part of india does not produce such rich articles as are manufactured in the warmer climes which lie near the indian ocean so that were the bucharians ever so willing to bring them they could not expect to rival the seatrade in such kind of merchandise  but among the bucharian trafic i must not omit to mention such articles as relate to natural history  they bring then several fruits of their own country as dried wild apricots and peaches a kind of small currants which have either a very large kernel or none at all nuts of the species of the beechtree wormseed which they say they get from india and which if thrown into canals in gardens and plantations will destroy particular worms and catipillars they bring also seed of melons watermelons and wild bucharian barley holcus saccharatus  there is no branch of the bucharian trade more important or any that would turn out more advantageous to the state by increasing the russian manufactories than the importation of rawgoods among which the silktrade has been but little encouraged camels hair would be another rich article of commerce as it might not only be manufactured at home but be exported and it can be purchased of the kalmucks and kirguisians at the cheap rate from two shillings english to eleven shillings for    pounds weight  bartering with the kirguisians for cattle is also a lucrative branch of commerce scarce a year passes but they sell to the number of from  0 to  0000 sheep and about  0000 horses the latter are conveyed into russia but the sheep are mostly killed in and about orenburg and the towns situated on the wolga the fat is transported to the seaports of the empire where it is sold for very little money under the denomination of russian tallow mutton therefore is to be had at orenburg in the summertime for little or nothing as the dealers are contented with the gain they get from the fat of the tail only of a kirguisian sheep which weighs sometimes about    pounds and after being melted down will yield thirty pounds and upwards of tallow  besides this great quantity of large and small cattle the kirguisians bring to market a great number of common furs wolvesskins foxes wildcat skins and many slunk lambskins the kirguisians also sell great variety of feltcovers and carpets which they make of sheepswool elegant and of various colors as these people are but little skilled in commerce they truck them away for russian commodities of small value though they are now daily improving in cunning and prudence  there is brought to market at orenburg the gold eagle falco chrysatus of which the kirguifians are very fond purchasing them for hunting of wolves foxes and antelopes there is a certain token in the motion of this bird by which they judge of it is goodness and docility for they are not all adapted to the chase a kirguisian will sometimes give an excellent horse for one of these birds when for another he would not give even a sheepskin which among them is one of their smallest coins to judge then of a gold eagle they will often sit a great while looking at it i must also mention that the kalmucks and baschirs breed a great many camels which they sell at orenburg to the bucharians who commonly leave this city with much greater loads than they bring the bucharians bring their goods on the backs of little asses and afterward try to dispose of them but the people here do not like them nor has this animal or the mule been ever bred in russia  july   on the  d of july i had the pleasure of going to and inspecting the saltworks of ilezkaja  0 miles off in company with his excellency major general reinsdorff the present governor of orenburg escorted with a strong guard of cossacks relieved from post to post to go to this place we cross a bridge of boats which connects the city of orenburg with the great and well built marketplace all the heath from orenburg for a distance of    miles had been wantonly fired by the kirguisians which is too often done in this wild country and prevented me finding even a single root of that curious plant which has been described by dr rinder and named from him  these saltworks have a small fortress to defend them garrisoned by cossacks the town is inhabited by thirty superintendants over an exiled people by whom rocksalt is here dug at the expense of the crown there is one captain who presides over the works and another who commands the fort  about   0 feet southeast of this fort rises a bare and white stucco mountain in form of a sugar loaf full of clefts and is called the watchmountain from having a guard of soldiers stationed on the top of it commanding a view over a considerable part of the country on the top is a cleft which once was very deep but is now partly filled up the kirguisians consider this mountain as divine and used formerly to throw various furs and other trifles into the cleft by way of vow or sacrifice even to this day they come round the hill at certain times in solemn procession and say their prayers kneeling having first bathed and cleaned themselves in the adjacent pools it is related that before the pit or cleft was filled up some covetous person in hopes of finding treasure made a descent into it and found the cold insupportable  between the watchmountain and the fort lies the saltvein it is greatest diameter is about  00 fathoms each fathom seven feet english and the cross diameter   0 to get at the rocksalt they dig sometimes three or four fathoms deep but in some places it lies so high that we may touch the solid salt with a dagger or a ramrod there are a great many freshwater springs about this place which seem to run all to this saltrock and in such quantities as sometimes to interrupt the working it  saltmines the nature both of the salt and the ground which covers it may be best seen in that large and open mine where they are digging at present and have so done for many years past this mine downwards from the watchmountain including all it is windings is about  00 fathoms the pit or open part at top is now above sixty fathoms long and in some places from nine to ten fathoms broad and the salt has been dug out in places to the depth of three fathoms but by the orders of general reinsdorff they are now going deeper they had no method of lading out the water from this mine but by pails his excellency has however had a depending part dug and the water is from thence worked out by a machine  the present method of digging the salt is as follows they first dig narrow crossdrains with pickaxes to a certain depth so as to leave a block of salt about an ell broad and an ell and a half to two fathoms long between the channels and this block is raised by levers wedges and breakers  over the pure and solid rocksalt in it is whole extent is nothing but a miry land consisting of a coarse yellow quicksand lying in heaps from two to three fathoms high near the bed of salt the sand is penetrated with salt water and if dried becomes hard as stone the vein of salt does not seem to lie horizontally but to wave being in some places deeper in others shallower  how deep these mines run is not known with any certainty they are working now only on the surface the mountainborer which i directed to be applied but with great labor could not be worked down more than half an ell a day into the solid rock it has been pierced in autumn to the depth of rather better than twenty else but it could be bored no farther being stopped by a black impenetrable stone in a shaft at some little distance from the great saltpit they met with a blackish marle at the depth of three fathoms so solid that it could not be removed with spades  the salt is generally very pure solid and of a white color and breaks when knocked to pieces in little square lumps like dice it dissolves in water rather slower than sea salt but has been found not so strong to salt meat with some masses of about   lb weight are here and there found as clear and transparent as crystal and capable of being worked into boxes and other toys  here are a great many saltpools near this spot in which the kirguisians occasionally bathe for the cure of certain disorders the water is so powerful that a man who goes into it breasthigh is lifted up and lies upon the surface like a plank it is a common saying that the water in these pits is at certain times during the cold weather in autumn cold on the surface but near the bottom so warm and sometimes so hot as not to bear the hand in it but i could find no difference in any i felt which during cloudy and cool weather was five degrees colder than the air if this report be true i should suppose that the salt crust covering the bottom of the pool attracts the suns heat like a burningglass and thus renders the water near it hot admitting this to be the case the reason why i could discover no difference was that the sun had not shone when i was there for several days i dont know of any reason more probable  the most common plant growing here is the saltwort salicornia herbacea which being pickled with spice and vinegar is a very palatable sauce the plantain plantago salsa growing on this land takes on a very pale redcolour and is very salt to the taste i should suppose that from this and other saltplants the salt alkali soda might be prepared but in a chemical process on the saltwort at orenburg it was found to contain too much culinary salt sixty or seventy pound weight of this plant dried yielded twenty pounds of saltashes i shall show hereafter that the russians prepare and export great quantities of alkali but yet none from this plant  the salt of ilezkaja is mostly dug in summertime the workmen are paid at the rate of half a copec for   lb weight there were now laying before the pit many ton weight of salt ready to be conveyed away winter is the season of transporting it which is done by the baskirs and vagaband peasants who have wandered from different provinces of the empire and are settled in the district of orenburg the price of transport from the mine to the saltoffice at the river aschkader is paid at the rate of six copecs or about  d english per pud each pud   lb english thence it is conveyed in barges on the rivers belaja kama and wolga in this way did they transport throughout the empire in the course of the last year above a million of puds and the quantity conveyed away must have been considerably increased since that time by the present welldirected regulations two new saltoffices having been erected one upon the river ik and the other on the samara  before i leave this remarkable spot i must mention that notwithstanding the saltness of the soil in one of the gardens here not only diverse sorts of vegetables seemed to thrive well but the tobacco plant raised from virginia seed came on well and had a fine smell which leaves not the least doubt but that tobacco might be raised with great success on the salt heaths between the rivers jaik and wolga it ought also to be noticed that even in this salt district as also upon the whole southern step or heath about the river jaik the garden tulip tulipa gesneri with yellow and red cups is every where seen they are rather smaller than our european ones yet have been known to increase in their size considerably by removing them into good garden soil  before i quit orenburg i will take notice of a neighboring coppermine though i did not see it myself i am able to describe it from the accounts i received this mine is not far from orenburg and formerly belonged to count alexander schuwalof who has since sold it with some other lands etc it has not for eight years been worked any thing worth mentioning to protect the workmen from the kirguisians on one of whose heaths it stands the place is defended by an intrenchment and guarded by some ordnance and a company of soldiers this discovery was made some years back in the old shafts scattered about the mountain upon all the uralian mountains are many such old shafts or pits seen which have been undoubtedly made in former times by some industrious miners but unknown to us the most considerable mines in the district of orenburg owe their discovery to old vestiges of these miners which consist of round pits and deep subterraneous passages some of them so narrow that they must have had much trouble to work in them in many they could not stand upright near saigatschi rudnik several pits have been found and a streamwork uncommonly spacious and in very good state on clearing it out they discovered some cakes of melted copper and some round pots of white clay in which they melted the ore also some bones of workmen on whom the ground had fallen in but not the least traces of a hearth or furnace in some of these old spots they have found a beautiful green and clear copperas  the stone in which the ore lies in a very compact green mass is yellow soft coarse and sandy and above the ore lie broken layers of soft red marble but the most curious circumstance is that near the ore in the sandstone is almost every where small and large pieces of trunks of trees petrified into a kind of rock that rings when struck with a steel and gives fire like a flint some of these petrifactions are brown and seem to be pieces of linden and other trees and encrusted with verdigrease and blue vitriol  however rare such woodpetrifactions are in other districts yet the ores dug in the southern districts of the uralian mountains abound with them all the mines along the middle part of the river jaik both on the russian and kirguisian side and those near the rivulets and brooks that flow into the samara are more or less crowded with such petrified pieces of wood and sooty pieces of sprays resembling charcoal they often find huge trunks with some of their roots and branches in the winter      i sent from orenburg to the museum of natural history at petersburgh a piece of root which had lain several years in this city and was larger than could be compassed by the arms it belonged to a trunk near seventy feet long it is back was changed into a rich copper ore having been found in the mine abovementioned with another laying across it underneath a layer of black ground  along the line of the jaik are wooden redoubts erected at certain distances and in the midway between each is a guard station and a pyramid erected on some high ground with wreaths of pitched cords and other inflammable materials wound round them which are occasionally set fire to as a signal to the adjacent guardstation when the plundering and rapacious kirguisians have made any incursion or committed any depredation  we here met with a chiwian caravan consisting of thirty camels which for want of food in this parched country were scarce able to walk those used by the asiatic caravans are mostly two bunched camels or dromedaries those with one bunch on their back are seldom used for this purpose they pass a cord through the bridge of their noses and during their march tie one to the tail of another the goods hanging in large bales on both sides on wooden packsaddles each load is wrapped in a coarse cotton stuff tied with cotton strings and to shelter it from the weather is covered with felts tied on with hairropes for riding and the carriage of provisions they use asses not unlike european ones  on one of these mountains in this district is dug talc in sheets which are fit for window lights but it is never found in pieces above a yard square and as it is not genuine isingglass or talc but only a gypseous spathum which does not split pure and fine is destitute of the other properties of genuine talc it does not deserve much attention this mountain was surveyed in      by a landsurveyor sent from the mineoffice at orenburg who has fixed it is distance at about four miles from the fortress sheltoi erected upon the samara  the brooks in the vicinage of these mountains swell so much in spring from the abundance of snowwater that one sees whole trees drawn up by the roots and lying about in them on some of these mountains is found a great deal of jasper some of a palegreen color and some flaming red on one the fortress orskaja is erected about half a mile from the mouth of the river or in it is center stands a pretty stonebuilt church which may be seen on all sides from far near it stands the uncommonly wellsituated observatory erected by lieutenant euler to observe the transit of venus over the sun round about the hill are dwellinghouses but none tolerable except that of the commandingofficer who is a lieutenant general the asiatic caravans which go to orenburg cross the river jaik at this part of the russianboundary here their goods are sealed up and they can sell only as much as will enable them to hire wagons to carry their merchandise on in case they should knock up their camels  the mountain on which this fort stands consists entirely of jasper the stone on the surface is rough and rocky but the deeper the more fine and beautiful is the color a very pleasing pale seagreen and a deep brownred some is white some gray and a great deal of it is black with flamecoloured veins and spots it has been often dug into by miners sent from the petersburgh manufactory at catherineburgh and i am persuaded was it properly done by regular shafts it would produce beautiful plates of jasper by examining into the nature and mixture of these jaspers it cannot be doubted but that they were formerly a soft variedcoloured loam now petrified on the uppermost parts of this mountain is nothing to be seen but a milkwhite quartz scarcely covered with earth on the summit of all the mountains in this chain along the jaik are kirguisian tumuli consisting of the best jasper great pains have been taken to select such a heap of jasperstone as form these graves which rise considerably from the ground  july    i visited this chain of mountains about the middle of july the valleys have a saltish soil and lead one to suppose that the salts which are derived from the burning of the heath and the urine of the cattle afterward washed down into the vales by the rain and snow are additional causes of the many salt spots found in the southern steps though it is past a doubt that the strongest of them originate from some hidden and subterraneous sources for there is no district in the known world that can boast of such an abundance of mineral salt as the southern parts of russia siberia and the vast extent of tartary  the line of forts all along the river jaik were erected to defend the interior provinces of russia from the incursions of the kirgese these forts are seldom garrisoned with more than a company of soldiers from twenty to thirty in number for though the kirguisians are very fond of plunder they do not like the arabs make their inroads in large bodies but in small gangs and show but little courage  jaizkoi kasatschei gorodok july    in tracing the river jaik i reached jaizkoi gorodok the chief city of the jaikian cossacks on the   th of july this place is situated according to the observations made by lieutenant euler in my presence in north latitude    degrees  0 min    sec at the banks between which once flowed the jaik whose course is now more eastern and straight the district about the city is elevated and tolerably even the city is very irregularly built in form of a crescent in one part it is encompassed with a breastwork supported with chevauxdefrize and a ditch and is furnished with some pieces of ordnance but is open to the river jaik being on that side safe enough the number of wooden dwellinghouses which are chiefly built according to the old russian fashion but large and spacious amounts to about  000 they are in general divided into narrow streets and built very close together the principal street which crosses the wholecity from the side toward orenburg to the river tschagan is very crooked and irregular but it is wide and ornamented with the best houses near this street stands a good stonebuilt church and the market where there are all sorts of provisions and many other things farther on toward the well built cathedral are a great many shops under the houses where foreign merchants sell a great deal of good merchandise very cheap a little beyond this are the suburbs where the cossacks of this nation live together and have a mesched or house of prayer built with wood and painted white there is also a third church built with wood in this principal street besides which there are two chapels built with the same materials but with few ornaments and which are very seldom attended by the cossacks who call themselves the old faithful and perform their devotions chiefly in their own houses so that even on the most solemn festivals they scarce do more than assemble round the church during the time of service or sit and kneel on the outside of the building it is ascribed to this prejudice that a church which had been burnt down and they had began to rebuild with wood more than twenty years back remains at this day unfinished  the city in general is very populous besides the great number of foreign merchants who reside there at all times and a still greater number of hired people and workmen who get their living there it is calculated that the cossacks alone amount to above  0000 among which are reckoned   00 enlisted soldiers belonging partly to the army and partly to the garrisons of the line in this number are a great many mahomedan tartars unconverted kalmucks and therefore called kysilbashes partly of truckmenian partly of persian extraction and generally wellskilled in the cultivation of melongrounds those who have turned christians are called baldyri there are also among the latter many kalmucks who have embraced the christian religion that they might not be delivered up to the hordes from which they have deserted  the jaikian cossacks having settled in an entirely wild country there is no determining the exact boundary of their district on the left shore of the jaik which is inhabited by the kirguisians they dare not lay claim to any thing but the hay that grows in the meadows on the western side they call all the heaths or steps their own from their city toward the caspian sea as far as the river can be seen and their neighbors on that side viz the ordinzian kalmucks contest not the matter with them the greatest claim they maintain is to the river itself and it is fisheries of which they are fully masters  the chief of the jaikian cossacks is a person called by them woiskowoi ataman now residing in jaizkoigorodok who is established by and is subordinate to the council of war belonging to the empire but his rank is not fixed he has under him twenty elders or starchins the principal of whom are always sitting as judges in the courthouse this council has a recorder a secretary an interpreter a few clerks and other officers the chief or ataman has two adjutants the lower ranks of officers are sotniks and dessatniks and no one can arrive at the honor of being an elder or starchin till he has served in the city as a dessatnik sotnik and adjutant for those that serve in the forts on the line under these titles are inferior in point of rank to the former every officer belonging to this regency has a proper income and several privileges from the crown but those who are not converted to the christian faith can never rise to any dignity higher than a sotnik  the power of this regency is very much circumscribed for the constitution of the jaikians is merely democratical no public matter can be decided but in a general assembly of the people which they call krug circle if any thing is to be done that requires a krug or if the people are to receive any high imperial commands the bell rings which calls them together the usual time is between ten and eleven in the forenoon but the assembly may be convened at any other time at which time all the cossacks in the city are drawn up round the courthouse which is built with stone and stands near the cathedral in a square encompassed with iron rails round which the people stand but without any particular order when the assembly is sufficiently numerous and the chief or ataman who is already with his elders within the courthouse is made acquainted with it by his adjutants he goes out on the covered steps before the courthouse having in his hand a staff with a silver head gilt accompanied by the elders the two adjutants then enter the square lay their caps and staves on the ground and after having said the usual prayers bow first to the chiefs next to the elders and then to the people every way who return the salute this done they take up their caps and staves again which are the ensigns of their order approach the chief and lay their caps at his feet bearing their staves in their hands after having received from the chief the matter to be debated on they go back to the people and when the senior of the two has called silence in a particular form they both repeat the word pomolschite silence and then tell the people aloud the subject to be determined on this done they collect their suffrages or votes and carry them to the chief who makes his reply to the people through his adjutants or informs them of the result of the poll the common acclamation of the people when they consent at one of these meetings is soglasny wasche wy soko rodie that is we acquiesce highborn gentlemen but they declare their dissent by ne soglasny muttering and bringing up the liberties of their ancestors  the commands of the supreme council are announced to the people by their secretary who places himself between the two adjutants and reads them aloud the people standing uncovered  it is needless to mention any thing respecting the first settlement and events of the jaikian cossacks it being most circumstantially related in the topography of orenburg i will however say something of their present state their manner and way of living is as free and unconstrained as their government young people are continually amusing themselves with a variety of sports and the old are not a little addicted to drinking and to idleness the female sex are at no loss to give themselves pleasure and delight as much in intrigue as in dress the latter no way differs from that worn by the russians except in the high colors of their shirts and the form of their caps which stand up straight in the front are round and flat at top and commonly very richly embroidered that worn by the men is the common cossack or polish dress there are among them some people of knowledge and good manners and about the river jaik we frequently meet with politeness and cleanliness which arises from their intercourse with foreign merchants they were formerly very uncivilized and had some very cruel customs a creditor was authorized to seize his debtor tie a rope about his left arm and lead him about publicly or treat him as ill and contemptuously as he pleased till his debt was paid either by friends or by alms but as the right arm is used among popish cossacks to make the sign of the cross should the creditor tie his debtors right arm by mistake he incurred a punishment for so doing and lost all claim to the debt when a wife had given her husband offense he was at liberty to dispose of her by sale at any of their public meetings and the price paid was often but a trifle  on all solemnities both of church and state the people assemble about the courthouse and are treated with bread fish and brandy  within the hall the regalia being removed the tables are spread with all sorts of strong liquors dried fish roe or caviar and bread when the sovereigns health is drank by the ataman and starchins under the firing of the great guns and the whole is concluded by drinking to the prosperity of government and the welfare of the community  young people enjoy a great deal of amusement their courtship and nuptials deserve to be noticed from the very day of a solemn betrothing which is done with many ridiculous circumstances to the day of marriage which is seldom sooner than twenty weeks all the young maidens of the brides acquaintance assemble every evening at her house and divert themselves with singing and dancing during this time the bridegroom is authorized to take a husbands liberties with his bride but with some secrecy before the wedding the bridegroom presents his bride with a complete female dress and she in return presents him with a cap boots and shirt when the nuptial ceremony is over the bride returns to her house from the church in an open wagon telega behind her sit her mother and the bridemaid their fingers full of rings and holding out on each side a piece of linen to hide the brides face from the spectators before the wagon walks the bridegroom with his father and relations behind ride several among whom is one carrying at the end of a long pole like a flag a piece of stuff striped with several colors such as is worn by the circassian women by way of petticoat and it is strange that the women of this district do not wear it likewise the nuptials are next celebrated with dancing and singing and mostly in the streets tartarian dances are frequent at such festivals and there are many young people who perform the varied and innumerable motions of the body with great strength and wonderful agility athletic exercises they practice from their childhood as also shooting with the bow the use of firearms and the lance in which they are eminently skilled  i have already said that the line or boundary along the river jaik besides the little forts and stations are chiefly garrisoned by cossacks for this purpose they enlist every year about twelfthtide a thousand volunteers to relieve those posted there the year preceding many of these soldiers settle afterward in or near these fortresses continue in the service and breed cattle acting as substitutes for others and receive their pay preferring this life to the laborious and uncertain trade of fishing at every new levy the volunteers are accepted at a public meeting and their pay is there settled according to each mans respective circumstances generally as little as possible for these troops they elect a certain number of officers and the colonel is subordinate to the ataman  i will proceed now to their several employs and the manner in which the jaikian cossacks get their living they have among themselves shoemakers smiths carpenters etc and never suffer strangers of these denominations to settle among them their town is supplied with such articles as are not made here by foreign traders who travel to this place to purchase fish some of the cossack women make camblets of different goodness and value the most common sort is very durable and cheap and they manufacture some of so superfine a quality as not only to rival the camblets of brussels but would excel them was it not for the defect common to all their drapery and stuff that of being made in very small and narrow pieces the tartarian name of these stuffs is armak and seems to have been invented by the kirguisians or kirgese whose women manufacture a coarse kind of camblet as camelhair is to be bought here in great perfection and at so low a price as about  s english for    pounds weight it is a pity that encouragement is not given them to manufacture a stuff of this hair in large pieces which would find purchasers every where they at present breed very few camels not selling any great number to the asiatic caravans but there is no animal that would thrive better on or are more fond of the salt plants that overspread the heaths of this district  breeding of cattle is one of the principal occupations of the cossacks but the russians attend only to horses and to horned cattle both prosper well in this warm country and acquire a handsome form their horses are no way inferior to russian horses in beauty strength and courage they live both summer and winter on the heaths and never fare better till when taken up to hard labor the dry ground gives them a fine hard hoof and renders shoeing unnecessary  on account of their breeding of cattle many of the cossacks have enclosures or cattleyards on those parts of the heaths where there is the best pasture such tartars as keep great flocks of sheep wander about with tents made of felts but the russians erect wicker huts where they gather their sheep at night and plaster these huts with mud they drive great herds of cattle from the jaik to the wolga and transport great quantities of hides and tallow to those towns where there are a number of tanneries and soapmanufactories as casan jaroslaw arsamas etc  another branch of employ is hunting heath or stepfoxes wolves beavers and wild boars of which sport they are very fond the season for this is the first three wintermonths when they are tracked in the snow and they follow this business close up especially when they have had an unsuccessful fishery  but the chief employment of the cossacks about the river jaik is fishing wherein they are regulated by many customary laws they fish but four times a year in that river and only three of these seasons they consider of any importance the first principal time is in january when they fish with hooks the second is in may and continues till june the third and least considerable is the autumnal season in october and they finish in the beginning of december with nets which they set under the ice not in the jaik itself but in it is branches and the lakes upon the heaths at this lake fishingtime they catch only a few small fish for their own use  the crown in laying a moderate duty on the fishgarth or wear formerly made upon the river near gurjef had confined the fisheries to the jaikian cossacks but they having demolished that garth and erected another at the further end of their city which stops the passage of the whole river the fish from the caspian sea can come no higher up than jaizkoi gorodok  i will now proceed to give my readers some accouht of these fisheries the kinds of fish caught in this river are the hornfish sturgeon shad barbel bream salmon and a variety of small fish  of all the wandering fish the first that comes up the river is the white salmon and that in february they are caught beneath the ice by hooks baited with pieces of fish in march april and may the several kinds of sturgeon shoot their way from the sea and swim up the jaik in shoals i have been well informed that at certain seasons they place cannon on the banks of the river near the wear at jaizkoi gorodok load them with powder only and fire often into the water to repel the impetuosity of those vast shoals of large fish that would otherwise break the wear that crosses the river they say and it is very probable that the sturgeon comes up into the river in the month of april when the willow buds to spawn and that they rub themselves upon the stony ground to get rid of their roe though as i have observed before young sturgeons are never caught from a conviction that the russia sturgeon and hornfish pass the winter in this river they have a law that obliges them to throw all they catch into the water again because when recaught in winter and transported in a frozen state they fetch a greater price and thus contribute to the public interest and they enforce this law so strictly as constantly to deprive him that breaks it of all his fishprovision and whip him into the bargain  it is chiefly sturgeons and bjelugas that are caught with hooks in january these fishes are said to lay themselves in rows in deep parts of the river toward the latter end of autumn and so pass the winter in a certain state of rest though not without motion or sensibility now as the river jaik from it is sandy bed is continually changing it is depth owing to the inundations in spring that wash away the banks beneath the water it is uncertain in what spots the fish lie on this account in autumn when the ice begins to form itself the cossacks will watch the motions of these fishes for it is said that before they lay themselves up they play some time upon the surface of the water and leap several times over those spots where they mean to winter others go out upon the ice as soon as the river is frozen and lay down on those spots where the water is clearest and will tell you that by putting a cloth over their heads they can see the fish lying at the bottom  when the time of the hookfishing is come which is commonly on the third or fourth of january a general assembly of the people is held when it is asked about whether the absent cossacks are returned an enquiry also is made in what places the fish is supposed to lie and finally what day is fixed to begin fishing in this and other fisheries with an intent to keep order they elect an ataman or chief from the starchins under whose command they choose some elders and an adjutant as conductors of the rest but the inferior cossacks join as it were in partnership five or six together every thing is prepared before the day fixed and care is taken to have good sharp hooks and poles of various lengths on which the hooks are fastened before the fishing day arrives every cossack enlisted though not on duty on the lines receives a written license sealed with the regencyseal a cossack that has served his year or one that has not yet served may procure a license to fish by getting himself registered no person can have more than one of these written licenses except the members of the regency who have some exclusive privileges the ataman or chief is entitled to four the starchin to three and the inferior officers to two licenses each the clerks have only one license granted to two and every resident priest has one those who have these licenses can sell them which enables many who have no claim to a license to purchase one  on the day appointed all those cossacks who have written powers assemble themselves with sledges and every necessary implement before sunrise in a certain place before the town and range themselves into a line in the same order in which they reach the ground here they are received by the ataman elected for the fishery and care is taken that every cossack has a firelock in order to defend themselves against any attack made on them by the kirguisians this done two officers exhort the people to behave orderly and quietly and as soon as day begins a signal is given from the town by the firing of two pieces of cannon upon which every one hastens as quick as his horse can carry him to the district appointed for the fishery in order to choose the most advantageous spot yet no one dares begin to open the ice till every one has taken his place and the ataman has fired a gun or two by way of signal to begin  i must notice here that the river is divided into two parts one for the spring and autumnfishing and the other for the hookfishing alone the latter begins just beyond the town and continues to the distance of  00 miles and from thence to the caspian sea the river remains undisturbed till the netfishing comes on at first setting off they fish only one day to enable the poorer cossacks to purchase with the gain of that day provisions and other necessary things five or six days after the great fishery begins and lasts for nine days fishing about twenty miles of the river each day each day the cossacks hasten to the spot where they are to begin before dawn and there wait for the signal of the ataman  every man makes on the spot where he means to fish a moderately round opening in the ice one may fish as near another as he pleases but no one can have two openings at a time yet when he leaves one opening he may make another and a second may occupy the spot he left by frequent changings and trials they will fish in the course of the day the whole district appointed for that days fishery where the places are not very deep they use hooks with short poles the pole with the hook on it is put down to the bottom of the river and as the disturbed fish rise they draw up the pole and hook the fish this done they bring it within reach of a short hook which they have in their other hand and with which they hook the fish afresh and pull it up upon the ice if two men hook the same fish it is divided between them and if one has not strength enough to pull a fish out he calls his next neighbor to assist and the fish is divided one man shall have sometimes the goodluck to hook ten or twelve large fishes in a day when another shall not be able to catch an equal number in the whole month perhaps not sufficient to pay his expenses a man commonly makes a vow before he leaves the town to give the first fish he hooks or perhaps more to the church on condition fortune favors him and they are supersticious enough to believe that in case they hook a frog of which there are some of very enormous size in this river the person to whom this disaster happens if he ever changes his spot or hooks will not catch a fish the whole winter  the second great fishery is in the spring for the fish sewrjug as soon in the month of may as accounts arrive from gurjef sent by the cossacks quartered there to watch for the said fish that it makes it is appearance in the mouth of the river jaik they prepare every thing to catch it the same orders and ceremonies are observed as in the winter an ataman is chosen whom every one who has a written power is bound to obey a certain district is set out for the fishing by a rope drawn across the river which no one is to pass this fishery last only three days as the sewrjugs when disturbed return into the sea the last fishery is commonly finished in one day this is carried on at the mouth of the river and begins with the usual ceremonies as before at daybreak each endeavoring at a signal given to outrow the other before the nets are spread for every one who fishes has a boat and net to himself these boats are made of the trunks of black and white poplar no other tree here being of sufficient diameter for the purpose tanned on the outside with the asphaltos which i have already mentioned and which is found here in abundance the nets they use for bjeluga fishing are from  0 to  0 fathoms long each fathom seven feet english  to observe the struggle says mr gmelin there is in the bjeluga fisheries is pleasant when the cold sets in the fish retire to their lurking places for the winter at which time as the bjeluga holes are well known the commander of the fishery orders all the inspectors to forbid the fishermen from exercising their profession in such places as these fish lie and all masters of vessels on the river not to make any noise nor fire any gun to disturb them  on the day when the great fishchace is settled after the fish have been seen to rise several times to the surface of the water and then plunge to the bottom which is generally about the beginning of november the fishermen are appointed to attend at a certain hour with their boats and implements and the commander inviting his friends to the diversion the evening before repairs with them to one of these hurdledams or fences across an arm of the river for at each of these dams a number of laborers are kept at a regular fixed salary have houses to live in and a church for public worship the company continue here all night regaling themselves and at break of day proceed to the bjelugaholes with a universal silence  having prepared their nets and disposed their boats in proper order the firing of a musket is the signal for departure at this signal all the boats to the number of  00 start at once and no sooner are the nets cast and all the passages closed then the most horrid cries and shouts of the fishermen succeed the profound silence that reigned before the affrighted fish endeavor to escape by all sorts of means some gain the surface of the water others not daring to venture so high remain in the middle region some strive to shun the danger by the most irregular contorsions but none can escape being encompassed by a troop of fishermen and nets the sport now increases enormous fish are seen tumbling head over tail on the surface of the river and others oversetting the boats in one place fishermen wet from head to foot making an uproar as if they were possessed and indeed they are so most of them being drunk in another place loud and violent disputes and torrents of abuse take place on the driving together of two boats when fortune is more favorable to one than another we see the effects of jealousy at last all order seems to be banished all persons row where they can and hence arise a thousand fresh disputes as the nets entangle and the boats ride and drive upon each other  the great sturgeons ichthyocolloe which at some seasons are more than ten men can master are at fishing in the yaick this time so feeble that two fishermen can take one at ease such an effect has the cold upon them this fishing lasts commonly for two hours and when over the fishermen flock to the chief to deliver their fish and receive their reward this again breeds new subjects of jealousy and quarrel fresh clamor and fresh bawling every gang struggles to get first and they often fight they beat and knock one another about oars are broken boats are split and very often a part of the combatants are tumbled into the river and perish mr gmelin who was present at one of these fishingparties on the  d of november      declares that there were taken in less than two hours more than  00 bjelugas of different sizes but the generality of them are from thirteen fourteen to twentythree hundred weight each he adds that there was not found in all that number any more than one sewrjug and one common sturgeon  it is affirmed by fishermen in general that they sometimes meet with fish hermaphrodites as well among the bjelugas as other kinds of sturgeon that is fish that have a milt on one side and spawn on the other the same thing has been observed in holland among the chevins or large codfish  the river wolga says took has a great resembance to the nile in egypt for it receives into it is channel so infinite a number of rivers and streams that when these are increased by the melting of the snows the waters rise above their usual level and not only overflow the low islands in the river so as that ships pass over them but all the plains that lie on each side the river are so overwhelmed that nothing but the tops of the highest trees appear above the surface of the water and when the water leaves these plains the land is in the highest state of richness and fertility but on account of it is numerous windings angles flats isles shelves and sandbanks the most experienced sailors are kept in continual alarm it is only in the months of may and june that large vessels sail on it with security and ease when the waters are swelled as i have mentioned the widest part of this river is between tzaritzin and astrachan at astrachan it is   00 feet over at tzaritzin about threefourths of a mile and it divides itself into a greater number of branches than any known river in the world at astrachan the river rises or swells about six feet at tzaritzin higher and the flats and and valleys all round are so entirely deluged that they have the appearance of a large ocean and the hares and fieldmice are destroyed by thousands the animals of a larger kind such as wolves foxes wildbores etc have probably a presentiment of the approaching flood as they take their flight to the inland steps but when the high waters take the hares by surprise so as entirely to surround them they seek a refuge on the higher lands and when the inundation reaches those also there is scarcely one that can escape if the water does not by chance reach them the hunters do and these take them with their hands alive rats and mice will sometimes take the resolution to escape by swimming and desperately strike in troops for the wolga itself in order to gain it is high western shore and in doing this will swim upwards of two miles and perish at last others take to the trees where birds of prey wait their coming and the bjeluga will shake the smaller trees with it is tail tumble them down and devour them alive so will they the young crows that have not learnt to fly the mouth of this river at astrachan is full of rushes and is a harbor for wild boars who feed upon the rats that dwell among them  the fisheries in this river though very profitable are often attended with great danger for when a south wind rises the waves of the sea flow toward the mouth and violently raise the ice if then a strong wind from the south northwest or east should suddenly succeed it causes a reflux of the water toward the sea the ice rushes on and often breaks into pieces of enormous magnitude pieces will drive out to sea containing fifteen or twenty square miles when this happens all the fishermen that are on it are soon swallowed up and lost  in these cruel circumstances as soon as the unfortunate wretches perceive themselves disjointed from the shore they keep a lookout to observe toward what point they are driven by the waves if they find they are floating to the open sea they stand in the same place immovable as statues waiting the dreadful decision of their fate but if there remains any hope of reaching land they leap upon the horses they usually take with them for drawing the fish and gallop full speed toward the leeward side hoping the piece of ice in it is passage will come in contact with the shore and give them an opportunity of leaping on the land in the moment of contact if they lose this moment the ice repelled with violence toward the sea will soon go to pieces by the agitation of the waves and their destruction is more certain than ever  it is natural to imagine that a state of life so full of danger will be followed only by people already reduced to the most abject state of misery and who have often merited the last inflictions of civil justice by their delinquencies from the time they embrace this calling they are fixed in a perpetual bondage by the advances their necessities oblige them to accept of their employers who frequently take advantage of this circumstance to subject them to the most cruel injustice though they only are gainers by their toil growing rich by their miseries whilst the unfortunate laborers are plunging deeper and deeper into distress  these fisheries ended the cossacks proceed to other business they travel to purchase bread in the districts of the wolga and samara and toward the latter end of summer cut and make their hay  during the hookfishing a great many buyers come here from the most distant parts of the russian empire sturgeons caught in winter are sold to these buyers as they are caught who dress the fish and roe barrel it and transport it frozen ten good sizable sturgeons will sell for from thirty to fortyfive rubles each ruble  s  d but a large sturgeon even without a roe will fetch six or seven rubles the largest bjeluga sturgeon caught in the river jaik will weigh above  000 lb and yield  00 lb of roe or cavear the sturgeons here are about seven feet long and weigh about  00 lb but the spawners are generally the largest and will yield sometimes    lb weight of roe and are sold at the first hand for two rubles a few years ago they found a great part of the roe in an old bjeluga petrified though the bjelugastone which is the petrified roe is very scarce indeed  this stone says mr sokolof who visited the caspian fisheries is found lying lengthways under the cartilages of the back in the part where the kidneys of other animals are the instant it is taken from the fish it is soft and moist but quickly hardens in the air it is size never exceeds that of a hens egg it is sometimes oval and sometimes a little flatted or bent toward the place where it is fastened to the back it may be scraped with a knife but with difficulty and does not ferment when mixed with acids though it has little merit it holds a considerable rank among the domestic remedies of the russians who administer the scrapings in small doses mixed with water in difficult labors in the diseases of children and against stoppages in the urinary passages the value of a stone is a ruble  the fresh roe being softly worked with the hand through a coarse sieve is thus cleaned and as in this southern clime the mild weather begins soon after new years day they salt it to prevent it is spoiling it is afterward pressed down in barrels with the feet and conveyed to very distant parts  they also dry the back sinews of the sewrjug sturgeon make them up in bundles of twentyfive each and sell them for food at the rate of three or four rubles a thousand and as they hold every part of the sturgeon to be eatable they preserve the stomach of it and eat it as a dainty but the most valuable part of this fish is it is bladder those merchants who buy the whole fish commonly sell back the bladder to the cossacks who make isinglass from it which is done here in one way only as the bladder is taken fresh from the fish they wash and spread it in the air to dry then divide the inner skin or white skin which is the isinglass from the outer wrap it up in a moist cloth to make it pliable and then roll it up and pinch it into the form of a serpent or a heart and let it dry again in the shade this is sold at different prices according to what fish it is taken from from twelve to forty rubles per pud each pud    pounds english  salt is also a very considerable article in the jaikian fisheries the cossacks have liberty to provide themselves with a sufficient quantity to salt their fish and roe which are conveyed into russia and use many thousand puds for this purpose indeed the steps or heaths about this river are so abundantly provided by nature with this mineral treasure that the inhabitants will never want it they once fetched this salt in summertime for the use of the town from the distance of seventy miles with an escort of  00 armed men but at present they have it from the seaside their provisions when salted are kept in all the guardstations in pits made in the ground or in tubs covered with mats and clay  the jaikian cossacks know nothing of agriculture perhaps the defense of their forts leaves them no time for husbandry or as they justly remark the too great saltness of the land will not allow it i think the bucharian millet would grow here this plant prospers with some care exceedingly well among the asiatic nations on a soil and in a climate similar to this it is the only kind of corn the bucharians have and the high and thick stalks of this plant serve the inhabitants of those woodless countries for firing it is no wonder therefore that the bucharians should cultivate it and have a solemn and universal feast at seedtime a single plant will often yield two pounds weight of millet tobacco might also be planted here with success if the cossacks did not abhor it from some religious prejudice  they are here great lovers of the watermelon and raise great quantities of them besides all sorts of vegetables for the kitchen there is not less than fifty large watermelon gardens in and about this town jaizkoi gorodok the fruit of which is sold for a trifle these gardens are divided into long fields enclosed only with a hedge and to all parts of these gardens they conduct the water in the manner of the eastern nations in clay trenches in order to water the plants sufficiently of course these gardens are always near some flowing or standing water where they raise the water by a watergallows during the ripening of this fruit they keep continual watch to frighten the crows and magpies which are no where more daring and rapacious than in  district  jaizkoi gorodok owing to it is high and open situation is a healthy town and the people know no other disorders than such as proceed from their way of life and a certain contagion of lust which is a universal and common disorder all the inhabitants are strong robust and of a large size not excepting the women and this lustdisorder is a kind of leprosy little known in europe but general along the districts of the river jaik it is the same disorder known in astrachan by the name of the crimean sickness brought from the crimea in former campaigns the jaikian cossacks assured me that it was brought to astrachan by a regiment that served in a persian war they call it the black distemper one of it is first symptoms being a livid color that covers the face i saw several persons laboring under it to the highest degree the patient suffers with it four or five years before it attains it is height and they say it is in the seventh year only that it proves mortal it does not infect all persons who attend the sick at least not during the four years i have seen a family in jaizkoi gorodok where the eldest brother was first afflicted with it three years after the youngest brother caught it and one year after this the mother and yet the wives of both who cohabited with their respective husbands all the time were free and clear from it it seizes chiefly the robust and persons of middle age the first and second year the patient feels no particular pain nor is sensible of any weakness his face looks blue as if he was choked and this is followed with a number of bluered spots or blotches on the wrist sides and face which occasions an extreme roughness of the skin in those places or scurf called in medicine impetigo some have no spots at all in their faces for the first year but a few small ones about their joints in the beginning of this distemper patients are somewhat feverish but after two years they all suffer the smartest pain in their limbs and joints begin to lose their appetite strength and countenance and become very faint at this period the leprosy is more virulent and spreads itself all over the body not in thick and deepred spots but in flat and scabby blotches which exulcerate by degrees and leave a bad scurf continuing longer than any similar irruption when the scurf drys away the parts itch and the skin underneath the scurf naturally heals but if the patient scratches it or picks off the scab it is followed by an increasing angry boil that will penetrate even to the bone when this happens in the fingers it destroys them quite and they will fall away joint by joint the legs are commonly most covered with spots but by degrees no part of the body is free from them except the palms of the hands the inside of the joints of the arms the armpits the backside and knucklejoints these parts even in the most desperate state of the distemper are always clear as at other times as is also that part of the head on which the hair grows those with whom the distemper continues to the seventh or eighth year have their nostrils the inside of the mouth and throat and windpipe exulcerated and it is probable that the inward and more noble parts are infected with boils ere the distemper proves mortal yet in it is last period it affects the constitution and strength less than one should expect for the pains are commonly tolerable and the natural functions go on regularly it does not appear that the patient as in other leprous disorders feels an uncommon lustful desire this appetite they lose gradually nor do they lose their hair except on the eyebrows which are always itching and on the exulcerated parts it is said that this disorder is cured in crimean tartary by a decoction of the plant anbasis aphylla which grows there and also about the river jaik i doubt much whether mercury would radically cure it at orenburg they salivated a cossack afflicted with it in it is middle period he lost much blood and afterward seemed better but being suffered to return to his former diet and way of living the leprosy returned and raged with redoubled violence mercurial lotions externally applied and antimonials taken internally would probably be a better treatment but such experiments require the skill of able physicians  by way of closing this account of jaizkoi gorodok i will mention some of their most common and pernicious insects which are moths or tarakans and crickets they have also a large kind of wandering fieldrat the surmulet of buffon i no where met with so many crickets as in this place owing partly to the warm and dry situation of the town and partly to a bad custom the people have of stuffing the seams of their houses between the beams with fine hay having no moss for that purpose and these insects liking to take up their abode in this hay with respect to the fieldrat the cossacks assured me there had not been any in their country about the river jaik for three years past though the northern parts of russia and siberia abound with them but that owing to a dry and burning summer vast quantities of them came one evening from the step of samara to this town and were seen by many of the inhabitants to make their entrance partly through a certain gate and partly over the ramparts from this time they became exceedingly troublesome having remained all the summer in town for want of food on the step it is remarkable and i had it from good authority that these mischievous guests never trespass on one side of the principal street which leads through the town but always keep on the eastern side  account of the kalmucks during my stay at jaizkoi gorodok i often visited the kalmucks who live on the step between this and samara in great numbers but as i could gather from them little of the history of this remarkable nation during the time when the great horde retired from the river jaik and marched to the western shore of the wolga on account of the kubanian war i will content myself with putting here together what i could collect of their way of living customs and religion  according to albulgasi indeed they are a branch of the mongols who in very remote ages wandered about the deserts on both sides of the mountains that divide dauria from the present chinese mongalia and the southern parts of the sayanehills long before the end of the twelfth century they were separated into three branches under the denomination of mongols oirats and burats tschingis khan who lived about   00 united them under one monarchy became their sovereign and made their several princes tributary to him he conquered china and subdued the tartars  when the mongols were driven out of china in      the united mongol and tartar hordes after subduing their western neighbors spread into russia and other parts of europe and there formed new colonies under the descendant of tschingis the princes divided again and thus with the addition of russian conquests the vast mongolthibetan empire was entirely disjointed in the sixteenth century from this dispersion of the people arose the present mongol and tartar nations tschingis khan and timur bek who attacked china and wrested it out of the hands of the founder of the new dynasty of ming sprung from one and the same ancestor  of the three branches the mongols the burats and the oirats i shall speak but of the latter who are commonly called kalmucks  these deserts says took which the kalmucks inhabit lie between the don and the wolga and on the river ural from irgis to the caspian sea they consist of a stony loam are quite burnt up destitute of wood abound in salt contain many fresh water lakes as well as salt lakes and produce wholesome herbage which makes their cattle vigorous and fat  the present kalmucks are of three tribes torgouts sjungorians and derbets and consist of about  0000 families dividing themselves into three ranks the nobility whom they call whitebones the common people who are bondmen whom they distinguish by the name of blackbones and the clergy who are descended from both ranks and are freemen the noble ladies are called whiteflesh the common women blackflesh  i spell the word kalmuck agreeable to the russian pronunciation but according to it is true etimology i should have written it chalmack or chalimack this being the name the tartars give the kalmucks chalimack in the tartarian language signifies revolted but some kalmucks give another derivation from their own language and say it is composed of the words kalmucks gal which in the kalmuck and mongalian language means fire and aimak which implies a tribe or a division of the ulusses and thus means courageous in the same manner their brethren the mongalians derive their name from men and gal the different races of kalmucks however give themselves universally the name of eljud or oljud  the kalmucks are in general middlesized men though there are more short than tall they are all wellmade and i do not recollect ever seeing one maimed or deformed the education of their children while infants which they leave solely to nature must give them healthy and perfect bodies though they are slender and their limbs slight i never saw a fat corpulent kalmuck at least among the common men though among the kirguisians and baskirs who live quite in the same manner many are often very bulky and corpulent the complexion of their face and body is tolerably white but their infants are quite so it being a custom among the common people to let their children run about stark naked in the burning sun and the smoke of their felttents and even grown persons sleeping quite naked it changes their natural complexion to a yellowbrown but this is not so visible in the women among their ladies of distinction are seen some very white faces and these appear more so from the blackness of their hair in this as well as in the features of their faces they are perfectly like the women of china  it is unnecessary to describe the common features of the kalmuck men they being sufficiently known took says they are for the most part rawboned and stout their visage is so flat that the skull of a kalmuck may easily be known from that of any other man the eyes too are smaller and the corners of them flatter than among the europeans they have thick lips a small nose and a short chin and their beard is scanty and appears late their teeth are even and white their complexion a reddishbrown and their knees always stand outward like a bow which proceeds from their manner of sitting on their ancles and their being almost constantly on horseback the women are of the same shape and make with the men only that their complexion is very clear and of a wholesome white and red according to some travelers one might be led to suppose that all the faces of the kalmucks are deformed and frightful but this is not the case there are among both sexes many round and pleasant faces some whose features are so regular that they would not want admirers in any european city though it seems a characteristic of this people that the corners of their eyes and eyebrows have a slant direction and the bridge of their noses are short and flat i found that the dsungorians were generally taller and had a prettier visage than the torgouts the former having probably received a greater mixture of tartarian blood by the rape of the women belonging to this latter nation as to the blackness of their hair with which their children are born i did not see among the kalmucks a single exception nor the least degeneration into a brown color fullgrown men have a strong and large beard but they leave only a whisker turned up on their upper lip and a tuft upon their under one old persons and especially priests leave a whisker and let the hair grow over the corners of the mouth on the lower lip underneath the chin and about the neck the rest of the face is kept clear by plucking it and cutting it with sizzars and rough knives the kalmucks also like the tartars accustom themselves in this manner to extirpate the hair from other parts of the body  having now spoken of their persons i will proceed to their minds in which i shall have an opportunity to be more favorable in many points than travelers in general have been in this respect they are far before other nomades or shepherdnations the socialness hospitality candor officiousness and a certain gaiety which never leaves a kalmuck but distinguishes him from the more phlegmatic kirguisian may be called good qualifications but their idleness want of cleanliness and knavery which they too often misemploy are justly to be deemed their principal vices a love of idleness is common and natural to all nations who lead an unlimited careless and pastoral life yet the kalmucks have less of it owing to their sprightliness but their filthiness or nastiness can no way be contradicted or excused and perhaps is to be ascribed as in the lower classes of the french more to their education and volatility than to sloth for the kalmuck women perform their domestic offices with great industry and are therefore much courted and coveted by the kirgueses as to their mental faculties their knowledge is certainly much limited but in spite of all their ignorance they have a very good quick and natural understanding which might be very easily cultivated and improved if their way of living and natural sprightliness were not insuperable obstacles though generally choleric they live more friendly together than one should expect from their mode of living among themselves they are social and hospitable they like to share every thing that can be enjoyed and never keep any thing to themselves alone when eating drinking or smoking tobacco every one present must be a partaker and if for example there should be but one tobaccopipe they must all use it by turns if one is presented with tobacco fruit or other eatables he will divide it with his friends or those who are next him if a family has made a provision of milk to make brandy of they will call in their neighbors to help to consume this blessing but this liberality mostly extends itself to eatables for they never part with any of their property however thievishly inclined they may have been described yet they never steal any thing from their countrymen unless there be hostilities among the ulusses indeed most of the robberies with which they have been charged arise from hostility or a spirit of revenge but this is not done by violence but craft i have been told that these ulusses who formerly were under the government of nasarmamut but now under bambar one of his successors a person renowned for his warlike disposition have always been famous for robbery but that among all other ulusses if the least care is taken of their property no such attempts are made  as the kalmucks know not how to make any sort of stuff for clothing they are obliged to buy it all the common people seldom wear any thing but sheep and other skins and felts which they throw over them in the rain by way of cloak the better class of men wear an uppergarment like that worn by the poles except the sleeves which are close and narrow and an undergarment buttoned all the way down and bound close to the body with a girdle those of distinction wear a short shirt under it open before and wide breeches made of linen which reach down and are fastened into the buskins the poor do without a shirt and are not less gay in their narrow coat or fur which they fasten round them with a girdle  the uppergarment and boots of the women differ but little from those of the men only that their cloaks are lighter made and of better stuff a little longer and more elegant and lighter about the arms those who are ladies of distinction wear over the undergarment or beschmet a rich and long floating waistcoat without sleeves and hang the uppergarment or fur upon one or both shoulders as the women have their undergarment and shirt open before they can uncover their bosom to the girdle and always do in the summerseason when they mean to be well dressed  the women would be scarcely distinguished from the men if it was not for their headdress and in this married women differ from the maidens the heads of the men are commonly clipped close leaving only a long tuft of hair behind in the center of the crown which those of distinction generally braid into two or three tresses the torgouts wear both summer and winter a small round cap bordered with fur the sjungorians commonly wear a summer hat covered with felt just like those of the chinese except it is being smaller and having a flatter brim all wear upon the crown a large spreading fringe which hangs down under the cap a kalmucks ears like those of the tartars stand at a distance from his head and the cap comes down to the root of the ears this prominence of ear is more visible in the kalmucks than the tartars the ears of the former being rather larger  boys hair is shorn from their infancy but the women do not like to have their hair cut girls run about like furies with bewildered locks but at the age of ten or twelve when a kalmuck lady is marriageable her hair is plaited in as many tresses as she pleases and wound round the head when a girl however is married these tresses are undone and the hair is braided into two large ones only which hang down in tails over both shoulders the ordinary class of women whilst at work put theirs into a linen bag the caps of wives and maidens are partly the same except that the lower class wear them only when they go out or are welldressed it is a round flat cap bordered with fur and covers only the upper part of the head women of distinction wear higher caps of a richer silk stuff with a broad brim cocked up before and behind and lined with black velvet they seem fond of spreading on the top of their caps a broad fringe that hangs down on all sides such a cap they call chalban the common ones maihalhu all the women wear earrings some maidens are silly enough to smear their faces with red and white paint and some women will wear a large gold ring in their nostrils  kalmuck dwellings are like those huts made of felts common in all asiatic nomades and very well known in russia they are called jourts the truly ingenious structure of which i will endeavor to describe for the entertainment of my foreign readers more circumstantially than has hitherto been done see the plate of kalmucks removing which represents one kalmuck tent on the outside and the section of another the skeleton of those felthuts consists first of wattled hurdles formed thirty inches thick by seven or eight different pieces seven feet long and five broad placed one upon another and fastened together in a kind of panel with willow rods several of these pannels are set up in a circular form and joined at the ends with hairropes or bands forming the circumference of the tent the door is made in the same manner but not so thick and ornamented with a border ropes serve instead of hinges by tying the piece that forms the door to the hurdle next it three long willowpoles are then set up with a ring on the top made of wicker to form the roof through which ring the ends of a great number of poles are put the other end fixed in the hurdles below and fastened with strings this being neatly executed the whole is painted red the skeleton now completed is covered with felts or a cloth made of wool united without weaving large enough to cover and sit it and fastened on with cords wound round it in winter all is shut close but in summer the sides are left open by throwing aside the covering in very cold weather they lay over the whole tent an additional covering of felts and mats binding them on as before the part within the ring at top is left open for a chimney but as a shelter from the wind and rain some cross circular pieces are fixed over it kalmucks removing on which they occasionally throw a felt on the windward side and when the fire is burnt out within they will cover the whole opening to keep the hut warm  in the center of this tent stands always a great iron trivet under which they continually keep some fire and over it dress their victuals in large flat iron pots great quantities of these pots are made at the iron manufactories in russia and sold to the stepnations the remainder of their furniture consists of wooden dishes drinking bowls large and small bottles vessels made of leather a large tea pot made of wood but among the better class of people hooped with copper or silver their bed stands opposite the door behind the fireplace commonly on a small wooden bedstead the pillow and bolster of which are made of felt  domestic labor falls upon the women only the men taking no other pains than to build and repair their tents the rest of their time being spent in hunting attending their flocks or in idleness or amusement it is the womans business to milk the cattle mares cows and ewes and prepare the hides or skins to do the needle work and every other domestic occupation they also knead with their hands camel horse and cow dung make flat cakes of the composition and dry them in the wind which is the only firing they use the women also take down the tents pack them up and erect them afresh when the master of a house means to go abroad it is the duty of his wife to saddle his horse and bring him to the door in short the women have so much to do that they are seldom seen idle they have scarce time to dress themselves  in summertime they have abundance of milk which indeed is their chief nourishment they have commonly more horses than horned cattle and mares milk is what they like best for being made sour it contains such a spirit that if a person drinks two or three of their large bowls full it will almost intoxicate him their cows and mares will give down no milk unless the calf or colt be present on this account colts and calves are kept almost the whole day about their tents staked down to a particular spot of ground with long ropes and are suffered to suck only at night their mothers will feed naturally not far from them of course they have them always at hand they milk the mares every hour and each yields about the seventh part of a gallon or a moderate bottle full of milk but the cows are milked only twice or three times a day before milking the mother is led to it is young one and as soon as it begins to suck some one pushes it away and the milk flows freely with the cows it is sufficient to show them their calf and should it die in the birth or afterward they will stuff the skin and tie it up among the rest in order to show it to the cow at milkingtime but the mare is not so simple and they are under a necessity of acting cautiously with these lest it should make them stubborn and refuse their milk entirely  fresh mares milk is much more fluid than the milk of cows but on account of a little alkaline taste is not so pleasant yet if they turn it with cleanliness it has a most delicate vinous flavor it yields hardly any cream of course it is not fit for butter though some writers falsely say it is but it is richer in spirituous and fermenting particles in winter when they have but little mares milk they make shift with cows milk which is much less spirituous and when turned four has a more disagreeable taste  in order to turn the milk they pour it gradually into large leathern or other vessels which in wintertime are set near the fire either above or under ground commonly unclean vessels alone will turn it but if not they forward it with leven made of flour and salt as they distill a spirit from this sour milk they sometimes turn it with a little of this spirit if they have any or can borrow it from their neighbors and sometimes with a little of the sour milk which they find in the stomachs of the lambs they kill milk designed for distilling they take no cream from but beat it about now and then with a stick as they do in making butter or as the milk is collected in summer in leather bottles they shake it well twice a day and this will turn it  when they have collected a sufficient quantity of such milk to make themselves merry and the whole has stood to sour at least one day in summer but more in winter the women distill a spirit from it in the following manner having set over the fire the largest iron boiler they have being first rinsed with water or melted snow after shaking the milk they pour it into the boiler and fill it within two fingers breadth of the top this kettle contains about two or three russian pails full or more it is then covered with a hollow cover that fits it made of two pieces of wood having two square openings the edges of this cover and the places where the wood joins are luted with clay glue and fresh cow dung the kalmucks of stawropal use in winter a stiff dough of coarse flour near this boiler is set a smaller one with a similar top and from the opening of one to the other is fixed a curved wooden pipe forming a still and thus with a slow fire they will distill in an hour and a half a bad spirit to the amount of one fourth of the milk if it be cows milk and one third if mares milk but the spirit distilled from mares milk is seldom strong enough to burn that from cows milk never unless it be distilled a second time  when this liquor is made and the neighbors are assembled to partake of it the master of the tent throws some into the fire some up the chimney and after breaking a point of the claycover pours a little also on them so done he fills a bowl which contains a moderate bottle full from the remainder and hands it round according to the age of the persons present serving the oldest first without any respect to sex the kalmucks say that this milkbrandy does not intoxicate so quick or in such small quantities as russian brandy but that if a man gets drunk with it he will continue so two days and must sleep longer to recover himself  the remainder of this milk after the spirit is distilled from it is exceedingly sour and they either mix it with fresh cowsmilk and drink it immediately or save it to steep their sheep and lambskins in or else they boil these dregs with some fresh cows milk till it grows thick then pour the curd into bags and after squeezing it well dry it in the sun and eat it as cheese they make also a kind of cheese from ewes milk which they eat in winter with butter indeed this is the only use they make of ewes milk deeming it unfit for distilling to make butter from cows milk they boil it well turn it sour in the course of one day beat it with a butterstaff and pour it into a bowl when the oil or butter will swim on the surface which they skim off and keep in leather vessels  they are never at a loss for meat in summer as they can procure it in abundance either by hunting or from such of their cattle as die a natural or accidental death very rarely do the kalmucks slaughter their own cattle but from necessity or on some great festival this is done only by the rich and by the first class of people birds of all kinds they are very fond of if fat the badger the marmot and the rat are their peculiar dainties they account the beaver also to be wholesome food unless it be too fat besides these animals they eat wild horses wild goats wild boars and all sorts of birds even the largest bird of prey yet they abhor the flesh of wolves saying it is bitter they eat also the fox and the smaller kinds of thieving animals with reluctance when they have plenty of meat in summer they will cut it into narrow slices dry it in the sun or in rainy weather over a smoking fire within their tents and lay it up for winter and traveling provisions even the chiefs and first people among them says took will feed upon cattle that have died of distemper and age and let the flesh stink ever so much they will eat it without disgust for this reason in every horde the fleshmarket has the appearance of a laystall of carrion bread and groats they purchase from the russians for as they eat but little they never cultivate any land or sow any corn i have been informed however that some of the ordinzian kalmucks have settled about the caspian sea in order to establish fisheries and cultivate the tobaccoplant of which they are very fond there are certain roots also which they eat as the knots of the sagetree phlomis tuberosa which they call bodmon after drying it and reducing it to powder they boil it into a pulp with milk they eat also the chichling vetch lathyrus tuberosus which they call schnok and boil it with their meat and also the roots of a sort of sunflower umbellata instead of tea which they boil in the mongalian fashion with milk and butter the common people gather on the steps a kind of small liquorice which they boil with salt and milk they are great lovers of mead and brandy and both sexes smoke tobacco at an enormous rate  i made many enquiries into the manner in which the kalmuck women tan and prepare the different sorts of hides and leather and found it to be as follows when they mean to dress their fine lambskins with care they first wash them clean in lukewarm water spread them in the air and let them get a little dry they then scrape them on the inside with blunt knives to take off the fleshskin that may hang to them and render them more supple this done they spread them out in the air on a piece of felt and rub them over for three days successively thrice a day with the dregs of the milk after it is distilled or with sour cows milk in which salt has been dissolved on the fourth day they suffer them to get quite dry and work them between their hands on their bosom till they become quite soft and pliant after this they are smoked to make them resist rain the better and prevent the rain from spoiling them for this purpose they kindle a small fire in a little pit and throw over it dry rotten wood dried dung and other things that will create smoke sheepdung is considered the best for this purpose about the pit they stick poles in such a manner as to form a pyramidical figure and cover these with skins so as to keep in the smoke sometimes changing their situation that every part may be equally smoked this is continued for an hour and as it renders them stiff again they are a second time rubbed with the hands till they are of a proper softness they are next rubbed well with bruised chalk scraped clean and polished with sharp knives and at last whitened with pieces of chalk nothing then remains but to clean and beat the fleece  when they mean to bestow less trouble as is the case with coarse skins they lay them over with a paste made of ashes and salt water to the thickness of the skin itself and as the skin absorbs the lie they do it afresh next day they scrape the fleshside clean and wash it with sour milk and when dry the skin is worked soft and whitened with chalk some wash these skins after they are smoked and rub them with halfboiled ox and sheep liver which have been laid some days in milk to rot and become a pulp this makes them soft but gives them an intolerable bad smell all the furs they prepare for their own use are sewed by the women with fine split sinews of horses bullocks and elks drying beating and tearing them into threads which surpass all kinds of thread in solidity horse and bullocks hides of which they make leather vessels are prepared by the kalmucks in the following manner they first scald them in boiling water to get the hair off the backs of oxhides make the best vessels but some lay them in ashes to get off the hair which ever way it is done they are next scraped and smoothed with knives and washed clean in flowing water others prepare them by soaking them a week or more in sour milk in which a little salt has been dissolved bootleather is prepared in this last way but in order to make the best kind the hides are spread as they come out from the water in the sun and the women most skilled in this business cut out the pieces that are to form the vessel few it with sinewthread and dry it in the smoke they manufacture in this manner not only vessels with wide mouths giving them their form whilst drying but all kind of bottles and vessels with narrow necks in order to preserve the form they continually blow into them whilst drying on the fire or fill them with sand or ashes the outside they embellish with a variety of lines and figures they even contrive to make teapots of leather resembling the china ones and make them very neatly as soon as they are dry they are fit for use but in order to keep them firm and not liable to get soft with liquid and to take away any bad smell they smoke them well for some days and as rotten and dried cow dung is seldom to be found on the heaths they collect it by degrees and do not begin to make these vessels till they have got a sufficient quantity to smoke them with they are smoked within these pyramids till they are as transparent as horn and equally solid i have seen some of their bottles which would hold as much as five or six pails  thus does the womens industry procure the men an easy and an idle life which as by their constitution they are all soldiers is perhaps not reprehensible besides the profession of arms and the care of their flocks it is the department of the men to mend and repair their tents and when they give a daughter in marriage to build the young couple a new one in the manufacturing of felts the men take also an active part having sheered their sheep in spring and summer with sharp knives they spread the wool out on an old felt carpet or mat on which it is well beaten by ten or twelve persons sitting round it till all the dust is out it is then equally spread upon a felt the exact size of the one that is to be made and in spots where they want to vary it in color they place over the first layer of wool dyed wool of those colors this done they carefully roll up the whole together and tie it tight with haircords then all the people present sit down in two rows opposite to each other take the rolled felt between them and raise it to their knees throwing it from their knees again on the ground with all their strength and continuing this for some hours this unites the wool into a body and when they think it is sufficiently matted they unroll it and repair with the hand any defects that appear in it  kalmuck arms mostly consist of lances arrows and bows the latter are made of different kinds of wood but chiefly of the planetree they have a variety of arrows some short made wholly with wood with a knob at the end with these they kill small animals and birds others are light arrows with small ironpoints and some wararrows with a strong ironpoint all these arrows are winged with eaglefeathers taken from the tail of the bird as the wingfeathers are apt to carry the arrow out of it is direction they are contained in certain divisions in a quiver and hung on the rightside of the saddle the bow in a scabbard on the leftside the more opulent kalmucks have firearms such as are wellarmed wear a breastharness like those of the easternnations consisting of network made of iron and steel rings getting these from the truchmenians i have seen such breastharness in persia worth more than fifty horses consisting wholly of polished steel there are however cheaper ones which they get in barter for about seven or eight horses their fullarmour consists of a round helmet with an iron network that hangs down round the neck upon the shoulders but only as low as the eyebrows on the face a coat of mail with sleeves to the wrist covering the back of the hand with a slip fastened between the fingers and two armharnesses extending from the elbow to the wrist and buckled on the outside of the arm to defend it from blows in any engagement  the ironwork used for their arms is made among themselves there are a kind of petty jewellers also among them who make ornaments for the women and embellish teapots with silver figures of animals and hoops their tools are very simple their bellows consists of a leatherbag with a pipe fixed between two boards which they extend and press together  their manner of hunting is various and they are expert in taking wild beasts with any kind of trap or snare they also shoot very exactly with arrows and firearms kalmucks of distinction are very fond of hawking with a kind of hawk falco lanarius which frequents this district and is much valued they keep also dogs which have long ears are good housedogs and expert at the chase  the great wealth and substance of a kalmuck are his flocks and herds but they keep more horses and sheep than horned cattle or camels their horses are not much smaller than those of the kirguese are tolerably high slight but are neither handsome nor ugly they are strong enough for draught but too wild as to swiftness they are inferior to none as they have no other feed than what the steps afford they will live any where and almost upon any thing indeed a kalmuck never accustoms them to regular feed fearful of increasing their wildness and ferocity with their strength some kalmucks own a hundred horses and other cattle in proportion they cut their colts at the proper season by opening their scrotum catching hold of the spermatic vessels and nipping off the testicles with their nails searing the part with a redhot iron they do the same with sheep and calves that they may never want mares milk they suffer the stallions to run continually with the mares  kalmuck sheep like those of the kirguese have very thick and fat tails though not quite so large as kirguisian sheep their rams have hanging ears seldom any horns and their wool is less hairy generally white with spotted faces the sheep here are suffered to feed in all seasons and as they lick the snow require no water among the kalmuck flocks are generally a few goats with pendant ears spotted with several colors having long hairs hanging down their legs but seldom any horns  as camels multiply but slowly their property in these is but small but they have as many as they want and often some to sell they have some with one bunch on their backs and others two many are taken to orenburg market and there trucked away to the bucharians this animal thrives well on the steps among the saltplants but requires attention in winter it being necessary then to cover their loins with mats or old felts  kalmucks pass the winter with their flocks in the most southern district of the wolga step and along the caspian sea but always at some distance from the jaik where the kirguese their most cruel enemies have fixed their abode they find there plenty of reeds to kindle fire with and as it snows but little the cattle have no difficulty in finding food with the beginning of spring they draw by degrees to the north and seek the hilly and watery districts of the milder step till after the wolga has entered within it is bounds and offers a richer pasture in the lower lands  the kalmucks thus emigrating in order to seek a better pasture find an uncommon advantage in their camels these animals not only carry their tents and all belonging to them but also their household furniture trunks bags of clothes and other little matters they will not employ the onebunched camel particularly white ones which they call bucharians but to transport their sacred books their idols or burchans and other holy articles these sacred things are packed up loaded on small wagons and drawn by white camels decorated with large and small bells and nothing is pleasanter than to meet such a suite of kalmucks kalmucks seeking a fresh abode the fine herds march foremost feeding as they go next follows a large company of armed herdsmen next the camels and oxen with the horses and furniture then the women and children on horseback in their gayest apparel driving the cattle and singing merrily as they pass whilst a number of the men rove about the environs of the road hunting indeed the chief part of this peoples life which to us appears wretched is interwoven with gaiety and the more unfortunate we deem them the happier they find themselves however unwholesome their nourishment and habitations may appear yet many arrive at an advanced old age gay and free from infirmities  i cannot say much of their diseases which are not many in number like those of civilized nations on account of their plain way of living but as their chief aliment is meat and that eaten half rotten it is easily to be conceived that they must have some inflammatory diseases the most dreadful and dangerous disorder among them is a burning and infective fever mortal on the eighth day where it seizes families it will carry off one or more from each tent those who live in the neighborhood of such as are afflicted with this distemper fly from their abode and search at a farther distance for a safer one the itch is also a frequent complaint among the lower sort of kalmucks which arises from their manner of feeding and their indolent state of life during the winter but they are more afflicted with the furor amorosus arising from the scald the biles indeed make their appearance but seldom but when they do they rage with virulence this is also observed among the kalmucks of stawropal who are more subject to it so that it is clearly in a great measure owing to the quantity of animal food they eat owing to their smoky tents the intolerable heat of the sun and the yellowness of the heaths inflammations of the eyes are so frequent that many wear a slip of crape over them by way of prevention the schoolmaster is generally the surgeon he feels the pulse opens a vein scarifies and clysters  it is time now to say something of their political and religious constitution the kalmucks were once subject to certain chiefs whose prerogatives were hereditary even at present the nation is divided among little tributary princes who call themselves nojonn and pay but little obediance to the khan that overules the whole the horde subject to such a nojonn is called uluss and is subdivided into small fraternities living not far from each other under the name of aimaks consisting of from   0 to  00 families who are surbordinate to certain nobles bearing the title of saissang each aimak is again divided on account of the pasture into companies of ten or twelve tents composing what they call a chatun which properly speaking implies a boiler so that chatun is a is a society which cooks out of the same boiler each chatun has an overseer who owes obediance to the saissang of their aimak as does the saissang to the nojonn a nojonn receives tithes of cattle from all his subjects he has a right ad libitum to inflict corporal punishment for all misdemeanors and can sentence them to have their ears nose and hand cut off but not to take away any mans life publicly though he exercises this power privately on those who incur his displeasure if a nojonn has not regulated the succession in his lifetime or made priests of some of his children they will after his death divide the ulusses among themselves and this division is commonly very unequal the mode of saluting a nojonn among the common kalmucks is by closing the hand holding it to the forehead and then touching the nojonns hip therewith and if the nojonn thinks proper to return the compliment it is by striking the other on his shoulder  the princes says took are only dependent on the khan in matters of general importance in every other respect they are independent they acquire their ulusses by hereditary succession the khan has a privy council or sarga consisting of nojonns saissangs and priests wherein sits an assessor from every uluss and an advocate from the governments chancery at astrachan and here it is that laws are enacted  there are several other dignities or titles conferred by the nojonns or khan as the sovereign lord of the uluss but i am not acquainted with them every uluss has at least one chief saissang whom they honor with the appellation of tarchan another title belonging to those nobles who are about the khan and chief princes is taischa these are sent as ambassadors darga from one uluss to another to the russian cities and governors  the establishment of the hordes is altogether military every subject must on the first orders repair on horseback to the headquarters of his prince armed and with a good stock of provisions the troops are assembled almost as soon as the order is known the prince musters them and sends the feeble and the wretched home again this muster lasts some time and procures the serviceable men the distinction of men of war the headquarters of the prince are known by the whiteness of the tents and by being surrounded by other tents in a circle  the army is composed of regiments of unequal numbers and every regiment ottok is divided into hundreds each regiment has it is colors painted with the idolgods of war dragons serpents tigers lions etc it is colonels tzrigen yassool captains soon yassool and other officers but no martial music every regiment is composed of three companies musquetry bowmen and neckbreakers or lancebreakers the musquetry first attack next the bowmen and last of all the neckbreakers they fight with courage and usually conquer all that fight in their way but against the regular troops i mean the troops of government they can make no stand except when they are vastly superior in numbers when they serve the russian crown they are equipped and paid as cossacks  it is very remarkable that the kalmuck princes have long since thought of and enacted laws which would put those european civilized nations to the blush who with an affected disdain presume to call them barbarians they have a code of laws written in mongalian language which in the reign of galdankhan was improved and ratified by twentyfour mongalian and uiratian princes in the presence of three kutuchts or highpriests wherein they trifle not with the life of a man nor inflict on him ordinary and extraordinary tortures in order to force from the weak and innocent a confession of crimes he never thought of the penalties in their code of laws are forfeitures of property proportioned to every degree of crime i will mention some for treason and hostilities among princes and ulusses themselves the penalty is forfeitures of their whole property or such a mortification as the wealth and rank of these princes will admit of for disertion in general war for cowardice or illconduct in battle the forfeiture of a commandingofficer is as heavy as his circumstances will admit of their arms are taken from them they are degraded and led about in womens clothes for murder the punishment is very great but does not affect the life nor wound the body of the criminal even though he were a parricide if men quarrel and fight and one is killed every one who was a standerby and did not strive to prevent it is fined a horse where a man is kiled in public games the party killing is to receive and maintain the wife and children of the deceased for assaults and wounds the fines are proportioned to the injury done it is enacted how much shall be paid to atone for a tooth ear and each finger of the hand parents or parentsinlaw who beat their children without a cause are also liable to fines there are also fines for insults or affronts the principal of which to men is pulling the hair or beard tearing off the fringe from the cap spitting or throwing sand in the face and to women pulling their tresses or touching them wantonly on the bosom or elsewhere in this latter case the punishment is adapted to the age of the transgressor for adultery and whoredom which is often committed with slaves and for bestiality the fines are but small it would be too extensive to give a detail of the fines annexed for interruption of hunting extinguishing of lamps detaining lost cattle or keeping a lost carcass without giving notice of it and other little cases the severest punishment is inflicted for theft besides the restitution of the stolen goods and a fine of cattle it is enacted that the robber even of a trifle shall lose one finger unless he thinks proper to buy off this corporal punishment by paying five head of cattle there are even fines annexed to stealing needles or yarn and in an appendix to this code galdankhan himself added that an overseer of one hundred tents or an amiak should be responsible for the thefts committed by his subjects and that the overseers of a chatun knowing of a theft and not giving notice of it shall lose a hand but the common people are to be laid in irons and he that has been three times convicted of theft shall lose all the property he has the fines are chiefly great and small cattle in proportion to the circumstances of the delinquent and the heinousness of the crime or offense and are divided between the nojonn the clergy and the plaintiff the fines of persons of rank are a certain number of arrows helmets and other warlike acoutrements the highest fine inflicted on a prince for hostility is  00 coats of mail  00 camels and  000 horses and to enforce the payment the other princes are to rise in one body against him and should he have ruined whole ulusses or large aimaks they deprive him of his all keeping one half to themselves and dividing the other among the injured party for some crimes the perpetrator is to lose one or more of his children the smallest fine is a male or female goat or a small number of arrows  some of their laws are a kind of proverbs says took for example  let him that proves fainthearted in battle be carried through the camp in womens apparel  let him that lifts his hand against his commander or senior pay a penalty of twentyseven head of cattle  let him that commits murder lose his wife and possessions  if any give a blow in an affray by which he breaks his antagonists thumb let him forfeit eighteen head of cattle if the middle finger nine etc  let a thief who cannot make good what he has stolen be beaten and drag after him a log and also be marked with a burning iron if the theft be great he may be sold for a slave  rape of a virgin is fined nine head of cattle and adultery the same  among their laws it is also stipulated that a betrothed girl cannot be married under the age of fourteen and not later than twenty and then if he to whom she is betrothed will not take her she may be given to another provided the nojonn has been first made acquainted with it the number of cattle which a father may accept for his daughter and the reciprocal present he is to make are ascertained according to the rank of the parties from fifty camels and four hundred sheep to fifteen horses as many oxen and twenty sheep it is also a law that every year out of forty kibitks or habitations four persons must marry each is to receive from the public fund ten head of cattle as a reward or purchase for the bride and the bridegroom is to have from the father some old clothes in return  none dare appear defore the prince otherwise than sitting on his legs but without crossing them in their ordinary manner all heads are uncovered when his commands are recited common people greet each other with a mendu which implies the same as salve or save ye among the romans if it be a long time since they have seen each other they lay their two hands flatways together on the festival zagan they kiss each other but at other times never not even between lovers in conversation they are not very ceremonious but are excessively submissive to superiors and show an uncommon reverence to the aged  when taking a solemn oath they put the muzzle of their firelock to their mouth and kiss it or in want of such a piece touch their tongue with an arrow put it is point to their head and say god destroy me i will be born again in no wild beast if i say an untruth in weighty and important cases they are proved by fireordeal the head of an ax or other iron is heated till it is redhot and the accused is to carry it at the end of his fingers to the distance of some fathoms if he does this and is not burnt he is acquitted of the charge i was told that some are so skilful in this business that by moving their fingers quickly they will receive no injury which is considered as a proof of their innocence  but i must proceed to their religion and speak of those spiritual and temporal customs as have any connection with it their doctrine is the religion of lama mostly the same with that of their brethren the mongols whom they copy in language writing and manner of living in this religion we find as in that of brahma a complete system of the structure of the world it is past and future state envelloped in a labyrinth of fables and crafty illusions it includes the old doctrine of metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls in so strict a sense as that all their deities who formerly were men had before their deification been rigorously subject to their law having wandered through many animal bodies they pass from the body of one beast into another till they have gradually effaced their slight transgressions by penance and remorse common souls proceed directly to the judgment seat in paradise without any wandering and receive the decree that disposes of them for ever this is their faith at least as to their principal idols the kalmuck religion in the externals or ceremonials has so near an affinity to many practiced by some sects of christians i mean in their opinions of the change of the world and several other points that it is probable to those who give a scope to conjecture that the religions of brahma and lama are much connected with that of the nestorians some few ceremonies in their divine service which i will describe will justify this supposition but before i proceed i will give my readers some account of the lama doctrine which is contained and dispersed in innumerable writings part of which i have collected from several translations of little mongalian theological authors which i was favored with from the protopope or high priest of the christian kalmucks at stawropal andrew tschubofskoi who is perfectly acquainted with their language i shall add also what i could gather from conversation respecting this extensive fabulous doctrine that a better knowledge may be formed of it and that it may be seen how far the brahma faith corresponds with it i have been informed that the indians of which there are no small number in astrachan not only acknowledge the kalmucks to be their brethren but pay also divine honor to the kalmuck idols called burchan ajuscha and dschakdschimmum which have a great resemblance to those of the tangutians if this be true it is an incontestable proof that the religion of lama originated in india and that the kalmucks are descendants of the mongols  in the beginning we have the whimsical story of the lamas about the system of the universe they say that at first without any creator there was an immense space or chaos whose width and depth amounted to    0000 leagues or beres each league or bear being equal to about six english miles but they fix no time of it is commencement in this space gathered some goldcoloured clouds which shed a rain so abundantly as to form the unmeasurable ocean that an immense thick froth grew upon the sea like milk the dimensions of which is also expressed in their books and that from this froth issued all living creatures and that from men their idols were produced that a storm next arose from certain parts of the heavens which gave existence to a column extending from the upperregion to far below the deepest bottom of the elementary ocean they call this column sjumer sula and say it is circumference amounts to some thousands of leagues or beres about this column as an axis move the habitable worlds but how the sun moon and stars came to exist in the upperregions their treatises give no account they say the sun consists of glass and fire and is some hundred leagues in circumference and as they hold glass to be one part of the body of the sun and have burningglasses among them it is plain that such glasses must have been known a great while in the east they deem the moon to be somewhat smaller than the sun and make it consist of glass and water the number of stars they fix at ten thousand millions which will lead our astronomers to judge of their other calculations the sun in the kalmuck system has an orbicular course round the middle part of the great column or sjumer sula this column shows four sides each of a different color one silver one skyblue one golden and one of a deepred when the sun casts it is beams on the silverside the dawn begins and if by degrees the brightblue is illuminated noon makes it is entrance but it is not perfect noon till it shines upon the golden side and when it throws it is light on the deepred side the twilight commences and continues till the sun hides itself from our view behind the column and this is night  about the column they say roll in general four great worlds and between these the smaller ones joined in couples of which they reckon eight and all the stars and worlds are made fast to it with a great ironring among the greater worlds stands ours on the right which they call sambutup as a great number of trees grow on it unknown to them but called by them jsambubarachia opposite to this is a world inhabited by giants ulyum schibiytutup the third world they call ukiredlektschi on which there are only cows but in the fourth world mundoutotup exist a people without souls they live  000 years without sickness and when the time of their dissolution draws near on the seventh day preceding their end they hear a voice calling them by their names and announcing their deadwarrant they then call their relations and friends together and take a lasting farewell  they describe all these worlds as very extensive to which no other creature except their idols can pass and these can go from one world to another besides these worlds they reckon seven other abodes eight little oceans and many clouds on which reside their aerial spirits in the vast vacuum and say that the whole system is encompassed and fastened as it were together by an enormous ironring giving and relating circumstantial stories of all these brainless chimeras  in our world they say spring four principal rivers from four mountains to which they give the following remarkable names ganga schilda baktschu and aipera between these four mountains feeds for four months in a year an elephant of which they relate many wonders and call him gasarsakikjin kowen or the protector of the earth this elephant is some miles long and high and white as snow has thirtythree red heads on each head six trunks on each trunk six fountains and upon the fountains six stars each star beset with a virginoffspring of their aerial spirits on the central head of the elephant rides the great genius of the earth called churmustu tenga when he goes from one place to another  immediately after the creation of the world men reached a very distant age lived nearly  0000 years were fed by invisible gifts of grace kididianar and had the wonderful power of raising themselves to heaven all this time transmigration was general and all men were chubulgans or regenerated this regeneration in human bodies according to the doctrine of the lamas is a thorough change from common mortality a rare prerogative allowed only to the clergy some persons of a holy disposition and to the nojonns or princes it was also in that age or epoch when the thousand burchans or idols whom the kalmucks worship went to heaven  this was followed say they by an unlucky epoch the earth produced a certain sweettasting herb like honey which is called in their books schime and there was a voracious man who eat thereof and made it known to all the rest hereby all the holiness of mankind and their power of flying to heaven ceased their longevity and gigantic stature decreased and they lived a great while in darkness till the sun and stars took their origin  after men had fed a certain time upon this plant it failed and they were forced to support life with a ki of earthbutter that looked ruddy and had a very sweet taste but this failing also they had recourse to a sort of sedge salasemis and began to store it up and make provision of it but instead of it is increasing it fell entirely away this is the epoch when virtue took her flight from the earth and adultery murder and injustice made their inroads among men they began at this time to cultivate the land and chose the wisest among them as their chief this chief divided the land and other goods among his people and is at last become the khan  in this state according to their opinion lives the present age during the past goldenage several of the thousand burchans or idols of that happy period appeared on earth in order to reform mankind for example at that time when the life of man had decreased to  0000 years appeared in the empire of enednai which perhaps is that of the mogul ebdefchiburchan the destroyer and preached religion at the decline of human life to  0000 he was followed by altandschidaktiburchan the golden unalloyed when life fell to  0000 years came gerelsakiktschiburchan the preserver of the world one might suppose that under this and the preceding name lies some obscure and deformed tradition of the savior and after him mafsuschiriburchan upon this world and finally when the limits of mans age dropped to one hundred years the great burchan and founder of the doctrine of lama dschakshimuni came down and preached to the sixtyone nations of the earth but it is to be lamented say they that each listened to the doctrine with different ears it having produced as many religions and languages as there are nations  dschakshimuni   the following are the revelations of lama on futurity the age and also the form of men and all created beings will from our times so much decrease that horses will not be bigger than hares and men will be scarce three feet high will live but ten years but will be marriageable at five months old after this sickness and death will come among them and carry off the greatest part before all people die the aerial spirits will make themselves heard and it will rain mortal shots a few of the remaining dwarfs frightened out of their senses will take provision for seven days hide themselves in dark holes and the land will be overspread with carcases and blood after this will follow rain which shall wash away all the dead bodies and every impurity into the desert ocean and a fragrant shower will cleanse the earth then shall the heavens rain down clothes and food for those whose lives were spared and they shall begin to live virtuously and a vast space of time shall pass during which the limits of human life shall extend to  0000 years when this epoch shall be fulfilled the age of man shall begin again to decrease a regenerated burchan bright with holiness called maidarin shall come into the world and his greatness and beauty shall be wonderful and ineffable men will be astonished and enquire of him the cause of his form and beauty and when the idol shall have told them that he has attained such perfection by a victory over his passions abstaining from all murder and practicing all virtue men will become converts and attain a similar perfection by the same means  this is the kalmuck system of the universal restoration of all things but from the different epochs and changes which the world in their opinions is still to undergo they seem to have a very extensive but confused idea of it insomuch that it was with difficulty i could form any tolerable comprehension of their system to the epochs of the world whose continuation is very unequal they give the universal name of galahp derived from the word gal fire as most will end with fire they reckon seven times seven epochs which are thus to terminate after every seven fiery epochs one will follow ending with a flood and after all these one ending with a hurricane all these small divisions of time are divided into four chief periods called achugalap ebderekugalap choasimgalap and toktochugalap in the first division or period containing the time wherein the life of man from an extent of  0000 years decreases to ten years are two epochs in the second all mankind will die for this reason they call it ebderekugalap the destroying period after this a time will come when the earth shall lie waste and this is called choasimgalahp or the waste period and then a storm or hurricane shall bring departed souls from hell which is the last period but the time and place is not plainly ascertained  i have mentioned the time when the burchans or gods of the kalmucks were raised from mortality they are so numerous and they relate so much of each as to fill whole folios but their tales are so confused and the kalmuck clergy so ignorant that it is difficult to make out the context without translating and comparing many of their writings so far it is certain that these burchans have originated from holy men or men pretending to holiness who have asserted that they passed through many bodies before they were regenerated or from fabulous persons or deformed idols of some other more ancient religion i could not absolutely find out whether besides these burchans they admit of some higher supreme being or whether they account for the first operative principles in the manner of epicurus but from what has been related i should rather suppose the latter to be the case good and bad events are governed by burchans and good or malignant aerial spirits there seems to be degrees of rank among their burchans at least they differ much from one another in power and occupation i think they look upon burchan abida as the most exalted of the whole though the supposed founder of the superstitions of lama dshakshimuni is more popularly worshipped and known it is image is almost always seen among the kalmuck idols  it is remarkable that almost all their idols except the dalailama and some other priestlylooking images are represented as women with the flaps of their ears long and pierced having indian ornaments and their feet turned underneath themselves or else in a sitting posture yet i saw some standing images with many arms and faces the kalmucks represent also their god of hell or erlikchan as standing  delailama   most of their idols are ornamented with a tippet which is a badge of dignity worn by the priests of lama some with the bell and scepter which the priest commonly holds in his hand or lays before him during service propitious burchans seem to be painted with a certain sweetness and beauty of countenance but the malignant ones inspire fright and horror i was lucky enough to meet with a great collection of these idols in jaizkoigorodok which were cast hollow in brass strongly gilt and so neatly executed as to equal if not surpass the engraved figures the foot of each burchan is made hollow closed with a plate of copper and contains a little cylinder made of ashes wrapped up in a piece of paper or the upper bast of the birchtree with a tangutian inscription or at least a ticket with such an inscription these cylinders of ashes are undoubtedly considered as relics of the holy bodies which the burchans once inhabited i shall have occasion to mention presently that the ashes of such persons as are supposed to be regenerated are sent to the chief pontiff or high priest of this religion at thibet it is also certain that if once the cover of the foot of such an image is opened the kalmucks consider it as profaned and it is no longer saleable they purchase with avidity and at high rates from the russian merchants those burchans which at the destroying of the sjungorian or dsungorian power became the plunder of the kirguese trucking with the russians for other things provided the foot of such idols has not been opened and the inner part has remained untouched  besides their idols cast in metal and silver they have figures painted or drawn upon chinese paper or stuffs of which i have seen some very fine i have met with some also impressed in clay which had the appearance of sigillata and were painted red or plated with gold such images they keep in coppercases in pyramids made for that purpose  i cannot speak more positively of the abodes of their burchans than that they reside on the worlds and stars or in other places of the celestial space of the kalmucksystem dschakshimmuni is said to dwell upon earth erlikkhan has his place in hell of which he is the mighty prince some have given them abodes in the uppermost parts of the firmament to which there is a goldenroad over a high mountain at the top of this mountain rides a cloud apparently made of jasper on which resides the aerial spirit adabaschi at the bottom of this mountain are a great number of foxes which attack the souls of the wicked and thus detain them from the blessed abodes which are the principal paradise underneath the goldenroad is a silverone which leads eastward to that peculiar abode where abidaburchan enjoys a perfect rest next follows a copperroad leading to the abodes of thirtythree propitious spirits near which is a place for the souls of children and those that have not been truly meritorious at the lowest bottom of the mountain is an ironpath that leads to hell  before i proceed fatrher i will relate two instructive stories of the kalmuck mythology they report of burchan dschakdshimmuni that whilst his soul inhabited the body of a hare seeing a man almost starved with hunger he ran voluntarily into his hands and that the genius of the earth admired this noble act so much that he placed the form of a hare in the moon as a monument to afterages and the kalmucks believe now they see a hare in the moon  the other story is curious and to the best of my recollection there is a similar tale in the life of an indian idol told in the letters of a jesuitmissionary i must observe first that the kalmucks imagine that there are always certain evil spirits and agents of their gods of hell hovering in the air i mean the lower class of kalmucks and their clergy for there are as in other countries kalmuckfreethinkers who laugh at such absurd stories they believe that a miraculous dragon called luuchan lives during winter in the water and rises into the air in spring when some of the infernal agents ride upon him when it lightens they suppose this dragon opens it is jaws and when it thunders that the deputy of hell is whipping him till he roars again for pain once it happened that as the three burchans mafsuschini dschakdshimmuni and maidarin were sitting together praying and in profound devotion with their eyes shut according to the kalmuck custom a malignant spirit drew near and let fall his excrements into the sacred bowl which persons of sacerdotal dignity commonly have before them when praying as soon as these holy men saw this they deliberated together how they should act if they threw this venomous matter into the air all beings there they thought would perish but if they poured the infected bowl over the earth every living creature would instantly be killed they agreed therefore to swallow the contents themselves mafsuschini and maidarin drank first and as dschakdshimmuni was to finish the bowl the sediment was so thick as almost to strangle him so that he looked blue in the face for this reason he is still represented in pictures with a blue face but in cast figures with a blue lacquered cap  i have more than once mentioned those aerial spirits which make the greatest figure in the fabulous doctrine of lama and observed that they were generally called tengri we may compare them to guardian saints and romancatholic angels some are propitious others malignant spirits and both are very much inferior to the burchans neither are they supposed to be immortal they are divided into various classes some of which i am unacquainted with and have stated abodes near and in the worlds and in the great vacuum they know the size of every one and how long each will live near our earth are four such evil spirits called macharasa who are only     fathoms high above these dwell the thirtythree spirits already mentioned who are   0 fathoms in height and one among them called tejusbijaschubilgaksam is said to be taller still another sort called chublgaksamedlekschi are near three miles in height and live  0 0 000 years there are some others     000 miles high whose tedious barbarian names i shall omit a day to these spirits is as fiftyyears to men and they live  00 years composed of such days as wonderful as are the properties given them so wonderful is their propagation some generate only by kisses embracing themselves others by smiling at each other by a wink and a glance and some only by friendly looks as far as i could learn in conversation with some kalmuck priests they believe that all bad weather and unlucky events among which are numbered the abovementioned bad epochs of the world arise from malignant spirits who nevertheless must yield and submit to the power of tangutian prayers and exorcisms but the propitious spirits whose faces are bright and white as snow and burchans are interested in the good of the world and mankind  an essential indeed the chief article in the religion of lama and which must have the greatest influence upon morality is their doctrine of the state of the soul after death respecting hell and rewards i collected many accounts on this subject and shall communicate the most probable  hell is situated in the middle region between heaven and earth here the matter is very indefinite but the following is more circumstantial in a large city encompassed with white walls wherein there is a continual beating of kettledrums the mighty burchan erlik khan unlimited governor of hell and judge of departed souls holds his residence in a spacious palace  erlikkhan   on one side of the city is a large ocean of urine and excrement which constitutes the first abode of the damned over this sea passes the above mentioned ironpath which has this admirable quality that if wicked souls who have treated the principles of their religion or the gurban erdeni gurbanerdeni frequently occurs in books of the religion of lama and means literally the holy trinity but they mean by it the three principles of their religion namely lama the burchans and pure faith with contempt and have not respected the clergy wander through it the path underneath their feet will become so thin as to break under them and precipitate them into the place of punishment farther on is a sea of blood in which many human heads are swimming these are they who during their life had sowed discord and occasioned bloodshed among friends and relations farther on still is a remote white land where many of the damned endeavor to dig for water and food without being able to find it and whose hands and arms are so much wounded in digging that they drop from their shoulders with exquisite pain but grow again to renew their torments these are people who gave whilst they lived neither meat drink nor clothing to the priests the other divisions of hell which are in number eighteen are situated round the palace of erlikkhan in every division the wretched souls suffer a degree of punishment proportioned to their offenses each division having an infernal esed and devils to torment the damned their devils are represented with all sorts of frightful forms black with the heads of goats lions and unicorns in one division of this place many run about without feet for having despised the doctrines of the priesthood in another are sitting those rich persons who though living in abundance never administered to the wants of the poor these are in an unheardof condition are transformed into monsters whose heads and bodies are each as big as a mountain and their neck as small as a thread in other places dreadful pits of unremitted yells the cruel are tormented those who have either killed their parent elders or other men cattle or even insects for according to the tenets of lamaism it is sinful to kill purposely even the smallest vermin that infect and plague mankind and they are of opinion that the souls of all animals so destroyed will when in transmigration they inherit other bodies seek revenge in other divisions are multitudes of mockers of religion whose ears some little devils are always filling with burning soot that eager as they may be they may not hear each other wretches who have robbed the the sacred shrines of burchans burnt spiritual books or have proudly lived are in a particular place thrown into boiling caldrons filled with serpents in other places the damned are continually roasting upon gridirons or spitted with a lance there is also a place where there are one hundred and eight hooks fastened in a cloud of ordure on which sinners are hung and when the wind blows them down they fall on sharp points which lie underneath and tear their bodies to pieces yet still a voice is heard that calls them back to life and their punishment continues some hundred millions of years constantly torn to pieces and their limbs beat and pounded in mortars there are also dark yet redhot infernal dungeons and here and there a cold hell where sinful men are frozen to death before the rising or the sun and are dragged about by furies till they are thawed to life again in order to renew their torments farther on is a place where those who spent their life in dress and lived luxuriously are punished a pack of little devils are here employed in forging currycombs and when redhot tearing therewith the backs of sinners lastly there is another place where delinquents are squeezed between iron blocks in form of millstones and always brought back to life to be squeezed to death again there is a place where cattle inhabited by human souls have sinned and also suffer the punishment of eating and drinking without ever being satisfied it is not to be wondered at that they should fix an abode in hell for cattle for according to the lama faith they have the high prerogative of entering into the paradise of burchans and aerial spirits but this wellpoliced hell has no place of punishment for lust which is very little thought of wherever this religion prevails  great and holy lamas who have been zealous in their office and obtained a victory over all their passions pass when they die by the aid of their prayers only of which the words om ma wie pad me chum have the greatest influence immediately into heaven to the abode of the burchans where they enjoy perfect rest with other godly souls and exercise themselves in divine service till the time of their regeneration comes  common souls are received by the infernal agent who brings them before erlikkhan where they they must account for their past actions and justify themselves if they can do this so as to leave no doubt of their righteousness they are sent with honor to the blessed abodes he ordering a flying cloud with a golden throne to transport such a soul those who living on earth did much good and much evil have a good burchan for their advocate to plead their cause with the infernal deputy erlikkhan who orders the large book to be brought where all the actions of men are registered and examines it and should the cause be doubtful he takes a balance writes the good against the evil and pronounces sentence accordingly and the soul so sentenced is delivered to the burchans or good aerial spirits or to the keeper of that division where they are to suffer punishment or they may possibly obtain a pass to the world again for erlikkhan has a power to send some departed souls back to their bodies and uses this means to preach repentance through them to the living part of men and it is from these returned sinners that they receive all their accounts of hell and a future life  infernal punishments according to the opinion of lamas are not eternal for each a time is fixed but by it is astonishing duration it is almost equal to eternity however it often happens that the omniscient burchan chomschinbodisada who is represented nearly like dsshakdschimmuni has mercy on departed souls or that some holy deceased lama being mislead to hell by mistake shall by some tangutian prayers release part of the tormented souls and bring them back to happier abodes but it may be easily conceived that such as have offended either the clergy or the burchans cannot be partakers of this fortunate delivery as their punishment is never to be shortened  there are also some books wonderfully endowed with the power of freeing wicked souls from their merited punishment provided they have in the course of their lives diligently read them copied them or or carried them about with them among these may be numbered one containing certain unintelligible revelations entiltled the mystery of dshodbo the contents of which i am unacquainted with yet i have had accounts of the miraculousness of this book in expelling diseases lengthening of life banishing malignant spirits and delivering sinners from the severest infernal punishment  it is evident from the accounts here set forth on which perhaps i have rather dwelt too long and which contain all the principal points of the tedious religion of the lamas that like other superstitions they are the fabric of priests and illusions by which they contrive to awe the ignorant multitude thanks to superstition so common to ignorant men for the great success of the sacerdotal tribe in establishing this religion whereby they multiply their number by increasing the advantages of their clerical supremacy over the disciples of lama and enslave even nobles and princes  the order of this idolatrous priesthood which is honored with the general title of churbrak cannot be better compared than to that of the roman catholics their head or delailama may be considered as the pope except that his soul is continually wandering from one human body to another and is deified the residence of this famous man whom the infatuated kalmucks adore as a burchan living upon earth is called by the vulgar barauntala by others pontal or batalailassau according to the reports of some pilgrims dispached from the kalmuck horde to this court in matters of religious concern or who travel hereby their own holy zeal the cloisters of delailama into which no woman is suffered to enter are situated on a high mountain which has been dug through in such a manner that a stream issues from it is center it is said to contain  00 pagod or temples the reader may form a better idea of the dress of the delailama from the representation in the plate taken from a brazen figure of this burchan than by any description i can give the pointed cap is like a monks hood on the outer robe and can be let down the color of this holy mans garment is always yellow and they consider this and red as the most sacred of all colors  this deity they suppose to be immortal because the soul of the living delailama when dead passes into the body of his successor sometimes they have two of equal eminence and power into both of whom the soul of the deceased delailama has passed hence arose the chutuchta at the head of the lamaism of china and the delailama of thibet the delailama which implies a deity at an immense distance is honored as a god all his words are considered as oracles he appoints the chief priests and nominates princes he lives in a pagoda on the mountain potata under    degrees   min n latitude and    degrees    min w longitude from peking he eats no flesh sits always crosslegged on an altar answers questions and blesses supplicants his followers says took assert that his soul after the death of his body passes into another human body born exactly at that time and this man is the new delailama others say that they keep a young man in the pagoda during the the life of the delailama who is to succeed him  this religion seems not of very ancient date it is a mixture of the superstition of the old schamans with the christian religion as taught by the nestorians the first delailama being no other than prester john the catholicus or nestorian patriarch who traveled into this country to convert the savages the schaman religion is the oldest in india the god of which the mongols call by the name dshakschimuni and can be no other than the wellknown schaka or schekia who was born  0   years before our savior and was called after his apotheosis fo as christianity then became more and more corrupted it at last vanished away and was here absorbed in the religion of lama  every prince has in his horde a vicelama subordinate to the delailama and appointed by the court at petersburgh this person performs in his district what the delailama does over all the church he ordains priests forgives sins bestows blessing and gives amulets to the dying  among the turgout kalmucks is a lama or substitute of delailama whose place is always filled by one of the present highest order of the clergy when the sjungor ulusses arrived they had also a lama but i could not learn with certainty whether there are two such patriarchs at present in this horde now united under the russian scepter the garments of these lamas differ in nothing from the former except that the upperrobe has sleeves which they put on in cold weather they are also considered by the silly kalmucks as burchans and are worshipped with outstretched arms as burchans are the benediction a lama gives consists only in laying his hands upon the person he blesses but i have seen many brazen images of dalailama himself represented with that display of the hands wherewith the zordshi or bishops give their benediction  the following is a representation of one    the lama has a uluss to himself consisting of one hundred tents of priests and receives besides an annual tribute horses and camels from the lower clergy  the higher order of the clergy next the lama are the zordshi which may be translated bishop their garments used to be yellow or red and they have sleeves in the undergarment yet like the lama they wear the red order continually and go like the latter without breeches that they may not defile themselves by touching any part of their body upon certain necessary occasions  common priests who compose the lower class of regular clergy are called gellung and live dispersed throughout the whole horde so that to every   0 or  00 tents may be reckoned one who performs divine service for his aimak a gellung has nothing to live on but the little presents his people make him on festival and prayerdays these priests and all those that belong to them are exempt from secular offices and importduties a gellung salutes his prince only by turning up his whiskers every gellung has many schosars mandshi whom he instructs in theology and the tangutian language and who sing with him in idolworship and learn to use the sacred instruments he has also a deacon or assistant called gadsul to which office he may appoint any of his scholars but a man cannot be ordained a priest but by a particular form and at the residence of the lama  they have another ecclesiastical officer corresponding with our sexton or vestrykeeper he attends only on the higher order of the clergy and takes care of a magnificent tent erected for the assembling of the burchans this lower order of priests does not differ from the kalmucks in dress except that their heads are shaved all over not wearing that tuft of hair behind which the lay kalmucks do the heads of all their scholars are so shaven at their admission and with a degree of ceremony neither have they any fringed appendage to their caps like the superior order of clergy they take a vow of celibacy and continence but a mandshi or scholar before he is ordained may with special commission of his priest quit the sacred profession and marry  as divine service among the kalmucks is performed throughout in the tangutian language every priest must at least be able to read it and be provided with those prayers and songs requisite for every hour and day and occasional solemnity and in every priests habitation is found a variety of mongalian writings in which are described the idolatrous ceremonies besides the offices used in sickness funerals and the like they have certain ceremonies of exorcism called tarni by which they pretend to cure diseases medicine they know little of their chief remedies are prayers and certain amulets each kalmuck wears an amulet hanging on his bare bosom sewed up in a piece of leather which he receives from his priest i have seen large pieces of cottonstuff on which was printed all kind of insignificant colored figures to each of which was added a tangutian exorcism with an inscription in mongalian for what purposes it it may be used the prints that make these figures are kept by the priests  no priest can be without the astrological books of of his religion from which he ascertains auspicious days and hours for certain acts and events which every kalmuck applys to his priest for information in before he undertakes any thing of consequence it is confidently said that the flight of a certain white owl strix nyctea which inhabits the steps foretells good or ill fortune according as it flies to the right or left if when they see him he directs his flight to the left they endeavor to turn him to the right and fancy this will give a change to fate  the largest and most important book in the possession of the kalmuck priests and which is said to contain an accurate and full account of their idols is entitled bodimer but i heard of an abridgment of the whole mythology of lama called ertjunzjuntoali  the common priests have their idols with them in their tents which are generally made of white felts it being ordained that a burchan shall inhabit no other they are kept with their religious books in small trunks and are put under the bedsted but the best burchans are set up in cases above before the trunks in which these idols are stands a little table or altar on which are always eight or nine little silver bowls and a lamp or lanthorn on the firehearth is another bowl made of iron fastened on an iron bar stuck into the ground into this bowl the gellung pours some drops of all the liquor he intends to use in sacrifice and never drinks any from any bowl but his own without pronouncing these words om a chum that is may all be pure god give abundance and prosper this drink they have several other laconic forms of prayer in this burchans tent sleeps the gellung and his gadful or some of his scholars  the kalmucks keep three days in each month sacred as these days are regulated by the moon and they begin the month with the new moon their first general supplicationday is the eighth after the new moon the second is on the fifteenth and the third on the thirtieth on such day no zealous kalmuck eats or drinks any thing but what is made of milk and spends best part of the day near the tent of his priest to which they are called to worship in the morning by the beating of a kettledrum and a kind of wooden or copper trumpet none dare come near the tent but the nobles and the learned a multitude of both sexes sits round about and drops from rosaries which they hold in their hands one bead after another pronouncing at each om ma wie pad me chum with their eyes shut or rehearsing with a low voice another short form of prayer which they have by heart without knowing it is meaning the more quiet the people are the more noisy is the priest in worship and with his red robe and crown of roses he cuts no small figure long strips of cotton on which are written tangutian prayers and fastened at the end of high poles are stuck up before the tent by way of flag from an opinion that the waving motion of such prayers in the wind are as efficacious as a recital of them see a representation of a tomb so adorned in the plate kalmucks before the burchans burns a light and the abovementioned little bowls are filled with dried meat cheese or other victuals there are also some large bowls filled with the same they also lay down before the altar of the burchans grits milk etc it is a crime among the kalmucks to pass by such a bowl and i saw they were displeased with me for so doing rich priests place small frankincense candles upon their altars before the burchans but poor ones are content to strew at the commencement of their prayers which last the whole day some frankincense on burning cowdung supported by an iron trivet on these days the burchans in splendid dress are exposed to the people by placing them on the trunk before the altar and some small rags of green red or yellow silk are hung over their shoulders by way of cloak add to this all the paperpaintings which the priest possesses are hung up within the tent as banners of their saints  the priest himself who performs the service or the gods sits in his usual place bareheaded his breast uncovered the red sacerdotal tippet over his shoulders and a rosary about his neck before the priest stands a little bench on which is another bowl with water an elegant metal bell with a handle a small scepter which represents the burchans and two plates near it sit or stand in a row his gedsul and his scholars choristers all bareheaded with red bands over their shoulders these bawl out the hymn as loud as possible from written sheets before them or play on instruments to increase the noise of the singers the instruments consist of great kettledrums a kind of hautboy made of a human shinbone with a copper venthole and a mouthpiece which gives a shrilling sound and an instrument in the form of plates used by the janissaries which the priest himself sometimes takes in hand it may easily be conceived what an odious noise these must make especially at the court of lama where there is a vast many of them joined in chorus by a multitude of priests holding their little bells in their lefthands and the sacerdotal sceptres between the two middlefingers and thumb of the right hand i saw some metal bells used on similar occasion the clappers of which were leather bags filled with sand but which gave a strong sound the lama is said to sit motionless surrounded by his bishops during the service the bishops give the blessing with such a gesture as is represented in the idol see p      these noisy songs are sometimes interrupted by still prayers muttered by the priest with open outstretched arms closed eyes and frequent bowing they have some variations in their ceremonies for public festivals which are probably enjoined and for particular reasons but to become acquainted with all the minutiae would require the study of many years and a knowledge of the tangutian and mongol language  the melody of these people particularly their soft and tender music has such a longdrawn mournful tone and at the same time so dissonant that a good ear is nearly as much hurt with it as with old french music besides the votive amorous and plaintive songs produced every day by their poets they have likewise a great number recording the romantic achievements of their heroes with monstrous legendary songs of chivalry and acts of wizzard prowess dragons with  0000 heads and gigantic animals without a name which they sing in a loud voice with very little cadence and frequently interrupted by a sudden dead sound the time is now and then varied but they are chiefly a monotony sung by rote and divided into strophes  the following is an elegy sung in the person of a new married woman to her husband chasaartaechaen chaarraani chabschoolchodu jaachodok bui chairladak innakgien tellaeaedub sobochu du jaachodok bui damchan egae schettekzaen darki tschin baelae by damchan egae

horse which thou ridest till he was lean how were thou humbled with once riding him true lovers we are and will thou not hear me was i not once thine only and best beloved at yonder river the river of pines thou were brisk and active and did you not find me lovely and pliant   the following expresses the passion of a kalmuck maiden for her lover translated from their language  as early in the matin as the larks raise their notes so early do i listen to their song and so early do i muse on my beloved ah father excelling at the bow ah mother of a temper most benign can i only enjoy a lover in my thoughts the deepest thoughts are but deceitful sensual perceptions alone are real let this my souls darling be told to you how powerful are the calls of nature how unknown is the time of our meeting but to return to the kalmuck religion besides the three days of supplication mentioned the kalmucks have three great festivals celebrated with all those amusements the reader will be more acquainted with the first and most important is that on which they begin their new year they call it zachansara the white day or chaburunturnsara the first day of spring and it commences with the first new moon in april the next important begins with the first new moon in june and is called ssagassara or suniturunsara the beginning of summer at this time for a fortnight the kalmucks take as much flour to their priest as they can afford of which they get round cakes made in the form of a cone i saw in the tents of some gellungs brazen moulds of them ornamented with some insignificant characters and fastened on woodenhandles when they are baked and have stood some time before the burchans they are thrown into water when a man is sick even at other times of the year he gets a figure made in dough either a man an ox a dog etc agreeable to the advice of his gellung or some holy book which having stood some time before the burchan is to be thrown either into the fire or water in order to appease the malignant spirit who has caused the sickness these figures are called zaza  the third feast is in november or begins with the new moon in december and is called uwilinturunsara the commencement of winter or sulainsara as they burn at this solemnity a kind of holy candles brought from thibet by the pilgrims which candles thev call sula i was not made acquainted with all the particular ceremonies used at these feasts but i will mention a few  there is nothing more peculiar in the kalmuck worship than the use of a little vessel similar to our coffeepots called bumba which on every day of public service is wound round with a white band ornamented with pheasants and peacocks feathers and set upon the altar of the burchans near the lanthorn this little pot is filled with sweet water to which the kalmucks attribute a miraculous virtue on such feast and prayerdays every faithful kalmuck has a few drops of this water poured on the palm of his hand which he devoutly and confidently licks up as a preservative against many evils gellungs generally give a cup of this sweet water to the sick and one for a trifling piece of money which i laid upon the altar would fain have persuaded me to drink some of it saying it would do me good every thing that is placed upon the altars is sacred and must not be touched especially on festivals when i attempted to take hold of a burchan to inspect it closer the gellung spread his silk rag in which he used to wrap up his idol over my hands and if he had either eat or drank he would have washed his hands and turned up his beard before he touched the burchan  still more remarkable are a sort of sacred pills brought from thibet it is the noble only and the rich who can obtain them from the priests in cases of sickness and when death seems almost unavoidable they are taken to alienate the soul from this world and sanctify it these pills are black and about the size of a pea i thought they might have contained some opiate but was told they were of a purgative kind  at the tents of some old priests i saw a kind of prayerwheel representing a particolored cylinder with iron axles containing written prayers it is fixed on a wooden frame and turned quickly round with a string wound about it each motion of a written prayer being considered as efficacious as a rehearsal of it  little cylindrical boxes or wheels full of written prayers wound round a stick are distributed by priests to such enthusiastic persons as through a holy rage have determined to go on some pilgrimage or lead a holy and solitary life such hermits and pilgrims must not eat any thing but meat grits or roots after this pilgrimage they conclude their life in sanctity placing over their tents a blue flag on which are written some tangutian prayer and as often as they mean to pray they turn about their cylinder after every turn of the wheel they pronounce the six words om ma wie pad me chum  it is also frequent among the torgouts that husbands weary of life or crazed with holiness shall forsake their wives their children and estates in order to be priests in this case they pass through a kind of noviceship that is their hair must be cut and they must be consecrated gedsulls all the dsjungorians i asked told me there was no such thing among them but many of the torgouts with a holy zeal assured me such an action was pleasing to god  there are also among the kalmucks certain magicians or schamans not belonging to the priests or or holy people but rather abhorred than revered and their arts which are prohibited are often dreaded these are men and women of the lower class of people the former are called uduguhn and the latter boh they exercise their sorcery once a month the night when the moon is new they steep a particular plant in a bowl of water with which they first sprinkle their tents next they take certain dried roots in each hand kindle them and with extended arms make all kind of gestures and violent contortions of the body repeating the following syllables dschi eje jo jo till they fall into an apparent phrenzy when they begin to answer questions respecting things lost and future events  i shall now proceed to those profane customs connected with their religion when a woman is in labor they send for a priest who attends near the tent and reads some tangutian prayers during this time and till the child is born the husband of the woman is to spread a net round his tent and continually fight the air with a cudgel crying gart tschetkirr avaunt devil in order to keep off the internal agent among the rich they place such a number of praying priests on guard round the tent as are sufficient to drive off the malignant spirits during the birth they have not only women but menmidwives who take the child and wash it the women are so strong that they are often seen to ride out the second day after they are brought to bed and to follow their business but they cannot appear otherwise than with their heads veiled or be present at divine worship till after forty days  the common class of kalmucks give their children the first remarkable name they hear or the name of the first man or animal which the father meets after the birth but the wealthy get the priest to study for a name from some holy book which if the father is not pleased with he alters when a boy has reached four years of age he undergoes a kind of confirmation he is brought before the gellung who reads some prayers over him and cuts off some of his hair which the mother is to pick carefully up and carry home wrapped up with an amulet hanging on her back i could never find out the meaning of this ceremony  not having had an opportunity of being present at any of the marriages of the kalmucks i can speak only from hearsay many betroth their children not only in their earliest infancy but in the womb this betrothing is however sacredly performed and conditional that such a one has a boy and such a one a girl the young couple are joined at fourteen years of age or later two years before marriage a bridegroom is allowed to take many little liberties with his bride but should pregnancy happen before the day of marriage an atonement is made to the brides parents by presents prior to the wedding the bridegroom agrees with the girls father as to the portion he is to have with her which consists in a certain number of horses and cattle and the father of the young man in return presents the bride with a new white felttent some household furniture bedcloaths and ornamented feetpillows covered with cotton or silk and laced the gellung is consulted with respect to the day of marriage and he searches by astronomical calculations for a propitious one the new tent is then erected the bride with her parents and relations goes to the bridegroom who with the gellung or priest accompanies them to the tent where he reads some few prayers and orders the brides tresses to be undone and braided in the manner of married women into two tails he next takes the caps of the married couple retires with them and his gadful without the tent smokes them with frankincense says a prayer then returns to the couple blesses them gives the caps to some of the persons present to put them on the bride and bridegrooms head and the ceremony concludes with a feast for a certain time the bride is not permitted to leave her tent and no one is suffered to see her but her mother and the married women of her acquaintance  at the nuptials of princes great entertainments are given a large banquet is prepared and those who carry the eatables to table which are served up in large wooden vessels are preceded by a herald or carver riding on a foxcoloured horse splendidly dressed having over his shoulders a long tippet of fine white linen and his cap trimmed with black fox or otterfur on the wedding day all the priests of the uluss read prayers and the day is concluded with a variety of amusements as horseracing wrestling shooting with the bow etc  the customary diversions of this careless and blithsome people consist in horseracing in which the girls bear a part shooting with the bow for wagers wrestling in which they strip themselves to their trowsers indeed the men and boys among the common people in summertime go about naked except a pair of trowsers hearing the maidens sing pantomimic dances and music performed by the girls who almost all of them play on the lute the kit and the viol a kind of hurdygurdy and the pipe the subjects of their songs are the fabulous stories of gigantic chivalry heroic tales and amorous ditties but their melody is harsh and dismal the kalmucks also play at chess cards and tocadillo much as we do  the nobles eat upon a carpet spread on the ground one cuts all the meat and the rest seize on it with their bare hands when it is swallowed they drink the liquor it was boiled in it would seem that cleanliness with them was a sin being forbidden to wash any vessel in riverwater of course they wipe them only with a piece of old sheepskin on which they wipe their hands when dirty as they dare not put any living creature to death their habitations abound in all kinds of small vermin  according to the principles of the kalmuck religion polygamy is prohibited but this law is not so rigorously observed by nobles and commanders who sometimes will have two or three wives such examples however rarely occur divorces are likewise unlawful yet they happen frequently among their people of distinction if a kalmuck has any reason to be dissatisfied with his wife or if she is herself desirous of a divorce the husband has only to strip her of her clothes and the divorce takes place but he sometimes even whips her away if he wishes to acquit himself honorably he invites her relations to a banquet gives his wife a saddlehorse and as much cattle as he pleases or can afford and she quits him with her friends taking this property with her  when a kalmuck dies the gellung is made acquainted with the moment in which the deceased gave up his spirit he then judges in which of the twelve hours wherein they divide their day and night the deceased left the world and ordains accordingly from a book the manner in which the corpse is to be carried and to what district of heaven and the relations carry it accordingly there are six different modes of burial one is to lay the corpse naked in the open step with the head toward the east and the body in a sleeping position supporting the head with the right arm at the head on both sides and also at the feet they stick poles into the ground on the top of which are fastened square pieces of stuff scribbled over full with tangutian prayers which resemble flags and are called prayerflags the second mode is to carry the corpse to some adjacent wood dressed in the dress of the country in both the above cases the body is left to be devoured by wild beasts by which process they suppose the soul continues it is transmigration the third way is to throw the body into the water this they do with children the fourth to bury it the fifth to cover it with a heap of stones and the sixth to burn it in the first five modes in which they bury the common people and lower order of priests they stick one flag as near the body as they can burying with them the weapons of the deceased and some few presents besides these prayers of the dead a kind of soulmass is read by the priest for the deceased by order of the parents agreeable to the hour in which he gave up his spirit these masses continue fortynine days at the expiration of which three prayerflags are given to the parents by the gellung which they also stick near the corpse and then leave it to itself without any farther notice some however will continue the masses a while longer from the hour of departure they judge whether the deceased was a good or a wicked man and if the body remains unmolested by the beasts of the forest they consider it as an ill omen  burning the dead is only practiced for the superior ranks of clergy or lamas the nojons or princes and a few holy people whom they believe in the regeneration of the ashes of such bodies are carefully collected mixed with frankincense and sent to the delailama at thibet who sends word back into which paradise the newborn soul is arrived through the fire without being metamorphosed into an animal in order to burn them a vaulted oven is built with holes in one of which the body fulldressed is laid upon a bench with three feet the fire blazes out of the oven and is fed with the fat of the body till it is entirely consumed the following mode of interring a kalmuck lady i learnt from one of their own people prince ondou who is still living had a truckmenian wife who begged the favor when dying to be buried in the ground according to the custom of her ancestors in conformity with her request she was buried up to her shoulders but over her bare head a felttent was erected and the corpse so left  august         collecting these accounts and committing them to paper detained me till the   th of august when leaving all my heavy baggage behind me i left jaizkoigorodok for gurjef one of the most southern districts of the russian empire and abounding with natural curiosities  it is remarkable that as i traveled southward i met among the meadowplants of the lowlands several i had not seen before and which are only to be looked for in the warmer districts of europe and asia on so varied a scene i could not but recollect the opinion of strahlenberg who with great reason considers the crossmountains which rise from the glacialsea to the farthest arms of the ural as the natural boundary between europe and northern asia the stepmountains as an immediate continuation of the decreasing and dividing ural which extends itself between the jaik and the samara southwest toward the wolga naturally separate here the more northern districts exhibiting a hilly and fertile land overspread with european plants from the asiatic steps  about five miles from jaizkoigorodok is a very extensive and bushy valley where among other shrubs i found the wildrose the false acacia and the greater meadowsweet which shot forth rods six feet long and which in this country are used for switches on account of their toughness and flexibility this place abounded with the curious insect called the stinking beetle tenebrio variabilis and a kind of earthmoss that covers the loamy surface of the step in whole tracts as with a whitegrey bark which breaks where the ground is particularly dry the cossacks call it semljanoi chleb earthbread and say that many a person out a hunting has lost his life by being obliged to feed upon this moss about the jaik they use it as a medicine but here they are ignorant of it is use  continuing my journey to the next guardstation i there changed horses and had time to look about me where i found the awrag a waterarm full of all forts of wildfowl and abounding with the beeeater merops watertortoises are here uncommonly large i saw one half an ell across the back and this size is said to be the least the common people believe that the bite of this animal is venomous and that it generally bites people while bathing in their private parts it is often found caught in fishing nets and basketwork i found here also a particular kind of shells which grow together in bunches and which to my knowledge are found no where but in the wolga the jaik and the caspian sea mytulus polymorphus  we saw now for the first time upon the jaik upwards of twenty of the spoonbill pelecanus onocrotalus which the natives call baba old woman they were very busy fishing it is well known yet deserves to be repeated that these enormous fowls assemble in lakes and bays form a long row and spreading out their wings all at once drive the fish together which they swallow up in great quantities their time of fishing is about dawn and noon and it is easily to be conceived how much a flock of such fowls will thin a water of fish they weigh here from eighteen to twentyfive pounds each measure from the point of the bill to the top of the tail about five feet and from the extremity of one wing to the other when spread about nine feet and a half if these fowls are disturbed they soar high in the air and fly in long crosswaving lines and even when shot at show not the least confusion from their whiteness they glitter as they fly and though they live on fish their flesh is not indelicate i enquired here about the wandering grasshoppers which are natives of the deserts of asia and was told that they did not come regularly every year nor did they always make their way from the same quarter sometimes they come from the kirguisian sometimes from the western kalmuck district and sometimes from the north up the river jaik and return the same way they arrive in the time of hayharvest and destroy many a fine crop  to the next guardstation i rode all night and it was very sultry owing to the burning of a kirguese step which had continued ten days and though very distant had heated the air all round before the moon rose we saw the light of this fire at east and in the daytime it could be perceived by a column of smoke on which seemed to rest an oblong cloud  in this district on a saltstep especially where the liquorice grows is found a useful plant serratula amara a kind of bitterwort which contains so strong a bitter that it is preferable in medicine to the centaury the cossacks assured me that they had rapidly and radically cured cold fevers with it and that it would cure in cattle the dangerous bites of badgers wolves and mad dogs by screwing it powdered upon the wound buxbaum seems to have described this plant by the name gacea erecta minor latioribus folus as there is plenty of waterfowl in the river jaik the inhabitants are pestered with birds of prey the common seaeagle skopa the large black eagle aquila ossifraga and another little species with a spotted head hitherto undescribed aquila leucorypha have nests almost in every high tree  about noon on the   th of august i reached kalmykowa a sort or guardstation at the distance of about  0  miles from jaizkoigorodok where i staid a few days to make some little excursions in the neighborhood here have been found in the jaik elephant and buffaloskeletons proofs of some old change in the globe of which i shall speak further hereafter they have preserved in kalmykowa a piece of elephants tooth calcined a monstrous elephant hipbone which weighed fiftyfour pounds and the upper part of an extraordinary great buffalos skull with both horns which measured between the bottompart of the horns one foot three inches parisian measure  on the steps here grow abundantly the stinking ground pine camphorosma monspeliaca which had not the least smell and some small pieces of wormwood on which the numerous flocks of the kirguese feed in winter these plants continue green under the snow which falls but lightly in this district and is soon gone the sheep dig them readily from under the snow and the kirguese look out for winter quarters where this plant abounds for the sheep will not touch it in summer here grows also the rhapontic of which the cossacks make an excellent medicine by steeping it in baandy to which it gives a pale yellow color in gurjef they collect the young leaves in spring and eat them as a cure for the scurvy which there reigns a decoction of it is a wholesome purgative and they apply it in a variety of disorders the kirguese use it to dye yellow with and i am persuaded it would supercede the use of the foreign turmerick  there is here the scorpionspider phalangium araneoides known by all the kalmucks by the name of bychorcho or mandschibychorcho and dreaded by them exceedingly it is bite not only occasioning extraordinary pain but a great tumor which though slow in operation is certain death this insect lives in holes under ground but creeps about in the reeds and often awakes with a bite those imprudent people who lie down to sleep where they are the kalmucks and all those who have seen it alive say that it will in the twinkling of an eye run up a stick held before it and bite the hand it is common antidote and cure is sweet oil but the kalmucks use some superstitious remedies against it they say the wound should be first bathed with the milk of a young woman suckling her first child and who lived chastely before marriage that then the heart and lungs of some black animal either a dog a sheep etc should be applied warm as taken from the body to the wound i saw an old kalmuck who had two marks on his breast made by the bites of these animals and who said he was waked from his sleep by the violence of the pain nay the kalmucks dread this insect so much that they will desert a district where they have seen them i had once an opportunity of getting one from the cape of goodhope but never knew it is violent effects till now the kalmucks say that there is another such black insect living under ground and spinning large and extensive webs but i could never learn further particulars about it  upon the height of kalmykowa two good journeys on horseback from the jaik is an extensive saltlake forming many little bays and marshes but has no flux it is called kamyschsamara it is borders are full of bullrushes on whose roots the wild boars feed on this lake are eight or ten floating islands the texture of which is composed of all sorts of roots rushes and willows and inhabited by wild boars swans and diverse sorts of waterfowl  august    i returned to the fort and the next day took a ride to see the kirguese who were quartered in the neighborhood and at sunset took notice of the racehare or flyinghare mus laculus this animal appears rather flying than running the fleetest horses of our cossack escort could not keep up with them with a single leap they will jump over twelve feet of ground and they scarce touch the ground but we see them again in the air till they rush into their holes  day was just declining when we reached the kirguese who were quartered on a step or waste under large felt tents on a delightful spot the stepnations show commonly a great deal of taste in choosing their abodes and in this respect enjoy a pleasure that in some measure atones for their unsettled vagrant way of life these people seemed more alarmed at us than we at them we saw no one about the tents but a few old women and some naked children running about a kitchenfire the young women had abscodned and the men were busy in collecting their dispersed flocks as soon as their business was done both masters and slaves gathered themselves about us and finding us peaceably inclined and of an agreeable disposition received us with a smiling countenance and treated us with a delicious though sourish drink made of maresmilk this drink if prepared in clean vessels as the kirguese do it is not in the least disagreeable but has that vinous sourish taste which milk has when turned to curds with cream of tartar the kumyss of cowsmilk is much inferior to that made with the milk of mares though when fresh it is rather saltish something like the milk of a cow who has eaten some alkali or dames violet alliaria  and called by them kumyss of which no one could drink a bottle without being intoxicated a proof of this i saw in one of my attendants notwithstanding the good reception we met with and the hospitality they showed we did not think it proper to take up our nights lodging among them therefore about dusk having inspected into what was most remarkable in their families we took our leave and returned from whence we came where for the first time this year i saw the unexpected comet which the cossacks with their lynx eyes had discovered three nights before and on the   th instant aug      a little below the hyades  as i owe my readers every account i could collect about the kirguese i now take the opportunity of relating to them all i could learn  this nation of people calls itself kergis chasak by which name it is known among the russians and kalmucks they themselves gave me the following account of their origin they formerly lived among the turks alone and propagated and extended themselves as far as the river euphrates where they had their own particular governors the last of whom sasydkhan had been in this district this prince designed to make himself master of the turkish throne and with this view murdered two of mahomets cousins by his daughter fatima called chasan and chussan i am not much versed in turkish history but was i ever so much and whether the story be found true or false i should relate it as i heard it it is a piece of kirguisian antiquity when the deed had transpired the turks rose in arms and drove him and all the kirguese from their settlements after this they sat down in the neighborhood of the nogayan tartars but having also fallen out with these people they were again driven from the step or desert which they now occupy this horde afterward threw itself under the protection of kergiskhan whose subjects were neighbors to the sungarians and chinese probably the mongols and this prince employed them in wars and military expeditions but they forsook him also and retired to their present abode with the name of kergischasak which implies a warrior of kergiskhan they believe indeed that all the russian cossacks derive their name and military discipline from them  these kirguese like all other asiatic nomades live in felttents not at all different from those of the kalmucks but in being cleanlier and so spacious that often above twenty persons may sit commodiously in such a tent in hot weather both kirguese and kalmucks remove the sidecovering of the tent in which situation it represents an alcove the kirguese with respect to their persons and dress are much cleaner than the kalmucks as they are mostly people of property they keep a great quantity of cattle live well in their way and are well attired whatever is requisite for their clothing and consists of manufactured stuffs they procure from russian merchants asiatic caravans or else by robbery though to do them justice they become daily more and more honest and trade now by way of barter the articles they make for themselves are furdresses leather a kind of coarse camblet feltcovers of sheeps wool which they neatly mix with wool of various colors all sorts of leather and some trifling things they chiefly tan their hides as do the kalmucks with sour milk and this leather so tanned composes most of their mens dress in summertime they wear different kinds of small upper garments made of hides the hair of which is outward and such a coat they call jirgak something more distinguishing yet frequently worn is what they call daka which consists of the skins of unborn colts of different colors so sown together that on the middle of the back and both shoulders the manes fall as an ornament in the seams some also wear summercloaths of welltanned goat skins without the hair these they call kaskan and are much worn by the jaikian cossacks being soft and impenetrable by the rain their method of preparing them is as follows having cut off the hair from the skin they moisten it with water and lay it rolled up in some warm spot till it begins to be offensive and the hair loosens at the roots they then scrape the skin with a blunt knife and afterward dry it to a certain degree if the skin be thin they lay it in sweet milk if thick in sour or turned milk tanning it therein for four days but scraping it every day in order to make it more supple it is then dried in the shade and worked with the hands and feet till it becomes very soft after this it is smoked dried again and finally dyed with a yellowbrown color made from the roots of rhapontic or the thrift statice tartarica called by the kalmucks tuschutt and by the russians sheltoi koren that is yellowroot which are boiled in allumwater some are said to mix a little sheepfat among the boiling roots in order to fix the color faster when the dye is cold it is said to be of the consistency of a soft pulp which they spread over each side of the skin twice or more letting them dry each time and then work and render them soft again such skins may be washed very often and not lose their pretty yellowbrown color they use the same root for dying wool but for a red color they use genuine cochineal which grows in some part of the step in some lowlands about the jaik and is called by them kysilbujaf they have among them some few silversmiths and blacksmiths but they are such inexpert workmen as to be able to make only some rough trifling things they are at a loss to conceive to what perfection those europeans have arrived who are able to manufacture needles and thimbles all fine trifles of this denomination are bartered for by them at orenberg and some other places on the frontiers having no coin among them they estimate every thing by the value of a horse or sheep and their customary small coin are wolvesskins and lambskins  the mans dress besides the uppergarment consists in a cotton underone and a shirt of blue linen or kitaika which is open like a bedgown from top to bottom but lapped over before and with other cotton clothes tied fast about the body they gird their uppergarments with a leather belt on which hangs usually a vessel with gunpowder and a bag full of shot and balls most of the kirguese of property carrying firearms with them some make their own powder digging saltpeter from the old tumuli and it is said to be so good that they need only wash the ground from it and may then mix it with sulphur and coals the sulphur and indeed the chief of their gunpowder they purchase from the asiatic caravans  the mens summercaps are commonly made of felt and covered with stuff they are worked with the needle with threads of various colors and lined with velvet the top is conical and the cap has two broad flaps that hang down on the cheeks or turn back or up occasionally their wintercaps are lined with fur besides these they wear as do the tartars upon their shorn heads for they shave their heads clean leaving whiskers on the upperlip and a pointed beard on the chin or at the corners of their mouths a kind of black cap worked with various colored needle work the boots which the rich wear are made by the bucharians and sold very dear they are made of asss skin very clumsy and after a peculiar model the soles are full of large points are encompassed with iron and are generally so badly made that no european would be able to walk in them without falling down at every step the kirguese however seldom walk but are almost always on horseback so that most of them are bandylegged and very bad walkers they are of middling stature rather handsome featured when young but among the old their faces are jewish and frightful and owing to their indolence their bodies are thick being well clad says took in furs and two or three garments at a time they are seldom hurt by the frequent falls they get from their horses  the trappings of their fine horses employ their thoughts almost as much as that of their persons having always elegant saddles handsome housings and ornamented bridles they are generally armed when on horseback and carry a short twisted whip about an inch thick like that of an english postilion when they go a hunting they wear schalvars or long trowsers which reach up to the armpits into which they cram all their clothes and a kirguese in this dress may be taken at a distance for a monstrous pair of breeches on horseback  the common dress of the women is a blue shift not open before which is the only covering they wear at home a pair of long breeches bands with which they wrap up their feet and legs flatbottomed socks and a white or particolored piece of linen with which they veil their heads the following is their usual headdress which they call dshaulok they first lay a kind of stuff three or four else in length over the head bringing the ends of it down the sides of the face about which they braid their hair in two tresses the ends of this stuff they cross under the chin and carry them up over the head again so that the ends hang down on the ears on each side this put on they wind a slip of some stuff four or five else long and about two hands broad in the middle round the head so as to form a kind of cylindrical turban when they are better dressed this dshaulok is of finer stuff and striped over the blue shift they wear another of silk or some rich bucharian stuff ornamented with artificial flowers they next put on a tippet of the same color as the dshaulok about the shoulders and over the whole a wide bucharian bedgown or chalat they carefully cover their bosom with a thick handkerchief worked with the needle in various colors within their undershift they have also another ornamental dress called dschadshbau consisting of a full and long train or tail fastened to the hind part of the head under the dshaulok above this flows to half way the leg a double tail the size of a mans thumb covered with velvet and ornamented at the end with a thick fringe of black silk married women divide this tail bringing it over the shoulders on each side but girls suffer it to hang down the back round this tail hangs down to the knee a kind of string with all sorts of varicoloured fringes corals beads and other things which make a jingling noise they also wear a cap under the dshaulok which round the face is ornamented and hung full with little silver coins or medals sultanas or princesses says took and daughters of illustrious persons distinguish themselves by the necks of the heron put into the hair raised into an ornament upon the head in the shape of a horn and the plumage is very beautiful these also wear silk clothes or rich stuffs or fine cloth set off with gold lace and loops or faced with fur and even velvets are very common with this class of ladies  the kirguese are mahomedans which religion they say they brought with them from turkestan they therefore take as many wives as they can rob or pay for and many says took keep concubines who are treated in every respect like wives their children also being reputed legitimate the moderate price for a marriageable girl to be taken as a first wife is about fifty horses twenty or twentyfive cows a hundred sheep a few camels or else a slave with a cuirass or coat of mail the poorer sort find wives at a cheaper rate and the rich pay much dearer the second wife of a married man costs much more than the first the third and following still more common people of course are obliged to be contented with one wife and think themselves very well off if they can get that one as they are often under the necessity of stealing her from some of the neighboring nations the kalmuck women are the most sought after by the kirguese conceiving that nature has endowed them with singular advantages for pleasure and that they preserve the marks of youth longer than the women of other nations insomuch that the rich are very willing to marry them if they can be prevailed on to embrace mahomedanism on the contrary they hold the persian women in so little estimation that they give such as they take in marriage to their slaves the espousals consist in a public declaration of the agreement made between the contracting parties and then a priest repeats a prayer the evening before a woman is sent for to shave off all her hair but that of her head and on the day of marriage she is carried in a carpet to the bridegrooms tent and the wedding celebrated in a hut built on purpose by the brides father previous to consummation also the girl is carried about on a carpet to her companions to take leave of them in which ceremony she is attended by several others singing all the way if unfortunately it is discovered that she was not a maid when married the guests the day after kill the bridegrooms saddlehorse tear his wedding garment in pieces and illtreat the bride in this case the fatherinlaw is obliged to give satisfaction to the offended husband but on the contrary if all is right the rejoicings continue for several days nothing is thought of but eating and drinking dancing singing chatting wrestling horseracing and shooting at a mark at the two lastmentioned diversions considerable bets are made and the newmarried couple give prizes to the conquerors of shewy apparel trinkets and sometimes horses on breaking up the festivities the guests make presents of cattle and other things to the married pair  such as have more than one wife give each a separate jourt or tent where she brings up her children after her own liking the more children they have the happier they esteem themselves and are the more honored by their husbands whilst such as prove barren are so little thought of that the husband often makes them the servants of those who increase his family the rich and great give pompous names to their children such as nour hali or the great light ir hali or erali the exalted man do hali the powerful friend batyr or bagatyr the hero temir ir the man of iron beghali the powerful prince etc  according to mahomedan custom it is difficult to see their women the richer kirguese have a separate tent for their wives and one for themselves they are zealous enough in their faith yet very ignorant having but few mahomedan priests among them their horde however has now an achan or chief priest who generally goes about with the khan  in their way of living they observe strictly the law of mahomet of course they eat no impure cattle of wild animals they eat only the antilope the stephorse and the different kinds of deer this meat composes their chief food though they now accustom themselves to food made of flour and groats which they procure from the russians by bartar in eating such things they mix them with sour milk or the spirituous extraction from mares milk called kumyss  took who frequently speaks from the authority of gmelin who traveled into siberia some years before dr pallas and as such i shall often quote him says that mutton is their ordinary winterfood and they will live on it for many months together at times they will eat other food but it is only at occasional festivals and for the sake of variety in winter they drink broth to quench their thirst and from the quantity of boiled meat they use have plenty of this liquor they are fond of fat regaling themselves often on suet or butter which they eat without bread or any dressing they are in general extravagant eaters or more properly devourers four men returned from hunting often consuming at one meal a whole sheep and leaveing nothing but the bones  they smoke tobacco to excess as do all the tartars men women and children all smoke and take snuff which latter they keep in little horns fastened to their girdle excepting kumyss and arrack they have no inebriating liquor for this reason they smoke till they grow giddy swallowing the smoke that they may attain that end the sooner they use chinese pipes when they can get them but at other times and for common use have a contrivance of their own they take the tibia or legbone of a sheep and cutting off the knob at one end take out the marrow and make a hole in the side at the other end near the knob like to that which the lips are are applied to in a germanflute when they would smoke they introduce a wad of wool into the tube and thrust it up to the abovementioned hole the design of this is to prevent the tobacco with which the tube is filled from choking up the hole which is the mouthpiece to this extraordinary pipe at the end where the knob was cut off they light the tobacco with touchwood drawing the smoke into their mouths by the little lateral hole through the wool and they suck with so much force that a great quantity of smoke comes out at their nostrils the rest they swallow each person takes three or four whiffs of this kind and then passes the pipe to his next neighbor who does the same and sends it round but they have an invention still more ingenious for a smoking party having found a place convenient for lying down upon the ground one of the company makes water in the center of this spot to settle the earth and make it soft and fit to receive a hole which they make with the handle of a whip in this hole they put the tobacco lighting it with touchwood and lying all round it flat on their bellies a kalmuck smoking party every smoker then thrusts obliquely a hollow cabbagestalk into the moistened earth in such a manner that the extremity may touch the tobacco at the bottom of the hole and in this attitude they smoke at their ease without any inconvenience to each other by this means all their heads are in a cloud of tobaccosmoke which to them is a great luxury and intoxicates them all in a short time  the habitations of the kirguese are portable tents made of felt like those of the kalmucks only larger and more neat the fire is made in the center directly under the opening left in the roof round the fire they spread pieces of felt persian carpets or furcushions the wealthy have the inside of their tents hung with different colored stuffs and not unfrequently with silk the leather bottles and the several chests and boxes are ranged round the side of the tent and their arms saddles bridles bedcloaths etc hung up over them  as the aimaks or principal families of this nation love to keep together their camps contain a great number of huts or tents and consequently take up a large space of ground the residence of the khan is surrounded by near a thousand tents but on the other hand one may travel fifty or sixty miles without seeing a single habitation they are commonly changing their situation both in summer and winter for the sake of pasturage but the aimaks first agree with one another not to settle too near together their tents are very cold in winter as their fire consists of nothing but the dung of cattle dried  the rarer priests are among the kirguese the more numerous are the sorcerers they have as i learnt five different sorts one sort prophesies from books and from the stars which they do in a scientific way without any private show of pecuniary motives these are called falscha there is also a sort of fortune tellers among them called jauruntschi who from the shoulder blade of a sheep foretell future events and answer all questions they say this shoulder blade should be cleared from the skin and flesh not with the teeth but with the mouth otherwise it is unfit for the blackart when a question is put to one of these fortune tellers he directs his mind to some thought and lays the bladebone on the fire till the flatside gets several rents and chops with the heat and foretells from the marks and lines so left they are said to be able to tell at what distance an absent person is they tell you that a party of kalmucks who had once such a fortune tellers among them committed a considerable robbery on the kirguese and that a party of the latter who had also a fortune tellers among them too was exhorted by him to pursue the enemy but the kalmuck fortune tellers was so experienced in his art that he gave seasonable notice to his countrymen of the approach of the kirguese and urged them to fly when the kirguisian fortune tellers thus found he could not compass his design he is said to have made use of the following stratagem he ordered his party to saddle their horses with the front of the saddle backwards and set on them in this manner with their backs to the horses heads by this means the kalmucks were lead into an error for their fortune tellers advised them to go on steadily and gently as there was no danger the kirguese having their backs turned toward them thus were they overtaken by the kirguese and made prisoners i heard this tale from a kirguese himself but am not accountable for it is credibility  a third kind of sorcerers is called bakscha and great confidence is placed in them when their advice is asked they demand a selected horse sheep or buck as a sacrificial victim the bakscha then begins his magic hymns and to beat as do the laplanders a kind of magic drum kobig hung with gingling rings jumping and making many violent motions with his body for half an hour he then orders the victim to be brought forth and slain catches the blood in a particular vessel takes the skin for himself and the flesh being eaten by those who are present gathers the bones paints them red and blue and throws them from him toward the west where he also pours the blood of the animal after this he jumps about again for some time longer and then gives the desired answer  another kind of magicians ramtscha are those who pour fat or butter in the fire and prophesy by the color of the flame on such occasions they also immolate a victim and make use of conjurations but this sort of witchcraft is in very little repute there are likewise wizzards and witches dshaadugar who enchant the slaves and prisoners so that they commonly lose their way upon their flight and fall into the hands of their proprietors again or if they should escape fall soon after into kirguisian slavery these pull out some of the hair from the captivs head ask his name and set him in the middle of a tent over the outspread cinders of the hearth which are strewed with salt this done the witch begins her spell during which the prisoner is thrice to go backwards the witch then spits on each of his footsteps and every time runs out at the door at last she strews a little of the ashes on which the prisoner stands upon his tongue and thus ends the enchantment the jaikian cossacks firmly believe that if a prisoner tells his true name the witchcraft takes an infallible effect  the numerous kirguese live far more unconstrained than the kalmucks who acknowledge so many little despots among them every kirguese lives like a free lord and on this account they are less dangerous as foes yet every aimak or family has it is chief to whom all the relations and dependants pay a voluntary obedience those who have most subjects and dependants take the title of khans and sultans they have also other degrees of rank certain nobles they call bu some other honorable persons of ancient extraction chodsha and some others murses the khan elected and placed over a small kirguisian horde has but little power unless he can acquire it by his wealth and liberality it is not he that can decide disputes and contentions among his people these are determined by a certain annual assembly of the elders and chiefs of families if they divide into parties or are threatened by some war they call together a democratic council and elect one of the elders or chiefs for their general the great and wealthy says took live perfectly in the same manner as the rest of the people and are remarkable only for the numerous train that accompanies them in their cavalcades and the quantity of huts which surround their quarters inhabited by their wives their children or their slaves the great men treat the common people as brethren and as all the kirguese are equally free these latter show no great marks of respect to them since every one immediately on becoming rich is as great as the best of them in all the tents the common people place themselves by the side of the nobles without the least ceremony eat with them and say what they please before them when a superior bids them do any thing they execute his orders if they like those orders although the commands of the khan are not executed with the most scrupulous exactness they treat him with the profoundest veneration looking on his person as sacred nour hali the reigning khan of one of the hordes is confirmed in his sovereignty by the court of petersburg he is an equitable discreet prince and strictly devoted to russia his property consists in about a thousand horses four hundred cows two hundred camels four thousand sheep and several hundred goats so that in respect to riches alone he holds a rank but little distinguished and as he is obliged to form tabounes or herds of cattle for a number of princes to enable them to make some figure and his numerous family and slaves and the frequent visits he receives occasions a great consumption of cattle and as he enjoys no revenue at all it will be ever imposible for him to a mass a large fortune notwithstanding this he makes a much greater figure than any one of his horde and the presents he obtains from the court of russia contribute greatly to the support of his dignity his residence is composed of a vast number of huts those of state are very richly adorned his family as well as himself are always dressed in cloth of gold or silver or velvets and his person is constantly surrounded by the elders of the nation the title of the khan is taghsir ghanim or taghsir padschaim his wives are called simply ghanim the princes his sons bear the title of taghsir saltan and the princesses that of ghanim kai daughters of the khan the present khan has four wives and eight concubines the former are sprung from rich and ancient families of the kirguese but the concubines are either taken from the common people or slaves bought from the kalmucks on account of their beauty beg hali one of his sons is khan of the airaklian troughmenians and saltan pri hali another of them is chief of the other troughmenians excepting the two youngest all the princes are married to daughters of the principal kirguese being already in the rank of elders in the different ulusses of both hordes a uluss being a society of several families who keep carefully together for the sake of preserving their descent pure and unmixed these alliances and the dignities of his sons contribute much to the power of nour hali as the princesses by the laws of the koran are forbidden to marry any relation they are all yet single and some of them begin to grow old yet the khan through pride will not dispose of them at even a handsome price to any suitor that is not descended of illustrious blood the people are not permitted to see the wives and daughters of their khan they never appear in public but when changing their residence and then they go on horses and camels in their richest dress and ornaments whenever a kirguese on horseback happens to meet the khan in the step or desert he dismounts and advancing in an oblique direction toward him says aloud alla arbaschou i e god give thee prosperity after this salutation the khan strikes him gently on the shoulder with his hand or whip and this passes for a sort of benediction  though they are forbidden to steal or carry off men or cattle they are so far from thinking these depredations shameful in any way that they glory in them boasting to one another of the exploit and the extraordinary adventures accompanying it as if it were some courageous act of heroism or some honorable and glorious feat of chivalry the circumjacent nations are most frequently exposed to their incursions but the kalmucks are their most favorite objects though the risk is the greatest as for the russians they are seldom molested  they commit their petty robberies in small gangs and if upon the russian frontiers they drive away a stock of horses and seize some single men and women it is commonly about the time when they quit that district with their flocks for as long as they feed their cattle in their vicinity they take care that no disorders are committed least the innocent and guiltless who cannot get off as expeditiously with their flocks should suffer for the misdemeanors of the perpetrators they commonly suit their periods of robbing so well as never to be caught it has been remarked that their neighborhood is most dangerous in those places where the step on the russian frontiers is flat and open not in their mountainous and woody steps where they conceal themselves and lie in wait for opportunities the asiatic caravans who pass through the insecure steps inhabited by these plunderers to the russian trading towns gain over the aimaks of the district they pass through to their favor by presents of goods in which case they appoint them an escort for which they are paid from ten to twelve rubles or about fortyeight shillings english per camel  besides the captures says took which accident throws in their way they go out sometimes singly in search of adventures and at other times in small parties having at their head but too often some great lord of their nation when they have a mind to pillage any caravan in their own territories or beyond them several ulusses join together for that purpose entering into negotiations and making conventions in form that they may be more certain of the predatory project in this sort of skirmish it often happens that a great number of the kirguese are made prisoners and carried away captive by the caravans and if any are killed in the fight not the smallest enquiry is ever made of what is become of them in trifling seizures every one keeps what he gets but considerable and important spoils are divided according to previous contract or as the exigencies of the case may require each adventurer keeps the cattle that fall to his share and generally the women he has taken as the buying off a woman does great honor to the ravisher they yield up the slaves and merchandise to the more wealthy who give them cattle in exchange it is no uncommon thing to sell their slaves to a neighboring nation especially if these slaves are russians for as they are known to be laborious and accustomed to agriculture they fetch a great price and it is the interest of the kirguese to get rid of them as soon as possible knowing what they are to expect if any russians are found among their captives  the court of russia has taken various measures to put a check to these terrible disorders a line of intrenchments and redoubts has been built along their frontiers wherever the river does not prevent their excursions they fix a number of sticks with both ends in the earth bent in the same manner as those in some countries for catching thrushes these sticks or wands are placed from one redoubt to another so that the patrole can see at once by such as are wanting or deranged whether any kirguese who come always on horseback have passed the frontiers and on such discovery mount and pursue them immediately the russian shepherds are armed and always on horseback to be on their guard and defend themselves when necessary if notwithstanding all these precautions a robbery is committed or a caravan bound to russia is pillaged on the desert of the kirguese the russian commandants demand restitution from the khan and if neither he nor the lords of the nation can bring the people to consent to it a troop of baschirians is dispatched immediately into the horde and the first kirguisian uluss they come to is obliged to conduct them to that which committed the robbery or be answerable for the damage the baschirians then take with them a certain number of kirguese and cattle and bring them to orenberg where they are detained till a state of the loss can be ascertained this being done the overplus is sent back again as soon as the russian prisoners taken in the engagement are restored when any single robbers are caught or a small party together they are first punished and then shut up in ostrogs of the fortresses where prisoners condemned to public works are confined  was it not for their depredations the kirguese would not be so formidable so little sanguinary are they that they would rather make a slave of a man than put him to death whilst their slaves are faithful they never treat them cruelly as they are all passionately fond continues took of uncontrouled liberty and as every man can acquire a stock sufficient for his own support not one of them can bear the idea of being a servant to any of his countrymen they are all brethren and have the resolution to preserve their condition as such which is the reason that the rich are obliged to have yasowres or slaves from other nations the more of these a kirguisian lord possesses the greater figure he makes and the more care is taken of his flocks even the courtiers and domestics of the great are all slaves the khan keeps about fifty slavery among this people is no great hardship to such as are once accustomed to their way of life for the masters treat their slaves as if they were their relations supplying them with all the necessaries of life and giving them the same provisions they eat themselves a prisoner on the contrary who cannot bring himself to adopt their method of living fares but ill among them attempts made to escape never fail to draw on the delinquents such cruel treatment as often costs them their lives involving in their calamity such unfortunate women as calculated by sentiments of humanity have contributed to favor their desertion  as all of them are not in a condition to afford so many slaves as are necessary to look after their flocks the rich give their superfluous sheep and cattle to the poor who in return tend the herds and flocks of their benefactors if the cattle of a kirguese multiply rapidly he considers it as a secret suggestion to beneficence and distributes them largely to his more indigent neighbors so long as his benefactor remains in good circumstances the other is never expected to make any return but if his cattle should be stolen or diminished by contagious distempers the person whom his bounty set up in the time of his prosperity restores him what he received and often adds to them some of the young produced by the animals whilst he was the depository of his neighbors beneficence even though by so doing he should reduce himself to the state of indigence he was in before this courteous and honorable manner of disposing of their property puts numbers of them above the fear of want rendering at the same time their flocks and herds as it were immortal for the more they give away in the time of affluence the more abundantly they receive on a change of fortune  for the homage of the kirguese to the crown of russia that court protects them against all invaders and in commerce and social life affords them the same advantages as to the russians gives them the quiet possession of their country disturbing neither their constitution their laws their religion nor the trade they carry on with their neighbors they pay no kind of tax or tribute in short they are under no restriction or constraint whatever but they are bound to be friendly to all russians and all nations in alliance with the crown and consider the enemies of russia as their own to guarantee their obligations they send certain principal people amanati to orenburg as hostages who receive an allowance stipulated by themselves of fifteen kopeeks or sevenpence halfpenny english per day for every hostage and five kopeeks for each domestic living very well for this small sum if the khan goes to orenburg he must first ask permission of the governor and is then received like a sovereign prince a bodyguard is appointed him and the physicians of orenburg are obliged to furnish remedies gratis to such of their sick as apply for them but notwithstanding all this and in defiance of their homage and their treaties they cannot but give way to their characteristic passion for plunder and rapine if any thing restrains them it is either the armed force which russia at times is obliged to employ against them the personal interest and advantage they draw from commerce or the influence of their chiefs who have a juster sense of decency and decorum  we find no school among them so that a few only know how to write their language which is said to be a dialect of the tartarian pretty pure the kirguese have a frank and prepossessing air in their conduct toward strangers says pallas they are affable yet always interested and crafty even when they visit any russian trading town they will make trifling presents to people in order to ask them for more important ones they have a sharp but not a fierce look and smaller eyes than the tartars they do not want good natural sense are greedy of danger and highspirited but at the same time fond of their ease and voluptuous their women have the reputation of being good economists tender and compassionate toward their slaves whose escape they strive to favor even by exposing themselves to various inconveniences and the rude treatment of their husbands  armed as the kirguese always are they are but inexpert warriors they are however good bowmen their muskets have no locks but are fired with a match they cannot discharge them on horseback but dismount lie on the ground and rest the barrel of the gun on a fork fastened to it it is easy to imagine that they sometimes meet with an enemy that has not patience enough to wait for all these maneuvres the instant they perceive that nothing is to be done or that they are beaten in spite of commanders or military law every man takes the shortest way home but when they have to engage with an enemy as little practiced as themselves in the art of war they are almost always victorious  their laws are few but founded on the koran and the usages of their ancestors starchans or elders are set over the ulusses and the khans decision is the last appeal a murderer for two years after the commission of the crime is at the mercy of the relations of the person slain who if they can lay hold of him in that time may put him to death if he escapes and is inclined to return home he may purchase that permission by paying  00 horses a slave and two camels to the family of the deceased in lieu of horses he may give sheep five sheep being equivalent to one horse he that kills a woman an infant or a slave pays half the foregoing fine as also any one that makes a woman miscarry but in all these cases the relations and friends of the culprit endeavor to make as good a bargain as they can with the injured party who generally remit a part of the penalty maiming a man is reckoned as halfmurder for a thumb cut off the criminal pays a hundred sheep the little finger is valued at twenty the loss of the ears is such an abomination that a man without them though he should have lost them in the most innocent manner is not even tolerated among them whoever commits a robbery on his countrymen restores nine times the value none are allowed to take an oath in their own cause and if the accused can get no brother or friend to swear for him he is proceeded against as guilty  their manner of salutation is like that of the tartars in squeezing each others right hand between both hands and saying salom malikom peace be with thee to which the other replies malikom salom with thee be peace they do not uncover their heads old acquaintance however says pallas embrace each kirguisian hospitality other with great warmth and cordiality after the first salutations they present their guests with the choicest viands they have to do the honors of their house when they have much company they commonly kill a sheep for making bischbarmak or the fivefinger dish which is a sort of hash made of fat meat chopped and stewed and is eaten with the fingers this stew they present to their friends by cramming handfulls of it into their mouths and the person whose mouth they so fill eats it as greedily as if he wished to devour the hand that crams him when the mouthful thus given is too large the eater empties half of it into his hands till he has gorged the other half and after this swallows the rest this honor is done to all the great men of the nation when they eat in state and the same politeness is shown by them to their inferiors as often as they treat them even the khan himself condescends so far as to stuff bischmark into the mouth of such as are admitted to the honor of dining with him if a stranger has for his friend any great man of the nation or any private person known to be rich he may traverse all the hordes in full security with him and may trust to his protection better than to a military escort numbers of russians avail themselves of this disposition of the kirguese and carry on very lucrative branches of traffic under the protection of some distinguished man  the property or wealth of the kirguese consists in breeding of cattle of which horses and sheep are the most numerous they have a much smaller number of camels and very badly are they stocked with great cattle as they cannot live on the steps in wintertime without being fed they make use of cows to transport their tents etc from one place to another they have no other camels but those of two bunches as much as i could learn of the breeding of these animals i did they bring the male to the female in wintertime when she is most disposed to receive him the male being brought she falls down on her knees and the male dropping upon his hindlegs and raising his forelegs quite upright is above an hour engaged like other animals when with young the female camel shuns the male and if pursued sets up a roar they carry their young a whole year and fuckle them for two years on this account the propagation of camels is exceedingly slow wealthy kirguese keep camels for milk which is rich bluish thick and very pleasant in taste it is considered as salubrious never yields any cream and if sour is said to ferment better and make a better spirit than mares milk in winter camels require more attendance and care than any other cattle they cloth them with felt and rushmats and if the cold is severe stretch felts and mats between the tents to shelter them from the weather  kirguisian horses are but little different from those of the kalmucks except that they are higher in wildness and swiftness they are equal to the former and are accustomed to scrape out their food in winter from underneath the snow they divide their horses into certain stocks each stock has one stallion and such malecolts as are not kept for this purpose are made geldings this stallion is as a shepherd to the stock or brood of mares and keeps them together  their sheep are without exception the largest and most monstrous of all woolcattle they are higher than a newborn calf and so strong and heavy that such as are fullgrown in a proper season will weigh between four and five puds that is about   0 lb english in their form they resemble indian sheep have crooked ramheads pouching underlips large hanging ears and often single or double warts about their necks instead of a tall they have on the rump a great lump of sat which will weigh from thirty to forty pounds and yield from twenty to thirty pounds of tallow their wool is coarse long and mixed with hair behind their color chiefly brown or spotted with brown and some are white the rams are all horned so are the wether some have from four to six horns like those of iceland the rams are left with the stock during the whole summer but from the month of april to october they bind a felt round their body to prevent their coupling during winter they seek their food underneath the snow and eat the snow instead of drinking the ewes generally bring forth two lambs at a time and as there is no disease among them they are left to the care of nature the flesh is sweeter says took than that of the common european sheep and men of distinguishing palates perceive in it an aromatic flavor of different odoriferous kinds of wormwood the lambs are esteemed so delicate that a certain number are sent yearly from orenburg to petersburg for the courtkitchen this sheep is the ovis laticauda of linneus  lambskins in this country are in the highest estimation and make an important article in kirguisian commerce they are of various colors white black blue gray spotted and foxcolour the best are waved slain as if varnished and resemble a piece of flowered damask to increase the quantity of these skins and at the same time to render them larger the kirguess few linen about the newfallen lambs which preserves the wool sleek and renders it waving when the lamb is grown so large as to burst the linen they kill it for the skin  they have also many goats among their sheep whom they rear only for their milk these animals also have an odd appearance being mostly without horns with long hair hanging neatly about the limbs their ears hang down and their coats are spotted with various colors  besides a shepherdlife the kirguese employ themselves much in hunting and have thus an opportunity of extirpating both foxes and wolves that are such enemies to their flocks i have already mentioned i think that they train up eagles for this purpose on the extensive steps they hunt on horseback in order to catch antelopes who in winter chiefly frequent reedy districts they shorten the reeds in particular places which as the animal leeps through wounds him in the belly and renders him easily to be caught  this nation generally reaches an old age and are till the last year of life sprightly and without infirmities their most common complaints are colds fevers shortness of breath and the venereal disease which they call kowrousaslan i could not learn that they were ever afflicted with those burning fevers so dangerous among the kalmucks but the tschitschak or smallpox has shown itself among them at times yet without committing any great ravages they are however so afraid of this disorder that as soon as the eruption shows itself they forsake the patient putting down his food at a distance and leaving him to fetch it and was a person in this disorder to go near any of their tents they would think themselves justifiable in shooting him  they bury their dead as do the mahomedans the grave is but shallow in which they lay the corpse fulldressed cover it with branches and then with earth at the head which is always to the north they put in a stick which is kept perpendicular till the tumulus is raised beaten solid and completed this stick is then drawn out and an opening thus left into the grave in stoney districts they lay a pile of stones over it where is the wonder then that we should meet with so many tumuli in all the steps which must continually increase especially as they like to bury their friends in such places where some holy men are said to have been buried before near some metsched or house of prayer and generally where there are many old graves  when a man dies says took they cut his best garment to pieces and distribute the fragments among his friends who lay them up as memorials of him  circumcision they never omit the abdals or circumcisers go up and down through the hordes to perform this operation on the children of the faithful and as every one receiving this professional character i obliged to give the abdal a sheep for his trouble these people have always considerable stocks  end of the second volume
