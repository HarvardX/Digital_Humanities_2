can she forget the darling of her heart the little darling whom she bore and bred nursed on her knees and at her bosom fed to whom she seemed her every thought to give and in whose life alone she seemed to live yes from herself the mother may depart she may forget the darling of her heart the little darling whom she bore and bred nursed on her knees and at her bosom fed to whom she seemed her every thought to give and in whose life alone she seemed to live but i cannot forget whilst life remains and pours her current through these swelling veins whilst memory offers up at reasons shrine but i cannot forget that gothams mine can the stern mother than the brutes more wild from her disnaturd breast tear her young child flesh of her flesh and of her bone the bone and dash the smiling babe against a stone yes the stern mother than the brutes more wild from her disnaturd breast may tear her child flesh of her flesh and of her bone the bone and dash the smiling babe against a stone but i forbid it heaven but i can never the love of gotham from this bosom tear can never so far true royalty pervert from its fair course to do my people hurt with how much ease with how much confidence as if superior to each grosser sense reason had only in full power arrayed to manifest her will and be obeyed men make resolves and pass into decrees the motions of the mind with how much ease in such resolves does passion make a flaw and bring to nothing what was raised to law in empire young scarce warm on gothams throne the dangers and the sweets of power unknown pleased though i scarce know why like some young child whose little senses each new toy turns wild how do i hold sweet dalliance with my crown and wanton with dominion how lay down without the sanction of a precedent rules of most large and absolute extent rules which from sense of public virtue spring and all at once commence a patriot king but for the day of trial is at hand and the whole fortunes of a mighty land are staked on me and all their weal or woe must from my good or evil conduct flow will i or can i on a fair review as i assume that name deserve it too have i well weighed the great the noble part i am now to play have i explored my heart that labyrinth of fraud that deep dark cell where unsuspected even by me may dwell ten thousand follies have i found out there what i am fit to do and what to bear have i traced every passion to its rise nor spared one lurking seed of treacherous vice have i familiar with my nature grown and am i fairly to myself made known a patriot king  why it is a name which bears the more immediate stamp of heaven which wears the nearest best resemblance we can show of god above through all his works below to still the voice of discord in the land to make weak factions discontented band detected weak and crumbling to decay with hunger pinched on their own vitals prey like brethren in the selfsame interests warmed like different bodies with one soul imformd to make a nation nobly raised above all meaner thoughts grow up in common love to give the laws due vigor and to hold that sacred balance temperate yet bold with such an equal hand that those who fear may yet approve and own my justice clear to be a common father to secure the weak from violence from pride the poor vice and her sons to banish in disgrace to make corruption dread to show her face to bid afflicted virtue take new state and be at last acquainted with the great of all religions to elect the best nor let her priests be made a standing jest rewards for worth with liberal hand to carve to love the arts nor let the artists starve to make fair plenty through the realm increase give fame in war and happiness in peace to see my people virtuous great and free and know that all those blessings flow from me o it is a joy too exquisite a thought which flatters nature more than flattery ought it is a great glorious task for man too hard but not less great less glorious the reward the best reward which here to man is given it is more than earth and little short of heaven a task if such comparison may be the same in nature differing in degree like that which god on whom for aid i call performs with ease and yet performs to all how much do they mistake how little know of kings of kingdoms and the pains which flow from royalty who fancy that a crown because it glistens must be lined with down with outside show and vain appearance caught they look no farther and by folly taught prize high the toys of thrones but never find one of the many cares which lurk behind the gem they worship which a crown adorns nor once suspect that crown is lined with thorns o might reflection follys place supply would we one moment use her piercing eye then should we learn what woe from grandeur springs and learn to pity not to envy kings the villager born humbly and bred hard content his wealth and poverty his guard in action simply just in conscience clear by guilt untainted undisturbed by fear his means but scanty and his wants but few labor his business and his pleasure too enjoys more comforts in a single hour than ages give the wretch condemned to power called up by health he rises with the day and goes to work as if he went to play whistling off toils one half of which might make the stoutest atlas of a palace quake against heat and cold which make us cowards faint hardened by constant use without complaint he bears what we should think it death to bear short are his meals and homely is his fare his thirst he slakes at some pure neighboring brook nor asks for sauce where appetite stands cook when the dews fall and when the sun retires behind the mountains when the village fires which wakened all at once speak supper nigh at distance catch and fix his longing eye homeward he hies and with his manly brood of rawbond cubs enjoys that clean coarse food which seasoned with good humor his fond bride against his return is happy to provide then free from care and free from thought he creeps into his straw and till the morning sleeps not so the king  with anxious cares oppressed his bosom labors and admits not rest a glorious wretch he sweats beneath the weight of majesty and gives up ease for state even when his smiles which by the fools of pride are treasured and preserved from side to side fly round the court even when compelled by form he seems most calm his soul is in a storm care like a spectre seen by him alone with all her nest of vipers round his throne by day crawls full in view when night bids sleep sweet nurse of nature over the senses creep when misery herself no more complains and slaves if possible forget their chains though his sense weakens though his eye grows dim that rest which comes to all comes not to him even at that hour care tyrant care forbids the dew of sleep to fall upon his lids from night to night she watches at his bed now as one mopd sits brooding over his head anon she starts and borne on ravens wings croaks forth aloud  sleep was not made for kings thrice has the moon who governs this vast ball who rules most absolute over me and all to whom by full conviction taught to bow at new at full i pay the duteous vow thrice has the moon her wonted course pursued thrice has she lost her form and thrice renewed since blessed be that season for before i was a mere mere mortal and no more one of the herd a lump of common clay informed with life to die and pass away since i became a king and gothams throne with full and ample power became my own thrice has the moon her wonted course pursued thrice has she lost her form and thrice renewed since sleep kind sleep who like a friend supplies new vigor for new toil has closed these eyes nor if my toils are answered with success and i am made an instrument to bless the people whom i love shall i repine theirs be the benefit the labor mine mindful of that high rank in which i stand of millions lord sole ruler in the land let me and reason shall her aid afford rule my own spirit of myself be lord with an ill grace that monarch wears his crown who stern and hard of nature wears a frown against faults in other men yet all the while meets his own vices with a partial smile how can a king yet on record we find such kings have been such curses of mankind enforce that law against some poor subject elf which conscience tells him he has broke himself can he some petty rogue to justice call for robbing one when he himself robs all must not unless extinguished conscience fly into his cheek and blast his fading eye to scourge the oppressor when the state distressed and sunk to ruin is by him oppressed against himself does he not sentence give if one must die tothers not fit to live weak is that throne and in itself unsound which takes not solid virtue for its ground all envy power in others and complain of that which they would perish to obtain nor can those spirits turbulent and bold not to be awed by threats nor bought with gold be hushed to peace but when fair legal sway makes it their real interest to obey when kings and none but fools can then rebel not less in virtue than in power excel be that my object that my constant care and may my souls best wishes center there be it my task to seek nor seek in vain not only how to live but how to reign and to those virtues which from reason spring and grace the man join those which grace the king first for strict duty bids my care extend and reach to all who on that care depend bids me with servants keep a steady hand and watch over all my proxies in the land first and that method reason shall support before i look into and purge my court before i cleanse the stable of the state let me fix things which to myself relate that done and all accounts well settled here in resolution firm in honor clear tremble ye slaves who dare abuse your trust who dare be villains when your king is just are there amongst those officers of state to whom our sacred power we delegate who hold our place and office in the realm who in our name commissioned guide the helm are there who trusting to our love of ease oppress our subjects wrest out just decrees and make the laws warped from their fair intent to speak a language which they never meant are there such men and can the fools depend on holding out in safety to their end can they so much from thoughts of danger free deceive themselves so much misdeem of me to think that i will prove a statesmans tool and live a stranger where i ought to rule what to myself and to my state unjust shall i from ministers take things on trust and sinking low the credit of my throne depend upon dependants of my own shall i most certain source of future cares not use my judgment but depend on theirs shall i true puppetlike be mocked with state have nothing but the name of being great attend at councils which i must not weigh do what they bid and what they dictate say enrobd and hoisted up into my chair only to be a royal cipher there perish the thought  it is treason to my throne  and who but thinks it could his thoughts be known insults me more than he who leagued with hell shall rise in arms and against my crown rebel the wicked statesman whose false heart pursues a train of guilt who acts with double views and wears a double face whose base designs strike at his monarchs throne who undermines even whilst he seems his wishes to support who seizes all departments packs a court maintains an agent on the judgment seat to screen his crimes and make his frauds complete new models armies and around the throne will suffer none but creatures of his own conscious of such his baseness well may try against the light to shut his masters eye to keep him cooped and far removed from those who brave and honest dare his crimes disclose nor ever let him in one place appear where truth unwelcome truth may wound his ear attempts like these well weighed themselves proclaim and whilst they publish baulk their authors aim kings must be blind into such snares to run or worse with open eyes must be undone the minister of honesty and worth demands the day to bring his actions forth calls on the sun to shine with fiercer rays and braves that trial which must end in praise none fly the day and seek the shades of night but those whose actions cannot bear the light none wish their king in ignorance to hold but those who feel that knowledge must unfold their hidden guilt and that dark mist dispelled by which their places and their lives are held confusion wait them and by justice led in vengeance fall on every traitors head aware of this and cautioned against the pit where kings have often been lost shall i submit and rust in chains like these shall i give way and whilst my helpless subjects fall a prey to power abused in ignorance sit down nor dare assert the honor of my crown when stern rebellion if that odious name justly belongs to those whose only aim is to preserve their country who oppose in honor leagued none but their countrys foes who only seek their own and found their cause in due regard for violated laws when stern rebellion who no longer feels nor fears rebuke a nation at her heels a nation up in arms though strong not proud knocks at the palace gate and calling loud for due redress presents from truths fair pen a list of wrongs not to be borne by men how must that king be humbled how disgrace all that is royal in his name and place who thus called forth to answer can advance no other plea but that of ignorance a vile defense which was his all at stake the meanest subject well might blush to make a filthy source from whence shame ever springs a stain to all but most a stain to kings the soul with great and manly feelings warmed panting for knowledge rests not till informed and shall not i fired with the glorious zeal feel those brave passions which my subjects feel or can a just excuse from ignorance flow to me whose first great duty is  to know hence ignorance  thy settled dull blank eye would hurt me though i knew no reason why  hence ignorance  thy slavish shackles bind the freeborn soul and lethargy the mind  of thee begot by pride who looked with scorn on every meaner match of thee was born that grave inflexibility of soul which reason cannot convince nor fear control which neither arguments nor prayers can reach and nothing less than utter ruin teach  hence ignorance  hence to that depth of night where thou wast born where not one gleam of light may wound thine eye  hence to some dreary cell where monks with superstition love to dwell or in some college soothe thy lazy pride and with the heads of colleges reside fit mate for royalty thou can not be and if no mate for kings no mate for me come study like a torrent swelled with rains which rushing down the mountains over the plains spreads horror wide and yet in horror kind leaves feeds of future fruitfulness behind come study  painful though thy course and slow thy real worth by thy effects we know  parent of knowledge come  not thee i call who grave and dull in college or in hall do fit all solemn sad and moping weigh things which when found thy labors cannot repay  nor in one hand fit emblem of thy trade a rod in the other gaudily arrayed a hornbook gilt and lettered call i thee who do in form preside over a b c  nor siren though thou art and thy strange charms as twere by magic lure men to thy arms do i call thee who through a winding maze a labyrinth of puzzling pleasing ways do lead us at the last to those rich plains where in full glory real science reigns fair though thou art and lovely to mine eye though full rewards in thy possession lie to crown mans wish and do thy favorites grace though was i stationd in an humbler place i could be ever happy in thy sight toil with thee all the day and through the night toil on from watch to watch bidding my eye fast rivetted on science sleep defy yet such the hardships which from empire flow must i thy sweet society forego and to some happy rivals arms resign those charms which can alas no more be mine no more from hour to hour from day to day shall i pursue thy steps and urge my way where eager love of science calls no more attempt those paths which man never trod before no more the mountain scaled the desert crossed losing myself nor knowing i was lost travel through woods through wilds from morn to night from night to morn yet travel with delight and having found thee lay me down content own all my toil well paid my time well spent farewell ye muses too  for such mean things must not presume to dwell with mighty kings  farewell ye muses  though it cuts my heart even to the quick we must for ever part when the fresh morn bade lusty nature wake when the birds sweetly twittring through the brake tuned their soft pipes when from the neighboring bloom sipping the dew each zephyr stole persume when all things with new vigor were inspired and seemed to say they never could be tired how often have we strayed whilst sportive rhyme deceived the way and clipped the wings of time over hill over dale how often laughed to see yourselves made visible to none but me the clown his work suspended gape and stare and seem to think that i conversed with air when the sun beating on the parched soil seemed to proclaim an interval of toil when a faint languor crept through every breast and things most used to labor wished for rest how often underneath a reverend oak where safe and fearless of the impious stroke some sacred dryad lived or in some grove where with capricious fingers fancy wove her fairy bower whilst nature all the while looked on and viewed her mockries with a smile how we held converse sweet how often laid fast by the thames in hams inspiring shade amongst those poets which make up your train and after death pour forth the sacred strain have i at your command in verse grown gray put not impaired heard dryden tune that lay which might have drawn an angel from his sphere and kept him from his office listening here when dreary night with morpheus in her train led on by silence to resume her reign with darkness covering as with a robe this scene of levity blankd half the globe how often enchanted with your heavenly strains which stole me from myself which in soft chains of music bound my soul how often have i sounds more than human floating through the sky attentive sat whilst night against her will transported with the harmony stood still how often in raptures which man scarce could bear have i when gone still thought the muses there still heard their music and as mute as death sat all attention drew in every breath lest breathing all too rudely i should wound and mar that magic excellence of sound then sense returning with return of day have chid the night which fled so fast away such my pursuits and such my joys of yore such were my mates but now my mates no more placed out of envys walk for envy sure would never haunt the cottage of the poor would never stoop to wound my homespun lays with some few friends and some small share of praise beneath oppression undisturbed by strife in peace i trod the humble vale of life farewell these scenes of ease this tranquil state welcome the troubles which on empire wait light toys from this day forth i disavow they pleased me once but cannot suit me now to common men all common things are free what honors them might fix disgrace on me called to a throne and over a mighty land ordained to rule my head my heart my hand are all engrossed each private view withstood and taskd to labor for the public good be this my study to this one great end may every thought may every action tend let me the page of history turn over the instructive page and heedfully explore what faithful pens of former times have wrote of former kings what they did worthy note what worthy blame and from the sacred tomb where righteous monarchs sleep where laurels bloom unhurt by time let me a garland twine which robbing not their fame may add to mine nor let me with a vain and idle eye glance over those scenes and in a hurry fly quick as a post which travels day and night nor let me dwell there lured by false delight and into barren theory betrayed forget that monarchs are for action made when amorous spring repairing all his charms calls nature forth from hoary winters arms where like a virgin to some letcher sold three wretched months she lay benumbed and cold when the weak flower which shrinking from the breath of the rude north and timorous of death to its kind mother earth for shelter fled and on her bosom hid its tender head peeps forth afresh and cheered by milder skies bids in full splendor all her beauties rise the hive is up in arms  expert to teach nor proudly to be taught unwilling each seems from her fellow a new zeal to catch strength in her limbs and on her wings dispatch the be goes forth from herb to herb she flies from flower to flower and loads her laboring thighs with treasured sweets robbing those flowers which left find not themselves made poorer by the theft their scents as lively and their looks as fair as if the pillager had not been there never does she flit on pleasures silken wing never does she loitring let the bloom of spring unrifled pass and on the downy breast of some fair flower indulge untimely rest never does she drinking deep of those rich dews which chemist night prepared that faith abuse due to the hive and selfish in her toils to her own private use convert the spoils love of the stock first called her forth to roam and to the stock she brings her booty home be this my pattern  as becomes a king let me fly all abroad on reasons wing let mine eye like the lightning through the earth run to and fro nor let one deed of worth in any place and time nor let one man whose actions may enrich dominions plan escape my note be all from the first day of nature to this hour be all my prey from those whom time at the desire of fame has spared let virtue catch an equal flame from those who not in mercy but in rage time has reprieved to damn from age to age let me take warning lessond to distill and imitating heaven draw good from ill nor let these great researches in my breast a monument of useless labor rest no  let them spread  the effects let gotham share and reap the harvest of their monarchs care be other times and other countries known only to give fresh blessings to my own let me and may that god to whom i fly on whom for needful succor i rely in this great hour that glorious god of truth through whom i reign in mercy to my youth assist my weakness and direct me right from every speck which hangs upon the sight purge my minds eye nor let one cloud remain to spread the shades of error over my brain let me impartial with unwearied thought try men and things let me as monarchs ought examine well on what my power depends what are the general principles and ends of government how empire first began and wherefore man was raised to reign over man let me consider as from one great source we see a thousand rivers take their course dispersed and into different channels led yet by their parent still supplied and fed that government though branched out far and wide in various modes to various lands applied however it differs in its outward frame in the main groundworks every where the same the same her view though different her plan her grand and general view the good of man let me find out by reasons sacred beams what system in itself most perfect seems most worthy man most likely to conduce to all the purposes of general use let me find too where by fair reason tried it fails when to particulars applied why in that mode all nations do not join and chiefly why it cannot suit with mine let me the gradual rise of empires trace till they seemed founded on perfections base then for when human things have made their way to excellence they hasten to decay let me whilst observation lends her clue step by step to their quick decline pursue enabled by a chain of facts to tell not only how they rose but how they fell let me not only the distempers know which in all states from common causes grow but likewise those which by the will of fate on each peculiar mode of empire wait which in its very constitution lurk too sure at last to do its destined work let me forewarned each sign each system learn that i my peoples danger may discern ever it is too late wished health to reassure and if it can be found find out a cure let me though great grave brethren of the gown preach all faith up and preach all reason down making those jar whom reason meant to join and vesting in themselves a right divine let me through reasons glass with searching eye into the depth of that religion pry which law has sanctiond let me find out there what is form what is essence what like vagrant air we well may change and what without a crime cannot be changed to the last hour of time nor let me suffer that outrageous zeal which without knowledge furious bigots feel fair in pretense though at the heart unfound these separate points at random to confound the times have been when priests have dared to tread proud and insulting on their monarchs head when whilst they made religion a pretense out of the world they banished common sense when some soft king too open to deceit easy and unsuspecting joined the cheat dupd by mock piety and gave his name to serve the vilest purposes of shame fear not my people where no cause of fear can justly rise  your king secures you here your king who scorns the haughty prelates nod nor deems the voice of priests the voice of god let me though lawyers may perhaps forbid their monarch to behold what they wish hid and for the purposes of knavish gain would have their trade a mystery remain let me disdaining all such slavish awe dive to the very bottom of the law let me the weak dead letter left behind search out the principles the spirit find till from the parts made master of the whole i see the constitutions very soul let me though statesmen will no doubt resist and to my eyes present a fearful lift of men whose wills are opposite to mine of men great men determined to resign let me with firmness which becomes a king conscious from what a source my actions spring determined not by worlds to be withstood when my grand object is my countrys good unravel all low ministerial scenes destroy their jobs lay bare their ways and means and track them step by step let me well know how places pensions and preferments go why guilts provided for when worth is not and why one man of merit is forgot let me in peace in war supreme preside and dare to know my way without a guide let me though dignity by nature proud retires from view and swells behind a cloud as if the sun shone with less powerful ray less grace less glory shining every day though when she comes forth into public sight unbending as a ghost she stalks upright with such an air as we have often seen and often laughed at in a tragic queen nor at her presence though base myriads crook the supple knee vouchsafes a single look let me all vain parade all empty pride all terrors of dominion laid aside all ornament and needless helps of art all those big looks which speak a little heart know which few kings alas have ever known how affability becomes a throne destroys all fear bids love with reverence live and gives those graces pride can never give let the stern tyrant keep a distant state and hating all men fear return of hate conscious of guilt retreat behind his throne secure from all upbraidings but his own let all my subjects have access to me be my ears open as my heart is free in full fair tide let information flow that evil is half cured whose cause we know and thou where ever thou art thou wretched thing who art afraid to look up to a king lay by thy fears  make but thy grievance plain and if i not redress thee may my reign close up that very moment  to prevent the course of justice from her fair intent in vain my nearest dearest friend shall plead in vain my mother kneel  my soul may bleed but must not change  when justice draws the dart though it is doomed to pierce a favrites heart it is mine to give it force to give it aim  i know it duty and i feel it fame the end of the third
