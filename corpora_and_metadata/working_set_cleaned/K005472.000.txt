human authority in matters of faith repugnant to christianity illustrated in two discourses on matthew xxiii    with a prefatory address explaining the particular occasion of offering them to the public  by the author of an essay on the justice of god  as the church of christ is the kingdom of christ he himself is king and in this it is implied that he is himself the sole lawgiver to his subjects  he has left behind no visibly human authority no vicegerents who can be said properly to supply his place no interpreters upon whom his subjects are absolutely to depend no judges over the consciences or religion of his people    they who have other lawgivers and judges in christs religion besides jesus christ  have set up to themselves the idol of an unintelligible authority both in belief and worship and practice in words under jesus christ but in deed and in truth over him  hoadleys sermon on the nature of christs kingdom london printed for j johnson no    in st pauls churchyard mdcclxxiv price one shilling and sixpence  the prefatory address etc the author of the following discourses has been frequently accused of cherishing in his own breast and laboring to diffuse among others a spirit of enmity against the members of the established church but this accusation has no other foundation than the ignorance or the passions of those who have raised it he can seriously and truly avow that he knows not what it is to wish evil to any man that he heartily wishes well to every one in the world others also can testify for him that next to the love of the supreme being the adorable source of all good there are no doctrines which he so earnestly and universally recommends as an abhorrence of every species of persecution a candid and dispassionate temper of mind toward those who differ from us and a generous boundless universal charity  is there however or can there be any kind of inconsistency between the sincerity of this profession and a thorough dislike to the mode of religion as by law established with warm and repeated animadversions upon the apprehended corruptions of it may i not have an unquestionable good will for a pagan while i detest idolatry as a disgrace to man and the highest insult that can be offered against heaven may i not be most affectionately disposed toward a papist a mahommedan and a jew while i despise popery and mahomedism and would take every convenient opportunity of exposing them as wicked impostures and while i have not the most distant inclination to embrace judaism churchmen who in the paroxisms of their zeal most violently declaim against the supposed heresies of the dissenters do not therefore i would hope hate the dissenters themselves and there are dissenters i am certain who make no scruple to charge the church with having adopted and still maintaining the most childish contradictory uncharitable and antichristian doctrines who notwithstanding entertain no antipathy against any churchman on the face of the earth but wish well to them all and would upon all occasions treat every individual of them not only according to the laws of common civility but also according to the strictest principles of humanity and brotherly love one of the most benevolent of men one who is known to cherish the most friendly disposition toward the members of the church as well as toward all men has repeatedly however charged the church itself with the heinous and barbarous crime of idolatry besides taxing it with a great variety of other follies and absurdities nor can i after revolving again and again the matter in my own mind see the least reason why the most rigid churchman should take umbrage either at the boldness or severity of this charge if it be groundless it reflects dishonor only upon the author and is most easily refuted if on the contrary it be well founded we should not degrade ourselves by traducing the very first genius of the age nor think that by vilifying him we change the nature of things but should acknowledge that he deserves the sincere thanks of mankind for his honest endeavors to enlighten reform and reclaim them to the pure worship of the only living and true god let the matter then be coolly and fairly debated the friends of orthodoxy have been repeatedly invited to point out the errors of this archheretic they have been particularly called upon to enter into a discussion of the doctrine now under consideration but they have all observed a profound silence except one who indeed cannot fairly rank among them though he entered the lists as their champion this gentleman however has since acknowledged himself mistaken if there are other more penetrating geniuses who as i have heard some of them pretend can still demonstrate our obligations to join in the athanasian worship why are they backward in executing so good a work why are they not so charitably disposed as to condescend to inform the more ignorant or if they find themselves unequal to the task why do they not renounce their claim to infallibility and give up their favorite idol as indefensible  but let those champions who would refute the charge and lead dr priestley to the knowledge of the truth be cautioned not to take refuge in church authority nor to divert our attention from the point in question by referring us to the opinions of fathers or councils nor to mispend their time by descanting upon any topics whatever that are not clearly to the purpose let them first precisely consider the nature of idolatry and then show the consistency between the first and great commandment and those addresses to christ and the holy ghost which run through the book of common prayer let them particularly explain to us how the true unitarian worship is contained in the following addresses taken from the litany the collect for trinity sunday and the communion service  o god the father of heaven have mercy upon us miserable sinners o god the son redeemer of the world have mercy upon us miserable sinners o god the holy ghost proceeding from the father and the son have mercy upon us miserable sinners o holy blessed and glorious trinity three persons and one god have mercy upon us miserable sinners remember not lord our ofnces etc spare us good lord  good lord deliver us  by the mystery of thy holy incarnation by thy holy nativity and circumcision by thy baptism fasting and temptation by thine agony and bloody sweat by thy cross and passion by thy precious death and burial by thy glorious resurrection and ascension and by the coming of the holy ghost etc see the litany it is hard to say what perplexities may not be removed by persons really possessed of the holy ghost this passage however is at present covered with such confusion and darkness in the view of the unregenerate that it seems neither above the dignity nor below the humility of a metropolitan to endeavor to explain it as the greatest men should not wish to have their good evilspoken of and as those who we are told have both received the holy ghost themselves and have the power also of conferring it upon others can certainly if our information be true enable us to comprehend every thing that is agreeable to the word of truth they should condescend to open the blind eyes was it only to prevent the strange ideas which some may otherwise entertain of the faith of bishops until we are thus enlightened a man who rather means to pity than insult them may be disposed to say that they have no certain object of religious worship or that they worship they know not what here in particular it might be said they first seem to believe that there is one god and father of all who is both able and willing to save but that they have no sooner addressed themselves to him than they seem to distrust either his power or his mercy and that they therefore address themselves to the son as if he only could or would have any compassion on them but that again having done this they seem instantly to lose all confidence both in the father and in the son and apply themselves therefore to the holy ghost as their only god the observer might continue to remark that when they had proceeded thus far in their worship they appeared to be all confusion again and that not knowing whether the father or the son or the holy ghost was the true god they called upon them all together not to miss the right object and in their extreme precipitation described the one god as consisting of three persons then follows it might be added a strange kind of incantation as it would seem to the three persons comprehended under the term lord which must shock such as are not initiated into the mysteries as it leads them to apprehend that the athanasians believe their god to have been a mortal man etc etc   almighty and everlasting god who have given unto us thy servants grace by the confession of a true faith to acknowledge the glory of the eternal trinity and in the power of the divine majesty to worship the unity collect for trinity sunday this is mystery with a witness the happy adventurer who succeeds in unfolding it will certainly find out the philosophers stone   glory be to god on high and in earth peace good will toward men we praise thee we bless thee we worship thee we give thanks to thee for thy great glory o lord god heavenly king god the father almighty o lord the onlybegotten son jesu christ o lord god lamb of god son of the father that take away the sins of the world have mercy upon us etc for thou only art holy thou only art the lord thou only o christ with the holy ghost art most high in the glory of god the father see the communion service it is difficult to determine whether this or the preceding passages are the most curious but perhaps they will be shortly explained to silence the murmurings of mr evanson and to convince the excellent lindsey of the error of his ways   besides it is well known that the clergy of the establishment take frequent opportunities of vindicating their principles and of extolling their service as the most pure and perfect system of religious worship under heaven as if not inspired and infallible approaching at least as near to divine perfection as human abilities could possibly carry it nay some of them on one particular day of the year not only take occasion to revile the principles of all dissenters but all dissenters themselves without making any kind of apology for their conduct without supposing indeed that any is necessary without imagining that they give just cause of offense to any one dissenter but rather that they merit the thanks of them all why may not a dissenter then freely propose and vindicate his own principles to dissenters why may not a dissenter without harboring a particle of enmity against any man in the world declare avow and publish what he apprehends to be the doctrines of reason and truth why may not a dissenter while all the arguments that have been hitherto advanced in favor of establishments are insufficient to work a conviction on his mind sincerely recommend as well as practice what he believes to be built upon the foundation of the prophets and apostles jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone who is there indeed has the least right to take offense at the undisguised declarations of an honest man who has truth alone for his object and who recommends what he believes to be truth not with the view of insulting any individual but only in the discharge of what he thinks his duty besides should he be imagined to labor under a very discernible weakness of intellect to have formed a wrong judgment to be bewildered with inveterate prejudices and to have entirely mistaken the grand plan of the gospel by what other method but openly communicating his sentiments to others could he stand any fair chance to have his understanding strengthened his erroneous opinions corrected the thick darkness which envelops him dispersed and his reason fully enlightened  i am certain that i am neither knowingly nor willingly deceived and that i would readily exchange my present sentiments for any others that could be shown to have even the probability of being better founded but notwithstanding this i can embrace nothing as truth which does not appear such to me if still however i am not able to discover or comprehend truth i can neither help my want of capacity nor justly incur any blame for it those indeed who would condemn me in this case might as reasonably condemn me for being either taller or shorter than themselves or for not being exactly similar to them in features or complexion in short i think any kind of apology for the following work so far as the matter of discourse may be insinuated to require one must be already anticipated by every candid mind or by every person who would deal with others as he wishes to be treated himself but to those who are yet disposed to think otherwise i will frankly declare in the words of an author whom i love to read and whom i love to think of that the things that seem to want an apology are the doctrines of original sin predestination trinity in unity satisfaction by vicarious punishments etc a hierarchy consisting of persons with names and powers altogether unknown in the new testament ecclesiastical persons as such invested with civil power contrary to the very genius of the religion of jesus christ whose kingdom was not of this world subscriptions to creeds and articles of faith of human composition the imposition of ceremonies by the authority of men in a church of which christ alone is the head such a church i know is asserted to be the church of christ but this seems to be a mistake as the church of christ has only one head and that head is christ whereas this other church sometimes acknowledges the bishops and sometimes the king and parliament to be its head or heads  and the enjoining of rites which are the remains and badges of popish superstition such as the wearing of a surplice the sign of the cross with godfathers and godmothers in baptism confirmation by the imposition of the hands of a bishop wheeling about to the east and bowing at the name of jesus as if it was a mere sound that was worshipped the posture of kneeling at the lords supper as it were in adoration of the elements of bread and wine etc etc etc such as these are the things that look as if they wanted some apology for certainly their reasonableness is far from being evident at first sight see the address to protestant dissenters as such   yet on another account i confess some apology may be necessary the doctrine which is here offered to the world has been already repeatedly and most clearly illustrated by men of the first rank for learning and genius why then it may be said should i challenge the attention of my brethren to that which has not even the claim of novelty to recommend it the question i acknowledge is by no means improper and therefore i will give it the best answer i can i would first observe that every republication of the plainest doctrine in a different style and manner from that of preceding writers may possibly be of considerable service to reimpress it upon our minds and to make us renew our acquaintance with it with fresh solicitude and success some advantage may arise from the same things being said in a different manner and upon a different occasion see address etc on the approaching election of members of parliament with respect to the state of public liberty in general and of american affairs in particular  what did not particularly strike us at one time may very forcibly strike us at another and lead to many unexpected and important enquiries besides the peculiarity of address belonging to any distinct writer however uncouth and unpleasing to the many may yet happen exactly to suit a certain class of readers as the most common scene of nature must when within their view communicate greater satisfaction to shortsighted people than the most enchanting distant prospect which their eyes cannot reach so to some persons the simplest language will have its advantages above the most elevated we are not all so constituted as to relish the grateful odours of the most sweetscented flowers or to discern the beauties of the finest or to find much entertainment among the greatest variety some again will prefer the open lawn to the cultivated garden some will bask under the piercing sunbeams rather than sequester themselves in the shady groves some delight in tumultuous cities others in the silent villages some climb the lofty mountains others can traverse only the humble vale and while some have sufficient fortitude and strength to penetrate the bewildering forest without being much alarmed or perplexed others have a thousand difficulties to contend with in traveling through the champaign country in like manner the metaphisical subtleties and sublime eloquence of a profoundly learned philosopher may be wholly lost upon persons of inferior understanding who will yet be much pleased and edified with plain language and unpolished periods  but if any farther apology should be deemed necessary for the publication of the following discourses there are some dissenters whom it may possibly be a more arduous task to satisfy on this head than even the generality of rigid churchmen the latter however need not plume themselves on this account whatever be the severity and narrow way of thinking of the former still freedom is found with the dissenters alone this very freedom prevents their disguising one another faults and makes them drop all ceremony where they apprehend one another are to blame on the contrary there are those of the establishment to be found who when they think the honor of their church is concerned are ready to throw the mantle of oblivion over ten thousand things which in themselves by no means please them and whatever in theory be the boasted freedom of many churchmen they can have no great cause of glorying while they are known to continue in their chains and either have not inclination or resolution sufficient to shake them off  some dissenters have such a peculiar delicacy about them others are so prudent others again are so sharpsighted in business or so obsequious to fashion that a man becomes their enemy for telling them the truth the author is concerned to reflect that he has had frequent proofs of this these discourses in particular gave great and almost universal offense to a certain society of dissenters who would be thought to be possessed of liberal candid and enlarged principles some persons have suggested that the disgust conceived against these discourses was universal but the author has the strongest proofs to the contrary as he knows several who were both highly pleased with the sentiments they contain and with the freedom in which they were delivered  they abused the author as a flaming incendiary who meant to offer them an outrageous insult and to excite them to wage incessant war with the church and they boasted with a peculiar selfsatisfaction how generally the laugh circulated among them while the discourses were delivering  they must surely be delighted then to receive entire from the press the subject of so much pleasantry as their memories are possibly not so perfect but that some sentiments which they eagerly endeavor to recollect may have escaped them and as they would no doubt fondly retain the particular obnoxious passages which so highly disgusted them that they may indulge their good humor upon them afresh and likewise edify others by their remarks he is willing therefore to gratify them to the full and to give them the best opportunity they can wish for of throwing confusion upon his whole scheme he is willing at any rate for more reasons than one that they should reconsider the matter particularly as persons often find fault with a speaker only because they misapprehend him this publication may be of some use to prevent a misrepresentation of things as it will empower those who did not hear it to criticize upon it as precisely and judiciously as those who did  but whatever be the event should the respectable society he is speaking of still continue in the same sentiments and be able also clearly to convince him that he has totally mistaken his subject he shall after all express his great surprise and astonishment that they as dissenters should have so little forbearance among them or that they should have been so vehemently irritated against him for what in any view can be called by no harsher name than the weakness of an honest zeal his surprise and astonishment will continue to increase as he proceeds to reflect what peculiar advantages this society has enjoyed for a long series of years past under the ministry of a trulyapostolic teacher  the author must farther remark that he thinks the dissenters here referred to have paid their acquaintance of the establishment but a coarse kind of compliment when they supposed that these would discover a high resentment either against him or against them for the freedom he used that is for vindicating while he continues to think it right to separate his separation from the establishment we should not suppose without full evidence at least that the members of the establishment would even wish to abridge us of the liberty of declaring our sentiments without disguise or that they would refuse to be upon the most friendly terms with us because we consistently affirm that we believe them to be in the wrong and ourselves to be right but if they will unreasonably be angry with us we cannot help their displeasure nor shall it reduce us to silence some persons are forward to raise the cry of disturbers of the peace against us when we presume to utter or recommend any sentiments that deviate a little from those of the multitude but they should learn as the famous bishop of bangor expressed himself upon this subject that the peace of christs kingdom is a manly and reasonable peace built upon charity and love and mutual forbearance and receiving one another as god receives us as for any other peace founded upon a submission of our honesty as well as our understandings it is falsely so called it is not the peace of the kingdom of christ but the lethargy of it and a sleep unto death when his subjects shall throw off their relation to him fix their subjection to others and even in cases where they have a right to see and where they think they see his will otherwise shall shut their eyes and go blindfold at the command of others because those others are not pleased with their enquiries into the will of their great lord and judge   my great remaining difficulty is that the very persons who expressed so warm an indignation at these discourses acknowledged at the same time as i am informed that every assertion contained in them was true will they avow then that truth is their abhorrence will they insinuate that truth is inimical to mankind will they pretend that we should be ashamed of important truths or that we should only communicate them in secret what sentiments upon this supposition can they entertain of jesus christ he was truth itself truth came by him he taught us nothing but truth and he appeared to lead us into all truth there seems therefore to be a high insult offered to him and very reproachful reflections cast upon his conduct when we resent the declaration of known or apprehended truths for upon the same principle had we lived in his age we would as his kingdom was not of this world have treated him with as unrelenting severity as he experienced from the jews  but instead of minutely accounting for what appears to me to be a glaring contradiction in their conduct i will now leave them to their own deliberations after sincerely assuring them that in whatever light they may be still pleased to judge of me they shall always enjoy my hearty good wishes  human authority in matters of faith etc discourse the first matthew xxiii viii one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren the gospel precepts are remarkable in general for their simplicity they come not recommended to us by the borrowed charms of eloquence or by any of the embellishments of art but by what is of much greater importance their own intrinsic excellence and as we would naturally expect that the great governor of the world when he condescendeth to reveal himself to man would not suffer things of the utmost consequence to be involved in obscurity we find accordingly that the more important any doctrine is the more intelligible are the terms in which it is universally expressed the way of duty the way to happiness is always pointed out in such legible characters that he that runs may read that allegiance also which is required in spiritual things is unfolded to us in the plainest language but to our great astonishment those very doctrines in which sophistry itself can discover no ambiguity have been the most grossly perverted the most presumptuously and impiously opposed but without searching the ample page of history for a variety of particulars in proof of this such reflections as offer themselves to our consideration from the words of the text will be abundantly sufficient to our purpose  as an introduction to what i propose it will be proper first of all to observe that the whole chapter abounds with some singularly affecting animadversions which our lord had made upon the superstition hypocrisy and other vices of the scribes and pharisees he gives us a summary view of their injustice cruelty oppression and uncharitableness and stripping them of all their artificial sanctity delineates their true characters in the most lively and expressive colors they imposed he says heavy burdens upon others by which they would not be bound themselves they pretended to be the most strictly just and pious of men at the same time that they devoured widows houses and while they were so punctiliously exact in their attention to what was then a branch of the externals of religion as to tithe such things as mint anise and cummin they scandalously neglected those weightier matters of the law justice mercy and faith  but besides a variety of other crimes to which they were notoriously addicted they completed their infamy by exercising an impious dominion over the consciences of others they claimed the power of prescribing certain ceremonies and shut up the kingdom of heaven against all opponents with all the grimace of an affected superlative holiness they compassed sea and land to make one proselyte when in their own hearts there was nothing but ravening and wickedness in short they laid a much greater stress upon a devout attention to insignificant forms than in living up to the perfect rules of righteousness and truth and as our lord expresses it they strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel  it might be well expected then that a teacher sent from god would most cautiously guard his disciples against such enormous corruptions and that he would charge them with a peculiar earnestness not to assume those overbearing principles of pride and superiority which actuated their enemies nor to form the most distant intention of founding a system of religious aristocracy over one another this had been the very fountain of all those iniquities which filled his pure mind with the utmost indignation and abhorrence he accordingly thus solemnly addresseth himself to those whom he had chosen out of the world be not ye called rabbi that is doctors or spiritual guides for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren that is all children of the same common universal father and all therefore in religious matters invested with exactly the same authority and power he could not have more fully expressed himself if he had said i only am the way the truth and the life those doctrines which i have received of my father are henceforth to be accounted the only true standard of faith and practice by those therefore you should be governed here because by those alone you shall be judged hereafter  had all those who have ever since professed themselves the followers of jesus observed a due submission to these divine admonitions we might now familiarize to our minds the various and complicated transactions of former times with perpetually increasing pleasure and delight we might be able to read the histories of a long succession of past ages without that degree of overwhelming horror which unavoidably rises in the soul at the view of that violence and barbarity which have been exercised upon the saints of the earth who have been crusaded massacred burnt and torn in pieces and that by those who have impiously named the name of christ for no other cause whatever than their honestly maintaining an inviolable allegiance to christ  but we all know that this antichristian and diabolical spirit which formerly prevailed among the scribes and pharisees was next adopted in all it is aggravating circumstances by that mother of harlots and abominations of the earth the church of rome and we know the horrible and unparrallelled inhumanities of this church what fires she has kindled what rivers of blood she has shed what cities and towns she has laid in ruins what extensive provinces she has desolated and what thousands of innocent victims she has butchered in order to support these hellish claims but happy would it be for the world unspeakably happy if we could name no other church which has been partaker of her sins happy would it be for the world if the monster of which we are here speaking was not still living beyond the boundaries of the papal empire and blasting the fair fruits of the blessed gospel among those who call themselves protestants happy would it be for us if even in this enlightened land there was now only one master even christ but whatever pain and astonishment we must feel at the recital truth compels us to declare that wherever there is any human creed established there there are more masters than one there there is an authority diametrically opposite to the authority of christ and fundamentally subversive of it this i propose to illustrate in the following discourses it is evident i think indeed from the words of the text thenselves for when our lord says one is your master even christ he means as much as if he had affirmed you have no spiritual jurisdiction at all one over the other  churches the author refers to such constitutions as have been since called churches are not your master mitred priests or ghostly fathers are not your master christ alone is your master and his laws are to be learned only from his own mouth without the intervention of any human authority whatever  but now to establish this doctrine upon the very best foundation i shall endeavor to show in the first place that jesus christ had the unquestionable authority of heaven for assuming that distinguishing preeminence which he here claimed namely that of being our only infallible teacher of religion as the word master in this place signifies and hence it will be easy to show the inconsistency absurdity and impiety of those who by naming the name of christ most solemnly admit this doctrine and yet in every instance of their conduct and with a shameless effrontery act repugnant to it  in the first place i shall endeavor to show that jesus christ had the unquestionable authority of heaven for assuming that distinguishing preeminence which he here claimed namely that of being our only infallible teacher of religion it is undoubtedly the sole prerogative of the eternal jehovah to give laws to man it is his prerogative likewise to communicate these laws at what time in what manner by what sanctions and by what messengers he pleases and whenever or by whomever his wisdom determines either to republish and enlarge old laws or to reveal new laws it is our indispensable duty to obey but then we are not to receive as divine laws all doctrines that are recommended to us as such for this would expose us to the most palpable contradictions and to millions of impositions on the contrary because we are required to submit to the divine authority only we should first be assured before we receive any doctrine that it is divine and this we can only know by bringing the said doctrine before the high tribunal of reason reason is unquestionably a divine law written with indelible characters upon every human heart and as the peerless perfections of almighty god will not admit even the thought that he can contradict himself or that he can give us contradictory laws we may therefore conclude that no laws can be divine which are a contradiction to our reason or which are plainly repugnant to that sense of right and wrong which is implanted in the soul and which is another divine law but if on the contrary any doctrines that are recommended to us as divine be found to correspond with the congenial sentiments of our minds and with the demonstrable perfections of god in the universe around us and are moreover confirmed by the most incontestable evidences of the divine power then we may rest assured that these doctrines descended from above from the father of lights and that the teacher of these doctrines is the sent of god  hence then it will clearly appear that jesus christ was the anointed messenger of god and fully commissioned by him to point out the way of salvation to man for he taught us no doctrines that are contrary to our reason but such as rather illuminate and perfect our reason in the highest degree and he established these very doctrines not as ignorance or malice have falsely asserted by attempting to extinguish the light of reason within us but by the most solemn appeals to this primary law of god to man what a wonderful contrast do we discover between him and all his pretended delegates or vicegerents and coadjutors upon earth how proud are they how humble was he without professing the least portion of his spirit they have lorded it over gods heritage with a rod of iron but he though the way to truth and the life though he spoke as never man spoke and though god was always with him and always taught him did not yet require an implicit faith from any of his followers he knew on the contrary that one divine law is best enforced and recommended by another divine law and he therefore submitted all his claims to the decisions of reason he drew up no inexplicable systems of faith for us to subscribe or to acquiesce in in the room of works the point that he labored was to make men good and not what the fashion of the times had received as orthodox in short he never addressed himself to the jews in the imperative tone of modern priests swallow down this mystery and the other mystery believe though your own reason demonstrates the contrary that three are no more than one and that one is as many as three else you shall have no peace in the other world and i will give you as much trouble as i can in this no he challenged them to examine his own pretensions according to those very scriptures in which they themselves believed search the scriptures says he for they be they that testify of me he challenged them to accuse him if they could of any single transgression of the divine laws which of you convinces me of sin he challenged them to convict him of any falsehood or to fix upon him any expressions or declarations that were contrary to the most indubitable perfections of god and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me he challenged them to show that any one of his miracles could be effected by any other power than that of omnipotence and if i do not the works of my father believe me not and he challenged them to produce any arguments why god would be with him in all that he did if he had not come to do the will of god and had not received his commission immediately from god the works which i do in my fathers name bear witness of me a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand and if satan cast out satan his kingdom cannot stand but if i by the spirit of god overwhelm the works of darkness then is the kingdom of god come unto you  all this we must see was sound reasoning and demonstrably proved that jesus was the son of god with power that he came not of himself that he spoke not of himself that he did nothing of himself but that whatever he did was by the power of the highest his holiness his wisdom his humility his selfdenial and his innumerable astonishing miracles did all proclaim him to be the wellbeloved of the father full of grace and truth and the importance of his doctrines and the benevolent scheme which he came to propose to the souls of men call up our most earnest attention to all that he did and taught and suffered for us  he was holy harmless undefiled and separate from sinners the spotless lamb of god without blemish without guile without a single deflection from the ways of righteousness and truth all this was fully characteristic of his heavenly origin it is such a one as he whom we would naturally expect the holy majesty of the universe and the father of all mercies to send into the world one who could no more betray us by his example than by his precepts one who was as amiable and lovely in his life as in his doctrines one in whom virtue might be seen breathing celestial sweetness displaying a thousand thousand inexpressibly venerable charms adorned with every grace possessing every excellence and beauty and superior in glory to the splendour of the sun and the brightness of the firmament  but the wisdom of jesus is another demonstrable proof of his divine mission the people might well be astonished at his doctrines for they were such as never had been taught before such as infinitely surpassed all the systems of the ancient sages he carried morality to its highest purity and perfection nothing now can be added to what he has said upon it and after a trial of above seventeen hundred years no exception can yet be made to a single precept he has given besides he alone has represented to us the perfections of the true god in their native dignity and glory leading us to consider him as the one spirit and universal father the only omnipotent the only author of every good whose providence continually watches over the minutest works of his hands and he being the best judge of human nature that ever appeared in our world both in delivering those sublime and unparrellelled doctrines universally and with an astonishing exactness adapted his address to the various characters of his audience frequently drawing them to condemn their impious conduct according to their own principles and afterward with irresistible force in extempore parables abounding with innumerable beauties and such as have never been equalled by any other son of man beating down all the strong holds of iniquity that stood before him and majestically scattering the whole immense mass of darkness which covered the world now upon what other conceivable foundation is such wisdom to be accounted for than by allowing him to have been a divine messenger how is it possible to be accounted for that the reputed son of a poor carpenter untrained in the schools without any of the aids of philosophy should have been the wisest of men and the only infallible teacher of righteousness and truth unless he was taught of god and sent by him to be the light of men could he without either any divine or human aids have been so singularly happy as to have infinitely eclipsed in knowledge all the men who lived before and after him or would the god of all wisdom and grace have given him only an understanding to know the things that are excellent had not he been under the constant influence of his good will and pleasure  but the humility and selfdenial of the blessed jesus likewise demonstrably prove him to have been our heavenly appointed master or teacher had he come to establish some favorite scheme of his own he would certainly have aimed at as much power and authority as he could prudently assume he would have availed himself of the friendship of this world and would have let no fair opportunity escape of fanning the fire of popular prejudices in his favor but he was meek and lowly of heart and came not to be ministered unto but to minister he sought not honor from men but that which comes from god only instead of aiming at temporal dominions grasping at the scepter of universal empire or climbing the summit of transient greatness he cheerfully offered himself to be the servant of all he declared in the most unequivocal language that his kingdom was not of this world and that if we would stand candidates for his favor or finally enter into the joy of our lord we must deny ourselves and take up our cross daily to follow him and he died as he lived gloriously avowing the same sentiments maintaining the same dignity expressing the same contempt for all earthly possessions discovering the same generous benevolence to man and reposing the same unlimited confidence in his god and father  now could all this have possibly happened unless god had sent him did any person ever yet espouse a cause that promised and aimed at nothing but poverty contempt and sufferings and die in the same without reluctance unless he had full evidence clear and irresistible evidence that this cause was the cause of god the supposition is ridiculous and a contradiction to itself this argument alone therefore sufficiently proves that jesus had his authority from above that the god of all wisdom inspired and taught him and that he was divinely appointed to be our master in religion  but besides the holiness the wisdom the humility and selfdenial of our lord god also bore witness to him by a successive train of the most stupendous miracles miracles which mere human art or power can no more accomplish than we can arrest the sun in its course or create another sun or another world the tempestuous ocean was instantly becalmed lunatics were restored to their right mind the deaf the dumb the lame and the blind lost all their complaints and the sick all their diseases in a moment and the dead were raised to life only by his word or touch and these things were not done in a corner nor transacted in darkness but in the face of day and amidst thousands of spectators and under the inspection too of determined enemies  but last of all god gave his omnipotent sanction to all his claims by making him victorious over death and the grave the third day after his crucifixion and shortly after carrying him up visibly into heaven to give him the government of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers hence then it is demonstrable that he was his wellbeloved son in whom he was wellpleased that he could have taught us nothing but the will of the most high god since the most high god was always with him and that he had therefore the most unquestionable authority for assuming and exercising the sublime office of instructing all the children of men in the way of salvation  this point then being once illustrated it will clearly follow that it is our indispensable duty to submit to him as our one master and that the same deference and obedience are now due unto his laws as if they were immediately proclaimed to us from the lofty throne of god for since he has not spoken of himself but that the father who sent him gave him a commandment what he should say and what he should speak he therefore that believes on him believes not on him but on him that sent him and all therefore should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honors not the son since he was sent by the father honors not the father who sent him john       these words cannot possibly convey so absurd and impious an idea as that we should consider the son upon an equality with the father or even that the son should become as high an object of our adoration the word  never signifies aequaliter equally but quum sicut inasmuch as and the only rational construction that can be put upon this celebrated passage is that all men should honor the son if they really do honor the father or if they would show that they really honor the father and thus our lord fully explained it in the following words when he says he that honors not the son honors not the father who has sent him as if he had said by affirming that all men should honor the son etc i mean that he that honors not the son etc as he said at another time he that despised him despises not him but him that sent him it was really the father who was dishonored when no regard was paid to the declarations of the son he acted under the authority of the father and he vindicated not his own authority he claimed no authority of his own but the authority of the father i can of my own self says he in this very chapter do nothing as i hear i judge  i seek not my own will but the will of the father who sent me if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that bears witness of me  the works which the father has given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father has sent me and the father himself who has sent me has borne witness of me  i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not etc how astonishing is it then that men can represent our lord as contradictorily claiming in the same breath what he had so repeatedly disavowed and rejected namely those divine honors which belong to the father only or as teaching us that we should make no distinction between him who did nothing of himself and him who did all things by him and can do all things of himself and that we should render the same personal homage to the messenger of god whose whole dependence was upon god as to the unchangeable and everlasting god himself  hence then we should be taught to pay the most solemn attention to every doctrine he has revealed lest we by the rejection of any either through interest or influence or lust or through any other motives whatever should be found fighting against god hence again we should be particularly taught not to take any of these doctrines upon trust lest they should be disguised or misrepresented to us but since they are not communicated to certain delegates to put what interpretation they please upon them but graciously communicated to all men to be persuaded each of us for himself to examine seriously what they are as they stand recorded in the sacred volume again after they thus appear to us in their full extent and native purity all the honors and applauses of men all the riches and pleasures of the world and all the powers of earth and hell united should not prevail so much as the dust of the balance to draw us from our duty we should be steadfast and immovable in our adherence to them in opposition to every enemy and every temptation we should be ready even to lay down our lives in witnessing a good confession for it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living god or to incur his sovereign displeasure by a negligent inattention or obstinate resistance to his will none can deliver out of his hands nor can any corner of the universe conceal us from his view or place us beyond the reach of his power  but besides the motive of escaping the folly and impiety of defying the omnipotent wrath of god or besides the just apprehension that we shall appear guilty before god for pouring contempt upon his ambassador it is also to be considered that jesus christ recommends himself to us as our most endearing and acceptable master by the importance of the doctrines which he taught and the benevolence of the scheme which he has proposed to the souls of men the doctrines he taught are of the utmost importance to the peace and happiness of the whole human race they oppose all our destroying enemies and are freedom health and joy to the mind that we would love the supreme being with all the heart and repose an unlimited confidence in his unceasing bounty these doctrines aggrandize the soul and afford us infinite security and complacency in all circumstances and that we would fly from all distraction and woe from all the fears of jealousy from all the pains of envy and discontent and from all the bitterness of wrath and malice by receiving and cherishing the heavenly blessings of temperance chastity truth righteousness and brotherly love these are the doctrines which every man who wishes well to human nature would see universally taught and practiced these are the doctrines which every friend to man would wish to have ushered into the world by the most glorious displays of the divine power and these are the doctrines which every friend to himself would cherish as his joy and crown and perpetually observe and cultivate for nothing more is wanted to banish misery out of the world nothing more is wanted to plant sweets in the desert and shelter us from all the storms of life nothing more is wanted to root up the briars and thorns which so often weary and perplex us and to make the whole earth a paradise of delights that man is therefore the enemy of human nature as well as his own tormentor and a traitor to his god who would oppose the progress of the gospel who does not rejoice that christ is our divinely appointed master and who would not cheerfully spend and be spent to bring all the sons and daughters of men into subjection to his authority but the benevolent scheme which the son of god has proposed to our acceptance is much greater than all this goes far beyond the line of time graspeth in its reach the utmost bounds of immense eternity for god was in christ jesus reconciling the world to himself gracious forbearing and longsuffering not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and therefore communicating through him the glad tidings of everlasting salvation to the whole body of his rational creatures here below besides providing in the best manner for their temporal happiness and instructing them how to overcome those lusts that war against the soul he was likewise pleased in the adorable overflowings of his love to hold out to their admiring view the bright prospect of endless life and endless bliss he was rich unto all that called upon him and he granted to all a full remission of all the sins that were past and repented of and while he enlightened and refreshed them with the most reviving precious promises of pardon of a complete conquest over death and the grave and of an unfading future and eternal crown of glory these wonderful communications of his love were accompanied with the solid encouragements to cast all our cares and burdens upon god and to cry unto him in all our distresses as our everpresent protector and friend and these were likewise accompanied with the blessed assurances that god will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able that he will never leave us nor forsake us while we persevere in our duty and that he will make all things work together for good to them that love him in short the love of god in christ jesus our lord comprehends in it every thing that our ambitious hearts can wish or desire is amply sufficient to employ all the wonder of the most enlarged faculties of the most capacious soul and to satisfy us for ever nay eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which god has prepared for them that love him and to bring us to the possession of which he of his infinite wisdom and goodness has appointed jesus christ to be our one master example and guide  how then should we joy in god through our lord jesus christ what gratitude should possess our hearts what divine pleasures should fill our souls with what unceasing warmth of affection should we look up to heaven to reflect that so excellent a personage is appointed to reign over us to save us from our sins to lead us to all truth and to make us kings and priests unto god for ever there can be no greater salvation the very thought of it should make us break out into the loftiest songs of adoration and praise indeed every thing in the world should be estimated as dross and dung when compared with this we should therefore hold this fast we should sell it for no price we should value it above all precious substance it should be dearer to us than our lives in short we should willingly relinquish every earthly comfort and cheerfully submit to every earthly suffering in maintaining our allegiance inviolable to our one divinelyappointed master even christ for how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation and what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul  hence then let us be seriously persuaded humbly and joyfully to acquiesce in the authority of christ and to testify through life the most dutiful and ready compliance with all those laws which he has revealed let not on the one hand all the terrors of persecution that can be raised against us nor on the other hand all the accumulated honors that can be bestowed upon us and much less let the mode or fashion of the times which can only influence slaves be able to turn us aside from our obedience but considering our dignity and privileges as the children of god and the called to an inheritance that is incorruptible and undefiled and that fades not away reserved in heaven for us let us nobly and triumphantly resolve with the apostle paul that neither the world nor death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord  but having now shown you that jesus christ had manifestly the high authority of heaven for claiming that distinguished preeminence which he assumed in the text namely that of being our one master or our only infallible teacher of religion and having hence clearly pointed out our duty and happiness to be guided by him in the true way to eternal life our next enquiry will be what is particularly implied in our acknowledging him as our one master our only master and submitting to him as such but at present our time will not permit us to enter upon this part of our subject  let me however just express my sincere wishes that what has been said may have a sufficient force to bind us to our duty to make us in all circumstances approve ourselves the genuine disciples of christ aiming at whatever is good and acceptable to the lord and not caring what shall befall us in this life so that we may finish our course with joy  to this purpose let us exercise ourselves during the interval of social worship in preferring petitions to the father of lights that he may guide us by his counsel that all prejudice may be rooted out of our hearts that we may know the truth and that the truth may make us free  amen human authority in matters of faith etc discourse the second matthew xxiii viii one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren i have endeavored to show in the preceding discourse that our lord had the unquestionable authority of heaven for claiming that high and distinguishing preeminence which he here assumes namely that of being our one master or only infallible teacher of religion this appears i observed from all those most illustrious virtues and heavenly graces which composed his character from that sublime and unparallelled knowledge which he possessed and from that divine power which universally upheld and bore witness of him his holiness his wisdom his humility his selfdenial and those innumerable and astonishing miracles which he performed through the power of the highest together with the purity benevolence perfection and importance of the doctrines which he taught all demonstrably evince that he was the wellbeloved of the father the chosen messenger of his salvation full of grace and truth  hence i observed as the clear consequence of this doctrine that it is our indispensable duty to submit to his authority and to pay the same deference and obedience to all his laws as if they were now immediately proclaimed to us from the lofty throne of god  but our duty being once obviously pointed out it then becomes a matter of the greater importance i shall therefore as was proposed in the next place enquire at present what is the full extent of this duty or what is particularly implied in acknowledging christ to be our one master and submitting to him as such and this evidently implies no less than that we should acknowledge no other man or body of men whatever considered either as in competition with him or in conjunction with him to be our master the one master signifies the one only master we accordingly find that he had all authority committed to him by the father and that he is constituted the only lawgiver and king in his church and from this it incontrovertibly follows that we as the true subjects of his kingdom must in a religious capacity submit to his laws only these laws it is again obvious to observe are to be found in the gospel only for this sacred volume contains the whole doctrine of christ which was either taught by himself in person or by his apostles whom after him he commissioned to preach his name among all nations thou shall not diminish aught from it neither shall any thing be added to it  hence then we learn in the first place that every law of the gospel demands our full acquiescence and obedience but that every law on the contrary that is formed in opposition to the gospel is a daring encroachment upon our native rights a traitorous imposition upon our understandings and an impious rebellion against god himself because a rebellion against the one master whom he has appointed  should any system or doctrine therefore by the wife and the learned be now proposed to us as a rule of faith our first business is to enquire whether this be the religion of christ if this be affirmed we would then ask whether the thing proposed be the gospel itself if this be denied on the contrary we would say that we have only one master even christ but if we are again told that what is proposed is a true summary of the gospel we would in this case reply that the gospel is its own best summary that we have nothing to do with any other that christ has expressly taught us to search the scriptures but never taught us to take up with any pretended summary of them but should it farther be insisted on that the thing proposed is the doctrine of the true church we would then ask of what true church should it be answered of the true christian church we would say that the true christian church has no rule of faith but the naked gospel should we however be still told of the true christian church as established by human laws to this we would give in our testimony that christs kingdom is not of this world that he has appointed no subgovernors in his church and that when one is of paul and one of apollos and one of cephas all these have so far withdrawn themselves from the church of christ but if it should be said in the last place that we are incompetent judges of the scriptures that the busy part of mankind have not time to study them nor capacities to understand them and that therefore for the prevention of heresy there are certain holy officers appointed in gods church and purposely trained up at the foot of the altar and solemnly called and consecrated to deliver to us the true sense of scripture all this i would positively deny or willing to do something more than offer what may be called a bold assertion i would argue in this manner if there be as is here pretended any officers appointed in gods church to deliver to us the true sense of scripture let them produce their credentials before they authoritatively require us to abide by their decisions god can certainly bear witness of himself and if he has sent these men it may be expected that he will work miracles by them but on the contrary if men have sent them or if they of themselves have assumed what they have not the least ground of pretension to let them return from whence they came for the christian has only one master even christ  besides the pretense itself that we are incompetent judges of the scriptures at least so far as our salvation is concerned in the understanding them is absolutely without proof not being warranted in a single instance either by christ or by any of his apostles our lord on the contrary addresseth himself to the understandings of men for if i do not the works of my father says he believe me not a farther proof of this among many others is that our lord proposed that his gospel should be preached to the poor signifying that the poor and illiterate were competent judges of its contents and that they should judge of it for themselves independently of the explication of the rich and the learned  the apostles in like manner supposed that we are all capable of reasoning and determining for ourselves why even of yourselves is their language judge ye not what is right i speak as unto wise men judge ye what i say and truly had the matter been otherwise or had men been taught implicitly to acquiesce in the dictates of their leaders instead of being directed by their own enquiries after truth there could never have been a christian in the world  but still farther the authority in question namely that of imposing upon one another any particular sense of scripture and calling ourselves the church and then drawing up a rule of faith for others which ignorance may invent and power enforce under the pious sanction of pains imprisonment etc this authority i say which has always extended it is influence in proportion to the barbarism of the age is expressly and most solemnly condemned by the authority of christ he says that we are all brethren that we have therefore no authority over one another he says that we have only one master it is an act of treason therefore committed against him to acknowledge any other master and he says that we shall not as his followers we cannot like the unenlightened heathens exercise lordship or dominion over one another what is here asserted is an undeniably clear inference from the express words of christ matthew xx       ye know said he to the disciples that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you see the whole context to this passage as we find it related from the  0th to the   th verses see also the parallel places mark x    and luke xxii     that therefore neither those men nor those churches that usurp any kind of spiritual jurisdiction over our faith can belong to his kingdom i would not however be understood to insinuate that none but the professors of pure christianity will be saved none but the dishonest need dread the displeasure of god besides there are many who in their moral conduct act up to the character of christians whose profession is antichristian these would certainly be more exalted characters if renouncing all inferior authority they would put themselves under the direction of christ alone but they cannot consistently call themselves the true servants of christ while they submit to any foreign jurisdiction  he has moreover instructed us that we are to search the scriptures ourselves and not that others are to search them for us john v    search the scriptures that is do you yourselves search the scriptures for yourselves be your own judges what they say and how not like slaves in what is submitted to your own understandings to the magisterial decisions of those who would interpret them for you   the apostles of christ likewise charge every man to be fully persuaded in his own mind and to stand fast in that liberty wherewith christ has made us free they again teach us instead of submitting or subscribing to any articles and confessions of faith composed by weak and fallible or by proud and tyrannical men to prove all things and to hold fast that which is best and they pretend to commend themselves to the consciences of men only by manifestation of the truth paul peculiarly distinguished himself in recommending these doctrines the other apostles breathed the same spirit  they farther instead of calling themselves our spiritual lords or our right reverend or reverend fathers utterly disclaim the being lords over gods heritage would only be esteemed examples to the flock helpers of their joy and their brethren and once more they instead of requiring an implicit faith from their followers highly applauded the conduct of those who tried even their inspired doctrines according to the divine rule and those of berea said they are more noble than those of thessalonica because they searched the scriptures to see if those things those things that were spoken by the apostles themselves were so or not the bereans in the opinion of some of our modern doctors should have submitted to the decisions of the church should have humbly and dutifully acquiesced in the various glosses and commentaries of the scribes and pharisees the legally appointed leaders of the national worship but they were such heretics as to search the scriptures themselves and the apostles were such heretics as to applaud them for this very conduct   what shall we say then of the pretended successors of the apostles when they would deprive us of the liberty of searching the scriptures arrogant and impious men how dare they so much as name the name of christ and yet establish by violence their own opinions in opposition to the word of god most explicitly revealed by christ or how dare they deny us the privileges of rational beings who have the candle of the lord within us as well as themselves by affirming or insinuating that we must take their sense of scripture for the true sense and that we must neither judge nor think for ourselves nay grant them but this single point and they as effectually rob us of the benefit of the scriptures as if we had no possible access to them or could never be permitted to see them but in an unknown tongue  but whether god is to be obeyed rather than man judge ye  the scriptures are the great charter of heaven to every man which we are required to examine for ourselves and of which we are required to judge for ourselves as they therefore demand our most cordial and grateful reception we should inviolably maintain the full possession of them and not by neglecting to make that proper use of them which the divine being intended spurn them from us as gifts not worth preserving but while without evidence we submit to that sense of the scriptures which has been affixed to them by men we are then only the servants of men on the contrary while we seriously read and judge for ourselves and are determined by that sense of scripture which appears to the conviction of our own minds to be the true sense of scripture we then submit to the divine authority and are the servants of christ  upon the whole it is evident that all human authority in matters of faith is fundamentally subversive of the christian religion and that all those therefore are so far the enemies of christ who submit to any such authority or who either directly or indirectly countenance any such authority when any men therefore or body of men or when any church pretend to claim or exercise any such authority to establish any human creeds or articles or confessions of faith we are warranted to conclude with the inspired address come out from among them o my people and be ye separate and not partakers of their sins  but secondly we may advance a step farther and show likewise that all human authority in matters of faith is absolutely repugnant to the very nature of religion itself religion is a conformity to the will of god arising from his dominion over us and all the obligations which we owe him but how are the opinions of men to be regarded as his will these vary as much as our faces and positively contradict one another which his will cannot these also contradict his will when they contradict that law which is written in our hearts for this law is his will those therefore who upon their own authority would impose on us any particular standard of faith dethrone as much as in them lies the divine authority and those again who submit to their authority do so far disclaim all loyalty to the king of kings besides god is our father he himself has shown us what is good and revealed to us the way of life our own breasts therefore are our best monitors and the word of god our only guide those very men who would impose upon us additional creeds etc confess that the scriptures contain the word and will of god when at the same time then they will not allow the gospel to be a sufficient guide to heaven but presume as it were to perfect it by their additions do they not most daringly and impiously set themselves above god  it is to be considered too that he is possessed of all power as well as of all wisdom and goodness his perfections then will not admit the thought that he has left our precious souls in the feeble hands of the church whether it be a popish one or an episcopalian one or a presbyterian one nor shall any of those creed and confessionmakers therefore persuade us to be led blindfold to salvation until they can first produce their commission clearly sealed with the seal of heaven nay if the blind lead the blind both must fall into the ditch and to conclude this point unless our religion be supported on a thorough conviction and a deliberate choice it can neither be a reasonable service nor pleasing nor acceptable to the god of truth  but i would observe in the third place that all human authority in matters of faith is a notorious departure from our original and avowed principles as protestants i might considerably enlarge upon this head but besides being precluded through the want of time very few observations will be sufficient to my purpose we cannot then it is obvious without the greatest absurdity and the most glaring contradictions claim that as our own right which we oppose in the church of rome for that is certainly lawful in the church of rome which is lawful in any other church but was it not human authority in particular that we first opposed in the church of rome was it not entirely by human authority that she established the most enormous superstitions the most hellish doctrines and the most execrable impieties that ever disgraced the children of men and was it not only for protesting against human authority that the first reformed were called protestants this cannot be denied they nobly pleaded that we have only one master even christ they solemnly protested against any other master they protested against the claims of any man to prescribe the terms of acceptance or settle the faith of any other man they protested against all persecutions for conscience sake they protested against the power in any man or in any men of determining the sense of the word of god for any other man or men they knew that it was the usurping of this power which had overwhelmed the world with darkness and deluged all europe with the blood of the saints of the earth and they therefore justly considered all who exercised this power as rebels against reason apostates from revelation traitors to god and destroyers of men  we therefore as protestants have espoused the same principles have enlisted in the same liberal generous cause the cause of humanity the cause of truth the cause of jesus and the cause of god but if we build again the things we have destroyed we make ourselves transgressors if we claim the right of exercising that very power which we opposed in our enemies we stand selfcondemned we deserve every measure of reproach and abhorrence and should be covered with shame and confusion at the name by which we are called but if we on the contrary vindicate the glorious principles of liberty of pure impartial liberty of necessary reasonable divine liberty i say of liberty not only to differ from the creed of rome but likewise to reject every other creed but the blessed gospel and to form our sentiments even of this not according to the public voice but according to every particular mans own reason and conscience if such my friends be our principles then may we rejoice and glory in the name of protestants for then this will be only another name for christians for those who are under the sole influence and authority of our one divinelyappointed master even christ  but once more all human authority in matters of faith is likewise diametrically repugnant to our original and to our present avowed principles as protestant dissenters we still continue to vindicate these principles upon the very same foundation that we vindicate our separation from the church of rome and certainly as was hinted before if we object to human authority in the church of rome we must to be consistent with ourselves not to say if we would profess a dutiful subjection to christ object to human authority wherever else it be found  let us examine then a little how the case stands between us we know that when king henry the eighth threw off the popes supremacy he laid claim to and assumed this supremacy himself by denying the pope to be our one master he did no honor to christ because he likewise at the same time denied christ to be our one master and usurping the unalienable authority of christ he declared himself to be our one master he accordingly published certain articles of what he called religion which bear the same stamp of folly and blasphemy with those of other uncommissioned spiritual guides and which whoever denied or disputed against was to suffer death thus this detestable tyrant this monster of pride iniquity and lust made himself the absolute lord of the lives and consciences of his passive subjects  his lofty daughter elizabeth unhappily trod in her fathers steps though a sufferer herself under her bloody sister still she retained so much of the spirit of her father and of that merciful church from which she would be thought to separate as not to be able to learn the lesson of mutual charity and forbearance or to hear of the gospel precept of doing to others as we would that they should do unto us but as if she had been the light of the world or as if god commanded an unlimited submission to her pleasure or as if it was treason against her and against heaven to affect to know more or less than she knew or not to worship exactly as she did let the conviction of any persons mind be what it would to the contrary together with the antichristian act of supremacy she piously procured another act called an act for uniformity of common prayers and service in the church and administration of the sacraments and besides adopting according to her royal taste a multitude of popish rites and ceremonies she likewise chose to have her priests clothed after the popish model she farther erected a court of high commission to enforce universal obedience to her commands and she punished or enlightened all the refractory nonconformists with suspension imprisonment fines confiscation of goods banishment or death these wholesome severities she found had been practiced by preceding princes and were no doubt in her apprehension essential to her monarchical dignity and expressive of the tender concern of an affectionate mother for her untoward and undutiful children  but hence happened that separation from the church which has continued ever since and which while there are any such things as reason and truth among men will ever justify itself to the world indeed all that the queens officers could argue was that the things they imposed were indifferent that it was requisite to order and decency to impose them and that she had therefore a right as supreme ecclesiastical governor to impose them that is she had a right by virtue of an office which could not possibly belong to her to lord it over gods heritage which very right it was death to ascribe to the bishop of rome but our noble ancestors after seriously consulting their own breasts and the word of god declared this right to be a violation of their christian liberty this liberty they well observed allowed not the imposition of those things that were left indifferent in the gospel they also objected their scruples of conscience to the use of the vestments not because they had any turpitude in themselves but because they had been the uniform of pagan and popish priests and might therefore be the means of still supporting pagan and popish superstition they affirmed again that weak christians ought not to be constrained to admit of indifferent things when they think them unlawful and they drew up a declaration in substance to this effect called reason grounded on scripture it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living god for doing that which our own consciences informed by the word of god judge to be evil for we would always keep in remembrance that alarming saying of st john if our conscience condemn us god is greater than our conscience we therefore choose to obey god rather than man and to suffer if it be the will of god for an unshaken attachment to his commandments and to the dictates of our own consciences in opposition to the commandments of men  these were the sentiments of our glorious forefathers these were the arguments on which they formed and vindicated their separation from the establishment and neither of these sentiments nor of these arguments can we yet be ashamed unless we first renounce the principles of reason of liberty of truth and of the gospel unless we are dead to every spark of honor generosity and greatness of mind unless indeed we be ashamed of christ himself it is on the contrary of the opposite principles that we ought to be ashamed of the principles of pride and ambition of slavery and darkness of priestly dominion implicit faith and diabolical antichristian tyranny of these we ought always to be ashamed as of what unman and degrade us to a level with the beasts of the field  but i would once more and particularly observe upon this point that we do not now if we know any thing of our principles or indeed if we have any principles of our own profess to be directed any farther by the sentiments of our forefathers than they were directed by truth we do not profess even by regarding their example to believe any one of their doctrines or to embrace any one of their opinions unless such doctrines and opinions are in perfect harmony with our own reason and the word of god nay we profess to reject as freely any doctrines of our forefathers or any of our own former doctrines as the most obnoxious doctrines of popery if the same doctrines now appear to us antichristian or absurd some christians seem to think that it would reflect the greatest reproach upon them to become wiser than their fathers or wiser even than themselves when children my father thought so i was born and educated so therefore etc but that which really disgraces man is his making no progress in divine knowledge his taking things of the utmost importance upon trust and not endeavoring to improve that knowledge as well as that estate which he inherited from his ancestors and that which does honor to man is not the not changing his sentiments or profession but his being open to conviction and yielding to evidence besides it is an uncomfortable kind of dignity which centers in such a uniformity of conduct as will not allow us to assert our freedom and independency nor to remedy any evils under which we groan in short it is not shameful to have been in error but to continue in error and to refuse to come out of darkness when we are surrounded with light in short we profess as protestant dissenters to have in all our religious concerns only one master even christ or to adopt the rational and spirited declaration of the celebrated chillingworth  the bible the bible is our only religion to this every one of us ought to adhere for by this every one of us shall be judged and not according to the understanding or obedience of any man or body of men but according to our own understanding and obedience what diligence and impartiality we use in learning our duty here belongs not unto men to judge but unto god  upon the whole i may now i think fairly conclude that the most distant attempt to introduce any kind of human authority in matters of faith is a most abominable despotism repugnant to the very nature of religion itself to the genius and groundwork of the christian religion to the dignity of reason to the genuine principles of freedom to the best interests of humanity to the common protestant cause and to our avowed principles as protestant dissenters if therefore we have only one master away with all other masters let none other however famous for wisdom or rendered conspicuous by sounding titles of honor have the dominion over us and what should particularly and most powerfully induce us to regard the exhortation is that the more we examine the several systems that have been espoused by that authority which we oppose the more shall we find them all to have been of a piece with that authority itself whether we take up the popish manual the english thirtynine articles and common prayer the scotch directory the augsbourg confession the articles of lutheranism or the institutions of calvin we shall find in them all some things that are equally irrational impious and antichristian it can therefore be nothing less than downright tyranny and blasphemy which establish any such authority or which continue to support it and it can be nothing less than slavery and darkness which pay any submission to such authority but if there be those after all who still determine to submit to human authority we pretend not to be their judges they are amenable to a future tribunal and according to their actions according to the sincerity and diligence they used in improving the talents committed to their trust they shall find their sentence yet i cannot help observing that until they change their present conduct they should to maintain a consistent character renounce the principles of reason reject the name of protestants and disclaim all the priveleges of christians  let us however as members of a kingdom not of this world resolve to reject all those doctrines of men which tend to make void the doctrines of god let us firmly and deliberately resolve to submit only to our one master even christ but as he was divinely authorized to communicate to us the whole will of god and nothing but the pure will of god let us be persuaded to attend to all his instructions as we regard our own salvation let us whenever we open the sacred volume to be taught of him consider ourselves as under the direction of god himself because he was taught of god and let us whenever his animating discourses are read to us out of this volume hearken with that reverence which is due to the wisdom of god again let us consider that mere knowledge only puffs up let us therefore while we are earnestly endeavoring to treasure up the doctrines of christ endeavor also in our conduct so to make our light shine amongst men that others seeing our good works may be hence led with us to glorify our father who is in heaven  the grand point is this we should set our affections upon the things that are above seeing that we look forward to a future incorruptible inheritance this inheritance should ever be our jewel of great price we should consider in the same view as the passing vapors all the riches and honors and pleasures of this present transient scene we should account nothing honorable which does not respect the will of the supreme lawgiver we should esteem nothing great or good which is not a resemblance of his most glorious perfections we should be endowed therefore with bowels of the most tender mercies to our fellow men we should be strangers to all wrath and malice and envy and evilspeaking and especially to all cruelty oppression and revenge we should love as brethren the whole human race remembering that god is love and that in this was the love of god manifested that he gave us his onlybegotten or his wellbeloved son that whoever believes in him might not perish but have everlasting life  the mention of this life is sufficient to make us show ourselves men with such an object in view we can pronounce nothing very grievous that may befall us here with such an object in view though all the terrors of our spiritual adversaries are at the same time before our eyes we shall be steadfast and immovable and always abounding in the work of the lord we shall not envy the high and mighty we shall not be moved to neglect the least duty by the tide of popular prejudices pomp and show will but little affect us truth will have more charms in it than all the world besides we will blush for those who triumph in their successful ambition we will sit easy under the laughter of fools we will pity the scorner and all the pride reviling and ridicule to which we stand exposed shall not be able to touch us  besides that the world is against us should not greatly affect us or rather should give us no kind of pain or discouragement the world was against our lord but the high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity was his refuge and we in like manner if we follow his steps shall be always secure under the arms of omnipotence the friendship of god will always support and refresh us will give light to our souls in the dark valley of the shadow of death and at last deliver us from every evil and crown us with every good his friendship truly is sufficient to reconcile us to all circumstances  to know likewise that our inevitable allegiance to him brings troubles upon us that we suffer for espousing the everlasting laws of righteousness and truth instead of making us disconsolate must make us always happy for this is the noblest cause in the world to vindicate such a cause places us among the first of human beings to be cast into dungeons for such a cause is a distinguishing honor to finish our course upon the scaffold for such a cause is our greatest glory nay we mention with a high veneration those heroes who fall in battle fighting for their country with a sort of wonder and reverence we rehearse the name of wolf but what are ten thousand such to the great captain of our salvation what are ten thousand such even to any other man who sacrifices his life in the cause of sacred truth the martyrs of religious liberty suffer for our dearest privileges and our best interests for the cause of god and the most important concerns of all mankind and their names are written in heaven and shall be held in everlasting remembrance  errata page xvi of preface line   of note after account put a period page    of discourse
