fish  it is lady mary magpie  let her in  even her ridiculous vanity is more supportable than the reflection on my own   fish lady mary maam opens the door   enter lady mary miss angle good morrow dear lady mary   lady mary nay sit still  and mrs fish do you stay  i have brought something to show your mistress and you may see it too if she will give you leave   miss angle certainly  fish you may stay   lady mary there opening a shawl what do you think of that  a present from mr walmsley  a shawl worth at a moderate valuation no less than a hundred and fifty guineas  he gave it me this minute  it came over but last night from india  has been on the seas seven months  was in that terrible storm of october last  little did i think when i heard of those dreadful wrecks and the many souls that perished that i had a shawl at sea if i had i should have suffered a martyrdom  now is not it pretty  beautiful  he assures me his correspondent writes him word there is but one more such in all india  and i am to wear it the first time on my wedding day   miss angle it is very beautiful indeed   lady mary ant you well my dear  you dont seem to understand it is value  what do you say to it mrs fish   fish oh madam  i like it of all things    lady mary i dare say you do  but come my dear miss angle what is the matter with you since you first came to town you are the most altered creature i ever saw    fish your ladyship does not think my mistress has lost any of her beauty i hope    lady mary as for that mrs fish i dare say your lady has made observation enough to know that beauty is of little weight here  of no signification at all  beauty in london is so cheap and consequently so common to the men of fashion who are prodigiously fond of novelty that they absolutely begin to fall in love with the ugly women by way of change    fish and does your ladyship think old women will ever come into fashion    lady mary they are in fashion  they have been in fashion some time  girls and young women have made themselves so cheap they are quite out    miss angle i believe so  aside   lady mary as soon as the vulgar lay hold of any thing the people of ton leave it off  such is the case with young women  the vulgar have laid hold of them and they are quite out    fish oh dear me    lady mary but come my dear angle pluck up your spirits against you know when  you are to be one of my bridemaids you know  oh how i long to be away from lodgings and in a house of my own  mr walmsley says he shall invite you to stay a day or two with us  he likes you stranger as you are to us both very much i assure you  he is a great admirer of virtue in us females and notwithstanding his little oddities would do any thing for a woman of character and your refusing that vile lords odious addresses which i informed him of has interested him for you exceedingly well heaven bless you  i cannot stay  he will be quite impatient going i may tell him you like the shawl i suppose   miss angle beautiful beyond measure   lady mary and you mrs fish   fish charming maam   lady mary did i tell you there was but one more such in all india coming back   miss angle you did   lady mary only think of it is being in that storm exit   miss angle would i had been in the storm and had fallen it is victim    fish dear madam    miss angle oh fish that womans nonsense at which you laughed was graced with sentiments of the strictest truth  young women are no longer thought of here  how rashly did i give credit to our foolish country people  they told me that though only admired by them in london i should be adored  that beauty here was rare  that virtue    fish well madam and that is rare every body knows   miss angle but is it valued  no  as soon as i gave lord lighthead proofs of my possessing it what was the consequence  i have neither seen nor heard of him since    fish that is very odd  for my part i thought him so much in love  and sometimes i thought you looked a little    miss angle that i felt a warmth  a something like tenderness for him i own but that it was the effect of love i will not pretend to say  it was perhaps the effect of hope  pride too had a great share in the agitation of my heart  and gratitude might have confirmed the whole sensation love  but in the moment gratitude should have been inspired resentment indignation took possession  and i am now left solely to shame and disappointment   fish well  it is very odd that a man should give himself so much trouble to come here after you so many times as he did and then all of a sudden never to come near you for a whole month  i should not mind losing him neither if some duke or other great man would come instead of him or even that strange young man we met on the road as we came to town and that was so kind to us when our chaise broke down   miss angle honest creature   fish well as sure as ever i was in love in my life that young man and his servant were both as deep in love    miss angle with me   fish no the master with you and the man with me  but we i thought were coming to town to make our fortune and so i was above making it on the road  for notwithstanding that young man looked so countrified and had hardly a word to say for himself he is worth thousands  and poor humphry his servant persuaded me to give him our direction that his master and he might come after us to london  and yet to see the fickleness of man we have heard nor seen nothing of them  but dear madam his lordship runs most in my head  perhaps he is sick   miss angle no  he visits the drawingroom constantly as we read in the papers  i wonder what he would say if he was accidentally to meet me    fish he would fall in love with you as much as ever  suppose madam you was to write to him    miss angle for shame   fish dear madam i know a few lines from you would cheer his heart and he would be as dying for you as ever  oh when i have given him a letter from you how he has jumped for joy how he has kissed it and how he has kissed me    miss angle could i write to him with any appearance of prudence  for instance upon any business  i should have no objection it would at least remind him of me and bring matters to a decision   fish then do madam contrive to write to him about some business   miss angle what business can i pretend   fish dear madam if you had a handsome piece of silk for a gown or a diamond pin or something of that kind you might return it him back again    miss angle return it him again what do you mean   fish why madam you might send it him back  as if you had received the present from a person unknown and concluding that it must come from his lordship you had thought proper to return it  and so you might send him with it a fine long virtuous letter that you would not receive a present from a king that had evil designs upon you and so on  and so on  and so on  this i am sure would make him ten times fonder of you than ever  for he would think some rival had been sending you the present in that anonymous manner which had made you think it was him  and i know he would    miss angle i protest there is something in that scheme which pleases me   fish do it madam  do it   miss angle but how can i  i have nothing of value  nothing that i could suppose he would send for a present and which i could think of consequence enough to return   fish what is your watch madam   miss angle an old fashioned thing   fish lord i have thought of something the finest thing    miss angle what    fish lady mary magpies shawl  you known maam it is the finest thing in the world  there is but one more such in all the universe   miss angle but the shawl is not mine   fish no maam  but i dare say i know where her ladyship has laid it and i can get it  going to the door miss angle for shame   fish dear madam do you think i would steal it  it could do it no harm to be a few hours at his lordships  he would send it back directly you may depend upon that  and then such a fine thing  it would make him think that some great man indeed had taken a fancy to you  and he would be so afraid of losing you    miss angle well  i protest  if i thought    fish i can get it maam with all the ease in the world  i dare say runs out   miss angle what will become of me  where will my folly end   enter fish fish yes  yes  maam i can get it  her ladyship has spread it on the bed in the blue chamber and is gone out for the whole evening and will sleep at her cousins lady beachs  her maid told me so in the morning   miss angle but suppose his lordship should not return it   fish laud maam do you think his lordship will keep it when he will know he did not send it you  his lordship is not a thief i suppose  you will have it back maam i will answer for it in an hour or two and himself with it  the person shall not leave it maam if his lordship is not at home and then you will be sure to have it in an hour or two  i will go steal it  i will go steal it going   miss angle steal it    fish take it maam  not steal it exit   miss angle this scheme will at least renew our acquaintance  and that is all i want  for if on the renewal he appears cold i will leave london instantly  if on the contrary he is as much in love as ever    enter fish with the shawl fish i have got it  i have got it  here it is  now madam come into your bed chamber and write a very affecting letter while i do it up and send for a porter   miss angle i protest i am frightened  though we take it but to return again   fish dear madam i am sure it is not in half the danger as when it was in the great storm pulling her off exeunt   scene ii a chamber at lord lightheads enter miss audley and thompson miss audley what  his lordship is gone to see lady loveall thus early i suppose or rather has staid with her thus late   thompson you are just like her ladyship maam for she is ever accusing my lord of being with you  but i assure you maam his lordship slept at home  a loud rap there he is madam exit   miss audley yes  i have heard of her ladyships jealousy  and that she sometimes searches this whole house to find me   reenter thompson thompson dear madam i hear mr walmsleys voice  my lords uncle madam  they are coming here  what shall we do madam my master will murder me if his uncle should see you  a cross old man madam  knocks every body down that he does not like  and he has a great dislike to a fine lady  and if he should see you here such a life my lord will have of it   miss audley oh you need tell me no more  i know mr walmsleys character well  where can i go i would sooner jump out of the window than meet him  a cruel unfeeling  piece of ice   thompson here madam step into my lords bedchamber   miss angle his bedchamber well the creature will not stay long   thompson not above ten minutes i dare say maam she goes into the chamber exit serve   enter mr walmsley and lord lighthead walmsley dont tell me my lord  you are a bad man  a very bad man  you say in excuse for your vices they are fashionable  but i being out of the fashion can call em only wicked   lord lighth what vices sir   walmsley why you are a fellow that falls in love with every face you see and yet admire your own more than any one of them  you are a man whose purse is open to every gambler and courtezan and is never shut but to objects of real distress   lord lighth but how are you informed of this   walmsley hear it  told of it by every body  do you think any thing but conviction would have forced me to the rash step i have taken  would any thing but a certainty that you were unworthy to be my heir have forced me to the desperate resolution of marrying notwithstanding my natural aversion to opposition   lord lighth i hope sir when you marry    walmsley hope pshaw  i know well enough what marriage is  it is a poesy of thorns  nobody knows where to lay hold of it  it is a stormy sea where nothing is to be expected but squalls tempests and shipwrecks  one cries help  another lord have mercy upon us  a third it is all over with us  and souse they all go into the ocean of calamity   lord lighth then for heavens sake sir if this is your opinion decline your intention of marrying   walmsley i cannot  it is too late  my word is passed  your indiscretions put me in a passion and i took a rash step  a step i never intended to take  i offered a lady to marry her in the heat of anger and she took me at my word before i had time to grow cool and recant   lord lighth how unfortunate   walmsley i was not aware she would be so sudden  but i was in such a violent passion  all against you for your follies  i was devilish hot i dont remember that i was ever in such a heat in my life i strutted  and fretted  and walked  and talked  all in anger against you which she took for love to her and so was overcome in less than ten minutes   lord lighth dear sir had i been present    walmsley why then i should have broken every bone in your skin  but as it was  i vented my rage  in kissing the lady and won her heart without farther trouble  it is impossible i could have won her so soon but by my being in that violent rage for she is a particular prudent discreet reserved middleaged woman and nothing but my great violence could have had that effect upon her   lord lighth but sir is it possible that you should pay attention to a rash promise in a moment of anger   walmsley my word  my word is as dear to me as my honor  it is my honor  and i cannot keep one without keeping both   lord lighth but now you are cool sir   walmsley yes i am cool  but now the lady is in a passion  and i must keep my word with her though i am afraid she will never find me warm on the subject again   lord lighth dear sir and all this to revenge yourself on me a man whose greatest faults arise merely from the report of malicious enemies   walmsley enemies  pshaw  that is always your excuse  but have not i enemies as well as you and yet i dare say you never heard of my being caught gallanting my neighbors wife  or walking arminarm with a a milliner or following fine ladies home to their lodgings  nor did you ever hear me accused of destroying a beautiful young womans peace of mind  did you   lord lighth i cannot say i ever did sir   walmsley then dont pretend to deny the reports i have heard of you  dont i know that you were caught with lady loveall and    lord lighth i own sir i have been very unfortunate as to appearances  appearances and those alone have been the ruin of my reputation  accidents so strange that no human wisdom could prevent or avoid them  i have been found for instance with a female whom i never had the smallest familiarity with in the most suspicious situations and only by mere accident    walmsey and pray was that an accident when i caught you kissing my housekeepers daughter as if you would devour her   lord lighth yes upon my word sir that was an accident  entirely an accident  my servant had just lost me a favorite spaniel and had the rascal been in the way i should have broken every bone in his skin but happening to meet with this poor girl i vented my rage on her   walmsley then i have only to say you have lost my estate by your accidents  enter servant serve lady loveall sir is in the parlour   walmsley is that an accident   lord lighth to the serve blundering   aside serve i did not see mr walmsley sir  a fine life i shall have for this aside and exit   walmsley this is another accident  how dares that imprudent woman visit you  my blood runs cold at the thought of her  for she was the cause of this rash step i have taken  it was hearing of your intrigue with her that hurried me to the rash step of marrying  let me get out of the house  she is poison to me and she knows it too and speaks to me wherever i meet her on purpose to insult me  let me get away  goes to the door zounds she is coming here  i will not see her  i shall be in one of my passions if i do  where shall i go  put me somewhere   lord lighth here sir  step into my bedchamber  i will take her ladyship to another room immediately  and you may avoid her   walmsley oh damn your accidents  but thank heaven you are no heir of mine  you are out of my will  he goes into the bedchamber   lord lighth and therefore may now offend you without fear enter thompson   thompson where is mr walmsley sir   lord lighth in my bedchamber  what did you want with him   thompson oh dear sir oh dear  miss susan audley is there sir  i crammed her in when i heard your lordship and mr walmsley on the stairs for fear he should see her    lord lighth zounds  but no matter  i am struck out of his will and may defy him  but i dont hear him  listening he cannot have seen her   thompson perhaps sir she is crept under the bed   lord lighth very likely  for i know she would rather meet a tiger what is become of lady loveall   thompson william is trying to prevent her coming up sir  for she says it is not your uncle that you have with you but a lady and she will see her enter lady loveall   lady loveall so my lord  what is the reason i am not to be admitted  you have no company neither  oh you have been hiding i percieve

oh oh oh   walmsley oh oh oh  deuce take your ohs  my lord you used to have faith in accidents    lord lighth but you convinced me there were no such things  and indeed uncle though you may think lightly of this affair i am very much concerned at it  my reputation as well as yours is at stake  such a thing to happen in my house  rat me if i would have had it happened for the world    walmsley what has happened  nothing has happened to miss audley   lady loveall oh heavens  my lord i ask your pardon for all my former suspicions of you and this lady   miss audley i must cry for vexation  for it is in vain to attempt to clear myself goes up the stage   lady loveall see the lady in tears mr walmsley  oh what a treat to teize him  aside lord lighth i beg that every means may be taken to put a stop to this affair getting abroad  for my part i declare never to breathe the circumstance to a mortal  and i dare say we may so far prevail on lady loveall    lady loveall no indeed  i am bound to no secrecy  mr walmsley has never been sparing of my reputation nor will i of his  the world shall know it   walmsley why then nephew upon my soul  i wish i may die  i wish i may never speak again  i wish    lady loveall wish  you used to pretend you had no wishes   walmsley i dont speak to you  to miss audley pray madam be so good as to tell me how you came into that bed   miss audley it is in vain to say  nobody will credit me exit miss audley   lady loveall well mr walmsley i will bid you good morning  and though i know you to be no friend of mine yet permit a poor weak woman to give you this counsel  that now you are about to enter into the married state you will not suffer these depraved inclinations even in youth a reproach to ruffle that tranquillity which ought ever to attend on the honorable marriage bed exit   walmsley zounds i have not patience  honorable marriage bed why her calling it honorable would alone have made me shudder at it if i had not before  that woman is the worst of all human    lord lighth dear sir    walmsley why you know my lord if it had not been for her you would have owned that  that gipsey was put there to meet you  but this woman is my bane wherever i go  or whatever i do  oh that i could but once be revenged of her  but i dare say i shall   lord lighth no more on this subject sir  i hope the lady you are going to marry may prove of a more amiable disposition  and that you will like her   walmsley why since i found i must have her i have been trying night and day to like her  but i cannot say i make much progress  however i am tolerably civil and give her a vast number of presents as a cover for my want of affection  she is expecting me now to go a shopping with her so good morning  you will come to the wedding sighing   lord lighth certainly  when is the happy day sir   walmsley how dare you call it the happy day  you just heard me say it was the most wretched miserable affair i ever had to do with in all my life and now you are calling t the happy day    lord lighth the day then sir  when is the day   walmsley thursday sighing  the day after tomorrow  the   st of december lord lighthead bows oh damme the shortest day and the longest night exit   enter servant serve sir this parcel was left about half an our ago to be delivered into your lordships own hands as soon as you were at leisure   lord lighth what is it  is that the ill   serve this is a letter sir exit   lord lighth a letter  reads  my lord although your lordship has had the delicacy not to avow yourself the presenter of this valuable gift yet something whispers me it can be none but your lordship to whom i am indebted for so generous an intention  but my lord the intention only  permit me to remain obliged to you for  the gift itself  honor delicacy and a thousand struggling sensations force me to return  and to add that my residence in london has not yet so entirely eradicated those principles imbibed in the country as to render a gaudy bait even an allurement except in its being a proof that your lordship sometimes honors with a thought the humble but contented louisa angle   lord lighth angle angle  which is that the girl at st jamess or the girl at westminster  oh the girl at st jamess  i dont remember sending her a present  but i suppose i did while i was mad for her  and now i have recovered my senses i have forgot it  what is it opens the parcel zounds but it is very handsome and the very thing to present to lady loveall  it will reconcile her to me immediately  for i am afraid she suspects me notwithstanding her behavior before my uncle  how came i to be such an extravagant puppy as to send that little gipsey such a present and she to return it now she finds i have given over my pursuit  faith i am very glad she did  richard  enter servant bring me pen ink and paper exit servant i certainly ordered some of my people to send this thing but it has slipped my memory  the servant brings in the pen and ink  his lordship writes and gives him the letter   lord lighth here  do up that parcel and take it with this letter to lady loveall directly   serve yes sir exit   lord lighth egad it came back at a very lucky time  her ladyship doats upon a present and such a present as that  such a shawl  oh yes  the shawl will make her friends with me at once exit   scene iv an inn clownly discovered clownly what a journey have i and poor humphry taken and all perhaps for nothing for if he should even find her she may not be glad to see me  enter humphry why humphry i thought you were lost   humph ay master and you may think yourself well off i was not   clownly well  but have you found where miss angle lives   humph yes  i have found her out  but such a time i was about it  why sir she lives up by st jamess or st giless i forget which  but it is all the same  and such a thing happened to me as i went along    clownly what   humph why just as i got to what they call the p hes a pretty place  just as i got under cover three or four or five or six or egad there might be a dozen fine ladies met me and one of them did give me such a slap in the face the water came into my eyes again    clownly what did she do that for   humph i cannot tell for the life of me  for i pulled off my hat and made them a civil bow  but faith as soon as i felt the blow i forgot my manners for after madam i ran and gave her such a shake    clownly you did not   humph but i did  and that was not the worst of it neither  i made a sad mistake  for when i came to look the lady had got a blue gown on and she that gave me the blow was in red   clownly how could you make such a blunder   humph why though their gowns were different their faces were exactly the same color   clownly but about miss angle  have you seen her or her maid   humph yes  i have seen mrs fish and she says that her lady has done nothing but talk of you ever since you left her on the road  and she desires you will go and see her lady directly  and she says too that she will get us a lodging in the same house before night but that is to be kept a secret from her mistress   clownly i am very much obliged to mrs fish for her contrivance and i shall give her a very handsome present to satisfy her   humph lord sir there is no occasion for that  i shall kiss her now and then and i dare say that will be quite satisfaction enough but come sir we must go directly   clownly do you know humphry that my heart misgives me   humph what now you are so near seeing the lady come come master be merry   clownly ah humphry if i had continued poor  if i had never been your master i might have been merry   humph never been my master  how can you talk so why there are people in the world would give any money to be my master  why now there is my wife  she would give every farthing she has to be my master but i tell her no  no jane says i you shall never be my master   clownly oh if i thought i should get miss angle    humph i will forfeit my head if you dont  have you not every thing to get her with  fine clothes in your box there and plenty of money  i never heard of a woman that could not be got with fine clothes and plenty of money nay often without either money or clothes   clownly but i tell you that will not do with her  there is something more required  i cannot talk to her  i am at a loss for words    humph you cannot be at a loss for words while you are courting  women will always give you two for your one  i know my wife did  and egad though we have left off courting so she does now   clownly come  i will set off  call a coach exit   humph ay sir and i will ride behind it for fear i should get struck again  it is very odd that any lady should wish to strike me  exeunt end of the first act act ii miss angles apartments enter miss angle and fish fish dear madam let me persuade you to put on your other gown for now his lordship has kept it thus long i dare say he will bring it home himself   miss angle i begin to be uneasy  did the porter say he was sure his lordship was at home   fish quite sure maam  so we may expect him every minute for he would certainly have sent it back before now if he had not intended to have brought it himself  do madam change that ugly gown  and what do you think of your other cap  your becoming cap  hark  no  that is only a single rap  the deuce take him he has sent it home by a porter perhaps   miss angle i dont care how so i get it again  for i begin to be alarmed lest by some accident  fish looks out of the window   miss angle is it that   fish no maam it is the milkwoman  perhaps maam his lordship may not call with it till the morning   miss angle well thank heaven her ladyship sleeps from home you say so she cannot miss it tonight and then if we have heard nothing from him you shall go after it fish  for as soon as her ladyship comes home in the morning    fish and the worst of it is  i am not sure she is to stay out all night    miss angle you told me she was   fish i did it for your good  i knew you would not have sent it to his lordship if i had not said so   miss angle ridiculous  and i still worse to listen to you   fish dear maam dont fret about it  but think of mr clownly  i am sure he looks very beautiful and so does his man humphry and pray maam did not you see by his masters looks that he is in love with you   miss angle pshaw    fish nay madam you need not sneer at him for if his lordship should never send back the shawl    miss angle heavens   fish we shall stand in need of a rich friend to make it up with lady mary a loud rap there is his lordship  that is his rap  i know it so well i could swear to it at any time  now madam how do you look  vastly well i declare  lord how well i know his rap  goes to the door i wish i may die if it is not lady mary    miss angle oh i shall faint   fish the first thing she does will be to look at her shawl   miss angle run fly  take a coach and sly to lord lightheads with my compliments  i made a mistake  he did not send it  but another person  who now has claimed it  and i must return it immediately   fish well maam  i will do all i can   enter lady mary lady mary oh mrs fish  where

had one loss already in losing me and i dont think it is right she should have another  besides i have now a value for the thing  who would have thought that little shawl would have turned out of such consequence providence preserved it from the storm at sea to save me from a worse storm on land exit   lady mary i will be as gentle as zephyrs  plead for me speak for me dear miss angle   miss angle i will madam  it is my duty  depend upon it i will reconcile you   enter betty betty dear my lady as mr walmsley went out he bid me observe if i should see the country gentleman or his man who were

 enter walmsley walmsley i have done the job  the thief is taken  and who do you think it is  the very person in the world  by jupiter i would not have lost the pleasure of taking her up for fifty times the value of the thing  i caught her just as she was going into covent garden theater with the goods upon her  so with the help of one of the playhouse constables i handed her in spite of her squalling into a coach and have brought her here that she may be properly exposed   lady mary and miss angle what can this mean   walmsley speaking loud desire the constable to bring up the woman in custody  sir to clownly whoever you are i beg your pardon  you are not a thief that i know of  if you are that is best known to yourself  i am a little busy sir at present  you will excuse me  constable bring up the prisoner  why dont you come  surely there never was such an accident   enter constable with lady loveall walmsley there  you see the goods are upon her   lady loveall insupportable  have not i affirmed that it was presented to me by lord lighthead   miss angle i am tortured aside   lady loveall it is not to be borne  sir you know it is mine  this is only a scheme on purpose to distress me in revenge for what i discovered this morning   walmsley ay you were vastly pleased at that  and now it is only evening and i have discovered something that pleases me   lady loveall very well  go on  but i have sent my servant to lord lighthead to inform him of this affair and i am certain the moment he has found him his lordship will come and clear me   walmsley there wants no clearing  every thing is clear enough   enter lord lighthead lord lighth dear uncle  dear lady loveall what is the matter  just as i was stepping into my coach a summons came to me to attend you upon life and death  what is the matter   walmsley no  no death in the case  i believe nothing more than hard labor on the thames   lord lighth sir although you are my uncle this insult to a lady with whom i have the honor to be acquainted is not to be suffered  i presented the lady with that shawl  it was sent to me by this lady pointing to miss angle and a few hours after she sent it her servant received five guineas for it   miss angle it is true  i confess it  guilt and shame overpower me   walmsley to miss angle why the devil did you confess nobody would have seen it in your face  besides you have robbed me of the pleasure of conducting her ladyship to a prison and damn me if i ever met with so great a disappointment   miss angle conduct me sir  i am ready to attend you   lady mary she has destroyed my peace  and i shall see her go to prison without a sigh   clownly but i would not without losing my life  madam i will satisfy you for whatever loss you may have sustained by this lady   lady mary you cannot satisfy me  i have lost mr walmsley   walmsley ay now ask her what she demands for me   lady mary i shall take nothing less than the gentleman himself   walmsley well  i like her for that  she does not undervalue me   miss angle mr clownly while you imagine you are giving your protection to a thief only  you are protecting a more despicable character  had poverty seduced me to the crime of which i am accused less would have been my remorse less ought to have been the censure incurred  but vanity  folly  a mistaken confidence in that gentlemans honor and my own attractions prompted me to avail myself of a contemptible scheme in order to regain his acquaintance which admitting what he professed to me real he himself would have rejoiced at  but the event has proved and discovered both our hearts  nor can i reproach him with the cruelty of his while i experience the most poignant reproofs of an inward monitor for the guilty folly of my own   lady loveall and so this was only a scheme for the lady to procure a husband  here lady mary is your beloved shawl  take it and take care    walmsley yes do you take care of that and i will take care of myself  yet i dont know perhaps i may have her but if i may judge by appearance    lord ligth on that witness who in company has not throughout the adventures of this day appeared culpable   walmsley very true  even i myself at one time made no very innocent figure  these adventures shall then be a warning to us never to judge with severity while the parties have only appearances against them   finis
