an elegy wrote in a country church yard  london printed for r dodsley in pall mall and sold by m cooper in paternoster row      price sixpence  advertisement the following poem came into my hands by accident if the general approbation with which this little piece has been spread may be called by so slight a term as accident it is this approbation which makes it unnecessary for me to make any apology but to the author as he cannot but feel some satisfaction in having pleased so many readers already i flatter myself he will forgive my communicating that pleasure to many more  the editor  an elegy etc the curfeu tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd winds slowly over the lea the plowman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivymantled tower the mopeing owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her sacred bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incensebreathing morn the swallow twittring from the strawbuilt shed the cocks shrill clarion or the ecchoing horn no more shall wake them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy houswife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share often did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow often the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they they drive their team afield how bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth ever gave awaits alike the inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave forgive ye proud the involuntary fault if memory to these no trophies raise where through the longdrawn isle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honors voice provoke the silent dust or flattery sooth the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the reins of empire might have swayed or waked to extacy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some village hampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muses flame far from the madding crowds ignoble strife their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by the unlettered muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to dye for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being ever resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires even from the tomb the voice of nature cries awake and faithful to her wonted fires for thee who mindful of the unhonourd dead do in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some hidden spirit shall inquire thy fate happily some hoaryheaded swain may say oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by hard by yon wood now frowning as in scorn muttring his wayward fancies he would rove now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or crossed in hopeless love one morn i missed him on the customd hill along the heath and near his favorite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he the next with dirges due in sad array slow through the church way path we saw him born approach and read for thou can read the lay gravd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn the epitaph here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melancholy marked him for her own large was his bounty and his soul sincere heaven did a recompense as largely send he gave to misery all he had a tear he gained from heaven it was all he wished a friend no farther seek his merits to disclose or draw his frailties from their dread abode there they alike in trembling hope repose the bosom of his father and his god finis
