the old whig  numb i  the old whig  numb i  on the state of the peerage  with remarks upon the plebeian   quod optanti divum promittere nemo auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro virg london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane and a dodd at the peacock without temple bar mdccxix price   d  the old whig on the state of the peerage with remarks upon the plebeian i find that men who have turned their thoughts to what is now the great subject not only of our parliamentary debates but of our private conversation are apt to complain it is a matter of such a perplexed nature and admits of so many arguments on either side that they are rather bewildered than instructed by what they have heard in discourse or seen in print upon this occasion but as i think this perplexity does not arise in mens minds from the nature of the thing it self so much as from the way of handling it i shall endeavor to draw out the whole state of this affair with such brevity and method as may neither tire nor puzzle the reader but carry his thoughts through a series of observations and arguments that will regularly grow out of one another and set this matter in its full light    those who are thought the best writers upon government both ancients and moderns have unanimously agreed in opinion that the most perfect and reasonable form is a mixed government in opposition to that of any single person or any single order of men for whether the supreme that is the legislative power be lodged entirely in a prince or in an aristocracy or in a democracy it is still looked upon as tyrannical and not properly calculated for the happiness of the whole community    it is also established as a maxim among political writers that the division of the supreme or legislative power is most perfect when it is distributed into three branches if it all centers in one man or in a body of men of the same quality it is that form of government which is called tyrannical if it be thrown into two branches it wants a casting power and is under such a divided authority as would often draw two different ways and produce some time or other such a discord as would expose the weaker to that which had most strength in it and by degrees end in a single authority if it consist of four branches it wants likewise a casting power and is liable to the same inconveniences as when it is composed of two and if it be divided into five or more parts it necessarily runs into confusion and will not long retain either the form or the name of government for this reason three branches in a legislature have been always fixed upon as the proper number because it affords a casting power and may moderate any heats in any two contending branches and overpower the third in case it should prove unreasonable or refuse to come into measures apparently necessary for the good and preservation of the community    the most natural and equitable division of these three branches of the legislature is the regal the noble and the plebeian because the whole community is cast under these several heads and has not in it a single member who is without his representative in the legislature of such a consitution    in the next place it is necessary that these three branches should be entirely separate and distinct from each other so that no one of them may lie too much under the influence and control of either of the collateral branches for if one part of the legislature may any ways be invested with a power to force either of the other two to concur with it the legislative power is in reality whatever it may pretend to divided into no more than two branches    it is the usual boast of englishmen that our government is fixed upon this triple basis which has been allowed even in speculation and that by persons who could have no eye to our constitution a form the most accommodated to the happiness of a community and the most likely to stand secure in its own strength but if upon examination one branch of its legislature is liable on any occasion to be entirely mastered and controlled by one of the other it is certain that nothing can be more desirable than such an improvement in our constitution as may remove out of it this visible imperfection if a king has power when he pleases to add what number he shall think fit to a body of nobles who have a vote in the legislature it is plain he may secure his point in that branch of the legislature and by that means command two votes out of three this has made many assert and i wish i could hear a satisfactory answer to it that there are not properly more than two branches in our legislature notwithstanding we flatter our selves that they are three    in this case a precarious power of nobles so far subject to the regal power in their legislative capacity might sometimes be more pernicious to the public than if the power of both the branches were confessedly united in the sovereign because we might well suppose a bad king would scarce venture upon some things were the whole odium of them to turn upon himself whereas a body of peerage should they only be created in an emergency to carry any unjustifiable design would serve to divert or silence the murmurs of the public    it is a known saying of a late british king that if his friends could gain him a house of commons he would throw his troop of guards into the house of lords rather than miscarry in his measures and whether it is impossible for a court to gain a house of commons of what complexion they please and what would be the consequences at some time or other of their success in such an attempt whilst the crown is possessed of a certain means by virtue of its prerogative of filling the house of lords with its own creatures are points too evident in themselves to be insisted upon    the foregoing reflections are like first principles that have scarce been ever called into dispute and have not only been the avowed maxims of those who have been distinguished by the names of whigs but have furnished matter of complaint to every party in its turn this power of the prerogative has always occasioned murmurs when either side has found it exerted to their prejudice we have often wished for a redress of it and have now an opportunity of coming at it which if we do not lay hold of is not likely to offer it self again so long as we are a people    it is proposed to prevent those many inconveniences which may arise from an arbitrary creation of peers in what proportion and at what time the sovereign shall please to restrain the peers to a certain number it is evident that such a law would remedy those many evils that may proceed from such sudden and numerous additions which have been made to the house of lords in the most critical conjunctures but i find there are objections made to this expedient from the consequences it would have upon the crown   0 it is represented that it will be the cutting off a branch from the prerogative but if this be only the cutting off a branch which is pernicious to the public it is certainly a very good argument for doing it when we can and that this power is of such a nature can scarce admit of a dispute besides that the crown far from being lessened by it will receive a greater luster by parting with a prerogative that has so often given offense and may some time turn to the destruction of the subject     the crown as a branch of the legislature cannot desire a greater prerogative than that of a negative in the passing of a law and as it ought not to influence either house in their debates what can a good king desire more than the power of approving or rejecting any such bill as cannot pass into a law without the royal assent     the crown will have still all the power in it of doing good to the people in which the prerogative of our british kings will be still unlimited in short it neither touches the executive nor the legislative power of the crown nor takes away the prerogative of creating peers but only of doing it in such a manner as seems repugnant to reason and justice the british king will still be the source of nobility and hold in himself the principle of peerage though it is not to be lavished away on multitudes or given occasionally to the detriment of the public     besides what does the crown do more in parting with a branch of its prerogative than what the two other parts of the legislature have frequently done with regard to their respective bodies when they have found any of their rights or privileges prejudicial to the community all such selfdenying acts are of a popular nature and have been passed with the goodliking and applause of their fellow subjects nay the crown has never more recommended it self to the affection of the people than when it has retrenched it self in any exorbitance of power that did not seem consistent with their liberty as in passing the bill of habeas corpus and that for establishing triennial parliaments     indeed were this a point extorted from the crown in its necessities it might be generous at such a juncture to appear in the defense of the prerogative but this is not our case we are only disputing whether we shall accept of a voluntary concession made by the sovereign himself who out of his unparalled goodness has shown by this instance that he places the true dignity of a british monarch where it always ought to be placed in the liberty of his people     having considered this alteration proposed to be made in our constitution with relation to the crown let us now consider it with regard first to the house of commons and in the next place to the whole body of the english commonalty and if we find that it will prove advantageous in its consequences under both these views it is undoubtedly an alteration very much to be wished for     the number of peers is in a few reigns increased from    to near   0 and there is no question but that in as few succeeding reigns their present number will be doubled nor will posterity be able to see an end of them unless it be timely prevented nay we have all the reason in the world to apprehend that their number will hereafter swell in greater proportions than it has done hitherto it is a general remark that since the act has passed for triennial elections commoners of great estates are more desirous than ever of gaining a place in the upper house which will exempt them from such a constant dependence on their electors and the frequent returns of trouble and expense in their elections at least it is natural to suppose that every king will make such additions as will give his friends a majority nay if we may conclude from experience every minister who differs in his politics from his predecessor will bring to his assistance a sufficient number to turn the balance in his favor and it is obvious to every one how quick is the succession of ministers in this country     the first good consequence therefore of the proposed alteration to the house of commons will be this that it will fill that house with men of the largest fortunes and the greatest abilities for we may well suppose that such men will set themselves forward to be elected into such a seat when it is the highest honor they can have immediately in their view by this means those will be the representatives of the people who have the greatest stake among them those will have the giving of money in their power who have the most of it in their possession but above all the influence of the house of commons and consequently of all the commons of england will preserve its self in its due strength for of all maxims none is more uncontested than that power follows property but what additional strength would this give the house of lords if the richest members of the house of commons may be draughted out of it in such numbers as the present frame of our constitution permits nor would the inconvenience be less with respect to men of great parliamentary abilities if instead of continuing to add weight and authority to the lower house they may be called up at any time to employ the same abilities in aggrandizing the figure of another house     and as the proposed alteration will be a proper means to give a figure to the house of commons so will it likewise be an expedient to preserve their integrity as it will take off one method and indeed the most effectual method of bribing men of overgrown fortunes when a peerage dangles before the eyes of the most wealthy commoner it may have charms in it to one who would have a contempt for any offers of another kind a mans ambition is as susceptible of bribes as his avarice and it should be the care of a legislature to cut off all temptations to corruption in the one as well as the other it is true the alteration proposed would not utterly remove the influence of such a motive but it would certainly very much weaken it and render it infinitely more ineffectual than what it is at present     if this method restrains men of the greatest figure of the lower house from making their way so easily to the upper it will evidently tend to the bringing a greater number of places of the highest trust honor or profit into the hands of the most able and wealthy commoners men so accomplished will have a diffusive influence both in their own house and in their respective countries and it will be necessary for all governments to find out proper rewards and gratifications for such men and gratifications of this kind no commoner will envy them since they enable them to be beneficial to the body of people whom they represent and do not in their nature deprive us of their strength and assistance in that branch of the legislature to which we belong   0 however the proposed restraint on the number of peers is far from being an exclusion of such commoners who are recommended by their fortunes or their abilities according to the calculation generally received there may happen two extinctions or vacancies taking one year with another in the body of peers as fixed and ascertained by the new scheme in case it should obtain and surely the commons of england will think it sufficient to lose annually two of their most considerable members whatever may be the opinion of particular persons who are in haste to leave their company     a restraint upon the number of the lords will necessarily restrain the influence of that body in the election of members to serve in the lower house it is very well known that few members of the house of commons are advanced to peerage who have not one or more corporations under their direction nay that very often this is one reason for their promotion if therefore this perpetually increasing body of lords continues on the foot it is now in proportion as their number is augmented their influence in elections will grow more general till at length as the upper house are the creature of the crown the lower house may be in a great measure the creature of the lords and it is worth while to consider whether in process of time unless seasonably prevented the house of commons may not be filled with the stewards and bailiffs of our peers     in the next place let us see what would be the consequences from such an alteration upon the whole bulk of the english commonalty which should always find the first place in the thoughts of their representatives if they should gain only this single advantage i think it is a very considerable one that it will hinder the nation from being overrun with lords we know that in the sale of an estate it is no small recommendation to the buyer that there is no lord within so many miles of it and the distance of such a borderer is often looked upon as an equivalent to a years purchase but who can be secure from such a neighbor whilst the species is so apt to increase and multiply i shall not insist upon paying of debts which is looked upon as a moral duty among commoners who cannot but be sorry to see any additions to an order of men that are sheltered by privileges from the demands of their honest and industrious creditors to which many considerations of the like nature might be added were they not obvious to the private reflection of every reader     but the great point and which ought to carry the chief weight with us in this case is that the alteration now proposed will give such a mighty power to the bulk of the english commons as can be never counterballancd by the body of the nobility should we suppose     peers possessed one with another of  000 l per annum this would amount to no more than     000 l per annum and what is such a property and the power arising out of it compared with the power arising out of the property of those many millions possessed by the commons besides that the great accessions of wealth yearly made in the body of the commons would give it continually an increase of property and power which would accrue to the body of the nobles in case their door was always open to men of overflowing fortunes who might find no great difficulty in procuring an entrance     i shall now offer two fair questions to any man who impartially weighs these matters  first if two schemes of government were proposed to him in both of which the legislature should consist of three branches whether he would prefer that scheme in which one of the branches might be increased at pleasure by another of them or that scheme in which every branch should be limited to a certain stated number nay if the two schemes were placed in parallel with one another and considered in their respective consequences whether the first would not appear a most wild and indigested project  in the second place i would propose this question if the lords had been limited to a certain number by our constitution whether it would not have been thought unpardonable in any one who should have proposed to have taken off that limitation and left it to the pleasure of the crown arbitrarily to add to them any number at any time  no body can be at a loss to determine himself in these questions who considers this subject by those plain lights which are already exhibited in this discourse and which may be strengthened by many other considerations     this subject naturally engages me in one task more which is to examine the objections that have been started against this alteration proposed to be made in the constitution of the house of peers and here i cannot discover any inconvenience which can be said to follow from such an alteration that does not now subsist or is not answered by some much greater inconvenience in the present state of the peerage but that i may not follow the example of those who have appeared in print on the other side of this debate in putting weak arguments into the mouth of their antagonists i shall answer such objections as have been the most approved by those who declare themselves against this bill as they are laid together in a pamphlet entitled the plebeian     as for the introduction the digression upon the ephori and the concluding paragraph they are only arguments ad conflandam invidiam and such as are not to be answered by reason but by the same angry strain in which they are written and which would discredit a cause that is able to support it self without such an assistance     at first sight says the plebeian this proposal must appear very shocking p   it carries with it too great an alteration of the constitution this is the first general objection and i wish it had been pursued regularly but because it is dropped and resumed in the following part of the discourse i must be forced to collect those scattered passages on this head as i find them in different parts of the book this great objection will be sufficiently answered if this alteration of the constitution is from worse to better which i think has been fully proved as every thing is formed into perfection by degrees the wisdom of all legislatures has embraced every opportunity of making such changes in their government as have been advantageous to those who live under it this author himself gives us an eminent instance of a great alteration of our constitution in the lower house under the reign of queen elizabeth p   when the crown erected several new corporations and relieved several ancient and decayed ones from sending any members at all i do not make use of this increase in the number of the commons as an argument for an increase of the number of the lords which the author produces as the reasoning of some people who are for the bill such people if any there are must talk inconsistently with themselves since it is the purport of the bill to prevent the house of lords from growing too numerous but it is an unanswerable argument to show that there has been as great an alteration in one branch of our legislature as is now proposed to be made in another and that such an alteration should be introduced into our form of government when there are good reasons for it on which account our author himself justifies the abovementioned alteration in the house of commons our author furnishes us with another very good argument in this particular against himself p   whiggism says he if i understand it aright is a desire of liberty and a spirit of opposition to all exorbitant power in any part of the constitution formerly the danger on this account was from the crown but since the habeas corpus act and the many restraints laid upon the crown in king william s time and the great and numerous limitations of the succession acts the prerogative of the crown is reduced so low that it is not at all dangerous to the commons as we have the authors confession in the aforementioned instance of an alteration in the plebeian he has here given us an account of as remarkable changes in the regal branch of our government the prerogative was retrenched in those several instances because without such retrenchment the power of it appeared exorbitant and dangerous to the commons if therefore there still inheres in the crown a power that is exorbitant and dangerous to the commons there is the same reason why the commons should lay hold of the present opportunity to retrench it this is the matter in debate betwixt us but be that as it will the argument which the author here makes use of against the bill in question that it carries in it too great an alteration of the constitution would have been as good an argument against the habeas corpus act or any other of those abovementioned what is further said upon this subject in p    would make a handsome sentence in a popular speech but will never stand the test of a strict examination in a discourse addressed to the reasons and not the passions of men in short it has been for our ancient constitution says the author that we have struggled with so much vigor for many years together it is for that we have poured out a river of english blood and a treasure unheard of in any former age this constitution may have its imperfections but faulty as it is our ancestors have conveyed down liberty to us through that channel and we ought to continue it on as well as we can to our posterity and not give way to the newmodelling schemes of every extraordinary genius this is not arguing but declaiming our ancestors remedied several imperfections from time to time and we are obliged to them for having conveyed liberty down to us through the channel which they had so often altered and reformed and will not our posterity be as thankful to us if we transmit to them their liberty through the same channel when it shall be only altered for the better conveyance of it     having taken off the force of this main objection i shall follow others as the author leads me he tells us that p   the shutting up the door of the house of lords in the manner talked of cannot but prove a great discouragement to virtuous actions to learning and industry and very detrimental to the house of peers it self by preventing such frequent supplies from going into it as the nature of such a body requires for want of which it may in time become corrupt and offensive like a stagnated pool which hitherto has been preserved wholesome and pure by the fresh streams that pass continually into it this consideration if it has any force cuts down all the other arguments drawn from the new accessions of figure and power which he supposes would accrue to the house of lords by the passing of the bill so much talked of can it be detrimental to the house of lords and at the same time throw into their hands all the places and honors that the crown can conser upon them will that body of men which would become mean and despicable and offensive as a stagnated pool by the means of this alteration be raised by the same means to be the most formidable and the most honored part in our constitution or could the same body degenerate into a public nuisance as our author represents it and at the same time be able to overawe both king and people can two fuch contrary effects be produced from one and the same cause but could we suppose that this body of men might thus degenerate would they be able without numerous recruits of wealth learning and industry to oppose any thing for the good of the community in contradiction to the king and people but more of this hereafter     our author adds i am not unaware it will be said that the frequent extinctions of noble families will salve this inconvenience and make room for the rewarding of merit but says he this expedient i fear is not much to be depended on for the uncertainty of the time when the crown will have any such power will make it much the same as if it were never to have it at all which is as much as to say that unless the crown has power of making what number of lords it pleases and at what time it pleases and to serve what turn it pleases it had as good have no power at all of making peers which the author supposes is the only adequate power it has of rewarding merit not to ask the author whether it be generally virtuous actions learning or industry that recommend commoners to the peerage or of what other kind the merit is which has been often thus rewarded i shall only ask him whether any man has so crying a merit as immediately requires a peerage for its reward or whether the extinction of two titles in a year will not leave room enough for the crown to reward those extraordinary persons whose merits give them such a demand upon it as for another argument which the author puts into the mouth of those whom he calls patrons of the bill proposed p   that it will ease the crown of importunities as i think it has no great weight in it i am not concerned to urge any thing in its defense against the plebeians answer to it   0 we come now to the most considerable paragraph of the whole book which i shall therefore transcribe at length p   and   but another consequence of a much higher nature attending the limitation of the number of peers is the danger there will be of changing the constitution by this means into an aristocracy and this may at any time in such case be effected by the confederacy of two or three great families which would form such a body in the house of lords as the crown would not be able to control that this kind of government is one of the worst sorts of knavery is too well known to be disputed in a democracy a great many different persons may come to have a share of power by several incidents but in the other case it is birth only that intitles to superiority and the milk such nobles are nursed up with is hatred and contempt for every human creature but those of their own imaginary dignity the question to be stated here is whether the house of lords under their present constitution is not as likely to run into an aristocracy as it would be in case their number should be limited it appears very plain to me that a body of peers perpetually increasing and capable of additions has in it a natural tendency to an aristocracy supposing that the house of lords from  0 members is now swelled to  00 these if increased by the same proportion would in the same number of years amount to     to which we may presume there would be still the like proportionable additions by this means they would in time receive such vast accessions of property as might encourage them not only to entertain so ambitious a design but in a great measure to render it effectual especially when any men could be admitted into their own order with their great abilities in parliament or their great influence among the people who might be most capable of opposing their encroachments upon the commons i do allow that such additions would be prejudicial to the crown but this is no reason why they would not be made as it has not prevented the additions that have been made in our own memory for though the crown in general would be a sufferer by this method yet it would naturally have recourse to it as it has formerly when it labors under any present exigency that can only be removed by such an expedient this danger of an aristocracy every one must confess would be very much abated and i think utterly removed by the limitation of the lords to such a number as is now proposed in such a case their property would be so very inconsiderable when compared with that of the commons as i have before showed to a demonstration that it would render such a design in them the most chimerical and the most impracticable and since it is impossible that the whole body of lords in their united strength could be able to establish themselves into an aristocracy the authors imagination vanishes that p   this may at any time in such a case be effected by the confederacy of two or three great families which would form such a body among the lords as the crown would not be able to control if the author means in this place by the crown not being able to control the lords that it would be restrained from pouring in such a number as would always sway them to its inclinations it is what ought to be wished for if he means that this want of power in the crown would enable them to erect an aristocracy it is certainly a wrong consequence because not only the crown but the people would have a superior power in them to the body of nobles and are equally concerned to preserve their stations in the government the author after this brings an argument to prove that an aristocracy is a bad form of government and that a democracy is preferable to it in which i entirely agree with him but must add that a mixed government made out of aristocracy democracy and monarchy is better than either of them the author subjoins that p   the milk which nobles are nursed up with is hatred and contempt of every humane creature but those of their own imaginary dignity if so the fewer of them the better what commoner would not desire to put a stop to the increase of them     the next objection i meet with is from the great privileges the lords are already possessed of with relation to p   actions de scandalis magnatum etc which is likewise a very good reason why we should hinder the increase of persons invested with these privileges and as for the judicial power with that of imprisoning they are such as subsist in their body as it is now constituted and therefore cannot be objected to the proposed alteration which would only leave them as they are     p   the increasing the number of peers says the author is always to be wished for by the commons we have seen sufficient reasons why it should not because the greater their number the less considerable they become the contrary of which has been evidently proved and the less within the influence of court favors what when by this very power of increasing them at will it can secure any point among them that it pleases by which means alone ministers are kept in awe and remain in a situation of being called to account for their actions were it otherwise they would be out of the reach of any accusation they would know exactly by whom they were to be tried and their judges might be their accomplices and should this once come to be the case what might they not attempt with impunity is this inconvenience better prevented in a house of peers on the bottom it now stands can any who has been a good minister be secure if the crown should add a sufficient number of his enemies to those who sit in judgment upon him or is a bad minister in any danger when he may be sheltered by the addition of a sufficient number of his friends     i must not pass over another remarkable paragraph of the author upon the same argument for increasing the lords at pleasure p   the great advantage says he that the number of their body cannot be increased is at present the most valuable privilege of the house of commons and the only thing that makes them considerable this is indeed a very poor advantage to found upon it the grandeur of a house of commons is not the power of giving money and raising taxes confined to that body and which can never fail to give them the greatest weight in the legislature will not this be always the most valuable privilege of the commons and what other privilege can make them more considerable he goes on the lords are possessed of many great privileges that they will not permit the commons to share with them and therefore the commons would be highly wanting to themselves if they should add this advantage likewise to the lords which is the only one that they can enjoy distinct from them our author as it may turn to his account sometimes considers the lords in their personal privileges as they are individuals and sometimes as they are a body of men in the legislature if he here means their privileges in the former view i do allow they are very great ones and therefore certainly every commoner cannot desire an increase of such individuals but if he here means their privileges as a legislative body it is certain that all their privileges together are not equal to that one of commanding the purse of the community so that it is wonderful how he could advance that the number of the house of commons not being subject to an increase is the only advantage that they enjoy distinct from the house of lords     our author next proceeds to speak of the proportion of property between the two houses of lords and commons which is a point already so fully discussed that i shall not trouble the reader with any repetitions but cannot omit what the author asserts as an indisputable point and which in it self is the greatest paradox i ever heard advanced his words are p  0 indeed if a restraining bill should pass i do not doubt but it would be soon followed with a bill to prevent lords from alienating their estates for which many plausible reasons are to be produced and then without all dispute the balance of property will be soon turned on the side of their lordships which is as much as to say in plain english that the lords will have as much wealth amongst em as the whole body of the british commons or that one million will be a balance against a hundred millions indeed the house of lords in their present constitution may be always approaching to a balance in property with the commons from whence they are continually receiving into their body such large supplies but if their number be once limited you cut off their recruits and lay them under an impossibility of ever rivalling the other branch of the legislature in this particular     our authors argument that a new power would arise to the house of lords from the alteration so much talked of is founded upon a fact which every one denies at first sight his words are these p  0    for as to what is commonly said that the lords would get nothing no new power would be added to them by this means i beg leave to state this matter in a proper light suppose the balance to be now even betwixt the lords and the crown as it certainly is or else the constitution would not subsist in quiet is it not plain to the most common capacity that when two scales are upon an equal poise if you take any weight out of one of them you give the advantage to the other without putting any thing into it the author here supposes that the balance between these two parts of the legislature should be even and so far i concur with him that being the chief end which this alteration has in view but i can by no means suppose with him that they are even because it is contrary to matter of fact for we plainly see that the sovereign has it always in his power to make what division of party or opinion he pleases prevail in that house as for the reason of their present supposed equality that otherwise they could not subsist in quiet it has no force in it because we see very illconstituted governments will subsist in quiet for many ages not that they are preserved by a rightly tempered constitution which would give them the greatest strength but by other accidental causes the ill consequences of such an inequality may be frequently felt and complained of though they may not shake the tranquillity of the public     i have now gone through every thing that carries the face of an argument for the constitution of the house of lords as it now stands or of an objection against the alteration proposed to be made having only avoided saying any thing in this case as it affects the scottish nobility because i have here considered it only as an english commoner and because i have thoughts of prosecuting the subject as it relates to scotland in another pamphlet being unwilling to swell this to a greater bulk     since the writing of the foregoing discourse i have perused a pamphlet entitled the thoughts of a member of the lower house etc in which the author first approves our constitution as divided into its three branches and through the whole course of his book contends in effect that it should consist of no more than two for he supposes the house of lords instituted only as guardians and ornaments to the throne and to be augmented by the crown in such a proportion as may strengthen it in opposition to the house of commons the reader may see his scheme in the following words p   there is not says this writer a more certain maxim in politics than that a monarchy must subsist by an army or nobility the first makes it despotic and the latter a free government i presume none of those noble personages themselves who have the honor to make up that illustrious body do believe they are so distinguished and advanced above their fellow subjects for their own sakes they know they are intended the guardians as well as ornaments of the monarchy an essential prerogative of which it must be to add to and augment their number in such proportion as to render them a proper balance against the democratical part of our constitution without being formidable to the monarchy it self the support of which is the reason of their institution this is a most extraordinary notion of government that one branch of a legislature should be instituted only to be subservient to the strength and support of another but it is on this bottom that he founds his whole discourse and as for his objections to the proposed alteration i find they are such as i have already obviated in the course of this pamphlet if any thing remains in them unanswered it will fall under the last objection against the matter in debate which i should not take notice of did not i find that it makes an impression upon some peoples minds     suppose says the objection there should be an inflexible obstinacy in a house of peers what method would there be left to bring them to a concurrence with the two other branches of the legislature when it will not be in the power of the king to bring them over to reason by flinging in sufficient numbers among them to this i answer that if the lords are obstinate in a point that is reasonable and beneficial to the community it will be happy for their country that they should be invested with the proper power of a legislative branch not to be overruled to wrong measures this may sometimes be of great advantage to the public if we can possibly suppose that the two other branches may concur in any thing that is not consistent with justice or the national interest if the peers are thus inflexibly obstinate in any methods that are dishonorable unjust or pernicions to their country can we imagine they could not be influenced into a compliance by the authority of the two sharing branches in the legislature or can we think they would persist in measures which would draw upon them the displeasure of the crown and the resentments of the whole commons of great britain every body of men takes as much care as possible to preserve their credit and to render themselves popular and we cannot think that any branch of a legislature would be made up of madmen or pursue such measures as must necessarily end in their infamy or their destruction especially when they are infinitely weaker than either of the other constituent parts of our legislature could any person apprehend such a behavior from them i am sure the same person cannot in his heart apprehend their growing up into an aristocracy the peers are so little a match for the crown in power or the commons in property much less able to cope with the united force of both that it is wildness to suppose them guilty of such an unjust and unreasonable obstinacy as they know might endanger their very being in the british constitution and now i shall only propose it to every ones thoughts whether an expedient which will remedy the greatest inconvenience that may arise to us from one of the branches of the legislature and of which we have had experience as has been already sufficiently explained should prevail with us to lay it aside out of a groundless fear that it should expose us to an inconvenience from another branch of the legislature which must suppose em destitute of common sense void of honor and equity and regardless of selfpreservation before it can possibly befall us to this i shall only add that whatever objections are made against this alteration in the constitution may be made against every form of government in which the legislature consists of three distinct branches and that is against such a form as has been pronounced the most perfect by those who have been the most skilful politicians and the most famous for their observations on the nature of government  finis
