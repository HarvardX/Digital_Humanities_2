a continuation of the history of the crowninn with characters of some of the late servants and the proceeding of the trustees to the coming of the new landlord  part ii  london printed for j moor and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster price   d  a continuation of the history etc so many things of consequence offer at this time that i find i shall swell my design to a much greater length than i imagined instead of writing once a week i shall never be able to retain so many memorable particulars or get through my promise without adjusting the substance every post  you would split your sides at the late set of servants and their favorers in this town were you to see how they behave themselves in their present circumstances what a mixture they discover in their countenances of the sullen and the impertinent or indeed of the spaniel and the lion they would fain lay a timely claim to the good graces and favor of mr wright but their pretensions are awkardly made out and built on such senceless foundations that it is queer enough to hear them explain em  harry aucumy who is at leizure now to carry on all the intrigues that lay upon his hands has had a very great levee of condolants since his late misfortune for say they harry appeared a man of spirit and was always firm to his purpose harry was resolute and constant in the measures he pursued and would have pushed things with another manner of spirit than that unaccountable fellow slyboots showed who had been asleep for three years and always kept his friends as well as his enemies in doubt what he designed harry was the life of the cause the joy of the party and the toast of the club from harry we expected something very great and surprising he had a spirit and impudence really fitted for it our hopes in him daily increased we saw him on robins downfall which was owing to his dextrous conduct placed in a sphere whereby his excellent talents would have come to shine in their full luster nay he had managed it so admirably that he sent the trickster robin off the stage with the utmost disgrace which for reasons well known to us would have proved of service to future purposes  but i must not stay to finish the encomiuns these visitants of harrys bestowed on him without letting you know that they were such friends of young shutes as began to place the greatest confidence in him from the several steps which they plainly saw he had taken in his favor the rest were such as harry had really let into the secret and among whom there ran a mutual and entire chain of confidence in which they would all rather have hanged together than to have broke their faith with one another  must it not therefore be the most sensible mortification to men elated with such hopes and inspired by a genius so very promising as harrys to promote their views to see him at two steps fall headlong from such an eminence of power and authority and lie the bleeding sacrifice of a ruinedparty at the feet of his enemies despised threatened and levelled to their resentments by the act of the new landlord who singled him out like a deer for the chase to be the common sport of all the honest servants and tenants nay even to his antagonist robin what can show a man more despised than the message delivered him by the trustees for his dismission  mr aucumy your proceedings having rendered your conduct suspected we are ordered by our new landlord mr wright to tell you that he has no farther service for you with directions likewise to take from you your books of accounts and seal up the counting house   you may be sure his friends bleed inwardly for him but they have indeed the most admirable way of outfacing things that ever was known they had before this given out that he stood on no bad terms with mr wright and chiefly that on the first indisposition of the widow it was he who promoted the delivery of bobs conjuringvvand into the hands of the chamberlain which he could not choose but acknowledge as a piece of good service but this is somewhat like bobs inviolable attach  this they maintained with an assurance peculiar to them till the time of harrys disgrace when a fresh astonishment appeared in them and for two or three days there was a general run of guilty confused faces among the party harry himself stood this shock with a great deal of outward confidence before his friends because he was unwilling to discourage them but alas we know that nothing but a clear and unspotted conscience can really support a mans spirits under such sudden and capital afflictions this required that they should give their sentiments a new turn and now harry was consoled by his friends as a man purely suffering for his principles and one who deserved all the confidence they had placed in him  one would think this indication should have taught them a little modesty but they go on at the old rate they will not stand convinced that they have a less share of the favor of mr wright than others though it is with the utmost impudence and vanity they dare even make pretenses to it they are the most impatient people at the loss of power imaginable and certainly make the worst use of it when they have it of any living for they are all heat and choler whence it is observable through their precipitate and posthaste fury that they have never been long before they finished their course  they have the merriest way of interpreting things that can be they pretend they are very impatient for the arrival of the new landlord being uneasy at the management of the trustees who have gone a great way toward putting the affairs of the inn in a better posture and to draw a better trade to the whole town they cannot or rather will not believe that the choice of the trustees has any thing of the true meaning of mr wright in it but that it was done upon their own solicitations and intelligence and that they doubt not but they shall soon convince him when they come to talk with him  would it not anger one that these fellows should have the impudence to form these preposterous suggestions for i will forgive the folly of it do they think he has forgot or ever will their turning two or three of his servants out of the house in a rude sort of manner though they paid honestly for what they called for only because they gave their master notice of their intrigues was any thing more grossly impudent than harrys conduct in this matter or his inspiring the club to do all they could to hinder young mr wright from coming among them they are mistaken if they think him a person so shortsighted as to be deceived in distinguishing his friends from his foes and if those who have always appeared in his interest and on all occasions justified their love to him are not to be entitled to his favor nay if his own sense of this in choosing such for trustees is not sufficient to prove it i leave them to be corrected by their own folly  every reed serves a drowning man to catch at you would smile did you but know the mighty splutter they make that their consort tom scatterwit has shook hands with mr wright now you must know there is no more in it than this tom was agent for the widow at nick frogs especially on the composition tom like the rest of his fraternity was a very active furious fellow and when reason would not do he used to cock his hat and tread upon nicks toes nick made damned sour faces but was not able to cope with the young bully nick in his time had been a very sturdy fellow but he was then cursedly pinched with corns and could hardly stir out of his elbowchair it is true he kicked and winced a little but tom always turned him by main strength and in the end worked him into temper to consent quietly to the agreement tom on the widows death lay under dreadful apprehensions he was conscious that a very good understanding would ensue between mr wright and nick and that if nick should remember the smart of his toes it would prove but a little queer for him tom therefore came to nick and showed a geat deal of unusual condescension instead of the bully cock he now came cap in hand and entered into an expostulation somewhat servile he desired nick to forget old grudges and to make the best of matters to mr wright nick looked a little sour on him as remembering the cursed gripes he had given him however like a man of honor he told him he forgave him and should be glad to hear of his conversion another thing likewise laid toms friends under some apprehensions for him he was dipped in harrys project of entering into a league with old savage and his grandson tending to the prejudice of mr wrights interest and had unluckily written for further orders therein just at the time of the widows death which packet falling of course into the hands of the trustees they sealed it up and sent it to mr wright  poor tom looked plaguey queer upon it at first but it seems he has had a long conference with mr wright on his arrival at nick frogs which his friends interpret strangely to his advantage not that they think tom will prove very stanch but that they love a fellow of a predominant spirit most people laugh heartily at this and say that tom who is an excellent fellow at congee and grimace took all opportunities to wriggle himself into mr wrights acquaintance and screwed in at the lower end of the table to dinner  nick spitfire was to have played the same game at squire souths but the squire being a man of spirit forbid nick the house and resolved to receive no message from the widow by such hands which put nick upon the splutter for losing so favorable an opportunity of exerting himself  bob bungey is selling his equipage again sensibly afflicted at the miscarriage of his business to phil baboon bob breeds excellent bullocks and has got money by it but was never looked on to be a fellow of any tolerable sense  matt spindleshanks the tavernboy is in a strange quandary whether he shall return home or stay at old savages it is noted for excellent air in a consumption and it is very probable that matt who is a little infirm will choose it for his healths sake life is sweet and it is very probable that the late damps that have happened in this country may be apt to suffocate poor matt so that his physicians have advised him that the other air is more safe for him  peregriue scamper who makes such a mighty noise of his conduct is lately returned from his last errand he pleads a great deal of merit and is angry he was not named one of the trustees to say truth the man had had never much harm in him but being always thought a little troublesome at home was usually sent out of the way for quietness sake most people would believe he had done some service if he talked jess of it and had shown less compliance to some points which render him a little disagreeable  jacob rash the new agent is the less concerned at being shut out of the management of all affairs at the inn because it furnishes him with an opportunity to indulge himself in a voluptuous life he was a zealous promoter of harrys new scheme and a great closeter of the buffcoats upon that occasion jacob has lost his former reputation and has the misfortune of being looked on as a tool when perhaps too much indolence and good nature only has been his fault  old biass the malster has a greater inclination than a spirit to do mischief covetousness which is in others a crime has in him proved a virtue he would have gone greater lengths in young shutes favor but for the excessive dread of losing his pelf besides he saw no reason why he should embark on a level with fellows of desperate fortunes biass dropped them in several important points and cried safes the word he was willing to come in for something among them but would not run the hazard of losing one of his g  s for never a cause in christendom so that people say though he is no very honest man yet he has proved an excellent bowler  i know no one lies more exposed than sim the scrivener sims principles prevailed over his gratitude to show his good inclinations to young shute it is whispered that he has already received his quietus and no doubt but a post or two more will confirm it will bromingham notwithstanding his great pretenses looks with a very formidable dull air he would fain be thought to merit his place but i hear mr wright is of another opinion  bob and harry aucumy are as far from being friends as ever bob has lost his reputation with both parties but harry stands fair with one side at least in short harry appears most guilty but bob has the more despicable phiz  will wildfire would be a solitary fellow too if he was capable of thinking but that is what he never did in his life he is a great comforter to harry under his affliction and talks mightily of his interest in a certain family he is allied to by marriage that are like to come into favor but a bottle i believe is the more solid consolation of the two  arthur skipkennel has packed up his movables and is ready for the scamper con  is turned out of the west farm by the trustees a fellow that has done a damned deal of mischief to the country there more of this in my next  tom dimple has recovered his former reputation tom you must know was pitched on to carry instructions to jacob rush in relation to stifling the evidence mentioned in my last tom thought he had been sent to influence the cause but by a cursed artifice found that bob and harry had sealed his packet up tom was chose steward at the next club and has shown himself a very honest friend of mr wrights  honest charles barrier is made clerk of the brewhouse in harrys room which is highly satisfactory to all honest men here and no doubt is an instance of mr wrights esteem to nick frog and to take off the odium of his conduct in concert with charles when the club at the inn in the vvidows time fell foul on him in opprobious words and had like to have sent charles to the stocks for the bargain he made with nick in relation to some copses and enclosures on esquire souths estate which were to be put into nicks occupation wherein charles as they alleged suffered him to infringe on a turnip field or two of the vvidows  never was man so joyfully caressed and entertained as mr wright was at nicks house both he and all his tenants were ready to devour him for joy and indeed to say truth nick had a great deal of reason for his exaltation for he had been used but a little scurvily in the latter part of the vvidows days many of the new servants hated him in their hearts and twas feared that to bring about some other design they would not have stuck to persuade the vvidow into a law suit against poor nick but these fears are all cured now and nick begins to speak and act with his usual spirit again  i am yours etc  postscript the swift current of affairs at this time will not let me i find conclude without a postscript  jacob rush is dismissed from the agency and honest john trusty has got his place again john met mr wright on the road and wishing him joy on his accession to the estate mr wright answered that he was satisfied a great deal was owing to him on that occasion and he should always very gratefully remember his services  this day mr wright arrived in town nothing can express the great joy and satisfaction of the people he was met by the heads of the town and conducted to the inn through crowds of spectators making loud acclamations  i just now learn that harry aucumy is sent for to be present at the opening of the counting house and that he comes with a heavy splenetick air the same hand informs me that poor sim has received a very civil message from mr wright to desire his absence from the house to make room for honest will the cooper a man that can see a little farther into a millstone than the other sim takes his misfortune very heavily and some queer fellows that used to write hackney under him are like to be reduced to the circumstance of wanting heels to their shoes again these scurvy dogs had just as much love for mr wright as their master  i am likewise credibly informed that charles the headostler ned topsail and several other of the honest old servants will have their places again at the inn the house begins to flourish and none are to be admitted but what are known to be men that have always promoted its interest  i must now finish for every moment almost brings me some fresh particular and i never should have done if i waited for any conclusive period  i wish this may come safe to your hands for the postboy is such a damned impudent rascal one is hardly abel to express it the dog sold ballads up and down the town before and now sets up for writing news letters he was a great lurker about harrys office and it is thought has conveyed many a private packet for him to young shute he has been often basted for his scurrilous saucy tongue without any effect but it is very probable we shall now bring him to the vvhippingpost when will bromingham troops off he will be forbid coming near the inn and we hope then to rid the town of such a scurrilous varlet  even whilst i am writing this short postscript there is news of other numerous changes at the inn but i cannot enter into particulars till my next  honest dan sobersides is poppd into old biasss twoarmdchair at the club jemmy brisk one of the prettiest fellows in town is made chief clerk in the room of will bromingham  you may perhaps not give this article its full weight but i can assure you it is meant as a distant compliment to squire south jemmy is one he has a particular esteem for and his preferment is an argument that a good understanding is renewed with the squire i believe you will soon see young shute removed to a little farther distance from the estate if i dont conclude now i never shall
