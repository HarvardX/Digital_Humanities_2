the fast a poem translated from the prophet isaiah  by the rev james murray  wherefore have we fasted and thou see not isaiah lviii   price   d  the fast isaiah lviii     cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgressions and the house of jacob their sins    yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinances of their god they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to god    wherefore have we fasted say they and thou see not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou take no knowledge behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure and exact all your labors    behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high    is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him will thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord    is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke    is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou see the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh    in lofty accents let thy voice be heard and show the tribes the mandates of the lord through all the land proclaim what crimes abound let every word loud like a trumpet sound spare neither age nor sex nor low nor high let all the house of jacob hear thy cry for from the lowest cottage to the throne all ranks of men in paths of vice have gone they much profess but yet their meanings naught for not one words an emblem of their thought in show fictitious they draw nigh to me and act as if jehovah did not see with pomp and splendour void of soul and grace they pay devotion in my holy place a pleasure counterfeit smiles on each brow and songs melodious from their lips do flow that such as see them in this apish mode would almost swear they did delight in god yet all is fiction  if you mark their course they still proceed from evil deeds to worse their state devotions all an action feigned for when they worship god cursed selfs their end their slumbering priests like hirelings serve for pay and idly sleep and saunter out the day like drowsy idle shepherds who at noon stretch out their lazy limbs upon the down and sleep securely in the heat of day while all their flocks do wander far astray and when the ravning wolves the sheep devour the shepherd lies supine and sleeps secure at last the sluggard wakes and as a proof he loves the flock he cries and scolds the wolf so thus the shepherds of the sacred fold they cannot watch but loudly can they scold even god himself they are so void of grace they even dare to scold him to his face how vain is it for us to fast and pray to waste our labor and lament a day to vex our souls for sin for though that we do fast and pray jehovah will not see or if he sees us pays us no regard nor thinks our labor worthy of reward our schemes are baffled and our troops defeat and all our wisest projects are too late the chiefs of bozrah who obeyed our laws have now rebelled and libnahs joined their cause now both are rebels and defy our hosts defeat our armies and invade our coasts yet we have fasted many a weary day but now we find it vain to fast and pray the words of the almighty can such profane dissemblers think that i will either hear their voice or mind their cry for when ye seem to fast in outward show you seek not things above but things below your souls are lofty and your hearts are proud this all your actions do proclaim aloud for when ye fast and feign to afflict your souls you swing in pleasure and ye swill in bowls and when ye come to bow before my throne ye make your servants drudge like slaves at home you never fast but when ye mean to smite and never pray unless for power to fight no more ye mean when ye your sins confess than to bribe heaven for freedom to oppress think ye that god all gracious ever will regard their litanies who pray to kill to kill and whom your very flesh and blood should i regard you how could i be good cease thus profanely to invoke my aid or think i will help to kill the souls i have made ye tyrants dread my thunder fear your god and tremble at the lifting of my rod is it a solemn fast to please the lord to bow the head and next transgress my word can sackcloth sanctified conceal your sin or hide from me your ugliness within all space i view and all the orbs that roll mine eyes behold and penetrate the whole your inmost thoughts their secret springs i see proceed from selfish vile hypocrisy to mes a fast an acceptable day when none but hypocrites do fast and pray when bended necks and stubborn hearts draw nigh to offer vain requests to the most high cry loud and long yet for no other ends except to kill their foes enslave their friends  who never bend their knees before my bar till sin and guilt have plunged them deep in war and then they think that i am so unjust to slaughter righteous men to feed their lust  their lust of power and when they steal my word maintain they have dominion from the lord their legislature though reverse to mine they yet eclept a government divine such is their power and impudence of face they would swear that satans power proceeds from grace even saul manasseh ahab all these three pretended each they had their power from me yet they from me had power no other way than wandering slaves have power to go astray for power to live and move implies no more than to preserve what i have made before abuse of power depends upon mens will and all must blame themselves when they do ill all just dominion has its base in right and shines selfevident like beams of light mans lusts apart all mankind must agree that only righteous power proceeds from me none need dispute who has a right to rule the god of wisdom never appoints a fool when fools wear crowns and tyrants sceptres sway then subjects sin not though they disobey when legislative powers opposed to right men are not ruled by justice but by might force is no law and violence no rule who practice either must be knave or fool the scheme of government which i approve is that which rules the heart of man by love what is aarons race or davids line to me when priests are proud and kings love tyranny the poor mans interest and his souls as dear in my esteem as those of prince or peer kings were appointed legislatures made mens interests to preserve not to invade how great their power how far their might should go are things quite plain not difficult to show the end of power is universal good a thing conspicuous easy understood first do no ill than all the good you can this is the end of government to man inferences kings often do and princes oftimes pray for power to rule with universal sway for royal proclamations seldom come abroad unless to bring dominion home when kings proclaim a fast the blind may spy they have at least a vineyard in their eye ahab than whom a baser prince never swayed a scepter over a nation whind and prayed proclaimed a fast at jezebels command and issued humiliation through the land but underneath this mask dark vengeance lay and naboth suffered when the court did pray the royal monarch gained his point at last and consecrated murder by a fast the venal ministers of ahabs court meant more by tasting than a simple sport like cunning politicians who conceal their dark designs against the commonweal who lest some prying folk should chance to know strike up some novel masquerade or show some cocklane ghost or if these fail at last amuse the people with a public fast state humiliations are but state engines intended chiefly to mask over black crimes i kings xxi   to     fasts seldom from the royal power proceed unless the prince is sadly pinched indeed give monarchs troops and but the treasry fill they will leave the tribes of men to fast who will a poor exchequer and the regments thin to monarchs always is the greatest sin when loads of wealth are squandered on their lust and all the ponderous sums they hold in trust are scattered far abroad to gather power they call it treason to refuse them more the subjects must not judge although they pay how much the king and courtiers throw away implicit faith to courts is reckoned due and none have right to judge except a few  whose interest always blinds their judgments so they never err be it ill or good they do thus faith politic like mens creed at rome is free to be explored by only  some the ignoble vulgar must remain content though monarchs should mortgage the continent thus speak the proud but hear the eternal say what men should ponder when they fast and pray the word of the lord he who proclaims a fast ought first to free his subjects from all yokes of tyranny loose all unrighteous bands both more and less and cease even helpless beggars to oppress set prisons open and the hungry feed bring water to the thirsty when they need give wholesome covering to the naked poor to all in want set open wide the door when to your home your helpless friends repair let them have always ready welcome there nor suffer sycophants for to deny your presence when a needy friend stands by then shall thy glory like the morning ray burst forth in splendour and increase like day health like a bubbling fountain shall spring forth and pleasures flow from east south west and north the trump of fame before thy face shall bear thy high renown and glory close the rear and when thy orisons shall ascend on high thy god propitious shall attend thy cry grant all thy suits and thy requests receive and even ere you ask shall answer give throw every yoke but legal bands away nor meanly rule with arbitrary sway for threatening proclamations never can insure obedience or regard from man how vain is it to think when kings command that men should run if they but wag their hand thus spoke jehovah to the jews of old and this the prophets to the fathers told isaiah lviii      part ii ever since the time that monarchies began and monarchs claimed dominion over man princes who aimed at arbitrary sway and meant to make their villains all obey have bribed an hireling priesthood first to blind the human conscience and debase the mind for every tyrant if he loose his purse will find some balaam ready with a curse  cheerful to listen to his lords command to scatter heavens vengeance through the land false prophets hannaniah like to tell when every thing is wrong that all is well  whose power of face and vilest impudence exceed the utmost bounds of all pretense they think no shame to tell the grossest lies and publish fictions for true prophecies even when an host advances in array will gravely swear they saw them run away make ignrant fools believe for there are fools at all times ready to be great mens tools that if they bow their heads or bend the knee in formal feigned vile hypocrisy with bashful looks conceal the worst intents that then they keep divine commandments when zedekiah erst over judah reigned and gods own people all his laws profaned false prophets then as well as prophets since told lies and flattery to that weak prince they augurd all things as the courtiers willed but never found their prophecies fulfilled even those who trusted to their prophecies in sad experience found them all prove lies when salems stately towers and walls around in ruins lay quite level with the ground the temple sacked and its foundation tilled then were their godly prophecies fulfilled their haughty monarch whose perverted mind to truth and all true discipline was blind who to his flattering sycophants gave ear for his credulity he soon paid dear he saw his kingdom lost his city taken his dearest offspring in his presence slain what now he saw was all foretold before he saw it true alas he saw no more the cruel chaldean then put out his eyes and in his blindness proved the prophecies helkiahs son of aarons sacred line of anathoth by augury divine in strongest emblems showed his dismal fate at last hew saw the truth but ah too late when babels warlike sons approached near and filled the tribes of judah all with fear the wise foresaw the lands approaching doom and trembled for their miseries to come but azurs faithless son an augur base who yet at court passed for a child of grace bribed by the ministry to publish lies came forth with asses loads of prophecies preached final conquest over every foe his lying pasquils over the country go industrious spread by ministerial tools to gull the unwary and to flatter fools full fifty thousand in a month were sold from salem to beersheba i am told and when the faithless people would not buy the courtiers gave them out of courtesy so sanguine they to blind the peoples eyes they turned pedlars of false prophecies and shephatiah d  h i would say as balaam preached and published he did pay the old false prophet in his chariot flew and every lie he caught he dressed it new cursed as he went and as his curses flowed held up his hands and turned his eyes to god his sanctimonious phiz and sly grimace passed among partisans for signs of grace so reverend like he vamped all his lies that grossest falsehoods passed for prophecies thus courtiers praised him and the venal tribes who judge a cause by interest truth by bribes  who rights divine or human will not see unless unlocked by intrests golden key hardened in sin and vainly puffed with praise he showed some marks which were not signs of grace for which the almighty gave him in his ire nor son nor daughter to succeed their sire jer xxix     while things turned worse and worse and every day brought still new tidings of some fresh dismay the king alarmed and roused through fear at last turned first devote and then proclaimed a fast he called the priests and prophets to prepare a scheme of fasting and a form of prayer to try if heaven would grant him power to kill all those that were not subject to his will court priests and prophets when that sovreigns cry run at their call and at their nod draw nigh for royal mandates have a powerful zest and like a mighty loadstone draw a priest even bishops feel their sympathetic force and all who have their feelings in their purse from jearim to beersheba all obeyed even judges fasted and attorneys prayed one would have thought all judah were sincere for naught was heard but mighty peals of prayer like ahabs priests they would not be said nay though god refused to hear yet still they pray than hananiah none showed more zeal in fervent fasting for the commonweal with labored suits he prayed and while he cried the very god of battles he defied of jewish valor vauntingly he spoke and with a symbol brake the chaldean yoke jer xxviii  0  made all the tribes believe their foes would run like bats and owls before the approaching sun he proved still more that on that fatal day when nergal nergal a chaldean officer conquered that he ran away him fools believed and lived in hope to see the jews victorious and the chaldeans flee so strong their faith they boast how every jew had conquered squadrons told they legions slew at their approach their foes still run away and yet the conquering tribes still lost the day when heavens angry frowns their hopes beguiled then hananiah swore jehovah smiled told how their foes were blasted since that day the guilty jews began to fast and pray yet every post brought tidings worse and worse often times the foot were slain sometimes the horse all this was proved a victory complete and those who vanquished were aye defeat such power has fasting in the hands of kings it changes nature and the cause of things even sins are sanctified when princes pray and light turns darkness darkness shines like day all this a venal priesthood will declare and consecrate plain murder lawful war even so it was in ahabs pious reign baals prophets prayed till naboth he was slain whatever the prince desired with one accord the priests insurd him always from the lord four hundred prophets in a lusty ring as they obsequiously stood round the king with rosy gills in cringing accents bless and swore that ramoth gilead sure was his but shall i prosper the vain prince replied they all said prosper but the prophets lyd with hieroglyphic horns vain symbols those to show how wicked men would push their foes these lying prophets with a solemn farce made foolish ahab think himself was mars but when the awful day of battle came he found their words and deeds were not the same it is vain to fast and pray while men remain resolved to hold and all their sins retain they cannot be humble who resolve to sin nor are they pure who lodge vile thoughts within it is no hard matter for to fast till four then feast on turtle when the fast is over where envy rules or proud ambition reigns religions self is fettered fast in chains however abstemious envious mortals are with god and man they wage eternal war whole chapels crowded full of envious men are but an image of that dreary den envys dark cave which erst the virgin found in a dark vale and deep below the ground where envy seated in her dark abode defiled with ropy gore and clots of blood shut from the wind and from the wholesome skies in a deep vale the dreary dungeon lies dismal and cold where not a ray of light invades the winter or disturbs the night a poisonous morsel in her teeth she chewed and gorged the flesh of vipers for her food minerva loathing turned away her eye the hideous monster rising heavily came stalking forward with a sullen pace and left her mangled offals on the place soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright she fetched a groan at such a cheerful sight livid and meagre were her looks her eye in foul distorted glances turned awry a hord of gall her inward parts possessed and spread a greenness over her cancerd breast her teeth were brown with rust and from her tongue in dangling drops the stringy poison hung she never smiles but when the wretched weep nor lulls her malice with a moments sleep restless in spite while watchful to destroy she pines and sickens at anothers joy foe to herself distressing and distressed she bears her own tormentor in her breast she takes her staff hung round with wreaths of thorn and sails along in howling tempests born over fields and flowery meadows where she steers her baneful course a mighty blast appears mildews and blights the meadows are defaced the fields and flowers and the whole year laid waste on mortals next and peopled towns she falls and breathes a burning plague among their walls though men may fast and with much fervor pray malice and envy soon will guilt betray he who commits a crime will quickly find the pressing guilt lie heavy on his mind though bribes or favor should assert his cause pronounce him guiltless and elude the laws none quits himself his own impartial thought will damn and conscience will record the fault each as his hands in guilt have been embrud by hellish horror ever is pursued a virtuous heart and unstained innocence is mans best second guard and sure defense but hear with patience a famed heathens word it may do good even to a fasting lord who fasts for power and when he fasts will pray for might to make reluctant lands obey and flimsy patriots if they will may hear some wholesome lessons for a patriots ear that mans a sisyphus whom noise and strife seduce from all the soft retreats of life to vex the government disturb the laws drunk with the fumes of popular applause he courts the giddy crowd to make him great and sweats and toils to mount the sovereign seat for still to aim at power and still to fail ever to strive and never to prevail what is it but in reasons true account to heave the stone against the rising mount which urged with labor and forced up with pain recoils and rolls impetuous down the plain but mark him down a slave who humbly proud with presents begs preferment from the crowd that early suppliant who salutes the tribes and sets the mob to scramble for his bribes that some old dottard sitting in the sun on holidays may tell what fates were done but ye proud chiefs that thirst for sovereign sway hear what an ancient heathen bard does say some ask for envied power which public hate pursues and hurries headlong to their fate down go their titles and their statues crowned are by base hands in the next river drowned the guiltless horses and the chariot wheel the same effects of vulgar fury feel the smith prepares his hammer for the stroke while belching bellows hissing fire provoke sejanus prime minister of tiberius caesar he had many triumphal chariots and statues erected to him but falling into disgrace they were all broken down and the senate and people insulted over him as meanly as they had formerly flattered him  almost first of roman names the great sejanus crackles in the flames formd in the forge the pliant brass is laid on anvils and of head and limbs are made pans cans and pisspots and such kitchen stuff nor did their mean revenge think this enough they drag the image through the streets and loud sound welcome to the gazing gathering crowd adorn your doors with laurels and a bull milk white and large lead to the capitol sejanus with a rope is dragged along the sport and laughter of the giddy throng good lord they cry what blackmoor lips he has how foul a smock and what a hanging face by heaven i never could endure his sight but say how came his monstrous crimes to light what is the charge and who the evidence there must be striking proofs of his offense nothing at all of this but caesar sent a threatening letter to the parliament nay sirs if caesar writ i ask no more hes guilty  and the questions out of door now with sejanus would thou change thy fate to be like him first minister of state to have thy levees crowded with resort of a depending gaping servile court dispose all honors of the sword and gown raise with a nod and ruin with a frown to hold thy prince in pupilage and sway the monarch whom the conquered world obey yes i believe thou would be great as he for every mans a fool to that degree all wish the dire prerogative to kill even they would have the power that want the will but would thou have thy wishes understood to take the bad together with the good would thou not rather choose the small renown to be the mayor of some poor paltry town bigly to look and barbarously to speak to pound false weights and scanty measures break than be sejanus so advanced in place then tumbled headlong to such mean disgrace great hannibal within the balance lay and tell how many pounds his ashes weigh him afric was not able to contain whose length runs level with the atlantic main and weakens fruitful nilus to convey his sunbeat waters by so long a way spain first he won the pyrenaeans past and frozen alps the mounds that nature cast and with corroding juices as he went a passage through the living rocks he rent though italy was conquered and oerrun uneasy still he cried there is nothing done till level with the ground their gates are laid and punic flags on roman towers displayed but what is his end o charming glory say what rare fifth act to crown this huffing play in one deciding battle overcome he flies is banished from his native home these heathen hints in an auspicious hour may warning give to such as pray for power to see the wancomplexiond gambling crew in church sit cloistered fasting in a pew yawning and panting till the hours are past and longing more to break than keep their fast to hear the long robbed gentry squeaking say ah guilty miserere domine is such a farce would almost spoil the grace and pinch the skill of aristophanes to give their characters a striking hue as they sit feigndly fasting in the pew by play mens tempers are unguarded made and when the heads intent the hearts betrayed then base desires of gain then rage appears next blows and brawls arise and anxious fears then clamor and revellings reach the sky while losing gamesters heaven and earth defy then horrid oaths are uttered every cast they grieve and curse and swear nay weep at last and in a pet will even feign to fast when lawyers fast and when that gamblers pray or when that bishops cast the tithes away when haughty churchmen are not fond of power or when the strong do not the weak devour then shall dissemblers find it on record that when they fast for strife they please the lord but why do pious nations in distress flee to the lord and all their sins confess sins which they mean not ever to give over while sin brings gain and vice increases power can such believe the great almightys blind and does not see the errors of the mind or that hypocrisy and vile grimace is a fit offering to obtain his grace while secret vice lies lurking in the mind and guilty culprits to their faults are blind though they may bow and cringe and fast a day in gods pure eye they neither fast nor pray a pampered prelate finely decked in lawn to fast and pray by six fine horses drawn in a gilt coach and to confess the crimes of lords and scavengers in these bad times is so polite a mark of penitence that drunken peers can scarcely take offense but why not join in praise as well as fast and thank the lord for many favors past for smiling springs dressed in a verdant green and gladsome summers which our eyes have seen with richest autumns in effulgence gay all nodding with a cornu copiae for twenty seasons past and some few more the last was better than the year before and now the present still excels the past yet peevish britons will not praise but fast like children who for some conceived affront will fast in spite if bid them eat they wont take penance on themselves cause heaven will not give what their own pride unjustly would receive who are not grateful for all favors past but mock jehovah when they feign to fast finis
