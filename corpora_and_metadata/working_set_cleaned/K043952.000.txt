music composed by dr boyce  dublin printed for j exshaw and m williamson m dcc liii  advertisement this little piece was written above three years since and acted for my benefit  the last scene was an addition the year after whatever faults are in it i hope will be pardoned when i inform the public i had at first no design of printing it and do it now at the request of my friends who as it met with so much indulgence from the audience thought it might give some pleasure in the reading  the songs were written by a gentleman  i take this opportunity to assure the public i am with great gratitude and respect  their most obliged humble servant c clive  persons men witling mr woodward sir albany odelove mr shuter tom mr mozeen prompter mr cross women mrs hazard mrs clive miss giggle miss minors

petticoats scene i a dressing room in mrs hazards house gatty preparing the toylet enter tom with tea things gatty well i believe we are at present the most melancholy family in town that used to be the merriest since these devils the muses as my lady calls em have got into the house they have turned her head and she distracts every body about her she really was once a sweettemperd woman but now i cannot speak or stir but she flies at me and says i have flurried her out of one of the finest thoughts  hang her i wish her farce may be hissed off the stage   tom that is but a foolish kind of wish for if she is so sweettemperd now what do you think she will be then   gatty i dont care what she will be for i am determined not to stay with her i am sure she uses me like her dog   tom does she  then you are an ungrateful hussy to complain for she is fonder of that than ever she was of her husband  i fancy this farce of here is is horrid stuff for i observe all her visitors she reads it to which is indeed every body that comes to the house whisper as they come down stairs and laugh ready to kill themselves   gatty yes but that is at her assurance why do you know it is none of her own a gentleman only lent it her to read he has been ill a great while at bath so she has taken the advantage of that made some little alterations had it set to music and has introduced it to the stage as a performance of her own   tom i hear mr surly that every body thought she was going to be married to is so enraged at her that he will never speak to her or see her again one of his footmen told me of it yesterday as a great secret so i promised him never to mention it  dont you hear her bell ring  rings gatty hear her yes yes i hear her but i should have a fine time on it if i was to go to her as often as she takes it in her head to ring rings again ay ay ring away   tom ay ay ring away  igad here she comes i with you well off exit   enter mrs hazard mrs hazard why what is the meaning i must ring for an hour and none of ye will come near me ye animals    gatty i was coming as fast as i could   mrs hazard as fast as you could why you move like a snail that has been trod upon you creeping creature  let me die but she has provoked me into a fine simile come get the things to dress me instantaneously tom with tea and coffee she repeats recitative oh corydon etc you tom i am at home to no human being this morning but mr witling i have promised to carry him to the rehearsal with me repeats recitative gatty waiting with her cap   gatty madam will you please to have your cap on   mrs hazard no you idiot how durst you interrupt me when you saw me so engaged as i am a critic this creature will distract me  give me my bottle of salts  she has ruined one of the finest conclusions  o cor  lord i cannot sing a note  what are you doing   gatty lord madam i cannot find them   mrs hazard here is a provoking devil sees em in my hand and would not tell me of it get out of my sight repeats recitative why where are you going am i to dress myself   gatty madam mr witling   enter witling witling my dear widow youre hard at it i see come give me some tea what is it your prologue or epilogue pray   mrs hazard o lord dear witling  dont be ridiculous for i am in a horrid humor   witling yes and a horrid dress too i think why it is almost ten  what is this your rehearsal habiliment   mrs hazard why that creature that you see standing there will not give me any thing to put on   witling well do you know i have had such a quarrel with frank surly upon your account we met last night at lady betty brags rout  there was a vast deal of company  and they were all talking of your new piece   mrs hazard so i suppose i was finely worried   witling you shall hear as soon as ever it was mentioned we all burst out a laughing   mrs hazard you did  and pray what did you laugh at   witling hey  why  oh at frank surly he looked so like a  ha ha ha igad i cannot find a simile that can give you an idea of such a face oh thinks i my dear youre in a fine humor to make us some diversion so says i frank i hear the match is quite concluded between mrs hazard and you and that she has fixed the first night of her comedy for your weddingnight  sir says he with a very grave face you may say what you please of mrs hazard for as she is going to expose herself she must expect that every fool will be as impertinent as she is ridiculous  but i would advise you not to mention my name any more in that manner for if you do i shall take it extremely ill lord says miss giggle mr surly how can you be so cross expose herself  i will swear i believe mrs hazard can write a very pretty play for she has a great deal of wit and humor  wit and humor says he why there are not ten women in the creation that have sense enough to write a consistent n b  marry her i would sooner marry a woman that had been detected in ten amors than one who in defiance to all advice and without the pretense that most people write for for every body knows she is a woman of fortune will convince the whole world she is an idiot   mrs hazard a bear a brute let me hear no more of him   witling yes but i must tell you a very good thing that i said to him   mrs hazard no that you cannot i am sure witling for you never said a good thing in your life   witling nay why should you be so illnatured to me i am sure i took your part why says i frank how can you be such a fool to quarrel with her i wish she liked me half so well as i am sure she does you she should write and be hanged if she would for any thing i cared for let them do what they will with her performance they cannot damn her eight hundred a year   mrs hazard you said so did you   witling i said so  no lord child  how could you think i could say such a thing no no to be sure it was said by somebody in the company but upon honor i dont know who   mrs hazard what a wretch is this  but he is to carry a party for me the first night so i must not quarrel with him aside   witling well but my dear hazard when does your farce come out   hrs hazard why some time next week this is to be the last rehearsal and the managers have promised they shall all be dressed that we may see exactly what effect it will have   witling well but dont your head ach when you think of the first night hey    mrs hazard not in the least the town never hiss any thing that is introduced to them by a person of consequence and breeding because they are sure they will have nothing low   witling ay but they may not be so sure they will have nothing foolish   mrs hazard ha  why perhaps they may not find out one so soon as the other ha ha ha well let me die if that is not a very good thing  but it is well for me witling the town dont hear me not that i mean quite what i say neither for to do them justice they are generally in the right in their censure though sometimes indeed they will out of humanity forgive an author stupidity and overlook his being a fool provided he will do them the favor not to be a beast for which reason witling i have taken great care to be delicate i may be dull but i am delicate so that i am not at all afraid of the town i wish i could say the same of the performers lord what pity it is the great tragedy actors cannot sing i am about a new thing which i shall call a burletto which i take from some incidents in don quixote that i believe will be as high humor as was ever brought upon the stage but then i shall want actors oh if that dear garrick could but sing what a don quixote he would make   witling dont you think barry would be a better he is so tall you know and so finely made for it if i was to advise i would carry that to covent garden   mrs hazard covent garden lord i would not not think of it it stands in such a bad air   witling bad air   mrs hazard ay the actors cannot play there above three days a week they have more need of a physician than a poet at that house   witling but pray madam you say you are to call your new thing a burletto what is a burletto   mrs hazard what is a burletto why havnt you seen one at the haymarket   witling yes but i dont know what it is for all that   mrs hazard dont you why then let me die if i can tell you but i believe it is a kind of poor relation to an opera   witling pray how many characters have you in this thing   mrs hazard why i have but three for as i was observing there is so few of them that can sing nay i have but two indeed that are rational for i have made one of them mad   witling and who is to act that pray   mrs hazard why mrs clive to be sure though i wish she dont spoil it for she is so conceited and insolent that she will not let me teach it her you must know when i told her i had a part for her in a performance of mine in the prettiest manner i was able for one must be civil to these sort of people when one wants them says she indeed madam i must see the whole piece for i shall take no part in a new thing without choosing that which i think i can act best i have been a great sufferer already by the managers not doing justice to my genius but i hope i shall next year convince the town what fine judgment they have for i intend to play a capital tragedy part for my own benefit   witling and what did you say to her pray   mrs hazard say to her why do you think i would venture to expostulate with her  no i desired mr garrick would take her in hand so he ordered her the part of the madwoman directly   witling well i think the town will be vastly obliged to you for giving them such an entertainment as i am told it is from every body that has heard it though the ill  natured part of your acquaintance say it is none of your own   mrs hazard why whose do they say it is pray  not yours witling not quite so bad as that i hope no my motive for writing was really compassion the town has been so overwhelmed with tragedies lately that they are in one entire fit of the vapors  they think they love em but it is no such thing i was there one night this season at a tragedy and there was such an universal yawn in the house that if it had not been for a great quantity of drums and trumpets that most judiciously every now and then came in to their relief the whole audience would have fallen asleep   enter tom tom madam there is a young miss desires to speak to you upon particular business   witling hearke tom are you sure it is a young miss  if it is an old one dont let her come up for they are a sort of creatures i have a great aversion to   mrs hazard why thou impertinent stupid wretch did not i bid you deny me to every body dont you know i am going out this instant   tom madam it is not my fault i was not below and they let her in   mrs hazard i dont believe there is a woman in the world has such a collection of devils in her house as i have   enter miss miss mame  your servant  not to interrupt you   mrs hazard yes miss but you have done that  what is your business pray   miss why mame  i was informed as how that there was a new play of yours mame acoming out upon the stage with some singing in it   mrs hazard coming out upon the stage lord where could this creature come from well miss   miss so mame i have a desire not that i have any occasion but it is my fancy mame to come and sing upon the stage   mrs hazard and a very odd fancy i believe it is  well miss you say it is your fancy to sing upon the stage but pray are you qualified   miss o yes mame i have very good friends   mrs hazard this girls a natural  why miss that is a very great happiness but i believe a good voice would be more material to your fancy  i suppose you have a good voice   miss no mame i cannot say i have much voice   mrs hazard ha ha she is delightful i am glad they let her in well miss to be sure then you are a mistress   miss mame  what do you mean   mrs hazard ha ha i say i imagine you understand music perfectly well   miss no mame i never learnt in my life but it is my fancy   witling miss is a very pretty girl i wish she would take a fancy to me i believe it would answer my purpose better than singing will here is aside   mrs hazard well but my dear as you confess you have neither voice nor judgment to be sure you have a particular fine ear   miss yes mame i have a very good ear  that is when i sing by myself but the music always puts me out   mrs hazard ha ha well child you have given an exceeding good account of yourself and i believe will make a very extraordinary performer   miss thank you mame yes i believe i shall do very well in time   witling pray miss will not you favor us with a song   miss yes sir if you please i will sing powerful guardians of all nature i have brought it with me   mrs hazard pray let us hear it miss sings oh fie miss that will never do you speak your words as plain as a parishgirl the audience will never endure you in this kind of singing if they understand what you say you must give your words the italian accent child  come you shall hear me mrs hazard sings in the italian manner there miss that is the taste of singing now  but i must beg you would excuse me at present i am going to the playhouse and will certainly speak to the managers about you for i dare believe you will make a prodigious figure upon the stage   witling that you will indeed miss  the strangest that ever was seen there aside   miss sir i thank you mame i thank you mame i will wait on you another time   mrs hazard miss your servant  no that you shall not do i promise you exit miss   enter tom tom madam your chair has been waiting a great while it is after ten above half an hour   mrs hazard my stars this driveling girl has ruined me here gatty get me my shade i will go as i am   witling shall not i set you down   mrs hazard oh not for the world an authoress to be seen in the chariot of a fool would be the greatest absurdity in nature we shall meet at the house   witling very well mame and i shall be in the pit the first night remember that  come give me your hand however exeunt   act ii scene the playhouse enter mrs hazard mr witling and mr cross mrs hazard mr cross your servant has any body been to ask for me this morning   mr cross not any body madam   mrs hazard well that is very surprising i expected half the town would have been trying to get in but it is better as it is for they would only have interrupted the rehearsal so mr cross i will be denied to every body well witling how do you like the playhouse in a morning   witling why i think it is like a fine lady it looks best by candlelight   mrs hazard but pray mr cross get every body ready is the music come   mr cross yes madam the music has been here this half hour and every body but mrs clive and i dare say she will not be long for she is very punctual mr beard and miss thomas are gone to dress   mrs hazard mr cross you have had a great deal of trouble with this thing i dont know how i must make you amends but pray when your benefit is  you have a benefit i suppose  set me down all your sideboxes and every first row in the front i may want more but i shall certainly fill those   mr cross thankye madam   enter a servant servant mr cross there is a person wants to speak to you exit mr cross   mrs hazard well i will swear these poor players have a very slavish life i wonder how they are able to go through it   enter mr cross mr cross madam mrs clive has sent word that she cannot possibly wait on you this morning as she is obliged to go to some ladies about her benefit but you may depend on her being very perfect and ready to perform it whenever you please   mrs hazard mr cross what did you say i cannot believe what i have heard mrs clive send me word she cannot come to my rehearsal and is gone to ladies about her benefit sir she shall have no benefit mr witling did you ever hear of a parallel to this insolence give me my copy sir give me my copy i will make mrs clive repent treating me in this manner very fine indeed to have the assurance to prefer her benefit to my rehearsal mr cross you need not give yourself the trouble to set down any places for me at your benefit for i will never come into the playhouse any more   witling nay but my dear hazard dont put yourself into such a passion cannot you rehearse her part yourself i dare say you will do it better than she can   mr cross why madam if you would be so good as the music are here and the other characters dressed it would be very obliging and if you please to put on mrs clives her dresser is here to attend as she expected her and i believe it will fit you exactly as youre much of her size   mrs hazard o yes to be sure it will fit me exactly because i happen to be a head taller and i hope something better made   witling oh my dear hazard put it on put it on oh lord let me see you in a playhouse dress   mrs hazard well let me die but i have a great mind  for i had set my heart upon seeing the poor thing rehearsed in its proper dresses  well witling shall i  i think i will do you go into the green room and drink some chocolate i will slip on the things in a minute no hang it i will not take the trouble i will rehearse as i am  enter performers dressed miss thomas your servant upon my word i am extremely happy to have you in my performance you will do amazing well only i must beg youd throw in as much spirit as you can without overdoing it for that same thing the players call spirit they sometimes turn into rant and noise oh mr beard your most obedient sir i shall be vastly obliged to you i am sure do you know that you sing better than any of em but i hope you would consider the part you are to act with marcella is to be done with great scorn therefore as you have such a smiling goodhumored face i beg you will endeavor to smother as many of your dimples as you can in that scene with her come come let us begin we may omit the overture   miranda sola recitative it must be so  my shepherd never shall prove a renegado from the faith of love nor shall marcella tear him from my arms even though her wealth be boundless as her charms  mrs hazard that is pretty well madam but i think you sing it too much you should consider recitative should be spoken as plain as possible or else you will lose the expression  i will show you what i mean  no no go on now with the symphony for the song   air if cupid once the mind possess all low affections cease no troubles then can give distress no tumult break the peace oh had i thousand gifts in store were i of worlds the queen for him i would covet thousands more and call profusion mean   then let my swain my love return and equal raptures feel nor let his passions cool or burn as fortune winds her wheel if his fond heart i may believe immutably secure no sorrow then can make me grieve no loss can make me poor recitative but see he comes  i will wear a short disguise be false my tongue  be hypocrites my eyes nor to the youth too wantonly impart the secret history of a faithful heart enter corydon what from marcella come  insulting swain come ye to wake and triumph in my pain warm from those lips whose cruel sentence gave thy friend philander an untimely grave recitative corydon marcella name not the capricious fair one smile from thee is worth possession there miranda did not i hear her in yon hawthorn bower with transport boast over corydon her power air corydon in vain my fair one you complain and charge the guiltless boy in vain who never was found untrue the sweetest image thought can find thou best idea of my mind my soul is filled with you   let but those eyes benignly bright that look the language of delight this spacious globe review if they can find an equal fair be jealous then  and i will take care you shall have reason too miranda well  would you ease my breast and peace restore oh never see the vain marcella more duet miranda air at length return luxuriant thought return and settle where you ought fizd by experience dearly bought for sweet and useful ends often did i dread her subtle care and often was jealous though secure what agonies did i endure but love has made amends corydon joy were no joy and pleasure vain were there not intervals of pain the captive who has felt a chain is doubly blessed when free i view with transports the abyss which powers propitious made me miss and rush with aching thoughts of bliss to safety and to thee both joy were no joy and pleasure vain were there not intervals of pain the captive who has felt a chain is doubly blessed when free it is clouds that make the sun more bright it is darkness that sets off the light it is sorrow gives to joy its height by heavens most kind decree corydon witling falls asleep soft she approaches  seek you poplar glade and wait beneath the thick embowering shade yourself shall be a witness to my truth miranda retires enter marcella oh corydon ah cruel charming youth look not so stern i have no hopes to blast my love is come in sighs to breathe its last air the silver rain the pearly dew the gales that sweep along the mead the softened rocks have sorrow knew and marbles have found tears to shed the sighing trees in every grove have pity if they have not love   shall things inanimate be kind and every soft sensation know the weeping rain and sighing wind all all but thee some mercy show ah pity  if you scorn tapprove have pity if thou have not love a noise without enter miss giggle sir albany odelove miss sidle and miss dawdle miss giggle my dear creature i immensely rejoice to find you do you know we have been at your house and could not meet with a creature that could give the least account of you your servants are all abroad ha ha ha they are certainly the worst servants in the world ha ha ha well but my dear have you done for we must have you with us we are going to one of the breakfasting places but we dont know which yet for they are all so immensely superb that i cannot touch my breakfast at home ha ha ha lord dear creature what makes you look so miserable your new thing isnt a tragedy is it   mrs hazard giggle i am astonished at you pray who are all these people you have brought upon me    miss giggle who are they my dear i will introduce you to them they are immensely agreeable all of them ha ha ha   mrs hazard lookee miss giggle if they are ever so immense they must not stay here for i am going to be immensely busy and will not be interrupted   miss giggle my dear creature as to leaving you it is not in the nature of things i would not go without you for the world sir albany odelove mrs hazard desires to be introduced to you madam this gentleman is immensely fond of the muses and therefore must be agreeable to you miss sidle miss dawdle introduces em   mrs hazard mr cross  i want to speak to you i shall run mad  aside   miss giggle lord witling what is the matter with mrs hazard she looks as if she could kill me   witling the matter with her ha ha ha why you have interrupted her rehearsal ah i could indulge such a laugh if you will join with me we shall have the finest scene in the world  she has made me sick to death with her stuff and i will be revenged you must know one of the actresses has disappointed her and she is going to sing her part herself so the moment she begins do you burst into a violent laugh we shall all join with you you may be sure and then you will see the consequence    miss giggle see nay i believe i shall feel the consequence for she will certainly beat us immensely oh i will tell you what let us set odelove upon her to enquire into the plot of her play  he will plague her to death for he is immensely foolish   witling well  that is an admirable thought  mum    miss giggle well but my dear mrs hazard dont let us interrupt you for we are all immensely fond of a rehearsal   miss dawdle yes so we are indeed madam immensely   witling so we are immensely catches her hand   miss dawdle lord dont paw one so mr witling    miss giggle and so this is the playhouse i will swear it is immensely pretty and all the music well if there was but a scene of green trees we might fancy ourselves at ranelagh ha ha ha   mrs hazard why really by the noise you make and the nonsense you talk i think you might lookee miss giggle i shall be very plain with you if you think it is possible for you to be quiet for half an hour i shall be glad of your company if not i must beg you would depart   sir albany why really what the lady says is very pathetic and consequental to the foregoing part of miss giggles behavior for when a person of parts as we are to suppose this lady to be is assassinated with incoherences it is such an aggravation to our intellects as does in fact require supernatural patience to acquiesce thereto   all ha ha ha   miss giggle very well sir albany i will remember you for this  no upon honor now i will be very good i will not interrupt you indeed will not speak another word  o la witling do you know miss lucy loveshuffle had such an immense ill run last night she bragged every thing that came into her hand and lost every thing she bragged  till she really looked as ugly as a fiend   witling i fancy you won then giggle for i never saw you look so well   mrs hazard nay as to that matter let giggle win or lose it will be pretty much the same thing with her beauty but come mr cross pray let us go on let me see i begin my recit   albany corydon    witling giggle i can tell you who is going to be married   miss sidle and miss dawdle oh lord who  pray tell us  witling the celebrated miss shrimp to lord lovelittle a man of very great fortune   miss dawdle really well then i think we none of us need to despair   witling come dont you be envious now for she is a charming girl and deserves her good fortune   miss giggle charming  nay then i shall never have done i am sure she is immensely little   sir albany oh fie miss that is nonsense horrid nonsense immensely little oh lord   witling why to be sure she is rather small that must be allowed she is certainly the least woman that ever was seen for nothing   sir albany madam as i was not so auspicious as to be here at the beginning of this affair will you give me leave to ask you a few questions    mrs cross madam if you will not go on the music and performers cannot possibly stay any longer   mrs hazard why what can i do mr cross you see how i am terrified with em   witling she begins to be in a fury  look at her giggle   sir albany i say madam will you give me leave as youre going to entertain the town that is i mean to endeavor or to attempt to entertain them for let me tell you fair lady it is not an easy thing to bring about if men who are properly graduated in learning who have swallowed the tincture of a polite education who as i may say are hand and glove with the classics if such geniuss as i am describing fail of success in dramatical occurrences or performances it is the same sense in the latin what must a poor lady expect who is ignorant as the dirt   mrs hazard pray sir how long have they let you out   sir albany therefore i hope you have had the advice of your male acquaintance who will take some care of your diction and see that you have observed that great beauty neglected by most dramatic authors of time and place   witling oh sir albany i will answer she has taken care of time and place for it will begin about half an hour after eight and be acted at drury lane theater  ha ha ha there is time and place for you   mrs hazard and so youre hand and glove with the classics are you why thou elaborate idiot how durst you venture to talk to any thing that is rational  consult my male acquaintance i thank my stars thou art not one of em where did you pick up this creature  what is his name  can you spell your own name you ugly brute   miss giggle oh lord it will never come to her singing   miss sidle pray madam will there be any dancing this morning   mrs hazard no  mr cross who let these people in i do assure you i shall complain to the managers  i have been so plagued there is no bearing it  i could tear these  i am unfit for any thing now  so the rehearsal must be put off till another morning   witling ay do  and let us go    mrs hazard go to    witling to ranelagh  i knew you would not name an ungenteel place   sir albany the lady has been somewhat underbred in her behavior to me but as i have a regard to the fair sex i would have some of you advise her to cry it will give relief to her passion   mrs hazard sir will you go out of this place   sir albany i protest madam i will directly exit   all ha ha ha   witling well but my dear creature you are not angry with me    mrs hazard indeed i am witling and very angry too i dont believe i shall ever speak to you again as for those things that run about littering the town and force themselves into all public places only to show their insignificance they are beneath my resentment  mr cross i will settle with you when i would have another rehearsal though i am not sure i ever will have another  i believe i shall tear it to pieces  pray let somebody see if my chairmen are there   witling shall i wait on you   mrs hazard no exit   witling well as sir paul says odsbud she is a passionate woman but her tearing it will only save the audience the trouble of doing it for her come ladies will you go i will see you to your coach   mr cross as the ladies have been disappointed of mrs hazards rehearsal if they please to stay we are going to practice a new dance   all oh by all means   a dance finis
