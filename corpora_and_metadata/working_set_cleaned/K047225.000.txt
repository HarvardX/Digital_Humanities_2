two letters on the conduct of our domestic parties with regard to french politics including observations on the conduct of the minority in the session of mdccxciii  by the late right hon edmund burke  london printed for f and c rivington no    st pauls church yard sold also by j hatchard piccadilly       preface the general scope of the following publication has been already intimated in the preface to a former collection of posthumous tracts by the same illustrious author it carries forward the series of mr burkes opinions relative to our domestic parties from the appeal to the old whigs in      which is contained in the quarto edition of his works to the letter which he published in      on occasion of the attack made upon him by the duke of bedford  the principal piece indeed in magnitude certainly though perhaps not in temporary interest the principal is not altogether new the observations on the conduct of the minority in the session of      were surreptitiously printed at the beginning of the present year but as it usually happens with such frauds in a very mangled state under a false title and without the real letter to the duke of portland which should have been prefixed  the paper itself was of the most private kind it was not intended to come at any time and under any circumstances to the view of the public mr burke wrote it as his justification to the two noble heads of his party for seeming to take he did not in reality take a different side from them when he acted on their own principles with more prompt and vigorous decision than they believed their duty at that time required them to do he was sensible that in its style it was not wholly free from the influence of resentment though such as he deliberately believed to be just he knew that the sharpness of his first impressions was visible on it but he knew also to whom it was to be confided he was to be judged by two of the most candid minds which the earth ever bore men who through the whole course of his political life had given him indubitable proofs of an unbounded affection trust and veneration nor was the paper to be seen by them till a moment of compulsory reflection when it could not operate to the injury of any man and would find in their bosoms something congenial with his feelings when he wrote it clearly foreseeing that the dissimilarity of their views must ultimately force them to a separation from mr fox he deposited it with the elder of his noble friends desiring that it might not be opened till after that event of this confidential memorial he never had a second copy made but he did keep a copy of the letter which accompanied it to the duke of portland as a short summary containing all the principle and general sentiment without the necessarily invidious details of his other more solemn protest  about two years after he casually learned from a friend that the rough draft of the observations still existed in the hands of the person whom he had employed to transcribe it he immediately expressed the greatest anxiety to get it back it was accordingly surrendered with an assurance that no copy of it had been taken and was immediately destroyed a copy however has since been published in the manner above related by the very person who gave that assurance  what mr burke felt on receiving intelligence of the injury thus done him by one from whom his kindness deserved a very different return will be best conveyed in his own words the following is an extract of a letter to a friend which he dictated on this subject from a sickbed the rest of the letter entirely relates to a lawsuit which he was then carrying on to obtain redress against another kindred fraud  bath    th feb      my dear  on the appearance of the advertisement all newspapers and all letters have been kept back from me till this time mrs burke opened yours and finding that all the measures in the power of dr king yourself and mr woodford had been taken to suppress the publication she ventured to deliver me the letters of today which were read to me in my bed about two oclock  this affair does vex me but i am not in a state of health at present to be deeply vexed at any thing wherever this matter comes into discussion i authorize you to contradict the infamous reports which i am informed have been given out that this paper had been circulated through the ministry and was intended gradually to slide into the press to the best of my recollection i never had a clean copy of it but one which is now in my possession i never communicated that but to the duke of portland from whom i had it back again but the duke will set this matter to rights if in reality there were two copies and he has one i never showed it as they know to any one of the ministry if the duke has really a copy i believe his and mine are the only ones that exist except what was taken by fraud from loose and incorrect papers by s to whom i gave the letter to copy as soon as i began to suspect him capable of any such scandalous breach of trust you know with what anxiety i got the loose papers out of his hands not having reason to think that he kept any other neither do i believe in fact unless he meditated this villainy long ago that he did or does now possess any clean copy i never communicated that paper to any out of the very small circle of those private friends from whom i concealed nothing  but i beg you and my friends to be cautious how you let it be understood that i disclaim any thing but the mere act and intention of publication i do not retract any one of the sentiments contained in that memorial which was and is my justification addressed to the friends for whose use alone i intended it had i designed it for the public i should have been more exact and full it was written in a tone of indignation in consequence of the resolutions of the whig club which were directly pointed against myself and others and occasioned our secession from that club which is the last act of my life that i shall under any circumstances repent many temperaments and explanations there would have been if ever i had a notion that it should meet the public eye   the moral sense of mankind on this occasion ran along with the authority of the law in endeavoring to defeat the mercenary speculations of so aggravated a fraud yet not less than three thousand copies of the pamphlet are supposed to have been sold in the three kingdoms it was reprinted both in scotland and ireland retailed and commented upon in newspapers noticed in reviews and quoted in the house of commons as mr burkes the very injunction which issued against it from the court of chancery authenticated it mr burke himself whenever he was asked as he frequently was at bath constantly gave in substance the explanation which is contained in the foregoing letter in this account indeed there was one trifling mistake the single fair copy which he had received back from the duke of portland was not in his own possession it was where it still remains in the hands of his other noble friend to whom it was jointly addressed probably he afterward recollected the circumstance as at his leisure he corrected with his own hand one of the printed copies but no essential change of any kind could now be made the mischief which had been done in a single day by the dishonesty of one man was irreparable  had it been possible to have let the paper sleep in total silence the friends of the author might have hesitated to give a genuine edition but no man in the least acquainted with the literary history of this century or even of our own times could for a moment entertain any such hope after the lapse of years sometimes inquisitive malice sometimes officious zeal in this instance the cold pedantry of poring curiosity in that case the imaginary triumph of discovering some hidden value in things which others had passed over with neglect have brought again to light productions which had dropped without a name from the press which had never excited general attention and which the mature judgment of the writers had wished for ever to abandon how then could it be supposed that a tract avowed to be mr burkes at the period of his proudest eminence which had circulated so widely and in itself abounded with historical matter would not be received with all its imperfections on its head into future collections of his works nothing remained therefore but to publish it in a less mutilated form to restore the true title which had been malignantly falsified and to add the introductory letter which if it had originally been given might have repressed some of the murmurs distinguishable in the halfstifled cry that was beginning to rise on the appearance of the spurious edition  the second piece in this publication though it has never hitherto been in print was written with a view to the press it was occasioned by a speech of a noble duke on the  th of may      in the debate on the recall of lord fitzwilliam it is in the epistolary form and is addressed to a gentleman of whom mr burke always justly entertained a very high opinion and whose merit has since recommended him honorably for himself and beneficially it is hoped for the service of the empire to an important situation in the sister kingdom from an answer of the most flowing gaiety to the attack which had been made upon him he passes to the exultations of the republican faction over him on account of the king of prussias defection from the common cause whom he treats himself with severe pleasantry and dignified ridicule he then proceeds more seriously to complain of the difficulties imposed by governments and the higher orders of society on all who disinterestedly struggle to support defend and save them amidst the perils of the present crisis he exhibits a beautiful picture of the state of europe the day before the revolution in france in a sublime strain of morality he developes the pure and exalted motives of his own actions and avows his despair of our safety from either of the two great parties which domineer in the councils and divide the opinions of the nation nothing perhaps that ever came from his pen would have placed him personally in a more elevated point of view but his own individual glory was ever the least of his cares the speech which gave rise to it having been soon forgotten this letter was suppressed and it may not be impertinent to remark that the same had nearly been the fate of the eloquent performance which he published the following year on a similar provocation from the duke of bedford he had determined to have forty copies only taken for his own use and the press broken up when lord lauderdale by a notice in the house of peers revived the subject of the grants which his sovereign had been graciously pleased to confer upon mr burke in reward of his long laborious and splendid services  his rupture with the minority which till the session of      was never considered on his part as final and irreconcilable drew down upon him much obloquy and reproach he was loudly charged with a dereliction of all his public principles with infidelity to his party and with a violation of private friendship on the other hand for the dissatisfaction which he early intimated and which he began from      more decidedly to entertain at the measures of government he has not escaped the imputation of ingratitude these are heavy accusations though all do not press with equal weight upon his memory it is the first praise of moral wisdom to know the just time and place of each respective virtue the best motives of human actions may lose not only their proper grace but their very nature they may become crimes if they are not such as are suited to the occasion happily for the infirmity of our kind in most cases the choice is simple it is between positive right and positive wrong there are situations however and the present is a season full of them which make it necessary for us to distinguish more nicely which leave us only an alternative of difficulties between evil and evil and a painful choice among conflicting virtues in free states the union of public men in a common cause cannot be too much respected and cherished for without the combined efforts of many who think alike of the commonwealth the purest and best public principles can seldom if ever prevail we should endeavor to strengthen public connection by private friendship for without the cohesion of that attraction without the charm of that endearment which winds itself round the heart the bond of party would be found sometimes a loose and weak sometimes a fretting and galling tie neither is it to be doubted that we owe a liberal attachment and support to the power of those from whom we have consented to accept benefits and by whom on the surest evidence of our own experience if we mean not to confess ourselves utterly unworthy we must believe that power to be well and laudably exercised to gratitude to friendship to party we ought cheerfully to yield every inferior opinion on every collateral and subordinate question within those limits they have lawful dominion but to require that to them we should surrender our deliberate judgment and settled conviction on a system of fundamental policy which involves the leading interests the safety or the honor of our country what is it but in the name of virtue to preach up conspiracy and corruption all the other social charities are swallowed up and lost in the comprehensive relation of our country for her they exist by her we are protected in the enjoyment of them to her they ought on grave and conscientious reasons to be sacrificed her danger may call upon us to do what touches us still more nearly it may be our duty to review perhaps to remodel our very principles new and unforeseen circumstances may teach us the error of conclusions which were formed with sufficient accuracy for general application to ordinary times consistency however is the first and strongest presumption both of integrity and wisdom sudden and great changes in the system of thinking and acting shake the character of the man to the foundation he who has broken with all his public and private friends may have been uniformly right he is at issue with them on equal terms before his country the world and posterity there is only their authority against his and authority is not estimated by mere numbers but he who is avowedly inconsistent puts himself at once on his defense and sets out with an admission against himself  mr burke so felt it strip him of his consistency said he speaking of himself in his appeal and you leave him naked indeed it was to the charge on that particular head that he more distinctly applied his answer yet professing to adduce only some few among many of his former declarations which he thought in unison with his view of the french revolution the perfect and perhaps singular consistency of his character can only be fully known when the public shall have before them the documents of his most secret motives and confidential counsels which during a very important epoch from the year      to the end of the american war have been fortunately discovered more entire than his friends had dared to hope for the present it will be sufficient to give a slight outline of some passages in his political life and of his early principles as introductory to the particular occasions of the pieces which are comprised in this publication this will incidentally afford some test of all the charges  nine and twenty years of an existence not prolonged to a very advanced age he devoted with unremitting zeal to the service of his country during all that period he never acted but with one party which he always believed to be in all its superior members the purest that our history can show when he came a new man among them he at once proved himself worthy of their confidence he declined taking any salary for his employment under lord rockingham as secretary to the first lord of the treasury and at his own cost he obtained a seat in parliament to defend their measures chance first led him to that connection but when it was soon after dissolved he entered into it a second time from choice even against the affectionate remonstrances of some of the leaders in it who pressed him to follow without regard to them the easy path which his great reputation had already opened before him to power and fortune  the sacrifices which he made to that connection are little known he never boasted of them nor voluntarily suffered any friend of his to blazon them he regarded them but as ordinary acts of duty indeed though not insensible to sober and judicious praise he was so abhorrent from that artificial fame which is made and unmade at pleasure in our popular journals that he shunned the most distant appearance of being gratified by it with scrupulous solicitude he restrained all over whom he had any influence even from refuting the absurd calumnies of which he was perpetually the object his old master companion and friend for he was all these did not go without a reprimand from him for revealing with some degree of innocent pride the real place of his education in contradiction to the silly tale of his having been bred in france he was daily vilified as an obscure and needy adventurer yet he did not tell what he had in his hands the means of substantiating that he was sprung from a family anciently ennobled in several of its branches and possessing an ample estate which his grandfather had actually enjoyed nor that he had himself sunk a handsome competency in his adherence to his party once and but once in debate he was provoked to declare his private circumstances it was in answer to a coarse aggression he said that by the death of a brother whom he loved and lamented he had succeeded to upwards of l 0000 part of which he had spent and the rest then remained to be spent in the independent support of his principles in truth without a single personal extravagance he did spend that and considerably more of his own chiefly derived from a source which cicero esteemed the most honorable to himself the last remembrances of dying friendship this was not on his part a speculation from which he had formed hopes that deceived him he repeatedly proclaimed to the world that he knew the road which he had taken was not the way to preferment  the advantages which offered themselves he was not eager to improve when he might with unfullied honor early in his opposition to lord north the ruling directors of the east india company wishing to stop a popular cry and to take from government the best plea for intermeddling in their affairs proposed to send mr burke on his own terms at the head of a commission to reform the abuses of the east some of the correspondence on this occasion is still extant he resolved not to go actually refused the appointment and then not before acquainted lord rockingham with his determination at several subsequent junctures he might readily have commanded in other arrangements much higher situations than he ever held or expected to hold with his own party the only office which he ever did hold he took with the intention of reforming under the old constitution of that office every paymastergeneral was necessarily for a time the defaulter of unaccounted millions he could not be admitted however ready to make up his accounts till those of all his predecessors had been closed and he was obliged to have in his hands large advances to answer the drafts of the inferior paymasters mr burke from the circumstances of the period when he came into his office had he kept it on its old footing might have been rich in the public money he might with certainty and safety have realized and it was actually suggested to him how he might fairly realize more than the value many times told of all the grants which he ultimately received from the royal bounty but by a law of which he was the author and which has since been imitated in the payment of the navy he changed the mode of the office and when he resigned it closed his accounts  on some of the occasions above related he resisted the temptations not of avarice only but of ambition a passion much more difficult for a statesman to subdue how exempt he was from the latter vice he still more clearly showed in another instance from what he thought his duty and for the general good of his party he declined a station which he might have been most expected to covet on the death of mr dowdeswell he was pressed to become the leader of his friends in the house of commons but he would not consent it was his systematick opinion that before any man should aspire so high he ought to have cast his root more broadly and driven it more deeply than he had himself then done into the soil of the country posterity may lament his virtuous delicacy  mr fox at that period generally voted on the same side but was not yet directly connected with the party of lord rockingham he had from his childhood been acquainted with mr burke and from his entrance into parliament had cultivated a close intimacy with him even while for years he was one of his most formidable antagonists in public debate their friendship was of course increased by acting together in opposition though in that situation for years mr fox kept himself open for any other political engagement and was not considered as actually a member of the same party with his friend mr burke never urged him to become so he fairly represented to him as he constantly did to others that he had little hope of success he never gave any man advice to act contrary to his interests but stating those for the consideration of the person himself he laid before him all the facts and the principles on which he might form his own decision in this manner he certainly did prepare the mind of mr fox to join the party and the minds of the party to receive mr fox and place him at their head an event in which when it happened no man more sincerely rejoiced  the principles on which mr burke supported the party wherein he spent his life are not left to be collected from detached sentences in his various productions or casual phrases dropped in debate and ill preserved by memories on which if even the intentions of the reporters were always upright little reliance could be placed in a question of any delicacy they were early recorded by himself at large and in a body he found the whig party under lord rockingham when they were compelled to set up a methodized opposition to be indeed men of sentiments eminently good and just yet what they felt rightly they had not deduced systematically they were new to their situation it was necessary however in erecting their standard to publish their declaration to their country the task of preparing it was undertaken by mr burke and in    0 executed by him in a pamphlet called thoughts on the causes of the present discontents the materials of it were collected from various conversations with all the leading members of the party and before it was sent abroad into the world the particular and distinct approbation of each was obtained from this he should be judged if he is to be fairly tried for inconsistency but among all his works the pamphlet of    0 has been least quoted if at all it certainly does not contain any tenets of democracy the clear object of the whole is to recommend as the best practical government for this country an open aristocracy of rank property virtue and talents acting in concert together on a known and avowed system of opinions agreeable to the existing constitution of the kingdom acquiring by their principles and conduct the public confidence of the people and in all those titles claiming the public confidence of the sovereign  none of his writings on the french revolution were ever pursued with a more violent cry than was that pamphlet by the republicans of the day but they were then of little comparative strength in numbers or influence by one writer his book was called an imposition on the public and a scheme calculated to perpetuate our distresses he was the organ of a discontented faction and the mask of patriotism dropped while he was writing another wondered at the corruptness of his heart and the deception of his head and in language similar to that of the writer just quoted described the pamphlet as designed to guard against the possible consequence of an effectual reformation in the vitiated parts of our constitution and government what sort of reform it was to which mr burke on that occasion was supposed to be an enemy may be collected from the great principle which is laid down by this adversary in the spirit and almost in the very words of the revolutionists in france it is said that the modes of government which have ever been imposed on credulous man have been not only deficient in producing the just ends of government viz the full and impartial security of the rights of nature but also have been rather formidable and dangerous cabals against the peace happiness and dignity of society in tracing the origin of all governments it is added a little lower down we find them either the produce of lawless power or accident acted on by corrupt interest the same circumstance that attends the formation of governments attends what is called their reformation and of this the history of our own country affords a melancholy example mr paines two parts of the rights of man are but a paraphrase of these texts  mr burke and his friends at that time never denied that it was their purpose to resist with all their might the effectual reformations there suggested and to support the melancholy example afforded by the settlement of our own revolution in the last century they always gloried in the accusation to convict such of them as yet remain before any impartial tribunal on a charge of inconsistency in not depreciating that example and not admiring those effectual reformations now will require more than declamation for argument and mutilated fragments for evidence against them indeed an author who is by no means deficient in severity against mr burke but who appears to be well read in his works drawing a parallel between his conduct and that of mr fox has very justly and heartily acquitted mr burke from this charge he represents the thoughts on the causes of the present discontents as a creed of aristocracy and the fault which he finds with the framer of that creed is not that he had swerved from it but that he had neglected the progress of the human mind subsequent to its adoption  the principles however which led mr burke to condemn the french revolution are to be traced to a much more distant date and long before he became a public man they are to be discerned in his first acknowledged production the vindication of natural society this was an ironical exposure of lord bolinbrokes false philosophy his cause of quarrel was the mischievous tendency of the principles insinuated by that lively but disingenuous writer who in his opinion sapped the foundation of every virtue and all government while he attacked every mode of religion the followers of that school were then chiefly if not wholly confined to the higher classes and he wished to warn them in time of the dangers which they incurred and which in other countries have since actually fallen upon them from the use that might be made of their own arms in the hands of others his design as he himself explained it was to show that without the exertion of any considerable forces the same engines which were employed for the destruction of religion might be employed with equal success for the subversion of government and that specious arguments might be used against those things which they who doubted of every thing else would at that period never permit to be questioned accordingly the vindication of natural society consists wholly in touching with vivacity on a number of commonplace topics from the abuses incident to or rather from the evils suffered under all the several forms of political society with an intimation that our own mixed constitution could no more stand this test than the simple forms copying the accustomed fallacy of the noble author whom he personated he declined giving any system of his own well aware as he was even then how much more easy it was in the scheme of that philosophy to demolish than to rebuild he urged these sophistries then as too futile to be taken for any thing but ridicule yet they have since been gravely produced as wonderful discoveries he thought them sufficient to startle the disciples of lord bolingbroke in that day but the french who profess to have taken that noble philosopher as one of their masters have gone the whole length in a desperate experiment on a great kingdom and mr burke in his last labors was only waging with more serious vigor the same war in which with lighter weapons he made the first essay of his juvenile strength nor is it possible to pass over without notice in the preface which discloses the real intention of that tract a beautiful strain of the same pious humility which characterized his wisdom to the last moment of his life he expresses himself satisfied that a mind which has no restraint from a sense of its own weakness of its subordinate rank in the creation and of the extreme danger of letting the imagination loose upon some subjects may very plausibly attack every thing the most excellent and venerable even in matters adds he which are as it were just within our reach what would become of the world if the practice of all moral duties and the foundations of society rested upon having their reasons made clear and demonstrative to every individual  this fixed persuasion of his youth as to the pernicious effects of the new philosophy was many years after confirmed when he was at paris not long before the accession of louis the xvith he was courted and caressed as a man of eminence by the literary cabal which was then preparing the way for the overthrow of altars and thrones they daily beset him and communicated to him enough to let a mind so observant as his into all their secrets from that time he always dated those impressions which made him foresee in their first rudiments the hideous consequences of the doctrines propagated and the measures pursued by the pretended national assembly of france not long after his return from paris he took occasion in the house of commons to testify those impressions in a speech of which no satisfactory report was ever given but which was taken in shorthand and of which a copy remains corrected by himself he pointed out the conspiracy of atheism to the watchful jealousy of governments he professed that he was not overfond of calling in the aid of the secular arm to suppress doctrines and opinions but if ever it was to be raised it should be against those enemies of their kind who would take from us the noblest prerogative of our nature that of being a religious animal  already continued he under the systematick attacks of those men i see many of the props of good government beginning to fail i see propagated principles which will not leave to religion even a toleration and make virtue her self less than a name he recommended that a grand alliance should be formed among all believers  against those ministers of rebellious darkness who were endeavoring to shake all the works of god established in beauty and order  with a mind thus long before prepared he could not be slow in forming his notions of the french revolution nevertheless he sought information from every quarter as if the subject had been wholly new to him he desired all persons of his acquaintance who were going to paris and curiosity attracted many to bring him whatever they could collect of the greatest circulation both on the one side and the other he had also many correspondents not only among the english and americans residing there but also among the natives to whom as well as to other foreigners he had always done the honors of this country as far as his means would permit him with liberal hospitality among others he received letters endeavoring to trick out the events of the revolution in the most gaudy coloring from mr pain mr christie and baron cloots afterward better known by the name of anacharsis it was in answer to a letter of this kind from a french gentleman that he wrote his celebrated reflections  while he was employed upon that work in the beginning of the year    0 the praise bestowed by mr fox on the behavior of the french guards in taking part with the populace first induced him to deliver his sentiments on that subject in the house of commons the circumstances of that debate and the noble deportment of mr fox who professed himself to have learned more from mr burke than from all men and all books put together and who aften having heard his friends speech declared that there was there could be no difference in their principles however they might differ in their application of the same principles cannot but be too well remembered to need repetition in consequence of what then passed the reflections were considerably enlarged from the first sketch of them and still further additions were successively made as the plot of the conspirators in france daily more and more unfolded itself in all it is parts the book was published in the following autumn and mr burke had the satisfaction of receiving explicit testimonies of concurrence and applause from the principal members of the party with whom he had begun his political career  having given this solemn warning to his country and to europe he in no way brought the subject again before the public till mr fox and mr sheridan the next year in three successive debates introduced the praises of the french revolution on the last of these occasions mr burke immediately rose to answer mr fox but was prevented it was then three in the morning by a loud cry for the question he afterward took the first opportunity which he thought regular and most favorable to his situation unsupported as he was to attempt a discussion of the principle he was however repeatedly interrupted the debate at length was forced into a personal contention between him and mr fox the scene altogether was of the most afflicting kind  having found himself on that night alone opposed to a host of enemies he considered himself as absolved from every obligation of party he made his appeal as he called it from the new to the old whigs from the declamations of his contemporaries in debate to the recorded doctrines of the great actors in our revolution affirmed by both houses of parliament on an important trial projected and prosecuted to that very end he knew indeed that many of those whom he had left entertained in their hearts the same sentiments with himself but till they should have publicly and explicitly avowed themselves so that he could consistently and honorably act with them he regarded himself as a mere individual member of parliament conscientiously pursuing what the discipline of his early studies the observation of his more mature years and his recent examination of the event so long anticipated by him had firmly persuaded him to be right he did not seek to engage himself with any other party it was not till some months after that he first saw mr pit in private society since the latter had been placed at the head of administration  toward the close of the year      a private friend of mr burkes connected with ministry first made him acquainted with the residence of mr adair at the court of st petersburgh and with the circumstance of a letter having been intercepted from that gentleman to mr fox which was represented to be of a very criminal complexion the whole proceeding was in it is very essence contrary to mr burkes notions of propriety and duty he manifested this in his own conduct when his son went to coblentz in that very summer he thought it necessary to obtain the approbation of government when too about the same time the empress of russia had written him a very gracious letter on some of his publications and he had prepared an answer intended to confirm that sovereign in the warm interest which she then appeared to take in what he thought the common cause of europe he conceived himself bound to communicate it to ministers he did so and in consequence of some doubts which they entertained just doubts as subsequent events have shown he consented to suppress it with these sentiments he was sincerely distressed at the intelligence which he received respecting mr adair the more so as it was intimated to him that some serious measures were in contemplation on that subject mr fox himself afterward told him that he did expect some motion of that description to be brought before the house mr burke in consequence purposely absented himself from the debate unable to defend and unwilling to join in accusing a man for whom he still cherished the memory of past friendship the subject in truth was never agitated he had therefore no opportunity of checking the account which he had received but when the spurious edition of his private memorial to the duke of portland came forth he watched the public prints with some attention looking for an explanation which was promised had any been given which might have satisfied his mind it is believed that he meant to have corrected any error of fact on the principle of his censure he was not to be shaken  the formation of the society calling itself the friends of the people on the one side and the kings proclamation against seditious writings on the other brought mr burke in      once more into contact with some of his old friends by whom the former measure was condemned and the latter supported after the retreat of the king of prussia out of france thinking that the state of this country and of europe demanded the united efforts of all public men he made an attempt again to collect around him such of them as saw in the same light with himself the danger which menaced the whole social and moral order of the world in one of these consultations he expressed the warmest regard for mr fox his regret for the difference between them and his eager desire that all consideration of himself should be laid aside if mr fox could be won to the true interests and service of his country he said that if an objection personal to himself could possibly lurk in the heart of any one which might make him stand in the way of such a broad and extensive settlement as that alarming crisis demanded besides freely abandoning any pretensions of his own he was ready to go out of the kingdom and to render himself a voluntary exile the earnest manner in which he uttered this effusion was felt and is still remembered by those who were present and they who best knew him are satisfied that he would have executed if necessary what he then proposed at the same period too and indeed at all times in all his occasional intercourse with ministers he labored nothing more than to dispose them in whatever arrangement they might project for strengthening government above all things to include mr fox with him it was mr burkes opinion that the safety of europe might have been reasonably hoped without him that it ought to be attempted but mr fox persisted in the course on which he had already entered and the great body of those who dissented from him could not at once bring themselves to break through their long habits of confidence in him so as to act steadily against his counsels  at the opening of the next session of parliament the minister had vacated his seat from his absence the spirit and vigor of opposition seemed to rise and on the side of government there was more room and more necessity for individuals to stand forward in the contest under these circumstances mr burke was the principal person to whose sentiments the nation looked on the questions of that day in the first debate he employed toward mr fox a tone of friendly remonstrance unmixed with any thing of asperity afterward in one of the passages of the house of commons he accidentally met mr fox who taking him by the hand told him that he would do more in that way than in any other but on the two following days the purport of mr foxs repeated motions and the vehemence of his manner which is impetuous even where there is nothing violent in the matter made it impracticable as mr burke said to preserve a similar style of conciliation he was conscious that he kindled as on the other side the discussions grew more and more enflamed or produced a more intense sensation from the continued action of the same heat his feelings on the occasion will be seen in his observations on the proceedings of that session from that moment he saw and he saw with pain that the die was cast for ever  mr burke was by no means singular in receiving the impression which he did from the conduct of mr fox the current of popular opinion set strongly against the latter he soon became sensible that his constituents in general disapproved what he had done and that even among those whose partiality to him was most conspicuous there were many who when he was attacked on that score professed themselves neither able nor willing to defend him in consequence he felt himself obliged not only to sign a loyal association of his own parish contrary to his own avowed opinion as mr burke has remarked but also to explain his principles and measures in a printed letter to his constituents  this publication was soon taken up by the most zealous supporters of mr fox in the whig club a society which had been founded chiefly with a view to embody strengthen and extend his personal interest in westminster though not wholly without regard also to the general principles and the political success of the party to which he belonged at the monthly meeting of february a vote of thanks to him for his late conduct was moved but withdrawn at his own desire he did not conceal that as many of his friends whom he most respected were known to differ in sentiments from him such a vote must inevitably tend to disunion and that it was in itself unnecessary as even his enemies did not charge him with bad motives his discretion however on this occasion as in some other memorable instances was unable to control the zeal of those who call themselves his friends and who avowing his elevation to power to be the first aim of all their politics seem always to treat him as incapable of choosing for himself or as speaking a language of management foreign to the heart they doubt either his judgment or his sincerity they think that they can do him no greater service than by plunging where they trust that in any event he will follow because he cannot desert those who profess to sacrifice every thing for him in this spirit notwithstanding his dissuasion of the step as both unnecessary and mischievous on the very same day a requisition was made and the next day advertised in the public papers for the holding of an extraordinary meeting the purpose of which was to consider of voting the approbation and thanks of the club to mr fox for the principles and arguments of his letter to his constituents  the prudent part even of those who agreed with mr fox looked forward to the motion with alarm it was not their inclination it was not their policy to precipitate a breach they would be left in the hands of those whom they had already found themselves unable to govern and the separation of others in whose public virtue and integrity soberminded men most confided would give their enemies a decisive advantage over them especially in what they knew to be a moment of unpopularity the authority of those who should secede would of course be wrested into evidence against those who should remain and would be used to lend a color to the worst constructions of their motives they could not stop what they dreaded they tried therefore to negociate a compromise they brought some of the more violent to something of apparent moderation on the other side they urged all the considerations which they professed to have determined themselves and they put it to the friendship to the justice to the candor of those whom they addressed whether they could directly or indirectly sanction what were called the calumnies malevolently spread against a man to whom all declared a warm affection the two noble chiefs of the party who were convinced with mr burke how much depended on gaining mr fox to the common cause of all established order but who had not yet with mr burke despaired of gaining him consented at last to acquiesce silently in some general contradiction of the asserted calumnies accordingly when the day of the meeting came as the understood price of their continuance in the society they were not then present a new motion was substituted for that which had been advertised but it was exactly what every attempt at comprehending opposite sentiments must ever be vague loose ambiguous admitting any future interpretation it did not at all ascertain as it should have done what were the misrepresentations and by whom employed which were so very injurious to mr fox as to make this declaration necessary now which he himself so short a time before had pronounced and shown to be unnecessary in proposing the amended resolve the chairman lord william russell spoke of it as virtually the same with that which it had superseded and only intended to supply what was there thought deficient by adding a disapprobation of the calumnies propagated against mr fox to the approbation of his principles and arguments of course it passed unanimously mr burke has abbreviated it but at full length it ran that the whig club think it their duty at this extraordinary juncture to assure the right hon charles james fox that all the arts of misrepresentation which have been so industriously used of late for the purpose of calumniating him have had no other effect upon them than that of confirming strengthening and increasing their attachment to him  when this resolution was made public many gentlemen quitted the club for which they stated their reasons in a letter signed by all of them but one they expressed great personal respect for mr fox but combining all the circumstances they could not construe the vote otherwise than as approving without qualification what had been done by mr fox in that session they did not agree in that approval and they could not come to the conclusion that their attachment to him was increased mr burke was in the number of the seceders but had no concern in drawing up the letter the first movers of the whole business congratulated themselves upon the event as upon a victory it was trumpeted about by the runners of the party as a decision though in reality it was nothing less than a decision of mr burkes two noble friends against his opinions and his speeches in parliament were plainly enough intimated to have been the misrepresentations by which mr fox was supposed to have been calumniated  the secession gave rise for a short time to the appearance of a third party with which mr burke might have acted in full conformity with all his principles he might have placed himself at the head of it and had he been an interested or an ambitious man he might easily have stepped from that eminence into a station which good men wished to see him fill and which his enemies for the purpose of maligning his motives more than once falsely reported that he actually had accepted but he still kept aloof from every new connection he contented himself with drawing up at the intervals which his occupation in the impeachment of mr hastings afforded him those observations which he afterward sent to the duke of portland on the conduct of the minority in that session this he thought necessary from the proceedings of the whig club and still more from the subsequent construction put upon them his motives and his objects in writing this paper are affectingly stated in the letter which accompanied it to his noble friend  having thus lodged his testamentary protest he waited with impatience for his dismission from public life for some time past nothing had detained him in parliament but the sacred duty which he felt of struggling to the last for the coercion and punishment of what he most unfeignedly and steadfastly believed to be the flagrant enormities of the east the coldblooded tyranny of avarice which oppressed millions of the innocent natives and the baneful corruptions which spreading thence threatened to infect and poison the whole body of this realm having no personal inducement whatever bold as have been the falsehoods to the contrary he had never sought that herculean labor when the select committee of which he was so efficient a member and in which all that followed had its origin was first appointed in the administration of lord north it is well known to many that he very reluctantly and not without much importunity of his friends accepted the honor of being put on the list for the ballot he too well foresaw how obstinate and perilous a combat he was to wage in refusing so long before the commission to reform abuses in bengal one of his reasons had been a suspicion that the company did not sincerely desire any radical reform he had seen a faction of their servants for years baffle a majority of the directors supported by the minister lord north and he was not ignorant how much every year had increased the strength of that faction but from the moment that he undertook the enquiry he determined that nothing should divert him from carrying it as far as it depended upon him to its proper and legitimate conclusion while a public clamor was raised about the delay of the impeachment and he was reproached as the cause of it he was in reality discharging an irksome trust that alone retarded the execution of all the plans to which he had long looked for the repose and comfort of his declining age at length having finished his task toward the close of the session in      he received the thanks of the house for his management of their prosecution  at the same time his exertions in the only other public business to which he had for a long time past attended obtained the sanction of both houses of parliament the plot for the overthrow of our constitution on which he had given the first alarm had now gained so much head as to force itself on the attention of the legislature a secret committee of the lords and another of the commons severally made reports on which the most serious proceedings were afterward grounded men of ingenious minds and practiced skill in the arts of popular eloquence may dispute and what may they not dispute the precise extent of legal criminality which may have attached to the actual conduct of the persons then put on their trials for high treason but no man of common apprehension and common honesty can read the evidence there adduced and say that no plot at all of the nature so often charged by mr burke existed and grew and was spreading itself rapidly over the country  the debates on these reports of the secret committee effected at length what the example and arguments of mr burke had failed to accomplish the principles of the opposition party were brought to the test on a fundamental question of domestic policy and from that time the separation between them and the noble friends of mr burke was complete the latter soon after formed a junction with administration a measure of which mr burke has been erroneously supposed the author but of which in fact he knew nothing till it was actually settled not indeed in all the particular details but in the general outline  in the midst of the negotiation mr burke vacated his seat it was generally expected by the nation and even called for in a very handsome manner by some members of the minority that such a public provision should be made for him as would afford ease and dignity to his retirement nor were ministers wanting in the contest of generosity they voluntarily acquainted some of his friends with their intentions of advising the king to bestow upon him an affluent income and the honor of the peerage not as a mark of favor in a new arrangement of power but as a debt strictly due to him from his country  every thing beyond what he had ever suffered himself to indulge to his desires seemed now to be within his reach and he had only to enjoy the retreat which he had laid out in prospect on the same system of moral duty that governed all the deliberate acts of his life when his son in whom every thing centered and whom he had just seen elected into that assembly which he had himself so long delighted instructed and adorned was unexpectedly snatched from him for ever from that day he thought only of preparing for his own departure with decency and in quiet by satisfying all just demands upon him he received therefore with gratitude the munificence of his sovereign in the pension which was settled on himself and mrs burke soon after their common misfortune accompanied with a gracious intimation that still more was intended but from the death of his son except on his part to withdraw his claims no mention was made of the first and highest reward which for the sake of that son alone had ever been a transient object of his ambition to the memory of the child whom he so tenderly loved and who by his filial piety repaid as by his other virtues and talents he justified that love he has rendered an elegant tribute of affectionate praise in the letter which he published on the duke of bedfords speech and in that now first published on the speech of another noble duke will be found two passages perhaps still more interesting because more simple when his sorrow was more fresh  his grief was undoubtedly strong and deep but it was never of that excessive kind which was weakly perhaps wickedly reported it never relaxed the vigor of his mind whatever subject called upon him to exert it nor the interest which he took to the last moment in the public weal a country he said not many months before his death which has been dear to us from our birth ought to be dear to us from our entrance into the stage to our final exit from the stage upon which we have been appointed to act he found however as was natural a superior pleasure in those subjects which were mingled up with the remembrance of his son his attention therefore was particularly excited by the nomination of earl fitzwilliam to the government of ireland a nobleman with whom he had not only a long and cordial friendship but under whose immediate auspices his son was to have commenced his public career and who was going to a scene of action in which that son had lately distinguished himself as agent for the roman catholics of that kingdom his own sentiments on the political expediency of granting relief to that great body which with the best dispositions to monarchy and to the reigning monarch from whom they know the first mitigation of their condition to have directly come contains more than threefourths of the whole population of ireland are well known from several publications of his on that question he would have raised them finally but by due degrees to the level of other dissenters from the established church too many of whom are much less friendly to the constitution of their country  the leading principle of lord fitzwilliams administration was to convert that which is now our weakness into our most efficient strength he wished to unite as far as possible the affections of all classes the pride of the higher orders he would have flattered by cherishing among them what had most resemblance of a countryparty in subordination to the enlarged interests of the british empire he would have subdued faction and conspiracy by conciliating the great mass of the people and far from employing so large a part of our own natural force in defeating the attempts of domestic rebellion and foreign invasion in that quarter he would have made that island a place of arms from whence if the vigor of our counsels had risen to meet the exigencies of our situation we might have poured forth unexhausted armies of a brave and loyal nation to the succor of our best and most meritorious allies in france the experiment was not fully tried but as far as it went every appearance indicated success those public men who certainly then enjoyed the greatest share of popular favor stood forth in the support of government and the war never was the parliament of that country so unanimous never were such large supplies voted and without a murmur never did a governor receive such incontrovertible proofs of public love and veneration in the addresses of all ranks all civil descriptions all religious persuasions even after that which in other cases would have been called disgrace into the immediate merits of his recall as the question was put mr burke would never enter he conceived it of most importance as a symptom and prognostic he was instantly satisfied though it happened many months before our first indirect solicitation for peace that we were then preparing to abandon what he always maintained as the great object of the war for he argued if ministers had been earnest in prosecuting the momentous cause in which we were engaged and had entertained a serious sense or the increasing danger that menaced every thing valuable to us they would not have asked whether the lord lieutenant had anticipated requests by which he should have waited to be importuned or whether he had removed from their stations at one stroke two considerable officers of the crown in whom he had no confidence instead of displacing them separately and at intervals they would only have enquired whether the kings business had been done with zeal and effect had there been a cordial consent of principle on both sides the water he was persuaded that some way or other would easily have been found to compromise all inferior considerations he did not dissemble these opinions on the contrary he spared no exertion though in vain to impress them on all the leading members of government in this kingdom  an enquiry into the causes of the lord lieutenants sudden recall was moved in both houses of parliament here in the house of lords a peer of the highest rank in urging the motion took occasion to throw out some insinuations against mr burke as having deserted his ancient friends and principles and as having written a book which amidst much splendor of eloquence contained much pernicious doctrine and had provoked on the other side a very mischievous answer  mr burke was probably the more ready to notice this attack because the topics were the same with those of which he had complained much in private as having been unfairly introduced in some of the statetrials in one of them especially having been summoned as a witness soon after the loss of his son having much against his will been kept in hourly attendance for two whole days in the neighborhood of the court and having then been discharged without examination he was much surprised to read afterward that a principal part of the defense had consisted in commenting upon various extracts from his works and by a learned person too who had never taken up any of the challenges which he had himself repeatedly thrown out where the truth might have been fully discussed face to face in the house of commons perhaps also there were some circumstances of the time which did not dispose him in general to regard the noble dukes conduct in parliament with much indulgence all these may be traced in the pleasant though severe chastisement of the letter which forms the second part of this publication but it is chiefly worthy of attention as it contains in their very germ and seed those notions which are unfolded and displayed in his later productions with so much luxuriant beauty it is a masterly drawing from which he afterward painted on a larger canvas his grand and striking pictures of our awful situation arising out of what he thought the false policy of both our contending parties as he would not surrender to his long friendship with mr fox those principles which he had himself modelled for his party and which he had unalterably fixed as his own canon long before that party had an existence so neither from a sense of recent obligation to mr pit would he accommodate them to the fluctuating chances of a campaign or the accidental languor and lassitude of a people which like every highspirited people too long repressed is only to be animated by a congenial character of decision energy and enterprise before the actual aggression of the french he had said it is impossible to tell what will be the event of any war it is impossible to tell how it will be conducted either by ministers or military men yet with all these dreadful uncertainties i am clear it must be risked or our ruin is no uncertainty at all in the course of our arduous contest he saw no indication of any essential change in the disposition and principles of the common enemy the real danger against which we were driven unwilling as we were to seek safety in arms he saw therefore no prospect of a rationally secure peace which is the only end of any justifiable war in whatever cause undertaken till the calamities of war by the lessons of that terrible necessity which is the stern but faithful guardian of the moral and social world shall have taught the disturbers and destroyers of europe to look for their own happiness in the truly pacifick mind which respects the rights of others all negociations and treaties appeared to him but snares to catch credulity and screens to conceal the shame of pusillanimity with most of the dreadful uncertainties of war now become in his opinion afflicting certainties he thought that we must persevere to the great talents of the minister he bore invariable testimony but he could never allow that to humiliate and prostrate a great nation at the feet of an insolent and rancourous enemy was the conduct of a statesman equal to the mighty crisis which ought to render us for ever worthy of our rank among the states of europe or for ever glorious in our fall he wished them to be stimulated and urged on to a more resolute discharge of their high duty by all of independent spirit and virtue that can be found in the country yet at the same time he wished their continuance in power because in whatever hands the present alarming situation of the civilized world had found the government of the kingdom to have wrested it from them by force would have put all good government to the hazard and because they have no competitors for public confidence on the grounds of our ancient appropriate local interests in connection with that system on which the liberties the tranquillity and the prosperity of europe have hitherto rested these sentiments did not leave him but with his breath he testified them on the last day of his life in the last conversation which he held hardly an hour before his dissolution if with the expression of them in his disputes with the political friends of his earlier days he ever mingled any thing of general human infirmity or his own particular infirmity as he said with his accustomed humility in the will which he wrote with his own hand almost over the dead body of his son and which he confirmed in the full and near contemplation of his own death  he has asked their forgiveness on the other side he had no forgiveness to ask to have supposed that by the grants which his sovereign was advised to confer upon him the minister meant to purchase his silence would not only have been contrary to the kind and generous manner in which they were signified to him it would have been to incur the guilt of the blackest ingratitude by supposing that under the color of rewarding his services to his country they were insidiously given to tarnish and obscure the luster of all his past life  letter to the duke of portland with observations on the conduct of the minority particularly in the last session of parliament      to his grace the duke of portland my dear lord the paper which i take the liberty of sending to your grace was for the greater part written during the last session a few days after the prorogation some few observations were added i was however resolved to let it lie by me for a considerable time that on viewing the matter at a proper distance and when the sharpness of recent impressions had been worn off i might be better able to form a just estimate of the value of my first opinions  i have just now read it over very coolly and deliberately my latest judgment owns my first sentiments and reasonings in their full force with regard both to persons and things  during a period of four years the state of the world except for some few and short intervals has filled me with a good deal of serious inquietude i considered a general war against jacobins and jacobinism as the only possible chance of saving europe and england as included in europe from a truly frightful revolution for this i have been censured as receiving through weakness or of spreading through fraud and artifice a false alarm whatever others may think of the matter that alarm in my mind is by no means quieted the state of affairs abroad is not so much mended as to make me for one full of confidence at home i see no abatement whatsoever in the zeal of the partisans of jacobinism toward their cause nor any cessation in their efforts to do mischief what is doing by lord lauderdale on the first scene of lord george gordons actions and in his spirit is not calculated to remove my apprehensions they pursue their first object with as much eagerness as ever but with more dexterity under the plausible name of peace by which they delude or are deluded they would deliver us unarmed and defenseless to the confederation of jacobins whose center is indeed in france but whose rays proceed in every direction throughout the world i understand that mr coke of norfolk has been lately very busy in spreading a dissaffection to this war which we carry on for our being in the country in which his property gives him so great an influence it is truly alarming to see so large a part of the aristocratick interest engaged in the cause of the new species of democracy which is openly attacking or secretly undermining the system of property by which mankind has hitherto been governed but we are not to delude ourselves no man can be connected with a party which professes publicly to admire or may be justly suspected of secretly abetting this french revolution who must not be drawn into its vortex and become the instrument of its designs  what i have written is in the manner of apology i have given it that form as being the most respectful but i do not stand in need of any apology for my principles my sentiments or my conduct i wish the paper i lay before your grace to be considered as my most deliberate solemn and even testamentary protest against the proceedings and doctrines which have hitherto produced so much mischief in the world and which will infallibly produce more and possibly greater it is my protest against the delusion by which some have been taught to look upon this jacobin contest at home as an ordinary party squabble about place or patronage and to regard this jacobin war abroad as a common war about trade or territorial boundaries or about a political balance of power among rival or jealous states above all it is my protest against that mistake or perversion of sentiment by which they who agree with us in our principles may on collateral considerations be regarded as enemies and those who in this perilous crisis of all human affairs differ from us fundamentally and practically as our best friends thus persons of great importance may be made to turn the whole of their influence to the destruction of their principles  i now make it my humble request to your grace that you will not give any sort of answer to the paper i send or to this letter except barely to let me know that you have received them i even wish that at present you may not read the paper which i transmit lock it up in the drawer of your library table and when a day of compulsory reflection comes then be pleased to turn to it then remember that your grace had a true friend who had comparatively with men of your description a very small interest in opposing the modern system of morality and policy but who under every discouragement was faithful to public duty and to private friendship i shall then probably be dead i am sure i do not wish to live to see such things but whilst i do live i shall pursue the same course although my merits should be taken for unpardonable faults and as such avenged not only on myself but on my posterity  adieu my dear lord and do me the justice to believe me ever with most sincere respect veneration and affectionate attachment  your graces most faithful friend and most obedient humble servant edmund burke beaconsfield sept          observations etc approaching toward the close of a long period of public service it is natural i should be desirous to stand well i hope i do stand tolerably well with that public which with whatever fortune i have endeavored faithfully and zealously to serve  i am also not a little anxious for some place in the estimation of the two persons to whom i address this paper i have always acted with them and with those whom they represent to my knowledge i have not deviated no not in the minutest point from their opinions and principles of late without any alteration in their sentiments or in mine a difference of a very unusual nature and which under the circumstances it is not easy to describe has arisen between us  in my journey with them through life i met mr fox in my road and i traveled with him very cheerfully as long as he appeared to me to pursue the same direction with those in whose company i set out in the latter stage of our progress a new scheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world which either dazzled his imagination or was suited to some new walks of ambition which were then opened to his view the whole frame and fashion of his politics appear to have suffered about that time a very material alteration it is about three years since in consequence of that extraordinary change that after a pretty long preceding period of distance coolness and want of confidence if not total alienation on his part a complete public separation has been made between that gentleman and me until lately the breach between us appeared reparable i trusted that time and reflection and a decisive experience of the mischiess which have flowed from the proceedings and the system of france on which our difference had arisen as well as the known sentiments of the best and wisest of our common friends upon that subject would have brought him to a safer way of thinking several of his friends saw no security for keeping things in a proper train after this excursion of his but in the reunion of the party on its old grounds under the duke of portland mr fox if he pleased might have been comprehended in that system with the rank and consideration to which his great talents entitle him and indeed must secure to him in any party arrangement that could be made the duke of portland knows how much i wished for and how earnestly i labored that reunion and upon terms that might every way be honorable and advantageous to mr fox  his conduct in the last session has extinguished these hopes for ever  mr fox has lately published in print a defense of his conduct on taking into consideration that defense a society of gentlemen called the whig club thought proper to come to the following resolution  that their confidence in mr fox is confirmed strengthened and increased by the calumnies against him  to that resolution my two noble friends the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam have given their concurrence  the calumnies supposed in that resolution can be nothing else than the objections taken to mr foxs conduct in this session of parliament for to them and to them alone the resolution refers i am one of those who have publicly and strongly urged those objections i hope i shall be thought only to do what is necessary to my justification thus publicly solemnly and heavily censured by those whom i most value and esteem when i firmly contend that the objections which i with many others of the friends to the duke of portland have made to mr foxs conduct are not calumnies but founded on truth that they are not few but many and that they are not light and trivial but in a very high degree serious and important  that i may avoid the imputation of throwing out even privately any loose random imputations against the public conduct of a gentleman for whom i once entertained a very warm affection and whose abilities i regard with the greatest admiration i will put down distinctly and articulately some of the matters of objection which i feel to his late doctrines and proceedings trusting that i shall be able to demonstrate to the friends whose good opinion i would still cultivate that not levity nor caprice nor less defensible motives but that very grave reasons influence my judgment i think that the spirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy and to the peace to the prosperity and to the legal liberties of this nation according to our ancient domestic and appropriated mode of holding them  viewing things in that light my confidence in him is not increased but totally destroyed by those proceedings i cannot conceive it a matter of honor or duty but the direct contrary in any member of parliament to continue systematick opposition for the purpose of putting government under difficulties until mr fox with all his present ideas shall have the principal direction of affairs placed in his hands and until the present body of administration with their ideas and measures is of course overturned and dissolved  to come to particulars    the laws and constitution of the kingdom entrust the sole and exclusive right of treating with foreign potentates to the king this is an undisputed part of the legal prerogative of the crown however notwithstanding this mr fox without the knowledge or participation of any one person in the house of commons with whom he was bound by every party principle in matters of delicacy and importance confidentially to communicate thought proper to send mr adair as his representative and with his cipher to st petersburgh there to frustrate the objects for which the minister from the crown was authorized to treat he succeeded in this his design and did actually frustrate the kings minister in some of the objects of his negotiation  this proceeding of mr fox does not as i conceive amount to absolute high treason russia though on bad terms not having been then declaredly at war with this kingdom but such a proceeding is in law not very remote from that offense and is undoubtedly a most unconstitutional act and an high treasonable misdemeanor  the legitimate and sure mode of communication between this nation and foreign powers is rendered uncertain precarious and treacherous by being divided into two channels one with the government one with the head of a party in opposition to that government by which means the foreign powers can never be assured of the real authority or validity of any public transaction whatsoever  on the other hand the advantage taken of the discontent which at that time prevailed in parliament and in the nation to give to an individual an influence directly against the government of his country in a foreign court has made a highway into england for the intrigues of foreign courts in our affairs this is a sore evil an evil from which before this time england was more free than any other nation nothing can preserve us from that evil  which connects cabinet factions abroad with popular factions here  but the keeping sacred the crown as the only channel of communication with every other nation  this proceeding of mr fox has given a strong countenance and an encouraging example to the doctrines and practices of the revolution and constitutional societies and of other mischievous societies of that description who without any legal authority and even without any corporate capacity are in the habit of proposing and to the best of their power of forming leagues and alliances with france  this proceeding which ought to be reprobated on all the general principles of government is in a more narrow view of things not less reprehensible it tends to the prejudice of the whole of the duke of portlands late party by discrediting the principles upon which they supported mr fox in the russian business as if they of that party also had proceeded in their parliamentary opposition on the same mischievous principles which actuated mr fox in sending mr adair on his embassy    very soon after his sending this embassy to russia that is in the spring of      a covenanting club or association was formed in london calling itself by the ambitious and invidious title of  the friends of the people it was composed of many of mr foxs own most intimate personal and party friends joined to a very considerable part of the members of those mischievous associations called the revolution society and the constitutional society mr fox must have been well apprized of the progress of that society in every one of its steps if not of the very origin of it i certainly was informed of both who had no connection with the design directly or indirectly his influence over the persons who composed the leading part in that association was and is unbounded i hear that he expressed some disapprobation of this club in one case that of mr st john where his consent was formally asked yet he never attempted seriously to put a stop to the association or to disavow it or to control check or modify it in any way whatsoever if he had pleased without difficulty he might have suppressed it in its beginning however he did not only not suppress it in its beginning but encouraged it in every part of its progress at that particular time when jacobin clubs under the very same or similar titles were making such dreadful havoc in a country not thirty miles from the coast of england and when every motive of moral prudence called for the discouragement of societies formed for the increase of popular pretensions to power and direction    when the proceedings of this society of the friends of the people as well as others acting in the same spirit had caused a very serious alarm in the mind of the duke of portland and of many good patriots he publicly in the house of commons treated their apprehensions and conduct with the greatest asperity and ridicule he condemned and vilified in the most insulting and outrageous terms the proclamation issued by government on that occasion  though he well knew that it had passed through the duke of portlands hands that it had received his fullest approbation and that it was the result of an actual interview between that noble duke and mr pit during the discussion of its merits in the house of commons mr fox countenanced and justified the chief promoters of that association and he received in return a public assurance from them of an inviolable adherence to him singly and personally on account of this proceeding a very great number i presume to say not the least grave and wise part of the duke of portlands friends in parliament and many out of parliament who are of the same description have become separated from that time to this from mr foxs particular cabal very few of which cabal are or ever have so much as pretended to be attached to the duke of portland or to pay any respect to him or his opinions    at the beginning of this session when the sober part of the nation was a second time generally and justly alarmed at the progress of the french arms on the continent and at the spreading of their horrid principles and cabals in england mr fox did not as had been usual in cases of far less moment call together any meeting of the duke of portlands friends in the house of commons for the purpose of taking their opinion on the conduct to be pursued in parliament at that critical juncture he concerted his measures if with any persons at all with the friends of lord lansdowne and those calling themselves friends of the people and others not in the smallest degree attached to the duke of portland by which conduct he wilfully gave up in my opinion all pretensions to be considered as of that party and much more to be considered as the leader and mouth of it in the house of commons this could not give much encouragement to those who had been separated from mr fox on account of his conduct on the first proclamation to rejoin that party    not having consulted any of the duke of portlands party in the house of commons and not having consulted them because he had reason to know that the course he had resolved to pursue would be highly disagreeable to them he represented the alarm which was a second time given and taken in still more invidious colors than those in which he painted the alarms of the former year he described those alarms in this manner although the cause of them was then grown far less equivocal and far more urgent he even went so far as to treat the supposition of the growth of a jacobin spirit in england as a libel on the nation as to the danger from abroad on the first day of the session he said little or nothing upon the subject he contented himself with defending the ruling factions in france and with accusing the public councils of this kingdom of every sort of evil design on the liberties of the people declaring distinctly strongly and precisely that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the power of the crown the policy of this declaration was obvious it was in subservience to the general plan of disabling us from taking any steps against france to counteract the alarm given by the progress of jacobin arms and principles he endeavored to excite an opposite alarm concerning the growth of the power of the crown if that alarm should prevail he knew that the nation never would be brought by arms to oppose the growth of the jacobin empire because it is obvious that war does in its very nature necessitate the commons considerably to strengthen the hands of government and if that strength should itself be the object of terror we could have no war    in the extraordinary and violent speeches of that day he attributed all the evils which the public had suffered to the proclamation of the preceding summer though he spoke in presence of the duke of portlands own son the marquis of titchfield who had seconded the address on that proclamation and in presence of the duke of portlands brother lord edward bentinck and several others of his best friends and nearest relations    on that day that is on the   th of december      he proposed an amendment to the address which stands on the journals of the house and which is perhaps the most extraordinary record which ever did stand upon them to introduce this amendment he not only struck out the part of the proposed address which alluded to insurrections upon the ground of the objections which he took to the legality of calling together parliament objections which i must ever think litigious and sophistical but he likewise struck out that part which related to the cabals and conspiracies of the french faction in england although their practices and correspondences were of public notoriety mr cooper and mr watt had been deputed from manchester to the jacobins these ambassadors were received by them as british representatives other deputations of english had been received at the bar of the national assembly they had gone the length of giving supplies to the jacobin armies and they in return had received promises of military assistance to forward their designs in england a regular correspondence for fraternizing the two nations had also been carried on by societies in london with a great number of the jacobin societies in france this correspondence had also for its object the pretended improvement of the british constitution  what is the most remarkable and by much the more mischievous part of his proceedings that day mr fox likewise struck out every thing in the address which related to the lokens of ambilion given by france her aggressions upon our allies and the sudden and dangerous growth of her power upon every side and instead of all those weighty and at that time necessary matters by which the house of commons was in a crisis such as perhaps europe never stood to give assurances to our allies strength to our government and a check to the common enemy of europe he substituted nothing but a criminal charge on the conduct of the british government for calling parliament together and an engagement to enquire into that conduct    if it had pleased god to suffer him to succeed in this his project for the amendment to the address he would for ever have ruined this nation along with the rest of europe at home all the jacobin societies formed for the utter destruction of our constitution would have lifted up their heads which had been beaten down by the two proclamations those societies would have been infinitely strengthened and multiplied in every quarter their dangerous foreign communications would have been left broad and open the crown would not have been authorized to take any measure whatever for our immediate defense by sea or land the closest the most natural the nearest and at the same time from many internal as well as external circumstances the weakest of our allies holland would have been given up bound hand and foot to france just on the point of invading that republic a general consternation would have seized upon all europe and all alliance with every other power except france would have been for ever rendered impracticable to us i think it impossible for any man who regards the dignity and safety of his country or indeed the common safety of mankind ever to forget mr foxs proceedings in that tremendous crisis of all human affairs    mr fox very soon had reason to be apprised of the general dislike of the duke of portlands friends to this conduct some of those who had even voted with him the day after their vote expressed their abhorrence of his amendment their sense of its inevitable tendency and their total alienation from the principles and maxims upon which it was made yet the very next day that is on friday the   th of december he brought on what in effect was the very same business and on the same principles a second time   0 although the house does not usually fit on saturday he a third time brought on another proposition in the same spirit and pursued it with so much heat and perseverance as to sit into sunday a thing not known in parliament for many years     in all these motions and debates he wholly departed from all the political principles relative to france considered merely as a state and independent of its jacobin form of government which had hitherto been held fundamental in this country and which he had himself held more strongly than any man in parliament he at that time studiously separated himself from those to whose sentiments he used to profess no small regard although those sentiments were publicly declared i had then no concern in the party having been for some time with all outrage excluded from it but on general principles i must say that a person who assumes to be leader of a party composed of freemen and of gentlemen ought to pay some degree of deference to their feelings and even to their prejudices he ought to have some degree of management for their credit and influence in their country he showed so very little of this delicacy that he compared the alarm raised in the minds of the duke of portlands party which was his own an alarm in which they sympathized with the greater part of the nation to the panick produced by the pretended popish plot in the reign of charles the second  describing it to be as that was a contrivance of knaves and believed only by wellmeaning dupes and madmen     the monday following the   th of december he pursued the same conduct the means used in england to cooperate with the jacobin army in politics agreed with their modes of proceeding i allude to the mischievous writings circulated with much industry and success as well as the seditious clubs which at that time added not a little to the alarm taken by observing and wellinformed men the writings and the clubs were two evils which marched together mr fox discovered the greatest possible disposition to favor and countenance the one as well as the other of these two grand instruments of the french system he would hardly consider any political writing whatsoever as a libel or as a fit object of prosecution at a time in which the press has been the grand instrument of the subversion of order of morals of religion and i may say of human society itself to carry the doctrines of its liberty higher than ever it has been known by its most extravagant assertors even in france gave occasion to very serious reflections mr fox treated the associations for prosecuting these libels as tending to prevent the improvement of the human mind and as a mobbish tyranny he thought proper to compare them with the riotous assemblies of lord george gordon in    0 declaring that he had advised his friends in westminster to sign the associations whether they agreed to them or not in order that they might avoid destruction to their persons or their houses or a desertion of their shops this insidious advice tended to confound those who wished well to the object of the association with the seditious against whom the association was directed by this stratagem the confederacy intended for preserving the british constitution and the public peace would be wholly defeated the magistrates utterly incapable of distinguishing the friends from the enemies of order would in vain look for support when they stood in the greatest need of it     mr foxs whole conduct on this occasion was without example the very morning after these violent declamations in the house of commons against the association that is on tuesday the   th he went himself to a meeting of st georges parish and there signed an association of the nature and tendency of those he had the night before so vehemently condemned and several of his particular and most intimate friends inhabitants of that parish attended and signed along with him     immediately after this extraordinary step and in order perfectly to defeat the ends of that association against jacobin publications which contrary to his opinions he had promoted and signed a mischievous society was formed under his auspices called the friends of the liberty of the press their title groundlessly insinuated that the freedom of the press had lately suffered or was now threatened with some violation this society was only in reality another modification of the society calling itself the friends of the people which in the preceding summer had caused so much uneasiness in the duke of portlands mind and in the minds of several of his friends this new society was composed of many if not most of the members of the club of the friends of the people with the addition of a vast multitude of others such as mr horn took of the worst and most seditious dispositions that could be found in the whole kingdom in the first meeting of this club mr erskine took the lead and directly without any disavowal ever since on mr foxs part made use of his name and authority in favor of its formation and purposes in the same meeting mr erskine had thanks for his defense of pain which amounted to a complete avowal of that jacobin incendiary else it is impossible to know how mr erskine should have deserved such marked applauses for acting merely as a lawyer for his fee in the ordinary course of his profession     indeed mr fox appeared the general patron of all such persons and proceedings when lord edward fitzgerald and other persons for practices of the most dangerous kind in paris and in london were removed from the kings guards mr fox took occasion in the house of commons heavily to censure that act as unjust and oppressive and tending to make officers bad citizens there were few however who did not call for some such measures on the part of government as of absolute necessity for the kings personal safety as well as that of the public and nothing but the mistaken lenity with which such practices were rather discountenanced than punished could possibly deserve reprehension in what was done with regard to those gentlemen     mr fox regularly and systematically and with a diligence long unusual to him did every thing he could to countenance the same principle of fraternity and connection with the jacobins abroad and the national convention of france for which these officers had been removed from the guards for when a bill feeble and lax indeed and far short of the vigor required by the conjuncture was brought in for removing out of the kingdom the emissaries of france mr fox opposed it with all his might he pursued a vehement and detailed opposition to it through all its stages describing it as a measure contrary to the existing treaties between great britain and france as a violation of the law of nations and as an outrage on the great charter itself     in the same manner and with the same heat he opposed a bill which though awkward and inartificial in its construction was right and wise in its principle and was precedented in the best times and absolutely necessary at that juncture  i mean the traitorous correspondence bill by these means the enemy rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of real faction and pretended commerce would have been had mr fox succeeded enabled to carry on the war against us by our own resources for this purpose that enemy would have had his agents and traitors in the midst of us     when at length war was actually declared by the usurpers in france against this kingdom and declared whilst they were pretending a negotiation through dumourier with lord auckland mr fox still continued through the whole of the proceedings to discredit the national honor and justice and to throw the entire blame of the war on parliament and on his own country as acting with violence haughtiness and want of equity he frequently asserted both at the time and ever since that the war though declared by france was provoked by us and that it was wholly unnecessary and fundamentally unjust     he has lost no opportunity of railing in the most virulent manner and in the most unmeasured language at every foreign power with whom we could now or at any time contract any useful or effectual alliance against france declaring that he hoped no alliance with those powers was made or was in a train of being made it is an exception that in one of his last speeches but not before mr fox seemed to think an alliance with spain might be proper  he always expressed himself with the utmost horror concerning such alliances so did all his phalanx mr sheridan in particular after one of his invectives against those powers fitting by him said with manifest marks of his approbation that if we must go to war he had rather go to war alone than with such allies   0 immediately after the french declaration of war against us parliament addressed the king in support of the war against them as just and necessary and provoked as well as formally declared against great britain he did not divide the house upon this measure yet he immediately followed this our solemn parliamentary engagement to the king with a motion proposing a set of resolutions the effect of which was that the two houses were to load themselves with every kind of reproach for having made the address which they had just carried to the throne he commenced this long string of criminatory resolutions against his country if king lords and commons of great britain and a decided majority without doors are his country with a declaration against intermeddling in the interior concerns of france the purport of this resolution of noninterference is a thing unexampled in the history of the world when one nation has been actually at war with another the best writers on the law of nations give no sort of countenance to his doctrine of noninterference in the extent and manner in which he used it even when there is no war when the war exists not one authority is against it in all its latitude his doctrine is equally contrary to the enemys uniform practice who whether in peace or in war makes it his great aim not only to change the government but to make an entire revolution in the whole of the social order in every country  the object of the last of this extraordinary string of resolutions moved by mr fox was to advise the crown not to enter into such an engagement with any foreign power so as to hinder us from making a separate peace with france or which might tend to enable any of those powers to introduce a government in that country other than such as those persons whom he calls the people of france shall choose to establish in short the whole of these resolutions appeared to have but one drift  namely the sacrifice of our own domestic dignity and safety and the independency of europe to the support of this strange mixture of anarchy and tyranny which prevails in france and which mr fox and his party were pleased to call a government the immediate consequences of these measures was by an example the ill effects of which on the whole world are not to be calculated to secure the robbers of the innocent nobility gentry and ecclesiastics of france in the enjoyment of the spoil they have made of the estates houses and goods of their fellowcitizens     not satisfied with moving these resolutions tending to confirm this horrible tyranny and robbery and with actually dividing the house on the first of the long string which they composed in a few days afterward he encouraged and supported mr gray in producing the very same strings in a new form and in moving under the shape of an address of parliament to the crown another virulent libel on all its own proceedings in this session in which not only all the ground of the resolutions was again traveled over but much new inflammatory matter was introduced in particular a charge was made that great britain had not interposed to prevent the last partition of poland on this head the party dwelt very largely and very vehemently mr foxs intention in the choice of this extraordinary topic was evident enough he well knows two things first that no wise or honest man can approve of that partition or can contemplate it without prognosticating great mischief from it to all countries at some future time secondly he knows quite as well that let our opinions on that partition be what they will england by itself is not in a situation to afford to poland any assistance whatsoever the purpose of the introduction of polish politics into this discussion was not for the sake of poland it was to throw an odium upon those who are obliged to decline the cause of justice from their impossibility of supporting a cause which they approve as if we who think more strongly on this subject than he does were of a party against poland because we are obliged to act with some of the authors of that injustice against our common enemy france but the great and leading purpose of this introduction of poland into the debates on the french war was to divert the public attention from what was in our power that is from a steady cooperation against france to a quarrel with the allies for the sake of a polish war which for any useful purpose to poland he knew it was out of our power to make if england can touch poland ever so remotely it must be through the medium of alliances but by attacking all the combined powers together for their supposed unjust aggression upon france he bound them by a new common interest not separately to join england for the rescue of poland the proposition could only mean to do what all the writers of his party in the morning chronicle have aimed at persuading the public to through the whole of the last autumn and winter and to this hour that is to an alliance with the jacobins of france for the pretended purpose of succouring poland this curious project would leave to great britain no other ally in all europe except its old enemy france     mr fox after the first days discussion on the question for the address was at length driven to admit  to admit rather than to urge and that very faintly that france had discovered ambitious views which none of his partisans that i recollect mr sheridan excepted did however either urge or admit what is remarkable enough all the points admitted against the jacobins were brought to bear in their favor as much as those in which they were defended for when mr fox admitted that the conduct of the jacobins did discover ambition he always ended his admission of their ambitious views by an apology for them insisting that the universally hostile disposition shown to them rendered their ambition a sort of defensive policy thus on whatever roads he traveled they all terminated in recommending a recognition of their pretended republic and in the plan of sending an ambassador to it this was the burden of all his song  every thing which we could reasonably hope from war would be obtained from treaty it is to be observed however that in all these debates mr fox never once stated to the house upon what ground it was he conceived that all the objects of the french system of united fanaticism and ambition would instantly be given up whenever england should think fit to propose a treaty on proposing so strange a recognition and so humiliating an embassy as he moved he was bound to produce his authority if any authority he had he ought to have done this the rather because le brun in his first propositions and in his answers to lord grenville defended on principle not on temporary convenience every thing which was objected to france and showed not the smallest disposition to give up any one of the points in discussion mr fox must also have known that the convention had passed to the order of the day on a proposition to give some sort of explanation or modification to the hostile decree of the   th of november for exciting insurrections in all countries a decree known to be peculiarly pointed at great britain the whole proceeding of the french administration was the most remote that could be imagined from furnishing any indication of a pacific disposition for at the very time in which it was pretended that the jacobins entertained those boasted pacific intentions at the very time in which mr fox was urging a treaty with them not content with refusing a modification of the decree for insurrections they published their ever memorable decree of the   th of december      for disorganizing every country in europe into which they should on any occasion set their foot and on the   th and the  0th of the same month they solemnly and on the last of these days practically confirmed that decree     but mr fox had himself taken good care in the negotiation he proposed that france should not be obliged to make any very great concessions to her presumed moderation  for he had laid down one general comprehensive rule with him as he said constant and inviolable this rule in fact would not only have left to the faction in france all the property and power they had usurped at home but most if not all of the conquests which by their atrocious perfidy and violence they had made abroad the principle laid down by mr fox is this  that every state in the conclusion of a war has a right to avail itself of its conquests toward an indemnification this principle true or false is totally contrary to the policy which this country has pursued with france at various periods particularly at the treaty of ryswick in the last century and at the treaty of aixlachapelle in this whatever the merits of his rule may be in the eyes of neutral judges it is a rule which no statesman before him ever laid down in favor of the adverse power with whom he was to negotiate the adverse party himself may safely be trusted to take care of his own aggrandizement but as if the black boxes of theseveral parties had been exchanged mr foxs english ambassador by some odd mistake would find himself cahrged with the concerns of france if we were to leave france as she stood at the time when mr fox proposed to treat with her that formidable power must have been infinitely strengthened and almost every other power in europe as much weakened by the extraordinary basis which he laid for a treaty for avignon must go from the pope savoy at least from the king of sardinia if not nice liege mentz salm deux ponts and bale must be separated from germany on this side of the rhine liege at least must be lost to the empire and added to france mr foxs general principal fully covered all this how much of these territories came within his rule he never attempted to define he kept a profound silence as to germany as to the netherlands he was something more explicit he said if i recollect right that france on that side might expect something toward strengthening her frontier as to the remaining parts of the netherlands which he supposed france might consent to surrender he went so far as to declare that england ought not to permit the emperor to be repossessed of the remainder of the ten provinces but that the people should choose such a form of independent government as they liked this proposition of mr fox was just the arrangement which the usurpation in france had all along proposed to make as the circumstances were at that time and have been ever since his proposition fully indicated what gevernment the flemmings must have in the stated extent of what was left to them a government so set up in the netherlands whether compulsory or by the choice of the sansculottes who he well knew were to be the real electors and the sole electors in whatever name it was to exist must evidently depend for its existence as it had done for its original formation on france in reality it must have ended in that point to which piece by piece the french were then actually bringing all the netherlands that is an incorporation with france as a body of new departments just as savoy and liege and the rest of their pretended independent popular sovereignties have been united to their republic such an arrangement must have destroyed austria it must have left holland always at the mercy of france it must totally and for ever cut off all political communication between england and the continent such must have been the situation of europe according to mr foxs system of politics however laudable his personal motives may have been in proposing so complete a change in the whole system of great britain with regard to all the continental powers     after it had been generally supposed that all public business was over for the session and that mr fox had exhausted all the modes of pressing this french scheme he thought proper to take a step beyond every expectation and which demonstrated his wonderful eagerness and perseverance in his cause as well as the nature and true character of the cause itself this step was taken by mr fox immediately after his giving his assent to the grant of supply voted to him by mr sergeant adair and a committee of gentlemen who assumed to themselves to act in the name of the public in the instrument of his acceptance of this grant mr fox took occasion to assure them that he would always persevere in the same conduct which had procured to him so honorable a mark of the public approbation he was as good as his word     it was not long before an opportunity was found or made for proving the sincerity of his professions and demonstrating his gratitude to those who had given public and unequivocal marks of their approbation of his late conduct one of the most virulent of the jacobin faction mr gurney a banker at norwich had all along distinguished himself by his french politics by the means of this gentleman and of his associates of the same description one of the most insidious and dangerous handbills that ever was seen had been circulated at norwich against the war drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compassion for the poor this address to the populace of norwich was to play in concert with an address to mr fox it was signed by mr gurney and the higher part of the french fraternity in that town in this paper mr fox is applauded for his conduct throughout the session and requested before the prorogation to make a motion for an immediate peace with france     mr fox did not revoke to this suit he readily and thankfully undertook the task assigned to him not content however with merely falling in with their wishes he proposed a task on his part to the gentlemen of norwich which was that they should move the people without doors to petition against the war he said that without such assistance little good could be expected from any thing he might attempt within the walls of the house of commons in the mean time to animate his norwich friends in their endeavors to besiege parliament he snatched the first opportunity to give notice of a motion which he very soon after made namely to address the crown to make peace with france the address was so worded as to cooperate with the handbill in bringing forward matter calculated to inflame the manufacturers throughout the kingdom     in support of his motion he declaimed in the most virulent strain even beyond any of his former invectives against every power with whom we were then and are now acting against france in the moral forum some of these powers certainly deserve all the ill he said of them but the political effect aimed at evidently was to turn our indignation from france with whom we were at war upon russia or prussia or austria or sardinia or all of them together in consequence of his knowledge that we could not effectually do without them and his resolution that we should not act with them he proposed that having as he asserted obtained the only avowed object of the war the evacuation off holland we ought to conclude an instant peace     mr fox could not be ignorant of the mistaken basis upon which his motion was grounded he was not ignorant that though the attempt of dumourier on holland so very near succeeding and the navigation of the scheld a part of the same piece were among the immediate causes they were by no means the only causes alleged for parliaments taking that offense at the proceedings of france for which the jacobins were so prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom other full as weighty causes had been alleged they were   the general overbearing and desperate ambition of that faction   their actual attacks on every nation in europe   their usurpation of territories in the empire with the governments of which they had no pretense of quarrel   their perpetual and irrevocable consolidation with their own dominions of every territory of the netherlands of germany and of italy of which they got a temporary possession   the mischiefs attending the prevalence of their system which would make the success of their ambitious designs a new and peculiar species of calamity in the world   their formal public decrees particularly those of the   th of november and   th and   th of december   their notorious attempts to undermine the constitution of this country   their public reception of deputations of traitors for that direct purpose   their murder of their sovereign declared by most of the members of the convention who spoke with their vote without a disavowal from any to be perpetrated as an example to all kings and a precedent for all subjects to follow all these and not the scheld alone or the invasion of holland were urged by the minister and by mr windham by myself and by others who spoke in those debates as causes for bringing france to a sense of her wrong in the war which she declared against us mr fox well knew that not one man argued for the necessity of a vigorous resistance to france who did not state the war as being for the very existence of the social order here and every part of europe who did not state his opinion that this war was not at all a foreign war of empire but as much for our liberties properties laws and religion and even more so than any we had ever been engaged in this was the war which according to mr fox and mr gurney we were to abandon before the enemy had felt in the slightest degree the impression of our arms     had mr foxs disgraceful proposal been complied with this kingdom would have been stained with a blot of perfidy hitherto without an example in our history and with far less excuse than any act of perfidy which we find in the history of any other nation the moment when by the incredible exertions of austria very little through ours the temporary deliverance of holland in effect our own deliverance had been achieved he advised the house instantly to abandon her to that very enemy from whose arms she had freed ourselves and the closest of our allies   0 but we are not to be imposed on by forms of language we must act on the substance of things to abandon austria in this manner was to abandon holland itself for suppose france encouraged and strengthened as she must have been by our treacherous desertion suppose france i say to succeed against austria as she had succeeded the very year before england would after its disarmament have nothing in the world but the inviolable faith of jacobinism and the steady politics of anarchy to depend upon against frances renewing the very same attempts upon holland and renewing them considering what holland was and is with much better prospects of success mr fox must have been well aware that if we were to break with the greater continental powers and particularly to come to a rupture with them in the violent and intemperate mode in which he would have made the breach the defense of holland against a foreign enemy and a strong domestic faction must hereafter rest solely upon england without the chance of a single ally either on that or on any other occasion so far as to the pretended sole object of the war which mr fox supposed to be so completely obtained but which then was not at all and at this day is not completely obtained as to leave us nothing else to do than to cultivate a peaceful quiet correspondence with those quiet peaceable and moderate people the jacobins of france     to induce us to this mr fox labored hard to make it appear that the powers with whom we acted were full as ambitious and as perfidious as the french this might be true as to other nations they had not however been so to us or to holland he produced no proof of active ambition and ill faith against austria but supposing the combined powers had been all thus faithless and had been all alike so there was one circumstance which made an essential difference between them and france i need not therefore be at the trouble of contesting this point which however in this latitude and as at all affecting great britain and holland i deny utterly be it so but the great monarchies have it in their power to keep their faith if they please because they are governments of established and recognized authority at home and abroad france had in reality no government the very factions who exercised power had no stability the french convention had no powers of peace or war supposing the convention to be free most assuredly it was not they had shown no disposition to abandon their projects though long driven out of liege it was not many days before mr foxs motion that they still continued to claim it as a country which their principles of fraternity bound them to protect that is to subdue and to regulate at their pleasure that party which mr fox inclined most to favor and trust and from which he must have received his assurances if any he did receive that is the brissotins were then either prisoners or fugitives the party which prevailed over them that of danton and marat was itself in a tottering condition and was disowned by a very great part of france to say nothing of the royal party who were powerful and growing and who had full as good a right to claim to be the legitimate government as any of the parisian factions with whom he proposed to treat  or rather as it seemed to me to surrender at discretion     but when mr fox began to come from his general hopes of the moderation of the jacobins to particulars he put the case that they might not perhaps be willing to surrender savoy he certainly was not willing to contest that point with them but plainly and explicitly as i understood him proposed to let them keep it though he knew or he was much worse informed than he would be thought that england had at the very time agreed on the terms of a treaty with the king of sardinia of which the recovery of savoy was the casus federis in the teeth of this treaty mr fox proposed a direct and most scandalous breach of our faith formally and recently given but to surrender savoy was to surrender a great deal more than so many square acres of land or so much revenue in its consequences the surrender of savoy was to make a surrender to france of switzerland and italy of both which countries savoy is the key  as it is known to ordinary speculators in politics though it may not be known to the weavers in norwich who it seems are by mr fox called to be the judges in this matter     a sure way indeed to encourage france not to make a surrender of this key of italy and switzerland or of mayence the key of germany or of any other object whatsoever which she holds is to let her see that the people of england raise a clamor against the war before terms are so much as proposed on any side from that moment the jacobins would be masters of the terms  they would know that parliament at all hazards would force the king to a separate peace the crown could not in that case have any use of its judgment parliament could not possess more judgment than the crown when besieged as mr fox proposed to mr gurney by the cries of the manufacturers this description of men mr fox endeavored in his speech by every method to irritate and inflame in effect his two speeches were through the whole nothing more than an amplification of the norwich handbill he rested the greatest part of his argument on the distress of trade which he attributed to the war though it was obvious to any tolerably good observation and much more must have been clear to such an observation as his that the then difficulties of the trade and manufacture could have no sort of connection with our share in it the war had hardly begun we had suffered neither by spoil nor by defeat nor by disgrace of any kind public credit was so little impaired that instead of being supported by any extraordinary aids from individuals it advanced a credit to individuals to the amount of five millions for the support of trade and manufactures under their temporary difficulties a thing before never heard of  a thing of which i do not commend the policy  but only state it to show that mr foxs ideas of the effects of war were without any trace of foundation     it is impossible not to correct the arguments and proceedings of a party with that of its leader  especially when not disavowed or controlled by him mr foxs partisans declaim against all the powers of europe except the jacobins just as he does but not having the same reasons for management and caution which he has they speak out he satisfies himself merely with making his invectives and leaves others to draw the conclusion but they produce their polish interposition for the express purpose of leading to a french alliance they urge their french peace in order to make a junction with the jacobins to oppose the powers whom in their language they call despots and their leagues a combination of despots indeed no man can look on the present posture of europe with the least degree of discernment who will not be thoroughly convinced that england must be the fast friend or the determined enemy of france there is no medium and i do not think mr fox to be so dull as not to observe this his peace would have involved us instantly in the most extensive and most ruinous wars at the same time that it would have made a broad highway across which no human wisdom could put an effectual barrier for a mutual intercourse with the fraternizing jacobins on both sides the consequences of which those will certainly not provide against who do not dread or dislike them     it is not amiss in this place to enter a little more fully into the spirit of the principal arguments on which mr fox thought proper to rest this his grand and concluding motion particularly such as were drawn from the internal state of our affairs under a specious appearance not uncommonly put on by men of unscrupulous ambition that of tenderness and compassion to the poor he did his best to appeal to the judgments of the meanest and most ignorant of the people on the merits of the war he had before done something of the same dangerous kind in his printed letter the ground of a political war is of all things that which the poor labourer and manufacturer are the least capable of conceiving this sort of people know in general that they must suffer by war it is a matter to which they are sufficiently competent because it is a matter of feeling the causes of a war are not matters of feeling but of reason and foresight and often of remote considerations and of a very great combination of circumstances which they are utterly incapable of comprehending and indeed it is not every man in the highest classes who is altogether equal to it nothing in a general sense appears to me less fair and justifiable even if no attempt were made to inflame the passions than to submit a matter on discussion to a tribunal incapable of judging of more than one side of the question it is at least as unjustifiable to inflame the passions of such judges against that side in favor of which they cannot so much as comprehend the arguments before the prevalence of the french system which as far as it has gone has extinguished the salutary prejudice called our country nobody was more sensible of this important truth than mr fox and nothing was more proper and pertinent or was more felt at the time than his reprimand to mr wilberforce for an inconsiderate expression which tended to call in the judgment of the poor to estimate the policy of war upon the standard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay toward its support     it is fatally known that the great object of the jacobin system is to excite the lowest description of the people to range themselves under ambitious men for the pillage and destruction of the more eminent orders and classes of the community the thing therefore that a man not fanatically attached to that dreadful project would most studiously avoid is to act a part with the french propagandists in attributing as they constantly do all wars and all the consequences of wars to the pride of those orders and to their contempt of the weak and indigent part of the society the ruling jacobins insist upon it that even the wars which they carry on with so much obstinacy against all nations are made to prevent the poor from any longer being the instruments and victims of kings nobles and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men they pretend that the destruction of kings nobles and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men is the only means of establishing an universal and perpetual peace this is the great drift of all their writings from the time of the meeting of the states of france in      to the publication of the last morning chronicle they insist that even the war which with so much boldness they have declared against all nations is to prevent the poor from becoming the instruments and victims of these persons and descriptions it is but too easy if you once teach poor laborers and mechanics to desy their prejudices and as this has been done with an industry scarcely credible to substitute the principles of fraternity in the room of that salutary prejudice called our country it is i say but too easy to pursuade them agreeably to what mr fox hints in his public letter that this war is and that the other wars have been the wars of kings it is easy to persuade them that the terrors even of a foreign conquest are not terrors for them  it is easy to persuade them that for their part they have nothing to lose and that their condition is not likely to be altered for the worse whatever party may happen to prevail in the war under any circumstances this doctrine is highly dangerous as it tends to make separate parties of the higher and lower orders and to put their interests on a different bottom but if the enemy you have to deal with should appear as france now appears under the very name and title of the deliverer of the poor and the chastiser of the rich the former class would readily become not an indifferent spectator of the war but would be ready to enlist in the faction of the enemy which they would consider though under a foreign name to be more connected with them than an adverse description in the same land all the props of society would be drawn from us by these doctrines and the very foundations of the public defense would give way in an instant     there is no point which the faction of fraternity in england have labored more than to excite in the poor the horror of any war with france upon any occasion when they found that their open attacks upon our constitution in favor of a french republic were for the present repelled  they put that matter out of sight and have taken up the more plausible and popular ground of general peace upon merely general principles although these very men in the correspondence of their clubs with those of france had reprobated the neutrality which now they so earnestly press but in reality their maxim was and is peace and alliance with france and war with the rest of the world     this last motion of mr fox bound up the whole of his politics during the session this motion had many circumstances particularly in the norwich correspondence by which the mischief of all the others was aggravated beyond measure yet this last motion far the worst of mr foxs proceedings was the best supported of any of them except his amendment to the address the duke of portland had directly engaged to support the war  here was a motion as directly made to force the crown to put an end to it before a blow had been struck the efforts of the faction have so prevailed that some of his graces nearest friends have actually voted for that motion some after showing themselves went away others did not appear at all so it must be where a man is for any time supported from personal considerations without reference to his public conduct through the whole of this business the spirit of fraternity appears to me to have been the governing principle it might be shameful for any man above the vulgar to show so blind a partiality even to his own country as mr fox appears on all occasions this session to have shown to france had mr fox been a minister and proceeded on the principles laid down by him i believe there is little doubt he would have been considered as the most criminal statesman that ever lived in this country i do not know why a statesman out of place is not to be judged in the same manner unless we can excuse him by pleading in his favor a total indifference to principle and that he would act and think in quite a different way if he were in office this i will not suppose one may think better of him and that in case of his power he might change his mind but supposing that from better or from worse motives he might change his mind on his acquisition of the favor of the crown i seriously fear that if the king should tomorrow put power into his hands and that his good genius would inspire him with maxims very different from those he has promulgated he would not be able to get the better of the ill temper and the ill doctrines he has been the means of exciting and propagating throughout the kingdom from the very beginning of their inhuman and unprovoked rebellion and tyrannick usurpation he has covered the predominant faction in france and their adherents here with the most exaggerated panegyricks neither has he missed a single opportunity of abusing and vilifying those who in uniform concurrence with the duke of portlands and lord fitzwilliams opinion have maintained the true grounds of the revolution settlement in      he lamented all the defeats of the french he rejoiced in all their victories even when these victories threatened to overwhelm the continent of europe and by facilitating their means of penetrating into holland to bring this most dreadful of all evils with irresistible force to the very doors if not into the very heart of our country to this hour he always speaks of every thought of overturning the french jacobinism by force on the part of any power whatsoever as an attempt unjust and cruel and which he reprobates with horror if any of the french jacobin leaders are spoken of with hatred or scorn he falls upon those who take that liberty with all the zeal and warmth with which men of honor defend their particular and bosom friends when attacked he always represents their cause as a cause of liberty and all who oppose it as partisans of despotism he obstinately continues to consider the great and growing vices crimes and disorders of that country as only evils of passage which are to produce a permanently happy state of order and freedom he represents these disorders exactly in the same way and with the same limitations which are used by one of the two great jacobin factions i mean that of petion and brissot like them he studiously confines his horror and reprobation only to the massacres of the second of september and passes by those of the  0th of august as well as the imprisonment and deposition of the king which were the consequences of that day as indeed were the massacres themselves to which he confines his censure though they were not actually perpetrated till early in september like that faction he condemns not the deposition or the proposed exile or perpetual imprisonment but only the murder of the king mr sheridan on every occasion palliates all their massacres committed in every part of france as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of despotism and of the dread of the people of returning under that yoke  he has thus taken occasion to load not the actors in this wickedness but the government of a mild merciful beneficent and patriotick prince and his suffering faithful subjects with all the crimes of the new anarchical tyranny under which the one has been murdered and the others are oppressed those continual either praifes or palliating apologies of every thing done in france and those invectives as uniformly vomited out upon all those who venture to express their disapprobation of such proceedings coming from a man of mr foxs fame and authority and one who is considered as the person to whom a great party of the wealthiest men of the kingdom look up have been the cause why the principle of french fraternity formerly gained the ground which at one time it had obtained in this country it will infallibly recover itself again and in ten times a greater degree if the kind of peace in the manner which he preaches ever shall be established with the reigning faction in france  0   so far as to the french practices with regard to france and the other powers of europe  as to their principles and doctrines with regard to the constitution of states mr fox studiously on all occasions and indeed when no occasion calls for it as on the debate of the petition for reform brings forward and asserts their fundamental and fatal principle pregnant with every mischief and every crime namely that in every country the people is the legitimate sovereign exactly conformable to the declaration of the french clubs and legislators  la souverainete est une indivisible inalienable et imprescriptible  elle appartient a la nation  aucune section du peuple ni aucun individu ne peut sen attribuer lexercise this confounds in a manner equally mischievous and stupid the origin of a government from the people with its continuance in their hands i believe that no such doctrine has ever been heard of in any public act of any government whatsoever until it was adopted i think from the writings of rousseau by the french assemblies who have made it the basis of their constitution at home and of the matter of their apostolate in every country these and other wild declarations of abstract principle mr fox says are in themselves perfectly right and true though in some cases he allows the french draw absurd consequences from them but i conceive he is mistaken the consequences are most logically though most mischievously drawn from the premises and principles by that wicked and ungracious faction the fault is in the foundation     before society in a multitude of men it is obvious that sovereignty and subjection are ideas which cannot exist it is the compact on which society is formed that makes both but to suppose the people contrary to their compacts both to give away and retain the same thing is altogether absurd it is worse for it supposes in any strong combination of men a power and right of always dissolving the social union which power however if it exists renders them again as little sovereigns as subjects but a mere unconnected multitude it is not easy to state for what good end at a time like this when the foundations of all ancient and prescriptive governments such as ours to which people submit not because they have chosen them but because they are born to them are undermined by perilous theories that mr fox should be so fond of referring to those theories upon all occasions even though speculatively they might be true which god forbid they should particularly i do not see the reason why he should be so fond of declaring that the principles of the revolution have made the crown of great britain elective why he thinks it seasonable to preach up with so much earnestness for now three years together the doctrine of resistance and revolution at all or to assert that our last revolution of      stands on the same or similar principles with that of france we are not called upon to bring forward these doctrines which are hardly ever resorted to but in cases of extremity and where they are followed by correspondent actions we are not called upon by any circumstance that i know of which can justify a revolt or which demands a revolution or can make an election of a successor to the crown necessary whatever latent right may be supposed to exist for effectuating any of these purposes   0 not the least alarming of the proceedings of mr fox and his friends in this session especially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings with regard to france and its principles is their eagerness at this season under pretense of parliamentary reforms a project which had been for some time rather dormant to discredit and disgrace the house of commons for this purpose these gentlemen had found a way to insult the house by several atrocious libels in the form of petitions in particular they brought up a libel or rather a complete digest of libellous matter from the club called the friends of the people it is indeed at once the most audacious and the most insidious of all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared it is said to be the penmanship of mr tierney to bring whom into parliament the duke of portland formerly had taken a good deal of pains and expended as i hear a considerable sum of money     among the circumstances of danger from that piece and from its precedent it is observable that this is the first petition if i remember right coming from a club or association signed by individuals denoting neither local residence nor corporate capacity this mode of petition not being strictly illegal or informal though in its spirit in the highest degree mischievous may and will lead to other things of that nature tending to bring these clubs and associations to the french model and to make them in the end answer french purposes i mean that without legal names these clubs will be led to assume political capacities that they may debate the forms of constitution and that from their meetings they may insolently dictate their will to the regular authorities of the kingdom in the manner in which the jacobin clubs issue their mandates to the national assembly or the national convention the audacious remonstrance i observe is signed by all of that association the friends of the people who are not in parliament and it was supported most strenuously by all the associators who are members with mr fox at their head he and they contended for referring this libel to a committee upon the question of that reference they grounded all their debate for a change in the constitution of parliament the pretended petition is in fact a regular charge or impeachment of the house of commons digested into a number of articles this plan of reform is not a criminal impeachment but a matter of prudence to be submitted to the public wisdom which must be as well apprised of the facts as petitioners can be but those accusers of the house of commons have proceeded upon the principles of a criminal process and have had the effrontery to offer proof on each article     this charge the party of mr fox maintained article by article beginning with the first namely the interference of peers at elections and their nominating in effect several of the members of the house of commons in the printed list of grievances which they made out on the occasion and in support of their charge is found the borough for which under lord fitzwilliams influence i now sit by this remonstrance and its object they hope to defeat the operation of property in elections and in reality to dissolve the connection and communication of interests which makes the houses of parliament a mutual support to each other mr fox and the friends of the people are not so ignorant as not to know that peers do not interfere in elections as peers but as men of property  they well know that the house of lords is by itself the feeblest part of the constitution they know that the house of lords is supported only by its connexions with the crown and with the house of commons and that without this double connection the lords could not exist a single year they know that all these parts of our constitution whilst they are balanced as opposing interests are also connected as friends otherwise nothing but confusion could be the result of such a complex constitution it is natural therefore that they who wish the common destruction of the whole and of all its parts should contend for their total separation but as the house of commons is that link which connects both the other parts of the constitution the crown and the lords with the mass of the people it is to that link as it is natural enough that their incessant attacks are directed that artificial representation of the people being once discredited and overturned all goes to pieces and nothing but a plain french democracy or arbitrary monarchy can possibly exist     some of these gentlemen who have attacked the house of commons lean to a representation of the people by the head that is to individual representation none of them that i recollect except mr fox directly rejected it it is remarkable however that he only rejected it by simply declaring an opinion he let all the argument go against his opinion all the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends lead to individual representation and to nothing else it deserves to be attentively observed that this individual representation is the only plan of their reform which has been explicitly proposed in the mean time the conduct of mr fox appears to be far more inexplicable on any good ground than theirs who propose the individual representation for he neither proposes any thing nor even suggests that he has any thing to propose in lieu of the present mode of constituting the house of commons on the contrary he declares against all the plans which have yet been suggested either from himself or others yet thus unprovided with any plan whatsoever he pressed forward this unknown reform with all possible warmth and for that purpose in a speech of several hours he urged the referring to a committee the libellous impeachment of the house of commons by the association of the friends of the people but for mr fox to discredit parliament as it stands to countenance leagues covenants and associations for its further discredit to render it perfectly odious and contemptible and at the same time to propose nothing at all in place of what he disgraces is worse if possible than to contend for personal individual representation and is little less than demanding in plain terms to bring on plain anarchy     mr fox and these gentlemen have for the present been defeated but they are neither converted nor disheartened they have solemnly declared that they will persevere until they shall have obtained their ends persisting to assert that the house of commons not only is not the true representative of the people but that it does not answer the purpose of such representation most of them insist that all the debts the taxes and the burdens of all kinds on the people with every other evil and inconvenience which we have suffered since the revolution have been owing solely to an house of commons which does not speak the sense of the people     it is also not to be forgotten that mr fox and all who hold with him on this as on all other occasions of pretended reform most bitterly reproach mr pit with treachery in declining to support the scandalous charges and indefinite projects of this infamous libel from the friends of the people by the animosity with which they persecute all those who grow cold in this cause of pretended reform they hope that if through levity inexperience or ambition any young person like mr pit for instance happens to be once embarked in their design they shall by a false shame keep him fast in it for ever many they have so hampered     i know it is usual when the peril and alarm of the hour appears to be a little overblown to think no more of the matter but for my part i look back with horror on what we have escaped and am full of anxiety with regard to the dangers which in my opinion are still to be apprehended both at home and abroad this business has cast deep roots whether it is necessarily connected in theory with jacobinism is not worth a dispute the two things are connected in fact the partisans of the one are the partisans of the other i know it is common with those who are favorable to the gentlemen of mr foxs party and to their leader though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects or their gallican politics to argue in palliation of their conduct that it is not in their power to do all the harm which their actions evidently tend to it is said that as the people will not support them they may safely be indulged in those eccentric fancies of reform and those theories which lead to nothing this apology is not very much to the honor of those politicians whose interests are to be adhered to in defiance of their conduct i cannot flatter myself that these incessant attacks on the constitution of parliament are safe it is not in my power to despise the unceasing efforts of a confederacy of about fifty persons of eminence men for the far greater part of very ample fortunes either in possession or in expectancy men of decided characters and vehement passions men of very great talents of all kinds of much boldness and of the greatest possible spirit of artifice intrigue adventure and enterprise all operating with unwearied activity and perseverance these gentlemen are much stronger too without doors than some calculate they have the more active part of the dissenters with them and the whole clan of speculators of all denominations  a large and growing species they have that floating multitude which goes with events and which suffers the loss or gain of a battle to decide it is opinions of right and wrong as long as by every art this party keeps alive a spirit of disaffection against the very constitution of the kingdom and attributes as lately it has been in the habit of doing all the public misfortunes to that constitution it is absolutely impossible but that some moment must arrive in which they will be enabled to produce a pretended reform and a real revolution if ever the body of this compound constitution of ours is subverted either in favor of unlimited monarchy or of wild democracy that ruin will most certainly be the result of this very sort of machinations against the house of commons it is not from a confidence in the views or intentions of any statesman that i think he is to be indulged in these perilous amusements     before it is made the great object of any mans political life to raise another to power it is right to consider what are the real dispositions of the person to be so elevated we are not to form our judgment on these dispositions from the rules and principles of a court of justice but from those of private discretion not looking for what would serve to criminate another but what is sufficient to direct ourselves by a comparison of a series of the discourses and actions of certain men for a reasonable length of time it is impossible not to obtain sufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and principles there is no other rational mode of proceeding it is true that in some one or two perhaps not wellweighed expressions or some one or two unconnected and doubtful affairs we may and ought to judge of the actions or words by our previous good or ill opinion of the man but this allowance has its bounds it does not extend to any regular course of systematick action or of constant and repeated discourse it is against every principle of common sense and of justice to oneself and to the public to judge of a series of speeches and actions from the man and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and conduct i have stated the above matters not as inferring a criminal charge of evil intention if i had meant to do so perhaps they are stated with tolerable exactness  but i have no such view the intentions of these gentlemen may be very pure i do not dispute it but i think they are in some great error if these things are done by mr fox and his friends with good intentions they are not done less dangerously for it shows these good intentions are not under the direction of safe maxims and principles     mr fox mr sheridan and the gentlemen who call themselves the phalanx have not been so very indulgent to others they have thought proper to ascribe to those members of the house of commons who in exact agreement with the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam abhor and oppose the french system the basest and most unworthy motives for their conduct  as if none could oppose that atheistick immoral and impolitick project set up in france so disgraceful and destructive as i conceive to human nature itself but with some sinister intentions they treat those members on all occasions with a sort of lordly insolence though they are persons that whatever homage they may pay to the eloquence of the gentlemen who choose to look down upon them with scorn are not their inferiors in any particular which calls for and obtains just consideration from the public not their inferiors in knowledge of public law or of the constitution of the kingdom not their inferiors in their acquaintance with its foreign and domestic interests not their inferiors in experience or practice of business not their inferiors in moral character not their inferiors in the proofs they have given of zeal and industry in the service of their country without denying to these gentlemen the respect and consideration which it is allowed justly belongs to them we see no reason why they should not as well be obliged to defer something to our opinions as that we should be bound blindly and servilely to follow those of mr fox mr sheridan mr gray mr courtney mr lambton mr whitbread mr francis mr tailor and others we are members of parliament and their equals we never consider ourselves as their followers these gentlemen some of them hardly born when some of us came into parliament have thought proper to treat us as deserters as if we had been listed into their phalanx like soldiers and had sworn to live and die in their french principles this insolent claim of superiority on their part and of a sort of vassalage to them on that of other members is what no liberal mind will submit to bear     the society of the liberty of the press the whig club and the society for constitutional information and i believe the friends of the people as well as some clubs in scotland have indeed declared that their confidence in and attachment to mr fox has lately been confirmed strengthened and increased by the calumnies as they are called against him it is true mr fox and his friends have those testimonies in their favor against certain old friends of the duke of portland yet on a full serious and i think dispassionate consideration of the whole of what mr fox and mr sheridan and their friends have acted said and written in this session instead of doing any thing which might tend to procure power or any share of it whatsoever to them or to their phalanx as they call it or to increase their credit influence or popularity in the nation i think it one of my most serious and important public duties in whatsoever station i may be placed for the short time i have to live effectually to employ my best endeavors by every prudent and every lawful means to traverse all their designs i have only to lament that my abilities are not greater and that my probability of life is not better for the more effectual pursuit of that object but i trust that neither the principles nor exertions will die with me i am the rather confirmed in this my resolution and in this my wish of transmitting it because every ray of hope concerning a possible control or mitigation of the enormous mischiefs which the principles of these gentlemen and which their connexions full as dangerous as their principles might receive from the influence of the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam on becoming their colleagues in office is now entirely banished from the mind of every one living  it is apparent even to the world at large that so far from having a power to direct or to guide mr fox mr sheridan mr gray and the rest in any important matter they have not through this session been able to prevail on them to forbear or to delay or mitigate or soften any one act or any one expression upon subjects on which they essentially differed   0 even if this hope of a possible control did exist yet the declared opinions and the uniform line of conduct conformable to those opinions pursued by mr fox must become a matter of serious alarm if he should obtain a power either at court or in parliament or in the nation at large and for this plain reason  he must be the most active and efficient member in any administration of which he shall form a part that a man or set of men are guided by such not dubious but delivered and avowed principles and maxims of policy as to need a watch and check on them in the exercise of the highest power ought in my opinion to make every man who is not of the same principles and guided by the same maxims a little cautious how he makes himself one of the traverses of a ladder to help such a man or such a set of men to climb up to the highest authority a minister of this country is to be controulled by the house of commons he is to be trusted not controulled by his colleagues in office if he were to be controulled government which ought to be the source of order would itself become a scene of anarchy besides mr fox is a man of an aspiring and commanding mind made rather to control than to be controulled and he never will be nor can be in any administration in which he will be guided by any of those whom i have been accustomed to confide in it is absurd to think that he would or could if his own opinions do not control him nothing can when we consider of an adherence to a man which leads to his power we must not only see what the man is but how he stands related it is not to be forgotten that mr fox acts in close and inseparable connection with another gentleman of exactly the same description as himself and who perhaps of the two is the leader the rest of the body are not a great deal more tractable and over them if mr fox and mr sheridan have authority most assuredly the duke of portland has not the smallest degree of influence     one must take care that a blind partiality to some persons and as blind an hatred to others may not enter into our minds under a color of inflexible public principle we hear as a reason for clinging to mr fox at present that nine years ago mr pit got into power by mischievous intrigues with the court with the dissenters and with other factious people out of parliament to the discredit and weakening of the power of the house of commons his conduct nine years ago i still hold to be very culpable there are however many things very culpable that i do not know how to punish my opinion on such matters i must submit to the good of the state as i have done on other occasions and particularly with regard to the authors and managers of the american war with whom i have acted both in office and in opposition with great confidence and cordiality though i thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable whilst the misconduct of mr pit and his associates was yet recent it was not possible to get mr fox of himself to take a single step or even to countenance others in taking any step upon the ground of that misconduct and false policy though if the matters had been then taken up and pursued such a step could not have appeared so evidently desperate as now it is  so far from pursuing mr pit i know that then and for some time after some of mr foxs friends were actually and with no small earnestness looking out to a coalition with that gentleman for years i never heard this circumstance of mr pitts misconduct on that occasion mentioned by mr fox either in public or in private as a ground for opposition to that minister all opposition from that period to this very session has proceeded upon the separate measures as they separately arose without any vindictive retrospect to mr pitts conduct in      my memory however may fail me i must appeal to the printed debates which so far as mr fox is concerned are unusually accurate     whatever might have been in our power at an early period at this day i see no remedy for what was done in      i had no great hopes even at the time i was therefore very eager to record a remonstrance on the journals of the house of commons as a caution against such a popular delusion in times to come and this i then feared and now am certain is all that could be done i know of no way of animadverting on the crown i know of no mode of calling to account the house of lords who threw out the india bill in a way not much to their credit as little or rather less am i able to coerce the people at large who behaved very unwisely and intemperately on that occasion mr pit was then accused by me as well as others of attempting to be minister without enjoying the confidence of the house of commons though he did enjoy the confidence of the crown that house of commons whose confidence he did not enjoy unfortunately did not itself enjoy the confidence though we well deserved it either of the crown or of the public for want of that confidence the then house of commons did not survive the contest since that period mr pit has enjoyed the confidence of the crown and of the lords and of the house of commons through two successive parliaments and i suspect that he has ever since and that he does still enjoy as large a portion at least of the confidence of the people without doors as his great rival before whom then is mr pit to be impeached and by whom the more i consider the matter the more firmly i am convinced that the idea of proscribing mr pit indirectly when you cannot directly punish him is as chimerical a project and as unjustifiable as it would be to have proscribed lord north for supposing that by indirect ways of opposition by opposition upon measures which do not relate to the business of      but which on other grounds might prove unpopular you were to drive him from his seat this would be no example whatever of punishment for the matters we charge as offenses in      on a cool and dispassionate view of the affairs of this time and country it appears obvious to me that one or the other of those two great men that is mr pit or mr fox must be minister they are i am sorry for it irreconcilable mr foxs conduct in this session has rendered the idea of his power a matter of serious alarm to many people who were very little pleased with the proceedings of mr pit in the beginning of his administration they like neither the conduct of mr pit in      nor that of mr fox in      but they estimate which of the evils is most pressing at the time and what is likely to be the consequence of a change if mr fox be wedded they must be sensible that his opinions and principles on the now existing state of things at home and abroad must be taken as his portion in his train must also be taken the whole body of gentlemen who are pledged to him and to each other and to their common politics and principles  i believe no king of great britain ever will adopt for his confidential servants that body of gentlemen holding that body of principles even if the present king or his successor should think fit to take that step i apprehend a general discontent of those who wish that this nation and that europe should continue in their present state would ensue a discontent which combined with the principles and progress of the new men in power would shake this kingdom to its foundations i do not believe any one political conjecture can be more certain than this     without at all defending or palliating mr pitts conduct in      i must observe that the crisis of      with regard to every thing at home and abroad is full as important as that of      ever was and if for no other reason by being present is much more important it is not to nine years ago we are to look for the danger of mr foxs and mr sheridans conduct and that of the gentlemen who act with them it is at this very time and in this very session that if they had not been strenuously resisted they would not only merely have discredited the house of commons as mr pit did in      when he persuaded the king to reject their advice and to appeal from them to the people but in my opinion would have been the means of wholly subverting the house of commons and the house of peers and the whole constitution actual and virtual together with the safety and independence of this nation and the peace and settlement of every state in the now christian world it is to our opinion of the nature of jacobinism and of the probability by corruption faction and force of its gaining ground every where that the question whom and what you are to support is to be determined for my part without doubt or hesitation i look upon jacobinism as the most dreadful and the most shameful evil which ever afflicted mankind a thing which goes beyond the power of all calculation in its mischief and that if it is suffered to exist in france we must in england and speedily too fall into that calamity     i figure to myself the purpose of these gentlemen accomplished and this ministry destroyed i see that the persons who in that case must rule can be no other than mr fox mr sheridan mr gray the marquis of lansdowne lord thurlow lord lauderdale and the duke of norfolk with the other chiefs of the friends of the people the parliamentary reformers and the admirers of the french revolution the principal of these are all formally pledged to their projects if the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam should be admitted into that system as they might and probably would be it is quite certain they could not have the smallest weight in it less indeed than what they now possess if less were possible because they would be less wanted than they now are and because all those who wished to join them and to act under them have been rejected by the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam themselves and mr fox finding them thus by themselves disarmed has built quite a new fabric upon quite a new foundation there is no trifling on this subject we see very distinctly before us the ministry that would be formed and the plan that would be pursued if we like the plan we must wish the power of those who are to carry it into execution but to pursue the political exaltation of those whose political measures we disapprove and whose principles we dissent from is a species of modern politics not easily comprehensible and which must end in the ruin of the country if it should continue and spread mr pit may be the worst of men and mr fox may be the best but at present the former is in the interest of his country and of the order of things long established in europe mr fox is not i have for one been born in this order of things and would fain die in it i am sure it is sufficient to make men as virtuous as happy and as knowing as any thing which mr fox and his friends abroad or at home would substitute in its place and i should be sorry that any set of politicians should obtain power in england whose principles or schemes should lead them to countenance persons or factions whose object is to introduce some new devised order of things into england or to support that order where it is already introduced in france a place in which if it can be fixed in my mind it must have a certain and decided influence in and upon this kingdom this is my account of my conduct to my private friends i have already said all i wish to say or nearly so to the public i write this with pain and with an heart full of grief  letter to   esquire occasioned by the account given in a newspaper of the speech made in the house of lords by the  of  in the debate concerning lord fitzwilliam      letter etc beaconsfield may         my dear sir i have been told of the voluntary which for the entertainment of the house of lords has been lately played by his grace the  of  a great deal at my expense and a little at his own i confess i should have liked the composition rather better if it had been quite new but every man has his taste and his grace is an admirer of ancient music  there may be sometimes too much even of a good thing a toast is good and a bumper is not bad but the best toasts may be so often repeated as to disgust the palate and ceaseless rounds of bumpers may nauseate and overload the stomach the ears of the most steadyvoting politicians may at last be stunned with three times three i am sure i have been very grateful for the flattering remembrance made of me in the toasts of the revolution society and of other clubs formed on the same laudable plan after giving the brimming honors to citizen thomas pain and to citizen dr priestley the gentlemen of these clubs seldom failed to bring me forth in my turn and to drink mr burke and thanks to him for the discussion he has provoked  i found myself elevated with this honor for even by the collision of resistance to be the means of striking out sparkles of truth if not merit is at least felicity  here i might have rested but when i found that the great advocate mr erskine condescended to resort to these bumper toasts as the pure and exuberant fountains of politics and of rhetoric as i hear he did in three or four speeches made in defense of certain worthy citizens i was rather let down a little though still somewhat proud of myself i was not quite so proud of my voucher though he is no idolater of fame in some way or other mr erskine will always do himself honor methinks however in following the precedents of these toasts he seemed to do more credit to his diligence as a special pleader than to his invention as an orator to those who did not know the abundance of his resources both of genius and erudition there was something in it that indicated the want of a good assortment with regard to richness and variety in the magazine of topics and commonplaces which i suppose he keeps by him in imitation of cicero and other renowned declaimers of antiquity  mr erskine supplied something i allow from the stores of his imagination in metamorphosing the jovial toasts of clubs into solemn special arguments at the bar so far the thing showed talent however i must still prefer the bar of the tavern to the other bar the toasts at the first hand were better than the arguments at the second even when the toasts began to grow old as sarcasms they were washed down with still older pricked election port then the acid of the wine made some amends for the want of any thing piquant in the wit but when his grace gave them a second transformation and brought out the vapid stuff which had wearied the clubs and disgusted the courts the drug made up of the bottoms of rejected bottles all smelling so woefully of the cork and of the cask and of every thing except the honest old lamp and when that sad draught had been farther infected with the gaol pollution of the old bailey and was dashed and brewed and ineffectually stummed again into a senatorial exordium in the house of lords i found all the high flavor and mantling of my honors tasteless flat and stale unluckily the new tax on wine is felt even in the greatest fortunes and his grace submits to take up with the heeltaps of mr erskine  i have had the ill or good fortune to provoke two great men of this age to the publication of their opinions i mean citizen thomas pain and his grace the  of  i am not so great a leveller as to put these two great men on a par either in the state or the republic of letters but the field of glory is a field for all it is a large one indeed and we all may run god knows where in chase of glory over the boundless expanse of that wild heath whose horizon always flies before us i assure his grace if he will yet give me leave to call him so whatever may be said on the authority of the clubs or of the bar that citizen pain who they will have it hunts with me in couples and who only moves as i drag him along has a sufficient activity in his own native benevolence to dispose and enable him to take the lead for himself he is ready to blaspheme his god to insult his king and to libel the constitution of his country without any provocation from me or any encouragement from his grace i assure him that i shall not be guilty of the injustice of charging mr paines next work against religion and human society upon his graces excellent speech in the house of lords i farther assure this noble duke that i neither encouraged nor provoked that worthy citizen to seek for plenty liberty safety justice or lenity in the famine in the prisons in the decrees of convention in the revolutionary tribunal and in the guillotine of paris rather than quietly to take up with what he could find in the glutted markets the unbarricadoed streets the drowsy old bailey judges or at worst the airy wholesome pillory of old england the choice of country was his own taste the writings were the effects of his own zeal in spite of his friend dr priestley he was a free agent i admit indeed that my praises of the british government loaded with all its encumbrances clogged with its peers and its beef its parsons and its pudding its commons and its beer and its dull slavish liberty of going about just as one pleases had something to provoke a jockey of norfolk mr pain is a norfolk man from thetford  who was inspired with the resolute ambition of becoming a citizen of france to do something which might render him worthy of naturalization in that grand asylum of persecuted merit something which should entitle him to a place in the senate of the adoptive country of all the gallant generous and humane this i say was possible but the truth is with great deference to his grace i say it citizen pain acted without any provocation at all he acted solely from the native impulses of his own excellent heart  his grace like an able orator as he is begins with giving me a great deal of praise for talents which i do not possess he does this to entitle himself on the credit of this gratuitous kindness to exaggerate my abuse of the parts which his bounty and not that of nature has bestowed upon me in this too he has condescended to copy mr erskine these priests i hope they will excuse me i mean priests of the rights of man begin by crowning me with their flowers and their fillets and bedewing me with their odours as a preface to their knocking me on the head with their consecrated axes i have injured say they the constitution and i have abandoned the whig party and the whig principles that i professed i do not mean my dear sir to defend myself against his grace i have not much interest in what the world shall think or say of me as little has the world an interest in what i shall think or say of any one in it and i wish that his grace had suffered an unhappy man to enjoy in his retreat the melancholy privileges of obscurity and sorrow at any rate i have spoken and i have written on the subject if i have written or spoken so poorly as to be quite forgot a fresh apology will not make a more lasting impression i must let the tree lie as it falls perhaps i must take some shame to myself i confess that i have acted on my own principles of government and not on those of his grace which are i dare say profound and wise but which i do not pretend to understand as to the party to which he alludes and which has long taken its leave of me i believe the principles of the book which he condemns are very conformable to the opinions of many of the most considerable and most grave in that description of politicians a few indeed who i admit are equally respectable in all points differ from me and talk his graces language i am too feeble to contend with them they have the field to themselves there are others very young and very ingenious persons who form probably the largest part of what his grace i believe is pleased to consider as that party some of them were not born into the world and all of them were children when i entered into that connection i give due credit to the censorial brow to the broad phylacteries and to the imposing gravity of those magisterial rabbis and doctors in the cabala of political science i admit that wisdom is as the gray hair to man and that learning is like honorable old age but at a time when liberty is a good deal talked of perhaps i might be excused if i caught something of the general indocility it might not be surprising if i lengthened my chain a link or two and in an age of relaxed discipline gave a trifling indulgence to my own notions if that could be allowed perhaps i might sometimes by accident and without an unpardonable crime trust as much to my own very careful and very laborious though perhaps somewhat purblind disquisitions as to their soaring intuitive eagleeyed authority but the modern liberty is a precious thing it must not be profaned by too vulgar an use it belongs only to the chosen few who are born to the hereditary representation of the whole democracy and who leave nothing at all no not the offal to us poor outcasts of the plebeian race  amongst those gentlemen who came to authority as soon or sooner than they came of age i do not mean to include his grace with all those native titles to empire over our minds which distinguish the others he has a large share of experience he certainly ought to understand the british constitution better than i do he has studied it in the fundamental part for one election i have seen he has been concerned in twenty nobody is less of a visionary theorist nobody has drawn his speculations more from practice no peer has condescended to superintend with more vigilance the declining franchises of the poor commons with thrice great hermes he has outwatched the bear often have his candles been burned to the snuff and glimmered and stunk in the sockets whilst he grew pale at his constitutional studies long sleepless nights has he wasted long laborious shiftless journies has he made and great sums has he expended in order to secure the purity the independence and the sobriety of elections and to give a check if possible to the ruinous charges that go nearly to the destruction of the right of election itself  amidst these his labors his grace will be pleased to forgive me if my zeal less enlightened to be sure than his by midnight lamps and studies has presumed to talk too favorably of this constitution and even to say something sounding like approbation of that body which has the honor to reckon his grace at the head of it those who dislike this partiality or if his grace pleases this flattery of mine have a comfort at hand i may be refuted and brought to shame by the most convincing of all refutations a practical refutation every individual peer for himself may show that i was ridiculously wrong the whole body of those noble persons may refute me for the whole corpse if they please they are more powerful advocates against themselves than a thousand scribblers like me can be in their favor if i were even possessed of those powers which his grace in order to heighten my offense is pleased to attribute to me there would be little difference the eloquence of mr erskine might save mr  from the gallows but no eloquence could save mr jackson from the effects of his own potion  in that unfortunate book of mine which is put in the index expurgatorius of the modern whigs i might have spoken too favorably not only of those who wear coronets but of those who wear crowns kings however have not only long arms but strong ones too a great northern potentate for instance is able in one moment and with one bold stroke of his diplomatick pen to efface all the volumes which i could write in a century or which the most laborious publicists of germany ever carried to the fair of leipsick as an apology for monarchs and monarchy whilst i or any other poor puny private sophist was defending the declaration of pilnitz his majesty might refute me by the treaty of basle such a monarch may destroy one republic because it had a king at its head and he may balance this extraordinary act by sounding another republic that has cut off the head of its king i defended that great potentate for associating in a grand alliance for the preservation of the old governments of europe but he puts me to silence by delivering up all those governments his own virtually included to the new system of france if he is accused before the parisian tribunal constituted for the trial of kings for having polluted the soil of liberty by the tracks of his disciplined slaves he clears himself by surrendering the finest parts of germany with a handsome cut of his own territories to the offended majesty of the regicides of france can i resist this am i responsible for it if with a torch in his hand and a rope about his neck he makes amend honorable to the sansculotterie of the republic one and indivisible in that humiliating attitude in spite of my protests he may supplicate pardon for his menacing proclamations and as an expiation to those whom he failed to terrify with his threats he may abandon those whom he had seduced by his promises he may sacrifice the royalists of france whom he had called to his standard as a salutary example to those who shall adhere to their native sovereign or shall confide in any other who undertakes the cause of oppressed kings and of loyal subjects  how can i help it if this highminded prince will subscribe to the invectives which the regicides have made against all kings and particularly against himself how can i help it if this royal propagandist will preach the doctrine of the rights of men is it my fault if his professors of literature read lectures on that code in all his academies and if all the pensioned managers of the newspapers in his dominions diffuse it throughout europe in an hundred journals can it be attributed to me if he will initiate all his grenadiers and all his hussars in these high mysteries am i responsible if he will make le droit de lhomme or la souverainete du peuple the favorite parole of his military orders now that his troops are to act with the brave legions of freedom no doubt he will fit them for their fraternity he will teach the prussians to think to feel and to act like them and to emulate the glories of the regiment de lechaffaut he will employ the illustrious citizen santerre the general of his new allies to instruct the dull germans how they shall conduct themselves toward persons who like louis the xvith whose cause and person he once took into his protection shall dare without the sanction of the people or with it to consider themselves as hereditary kings can i arrest this great potentate in his career of glory am i blameable in recommending virtue and religion as the true foundation of all monarchies because the protector of the three religions of the westphalian arrangement to ingratiate himself with the republic of philosophy shall abolish all the three it is not in my power to prevent the grand patron of the reformed church if he chooses it from annulling the calvinistick sabbath and establishing the decadi of atheism in all his states he may even renounce and abjure his favorite mysticism in the temple of reason in these things at least he is truly despotick he has now shaken hands with every thing which at first had inspired him with horror it would be curious indeed to see what i shall not however travel so far to see the ingenious devices and the elegant transparencies which on the restoration of peace and the commencement of prussian liberty are to decorate potzdam and charlottenburg festigiante what shades of his armed ancestors of the house of brandenburgh will the committee of illumines raise up in the operahouse of berlin to dance a grand ballet in the rejoicings for this auspicious event is it a grand master of the teutonick order or is it the great elector is it the first king of prussia or the last or is the whole long line long i mean a part ante to appear like banquos royal procession in the tragedy of macbeth  how can i prevent all these arts of royal policy and all these displays of royal magnificence how can i prevent the successor of frederick the great from aspiring to a new and in this age unexampled kind of glory is it in my power to say that he shall not make his confessions in the style of st austin or of rousseau that he shall not assume the character of the penitent and flagellant and grafting monkery on philosophy strip himself of his regal purple clothe his gigantick limbs in the sackcloth and the hairshirt and exercise on his broad shoulders the disciplinary scourge of the holy order of the sansculottes it is not in me to hinder kings from making new orders of religious and martial knighthood i am not hercules enough to uphold those orbs which the atlasses of the world are so desirous of snifting from their weary shoulders what can be done against the magnanimous resolution of the great to accomplish the degradation and the ruin of their own character and situation  what i say of the german princes that i say of all the other dignities and all the other institutions of the holy roman empire if they have a mind to destroy themselves they may put their advocates to silence and their advisers to shame i have often praised the aulick council it is very true i did so i thought it a tribunal as well formed as human wisdom could form a tribunal for coercing the great the rich and the powerful for obliging them to submit their necks to the imperial laws and to those of nature and of nations a tribunal well conceived for extirpating peculation corruption and oppression from all the parts of that vast heterogeneous mass called the germanic body i should not be inclined to retract these praises upon any of the ordinary lapses into which human infirmity will fall they might still stand though some of their conclusums should taste of the prejudices of country or of faction whether political or religious some degree even of corruption should not make me think them guilty of suicide but if we could suppose that the aulick council not regarding duty or even common decorum listening neither to the secret admonitions of conscience nor to the public voice of fame some of the members basely abandoning their post and others continuing in it only the more infamously to betray it should give a judgment so shameless and so prostitute of such monstrous and even portentous corruption that no example in the history of human depravity or even in the fictions of poetic imagination could possibly match it if it should be a judgment which with cold unfeeling cruelty after long deliberations should condemn millions of innocent people to extortion to rapine and to blood and should devote some of the finest countries upon earth to ravage and desolation  does any one think that any servile apologies of mine or any strutting and bullying insolence of their own can save them from the ruin that must fall on all institutions of dignity or of authority that are perverted from their purport to the oppression of human nature in others and to its disgrace in themselves as the wisdom of men makes such institutions the folly of men destroys them whatever we may pretend there is always more in the soundness of the materials than in the fashion of the work the order of a good building is something but if it be wholly declined from its perpendicular if the cement is loose and incoherent if the stones are scaling with every change of the weather and the whole toppling on our heads what matter is it whether we are crushed by a corinthian or a dorick ruin the fine from of a vessel is a matter of use and of delight it is pleasant to see her decorated with cost and art but what signifies even the mathematical truth of her form what signify all the art and cost with which she can be carved and painted and gilded and covered with decorations from stem to stern what signify all her rigging and sails her flags her pendants and her streamers what signify even her cannon her stores and her provisions if all her planks and timbers be unsound and rotten  quamvis pontica pinus silvae filia nobilis jactes and genus and nomen inutile i have been stimulated i know not how to give you this trouble by what very few except myself would think worth any trouble at all in a speech in the house of lords i have been attacked for the defense of a scheme of government in which that body inheres and in which alone it can exist peers of great britain may become as penitent as the sovereign of prussia they may repent of what they have done in assertion of the honor of their king and in favor of their own safety but never the gloom that lowers over the fortune of the cause nor any thing which the great may do toward hastening their own fall can make me repent of what i have done by pen or voice the only arms i possess in favor of the order of things into which i was born and in which i fondly hoped to die  in the long series of ages which have furnished the matter of history never was so beautiful and so august a spectacle presented to the moral eye as europe afforded the day before the revolution in france i knew indeed that this prosperity contained in itself the seeds of its own danger in one part of the society it caused laxity and debility in the other it produced bold spirits and dark designs a false philosophy passed from academies into courts and the great themselves were infected with the theories which conducted to their ruin knowledge which in the two last centuries either did not exist at all or existed solidly on right principles and in chosen hands was now diffused weakened and perverted general wealth loosened morals relaxed vigilance and increased presumption men of talent began to compare in the partition of the common stock of public prosperity the proportions of the dividends with the merits of the claimants as usual they found their portion not equal to their estimate or perhaps to the public estimate of their own worth when it was once discovered by the revolution in france that a struggle between establishment and rapacity could be maintained though but for one year and in one place i was sure that a practicable breach was made in the whole order of things and in every country religion that held the materials of the fabric together was first systematically loosened all other opinions under the name of prejudices must fall along with it and property left undefended by principles became a repository of spoils to tempt cupidity and not a magazine to furnish arms for defense i knew that attacked on all sides by the infernal energies of talents set in action by vice and disorder authority could not stand upon authority alone it wanted some other support than the poise of its own gravity situations formerly supported persons it now became necessary that personal qualities should support situations formerly where authority was found wisdom and virtue were presumed but now the veil was torn and to keep off sacrilegious intrusion it was necessary that in the sanctuary of government something should be disclosed not only venerable but dreadful government was at once to show itself full of virtue and full of force it was to invite partisans by making it appear to the world that a generous cause was to be asserted one fit for a generous people to engage in from passive submission was it to expect resolute defense no it must have warm advocates and passionate defenders which an heavy discontented acquiescence never could produce what a base and foolish thing is it for any consolidated body of authority to say or to act as if it said i will put my trust not in my own virtue but in your patience i will indulge in effeminacy in indolence in corruption i will give way to all my perverse and vicious humors because you cannot punish me without the hazard of ruining yourselves  i wished to warn the people against the greatest of all evils a blind and furious spirit of innovation under the name of reform i was indeed well aware that power rarely reforms itself so it is undoubtedly when all is quiet about it but i was in hopes that provident fear might prevent fruitless penitence i trusted that danger might produce at least circumspection i flattered myself in a moment like this that nothing would be added to make authority topheavy that the very moment of an earthquake would not be the time chosen for adding a story to our houses i hoped to see the surest of all reforms perhaps the only sure reform the ceasing to do ill in the mean time i wished to the people the wisdom of knowing how to tolerate a condition which none of their efforts can render much more than tolerable it was a condition however in which every thing was to be found that could enable them to live to nature and if so they pleased to live to virtue and to honor  i do not repent that i thought better of those to whom i wished well than they will suffer me long to think that they deserved far from repenting i would to god that new faculties had been called up in me in favor not of this or that man or this or that system but of the general vital principle that whilst it was in its vigor produced the state of things transmitted to us from our fathers but which through the joint operation of the abuses of authority and liberty may perish in our hands i am not of opinion that the race of men and the commonwealths they create like the bodies of individuals grow effete and languid and bloodless and ossify by the necessities of their own conformation and the fatal operation of longevity and time these analogies between bodies natural and politic though they may some times illustrate arguments furnish no argument of themselves they are but too often used under the color of a specious philosophy to find apologies for the despair of laziness and pusillanimity and to excuse the want of all manly efforts when the exigencies of our country call for them the more loudly  how often has public calamity been arrested on the very brink of ruin by the seasonable energy of a single man have we no such man amongst us i am as sure as i am of my being that one vigorous mind without office without situation without public functions of any kind at a time when the want of such a thing is felt as i am sure it is i say one such man confiding in the aid of god and full of just reliance in his own fortitude vigor enterprise and perseverance would first draw to him some few like himself and then that multitudes hardly thought to be in existence would appear and troop about him  if i saw this auspicious beginning baffled and frustrated as i am yet on the very verge of a timely grave abandoned abroad and desolate at home stripped of my boast my hope my consolation my helper my counselor and my guide you know in part what i have lost and would to god i could clear myself of all neglect and fault in that loss yet thus even thus i would rake up the fire under all the ashes that oppress it i am no longer patient of the public eye nor am i of force to win my way and to justle and elbow in a crowd but even in solitude something may be done for society the meditations of the closet have infected senates with a subtle frenzy and inflamed armies with the brands of the furies the cure might come from the same source with the distemper i would add my part to those who would animate the people whose hearts are yet right to new exertions in the old cause  novelty is not the only source of zeal why should not a maccabeus and his brethren arise to assert the honor of the ancient law and to defend the temple of their forefathers with as ardent a spirit as can inspire any innovator to destroy the monuments of the piety and the glory of ancient ages it is not a hazarded assertion it is a great truth that when once things are gone out of their ordinary course it is by acts out of the ordinary course they can alone be reestablished republican spirit can only be combated by a spirit of the same nature of the same nature but informed with another principle and pointing to another end i would persuade a resistance both to the corruption and to the reformation that prevails it will not be the weaker but much the stronger for combating both together a victory over real corruptions would enable us to baffle the spurious and pretended reformations i would not wish to excite or even to tolerate that kind of evil spirit which evokes the powers of hell to rectify the disorders of the earth no i would add my voice with better and i trust more potent charms to draw down justice and wisdom and fortitude from heaven for the correction of human vice and the recalling of human error from the devious ways into which it has been betrayed i would wish to call the impulses of individuals at once to the aid and to the control of authority by this which i call the true republican spirit paradoxical as it may appear monarchies alone can be rescued from the imbecility of courts and the madness of the crowd this republican spirit would not suffer men in high place to bring ruin on their country and on themselves it would reform not by destroying but by saving the great the rich and the powerful such a republican spirit we perhaps fondly conceive to have animated the distinguished heroes and patriots of old who knew no mode of policy but religion and virtue these they would have paramount to all constitutions they would not suffer monarchs or senates or popular assemblies under pretenses of dignity or authority or freedom to shake off those moral riders which reason has appointed to govern every sort of rude power these in appearance loading them by their weight do by that pressure augment their essential force the momentum is increased by the extraneous weight it is true in moral as it is in mechanical science it is true not only in the draught but in the race these riders of the great in effect hold the reins which guide them in their course and wear the spur that stimulates them to the goals of honor and of safety the great must submit to the dominion of prudence and of virtue or none will long submit to the dominion of the great  dis te minorem quod geris imperas this is the feudal tenure which they cannot alter  indeed my dear sir things are in a bad state i do not deny a good share of diligence a very great share of ability and much public virtue to those who direct our affairs but they are encumbered not aided by their very instruments and by all the apparatus of the state i think that our ministry though there are things against them which neither you nor i can dissemble and which grieve to the heart is by far the most honest and by far the wisest system of administration in europe their fall would be no trivial calamity  not meaning to depreciate the minority in parliament whose talents are also great and to whom i do not deny virtues their system seems to me to be fundamentally wrong but whether wrong or right they have not enough of coherence among themselves nor of estimation with the public nor of numbers they cannot make up an administration nothing is more visible many other things are against them which i do not charge as faults but reckon among national misfortunes extraordinary things must be done or one of the parties cannot stand as a ministry nor the other even as an opposition they cannot change their situations nor can any useful coalition be made between them i do not see the mode of it nor the way to it this aspect of things i do not contemplate with pleasure  i well know that every thing of the daring kind which i speak of is critical  but the times are critical new things in a new world i see no hopes in the common tracks if men are not to be found who can be got to feel within them some impulse   quod nequeo monstrare and sentio tantum and which makes them impatient of the present if none can be got to feel that private persons may sometimes assume that sort of magistracy which does not depend on the nomination of kings or the election of the people but has an inherent and selfexistent power which both would recognize i see nothing in the world to hope  if i saw such a group beginning to cluster such as they are they should have all that i can give my prayers and my advice people talk of war or cry for peace  have they to the bottom considered the questions either of war or peace upon the scale of the existing world no i fear they have not  why should not you yourself be one of those to enter your name in such a list as i speak of you are young you have great talents you have a clear head you have a natural fluent and unforced elocution your ideas are just your sentiments benevolent open and enlarged  but this is too big for your modesty oh this modesty in time and place is a charming virtue and the grace of all other virtues but it is sometimes the worst enemy they have let him whose print i gave you the other day be engraved in your memory had it pleased providence to have spared him for the trying situations that seem to be coming on notwithstanding that he was sometimes a little dispirited by the disposition which we thought shown to depress him and set him aside yet he was always buoyed up again and on one or two occasions he discovered what might be expected from the vigor and elevation of his mind from his unconquerable fortitude and from the extent of his resources for every purpose of speculation and of action remember him my friend who in the highest degree honored and respected you and remember that great parts are a great trust remember too that mistaken or misapplied virtues if they are not as pernicious as vice frustrate at least their own natural tendencies and disappoint the purposes of the great giver  adieu my dreams are finished  finis speedily
