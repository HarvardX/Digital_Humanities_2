an appendix to the history of the crowninn with a key to the whole  london printed for j moor and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster price   d  appendix to the history of the crowninn etc i must assure you that had i not through the great hopes and expectation of seeing you ere this omitted something in my last which i thought proper to communicate to you and would have done it personally if our good stars had so directed i should have had no farther occasion of adding to all my former being of themselves sufficiently long and tiresome  as in the greatest variety we are always put to the hardest difficulty in fixing our choice so in the vast field the numerous subjects for discourse one is at greater loss to put ones thoughts into any method for in all instances we find there is no surer evidence of a good genius than that which is shown in the effect of choice  i have very great reason to believe that every thing is well received by you not through any motive but your sincere friendship nor any merit but the subject both i know are particular but one much more worthy your attention  one would believe by their actions that a set of people here are really infected in their brains and that they lie under the same influence with creatures of another species which have lately been visited with a very odd distemper there is some kind of correspondency in their maladies only that which affects the twoleggd creatures seems to be of the most fearful and tremendous consequence and to threaten the country in the most dear and tender part but thank god the distemper is not epidemical though it seems the nature of those infected to endeavor all they can to spread it about and to make others in the same pickle with themselves  the symptoms they are seized with are a kind of splenatick mad fits not much unlike madness they foam at the mouth roll their eyes and utter strange incoherent speeches and in this manner go raving up and down the town the direct cure for this we know were a dark room and clean straw with some manual exercise slender diet and other proper methods to correct the fumes of the distemper but at the rate they go on i despair of any cure for them and were it not for the honor of living in a free country where liberty has been always the peoples right they are such as ought rather to be shut up in pesthouses to prevent a contagion than to breath in the open air among men of free and generous principles  some of these creatures appear in furred gowns tufted garments and fit in the high places but are indeed men of the most shallow and humble understandings and you will find very few among them that act with a spirit of disinterestedness or are not attached to the person of young shute  i have scarce patience to preface any longer when i think what degenerate fellows i treat on good gd what is become of that ancient spirit that used to reign in this kingdom or for which of our sins was this stubborn generation sown among us which have sprung up like the tares that almost choked the good corn  would they produce an instance of that time when they have not been tumultuous and troublesome i would spare their shame unless it were like the dl who is good when he is pleased they had set their hearts so upon rule in the widows reign when they carried their point as far and sat with as much security as the memory of any known time ever afforded them the days of sir jacob excepted that it is no very great wonder they are so impatient under their present circumstances they had really under her procured a pretty tenantable lease few copyholds were firmer and they were endeavoring to get a grant of the inheritance in feesimple when alas the lease it self depending on one single life casually expired  considering the mischief they might do by the influence of their former power and how likely the desperateness of their case was to put them upon it what a happiness must we acknowledge their stupidity to be in fancying they had pretensions to renew it under mr wright and how justly may we impute our safety to their miserably deceived expectations and regret the less that it is the deplorable occasion of their present inveteracy rage and fury  i told you the state they stood in at preferring the old servants again and the grievous clamours they raised against it though their justifying the same thing in the widow had made it a very remarkable precedent which of all men they ought to be the last to censure but nature is predominant it is true one inconveniency seems to arise from their being displaced which is that they are too much at leizure to plot and cabal with the friends of young shute who by that encouragement and addition to their party begin to gather life again and to rouse themselves from a despair that the late alteration had thrown them into their business is now to act in concert together and not unlikely as propperties to each other the family of the bulls by their assistance to introduce themselves into power again and the other by assisting them to advance the interest of young sir jacob one thing in this is certain that they have united their forces again and the daily clamours and disturbances we hear of in the country are the true effects of it it is strange that the bulls family who have always been the tools to sir jacob and his issue should not once endeavor to honor themselves by disclaiming so scandalous a correspondence but reproofs are vain  the widow poor woman began severely to feel the effect of patronizing them so long and it is pity a life of such consequence should be sullied with their miscarriages i can hardly mention without tears the advantage it may give posterity of treating her memory with contempt and obscuring a history that would else have appeared as bright as the element her own virtues shone in and could have been liable to no contradiction from the most partial pen  but we will forgive them this forgive the sad occasion of her death but shall we forgive their going on in the same road their repetition of practices that have always been pernicious to the interest of their country it is well known they were her aversion the least of her care or concern for nine years which they sufficiently revenged by teazing her out of her life in less than half the time and heaping on her anxious head as great a weight of trouble and perplexity as their predecessors the old servants had loaded with accumulated glory and advantages  but i will have done with this repetition you know the truth of it too well already do but revolve the passages and incidents of their last short reign for you must understand they have been in power in other past times to as good a purpose and you will find that not one single action or consequence went well from the very footing of their administration unless you will believe that idle story trumpt up by them at that time of their beginning with saving the church which in reality never flourished with greater tranquillity than during the widows time and i believe they will themselves acknowledge when they have not a mind to be merry with us that it was the highest insolence and affront to impute the contrary to her  now i am speaking of this i cannot but acquaint you with an odd accident that happened here the other day an innocent country vicar preaching in town was insalted and very rudely treated by the parishioners of the bullian party the offense he was guilty of was blessing heaven for the happy situation of affairs and the imminent danger we were lately rescued from but that is not the occasion i mention it on i cannot but smile to think that the first insult or indignity literally offered to the church since the time of sir jacob should be by the family of the bulls themselves who have always expressed such reverence and veneration to the place and justified the dignity of its priests even to rage and madness  had the other party done as much good heaven what clamours would have been raised it could not have escaped the censure and construction of their going to pull the church down if no worse i hope they will not forget it together with their pulling down of conventicles if there should be occasion for the future to mention it to them by way of alternative  poor men they have really been unfortunate for the most part in raising up precedents against themselves though they are the least inclinable to be judged by their own laws of any men breathing had they foreseen the consequence of justifying the widws proceeding in displacing her old servants and that the splutter they made about her right to do it which they termed the highest insolence in any one to question would so soon have reverted upon themselves they would not probably have been so violent in maintaining the legality and   a key to the history of the crowninn etc part i crowninn the ct widow the late q her husband p ge sir jacob
