for messrs l white p byrne p woogan h colbert a gruebier c lewis j moore and j halpen  mdcclxxxix  cornelia etc letter i from mrs audley to lucy i am sorry you have been so alarmed for the dear bachelor and give you both joy and praise my good girl for having nursed him once more into his usual saucy health behold us all happily arrived at audleygrove where the gay louisa was ready and delighted to receive us she is wonderfully improved since we saw her last in stature beauty and sense  but more of her in her turn i have a thousand things to talk of first i shall not waste my paper in telling you what a fine numerous cavalcade we formed in returning hither nor what a graceful figure our lovely widow made on her beautiful portugueze palfrey no my dear not a word of all this i must begin like a true mother by talking of my chits and telling you that your little namesake and charles and william are all highly pleased as we are with the monsons our new governor and governess who came hither in our party and are very soon to be settled in the white farmhouse lately enclosed within the park where the little folks under their care are to reside but methinks i hear you cry pish why does she begin talking to me of the brats who are all well when i am dying to hear of the poor cornelia who is perplexed in the extreme  would i could say that our gentle friend enjoys as our associated children do for her little ones are here the thoughtless day the easy night the spirits pure the slumbers light   but alas i perceive too clearly that her tender bosom is becoming the victim of the furypassions i may with too much propriety speak of them in the plural number for by a little incident which i will tell you presently you will find that she is tormented by more than one and that jealousy has added new stings to discontented and self tormenting love i see my dear lucy that you begin to form a hundred surmises and want to ask me a hundred questions what i hear you exclaim is the romantic seymour so fickle is he really captivated by the girlish bloom of louisa patience my good girl it is not fair when you get a new play in your hand to peep at the last act before you have well finished the first allow me to proceed in my own way and i will soon make you better acquainted with all the characters and conduct of our busy drama which is to end i hope according to the good old established custom with a happy marriage  first then for our heroine our dear cornelia there is an air of deep dejection fixing itself on her features in spite of all our attempts to disperse it which alarms me much she is even melancholy in the presence of seymour and much more so when he is out of her sight yet she has such a dread of passing a few minutes alone with him that she conjures me to watch over her incessantly and never allow him an opportunity of speaking to her in private but my good man though he has not made him a convert as i most devoutly hoped he would has yet made him so tractable and so willing to bestow a religious education on the children that cornelia has and may have that i am in great hopes their desirable union may in due time be happily accomplished in spite of the dear rash creatures too righteous vow on the fatal night that i described to you this cruel vow presses like an engine of torture on her heart she frequently says to me that their marriage must never take place but she says this with such a voice and such a countenance as convince me that if it does not her health and peace are utterly ruined for ever i have not mentioned a word of this distressing vow to seymour and indeed i would not have him know of it for the world especially just now when i have brought his turbulent spirits to a most comfortable calm i flatter myself that i am his favorite confidante and by telling him no more than literal truth on the various little proofs of cornelias entire affection for him i have brought him to make me a promise very essential to our present tranquillity and this is not to address a syllable concerning marriage to her till the year of her widowhood is expired in the mean time it will be the great object of us all to calm her agitated spirits by every thing that can divert and amuse her i was in great hopes that my lively niece louisa might be of great use to us in this friendly purpose but alas how frequently does pain flow from those sources whence we expect only pleasure now lucy you shall have the incident i promised but first i must give you a little description of the charming girl whom you have not seen since she was a mere child though she was always a beautiful child she has now i think still more beauty than her infancy promised and will i presume be reckoned much handsomer than our admired cornelia herself by all men who prefer a lively countenance to a tender one they are exactly of the same height and louisa with the elegant shape of our friend has a smiling set of features that seem to say there is no such thing as sorrow in the world happily indeed it has hitherto been as much a stranger to her as if it did not exist and as to the solicitudes of love you will guess what experience she has of them when i tell you she has yet found them only fit subjects for laughter  i never see our tender widow and this sprightly girl together but i have the two following lines of shakspeare at the end of my tongue though i must confess my application of them appears rather cruel why let the stricken deer go weep the heart ungalld may play   to play indeed from morning to night seems the ruling propensity of louisa besides singing sprightly songs with great humor and pleasantry this laughterloving gypsey is a most admirable mimic she halfdelighted and halfprovoked me and caroline yesterday by taking off what she calls the impassioned langour of the widow and the solemn sympathy of seymour she is however much too delicate and wellbred to attempt any thing of this kind in the presence of cornelia but when my husband and seymour have got the saucy arch girl to themselves she does not spare the inamorato as i learn from a scene that passed yesterday in the garden and produced a very singular effect within doors though at the moment it escaped my observation  it happened that i and caroline i cannot yet familiarize myself to the formal sound of mrs monson were standing to chat with cornelia at her toilet the windows of her dressing room you know have a perfect command of the new terrace where louisa i find was sauntering in one of her gayest moods between the two gentlemen as i chanced to turn my back to the window i had not perceived the party in the garden and had indeed my eyes and attention fully engaged by the features and dress of our lovely friend who between ourselves appears to me a little more curious in setting her cap than she used to be before the arrival of my niece she had borrowed carolines assistance to adjust some feathers after the spanish fashion and while they were both thus engaged i was suddenly alarmed by seeing cornelia turn as pale as death a cold trembling seized her whole frame and all the loveliness of her sweet countenance was lost in a strange expression of desponding wretchedness or rather of lifeless vacancy not suspecting the real source of her disorder and apprehensive that she was on the point of falling into a fainting fit from mere weakness of body i led her to the sopha and was very busy with my bottle of hartshorn the moment i had placed her in a posture of ease and quiet she was relieved by a violent burst of tears and pressing my hand she said in a broken voice be not so terrified my dear harriot i have no malady to struggle with but my own folly and i shall subdue that presently if you and caroline will have the goodness to leave me for a few minutes alone unwilling as i was to quit her i did not hesitate to comply with her request because i perceived by the looks of caroline that she had some thoughts on the occasion that she wished to communicate in private  we accordingly withdrew together and the moment we got into my room for heavens sake my dear caroline said i can you account for all this oh madam replied the warmhearted and grateful caroline she must indeed she must be the wife of mr seymour pray do not let mr audley oppose it i would venture my life on their being happy together though mr seymour it not quite so devout as he should be yet he has a thousand noble virtues and she loves him to distraction i think with you entirely my dear caroline i replied but this is no answer to my question i thought by your manner that you had discovered the immediate cause of my poor friends agitation discovered it cried caroline ah madam you would have seen it plain enough if you had cast an eye toward the window at the moment that mrs sedley and i happened to do so poor lady she is far gone indeed but i believe in her case i should have been affected as much affected at what dear caroline dont torture my curiosity so barbarously for heavens sake what did you see nothing madam but an idle frolic of mr seymour with miss louisa she had provoked him i suppose by mimicking the poor lady who doats on him how that might be i cannot tell but just as mrs sedley turned so sick i happened to spy mr seymour catching hold of miss louisa who had tried to run from him and kissing her most unmercifully poor cornelia i exclaimed with a sigh can a sight like this affect thee so woefully well my good caroline i continued pray do not mention a syllable of this idle affair to any creature except your husband i will instantly return to my poor friend and see if she has honesty or rather strength enough to avow to me of her own accord the real cause of her suffering i found cornelia greatly recovered yet so anxious to evade all discourse that might lead to an explanation of what had passed that from a sincere desire not to distress her tender spirits i sacrificed my design of leading her to a full confession yet to show to what an uncommon degree of amiable ingenuousness reigns in the heart of this admirable creature i must tell you how she behaved to me on our retiring at night she took me to her own chamber and sending away her servant began to apologize for her reserve toward me before dinner i feel that i am guilty of ingratitude my dear harriot said this tenderest of friends in attempting to conceal any excesses of my folly from you whose indulgence and whose zeal to comfort me have ever kept pace with my hapless propensity to torment myself today indeed i was ashamed to confess my extreme weakness to you in the moment perhaps our gentle caroline who perceived it all though she was too delicate to utter a syllable before me that proved her conscious of my folly perhaps caroline has explained to you all the mystery of my foolish agitation ah my too indulgent harriot to what an extravagant and silly pitch of fondness have you raised my dangerous partiality for a man to whom i must never be united my reason tells me sufficiently that i have no right to be jealous of him yet i cannot behold him caressing even your niece louisa in a romping frolic without such wretched and unjustifiable sensations as i am ready to detest and despise my own heart for feeling i did not think that any human bosom could be so very weak and unjust and much less did i suspect myself to be capable of the extreme weakness and injustice which i am now deploring but since it is so my dear harriot pray contrive for me to make a decent retreat tomorrow to my own quiet mansion and instead of encouraging   i heard the tender soul with the most patient silence thus far but here i could not refrain from entering into a very warm opposition both to her sentiments and her project of retiring from our party we had a curious dissertation on the passion of jealousy in which i affirmed that a woman never feels it so painfully as when she fancies she has no right to feel it at all we ran over all the old and new ground of argument for and against seymour in short we spent half the night in a very diversified conversation during which i laughed and wept and scolded and soothed our dear selftorturing friend alternately till at last i left her a little reconciled both to herself and her lover in wishing her a good night i added a saucy declaration that i should act as queen in my own castle that if she talked again of removing i should issue an order for her close confinement and publish an edict at the same time in which seymour should be threatened with instant death if he was seen to touch any lips but her own  thus my dear lucy by a mixture of seriousness and sport i endeavor to preserve the mind of our gentle friend from pursuing any immediate and desperate resolution that might prove fatal to her future peace would to heaven i could as easily remove seymours distressing infidelity in religion as i can annihilate the vehement resolves which poor cornelia will sometimes utter of renouncing his society for ever my husband encourages me to hope that time may do much in promoting the happiness of this interesting couple if we can but prevent the eagerness of love on one side and of fear on the other from taking any precipitate measures to accelerate or preclude their union he wishes to keep them for a few months in an absolute neutrality but this is a project which even his friendly zeal and his persuasive address will hardly be able to accomplish we cannot utterly change the dispositions of nature love in a bosom like seymours will be impetuous and terror in a frame like cornelias will be precipitate for my part i should not be surprised if our dear conscientious friend should be terrified still more than she is by a vision of the poor departed sedley and should steal away from us in the night the conflict of the various passions that agitate her mind is truly pitiable and at the very moment when i attempt to relieve her by laughing at her perplexities my heart inwardly bleeds for the anguish of hers yet perhaps she says truly my dear lucy that you from the peculiar incidents of your past life are more able to enter into her present feelings than i am from this idea she will have great satisfaction in unburthening her full soul to you and as you will certainly have a letter from her very soon you will the more readily allow me to close this long packet pray tell our dear edmund that we think a change of air would have secured him from a relapse and that we wish him to take that precaution against a second cannot you make it suit you both to come to us at this critical time when the sage edmund might prove a very useful mentor to our young telemachus not in driving him away from the enjoyments of love but in teaching him how to secure them if however we must not expect the pleasure of adding you to our party as i fear we must not be assured that i shall send you quick tidings of every interesting occurrence relative to the great object of our general solicitude louisa longs to renew her acquaintance with you and unites her kind wishes to those of  your affectionate harriot  letter ii from seymour to edmund audley if you wish my dear edmund to be pleasantly laughed out of all the singularities belonging to the condition of a confirmed bachelor aye and out of the condition itself let me advise you to hasten hither here have we a pretty madcap from ireland whose magical powers are strong enough i believe to metamorphose the stiffest advocate for a single life into the supplest of all supple creatures an uxorious and contented husband in serious truth our young louisa is a most lovely girl and playful as the air which sports with every feather that flies across it how it would delight me to see our dear discreet edmond most profoundly in love with this sweet sportive damsel by heaven she has all the vivacity and frolic of your sylvia with goodnature and innocence into the bargain she is the richest antidote that nature can furnish you with against those poisonous vapors of spleen and timidity which you sometimes feel and lament and which seldom fail i believe to infest the single in the latter stages of life she is the very thing for you perfectly qualified though a child of nature to relish your wit and to repay you for it by a lighter and more copious coin of her own why man she would destroy all your troublesome doubts scruples and depressions as st patrick destroyed the rats of her country by rhyming them to death she will spout you verses like a young priestess of apollo yet the lovely creature has not an atom of pedantry or affectation about her she has however the dangerous diverting talent of mimickry to perfection if my love to cornelia had not been thoroughly rooted in my heart i believe this gay gypsey would have beat it out of my bosom by the mere force of her wit and humor she took me off the other day as we were strolling with only your brother in the garden with such provoking powers of ridicule that having little to say in my defense i was forced to take vengeance on her lips i believe she will not speedily renew the provocation for seizing her with all my force i not only kissed her without mercy but refused to release her till she in her turn bestowed a few kisses on me and the warm luxuriant creature did it with a prudency so rosy the sweet view on it might well have warmed old saturn   these are dangerous frolicks seymour very dangerous indeed this i know will be the exclamation of my dear timid monitor in perusing this little anecdote and dangerous i grant you my good man of caution such a frolic might be had your serious worship been in my place had your solidity ventured so near as i did to this flaming beauty i am confident she would have set you in a blaze but i bear a charmed heart the image of my lovely widow is so magically engraven there that no other enchantress has power to affect it as to that danger which you in the friendly abundance of your fears have apprehended for the damsel herself believe me she is perfectly secure louisa is one of those happy girls whose sense and spirit enable them to jest and even to romp without endangering the freedom of their affections and the delicacy of their character or as you will say of her when you are as much in love with this lively charmer as i wish you to be she is a venus who can sport with momus without forgetting that she is the queen of the graces and now though you have not seen her i understand since she was an infant i shall deem you a very barbarous fellow if you do not instantly fall in love with her upon my suggestion especially as i have actually opened the campaign as your aidducamp and have laid strong siege to her heart in your name i may venture to add that i have made considerable advances in this exploit so pray hear what they are first i have made her intimately acquainted with all your virtues talents and perfections but this is the least important part of my service my capital stroke in your favor is the following secondly i have made her equally acquainted with your oddities and foibles a pretty method you will say of serving a friend but hear me out edmund in making her thus intimately acquainted with your oddities and foibles i have shown her at the same time how exactly suited her own charms and accomplishments are to correct improve and make you a perfect creature this i have done for you my dear diffident philosopher and i defy you after all your profound meditations on the virtues and caprices of the fair sex to point out to me any conduct by which i could more effectually create for you a tender interest in the bosom of the lady though you are often a champion for the fair i believe in your private thoughts you do not think so highly of women as i do for my own part i am persuaded that a young artless sensible inexperienced woman is generally actuated by a sincere and ardent desire to make her own tender virtues of real utility to the world this by the way will explain the reason why so many of this description have married in the hope of reforming a rake it is not as the vulgar phrase will have it that women love to see a spice of the devil in man or that they have a vain confidence in their own personal attractions no it is because nothing is so bewitching to a virtuous mind without experience as the expectation of rendering its own virtue an instrument of good  but what a sad pedantic varlet am i growing to run on in this fine moral dissertation upon you and your laughing louisa for she must be yours without bestowing a syllable on my pale pensive perplexed yet adorable and faithfully adored cornelia but here comes my youngest female monitor my little mentor in petticoats the grateful caroline who has just entered my room to fulfill her promise of indulging me in a long private conference in which i have a million of questions to ask by the arch smile on her countenance she has some pleasant tidings to give me concerning my idol but as she tells me the courier of the house is waiting for this letter i must reserve her good news to enliven my next at present you have food enough for your imagination and your heart in what i have said of louisa  so good digestion wait on appetite and health on both  ever your affectionate seymour  letter iii from cornelia to lucy audley it is from you alone my dear lucy that i can expect perfect sympathy and compassion for the various agitations of heart and mind which i continually endure though our excellent harriot has certainly one of the tenderest hearts in the world and is all kindness to me yet having known in her own happy lot nothing but the felicity of a most fortunate affection she cannot thoroughly enter into all the diversified wretchedness arising from a passion that we can neither renounce nor subdue you my dear girl have passed through the fiery ordeal which is now consuming my peace and perhaps some portion of my integrity for i fear i am acting very wrong in spite of all that our too indulgent harriot alleges in my defense to remain here in the society of a fascinating creature from whom i ought i think both for his sake and my own to hide myself for ever but i will unburthen my full bosom to you my dear lucy and lay my whole soul before you in the hope that your experience as well as your tenderness may minister in some degree to my relief  you have known my good girl what it is to love in spite of reason and without a hope of being united to the object of your regard ah my dear lucy how sincerely do i admire that nobleness of spirit with which you have finally triumphed over feelings that seem to annihilate the best faculties of the mind but your candor will allow that you had one great advantage which i am very far from possessing in discovering the baseness of the man who had artfully engaged your affections you had an opportunity of summoning your pride to your support your bane and antidote were both before you  but alas the case is far otherwise with me the gallant the princely seymour to give him the titles conferred on him by yourself has i find no qualities as you have often told me when arguing in his favor to awaken either contempt or indifference and to love him once is to love him for ever how often my dear friend has that forcible expression of yours recurred upon my heart and how many wonderful occurrences since you and i parted have conspired to make me feel the truth of it as i do at this moment but while i am thoroughly convinced that my affection for him is become a part of my existence i feel with equal conviction the cruel necessity if rejecting him as a husband why am i here then in his company why do i linger thus like a guilty ghost in a scene that i ought and wish to abandon ah my dear lucy if you could see how pale and thin your poor cornelia is grown you would not think the word ghost misapplied and that i am in some degree guilty my conscience tells me every hour for by staying here i seem to practice an ungenerous deceit toward seymour and may lead him perhaps to cherish a distant hope of accomplishing what never must come to pass why then do i stay why truly because your good brother and sister will have it so they would persuade me that time may do wonders in removing the great and only obstacle to this muchdesired yet impossible union your brother this very morning refused to hear a petition that i attempted to make to him for leave to depart and turned from me with the following parody on a couplet of grays love yet may make an unbeliever wife and gospel light dawn from cornelias eyes   ah my dear lucy i will confess to you there are times when this transporting idea takes full possession of my soul when i fondly imagine myself destined by heaven to rescue the generous seymour from the vain illusions and arrogant sophistry of the world and to make him a true servant of that divine master whose laws are so consonant to the purity and the benevolence of his heart how exquisite is the delight of this heavenly idea with what enthusiastic transport have i frequently in my own mind applied to seymour and myself the following charming lines from the royal convert of row my life my lord what would my heart say to thee oh lift thy eyes up to that holy power whose wondrous truths and majesty divine thy ethelinda taught thee first to know there six thy faith and triumph over the world for who can help or who can save besides   yet in spite of this holy fortitude and fervor which seem in some or my private moments to render me a new and more exalted being i soon relapse again into my poor trembling self though i feel at times as if i had sufficient powers of language and reasoning to produce a total and immediate change in the religious sentiments of seymour and though i love him with so pure and disinterested a passion that i would most willingly sacrifice my life to ensure his conversion yet such a poor weak wretch am i my dear lucy by nature that i dare not even utter a syllable to him on the subject of religion and a cold involuntary tremor runs through my whole frame if the conversation seems to be taking that turn whenever we are in company together still our dear encouraging harriot would induce me to hope that the mild engaging piety of her husband and his conciliating manners united to the secret influence of love may gradually accomplish what i have not faculties to attempt and give to us at last the happy convert that we so ardently wish to behold why should we despair says this indulgent friend and most indefatigable of advocates why should we despair of seeing a candid a magnanimous young man relinquish the accidental prejudice of his youth if seymour were one of those lawless libertines who abhor in the gospel an insupportable curb to their sensual and imperious passions or if he were one of those coldhearted and arrogant sophists who decide every thing that does not square with their own infallible reason we might indeed despair of his conversion but seymour is a character very different from these in embracing the law of christ he will subject himself to no restraint from which his heart can feel a wish to revolt on the contrary he will secure to himself by this measure the only object of his passion to attchment ah my dear lucy you i am sure will forgive me for listening sometimes with the fondest credulity to these insinuating arguments alas how deeply am i punished for that credulity whenever my own poor wavering mind flies back again as it frequently does to the opposite persuasion i then think myself the most culpable of creatures i seem to have deserted my prime duty to my dear children by suffering myself to be thus more and more entangled in a connection which might ultimately lead me to violate the dying injunction of their father and expose them to the worst of evils but no my dear lucy this shall never be i have taken a most sacred oath as harriot has told you that i will never be the wife of an infidel seymour is too noble to delude me with hypocrisy and whatever dstiny may await me i am secure against this deepest of calamities why then am i tormented with such a dread and horror of what never can befall me for o my dear friend i am tormented to a degree that i can hardly impart without a scruple to your tender bosom i know how you will feel for me when i tell you what i have not confessed to harriot that i am haunted by visions which almost freeze my blood and render me an object of detestation to mself you will suppose i am persecuted in my dreams by the image of the poor departed sedley but it is not so to my great surprise i have never dreamt of him in all my present agitation of spirits no my visions are much more horrid for i have dreamed that my excessive passion for seymour had annihilated all my natural affection for my children o god my dear lucy this is a horror of which you can form no adequate conception i had hardly closed my eyes last night when i seemed to behold the misery of my alienated children i heard william shriek out to the poor little affrighted charles our mother is turned into a treacherous friend their looks of terror and abhorrence pierced me to the soul i strove to convince them of my fondness the poor bewildered innocents fled from me i pursued them through innumerable difficulties till at last i awoke in a burst of convulsive anguish and found myself actually kneeling and weeping over the little bed in my chamber where the two dear boys were happily asleep at first i could hardly believe my own happiness in finding them so tranquil and i took the light which i always burn in my room to convince myself of its truth by a full survey of their sweet little placid features the contrast of their soft delicious slumber and the agony which i had dreamed they were suffering threw me into fresh floods of tears in retiring to my own pillow i addressed a most ardent prayer to heaven not only to preserve these dear infants from all the evil which my weakness might draw upon them but to deliver both myself and seymour from this disquieting passion which seems so likely to prove a misfortune to both i am afraid you will think me hardly sincere in this prayer yet believe me my dear friend if i know my own heart and soul i was so most truly but to you my dear lucy i shall not hesitate to confess that the more i struggle to free myself from this fascinating attachment the more i feel myself the slave of an unfortunate affection which has so much to plead in its excuse my reason and my conscience continually suggest to me that i am wrong and there are times when i feel a sort of hatred toward seymour for having led me to a state of mind so full of pain and distress even in my private meditations my heart will often seem to shrink from him and hold it as a crime even to think of his perfections but these feelings are transient and they are generally followed by such a relapse of tender passions that i am ready to address the image of this dear enemy to my peace in the words of ethelinda if thou art my offense i have sinned indeed even to a vast and numberless account for from the season when i loved thee first my soul has not one moment been without thee   you my dear friend you and harriot have been cruelly instrumental to my disquietude and distress by your wellintended but fatal indulgence to me at the early period of my attachment when you ridiculed my honest endeavors to conceal and subdue my affection when you delighted to fan the flame that i was vainly laboring to extinguish time and chance have conspired still more cruelly to give this most enchanting of men a dominion over my heart i have a strange mixture of pain and delight in reflecting on the great obligation that i owe him he has indeed as you have often said of him so many attractive accomplishments and virtues that it is hardly possible for any woman to see him frequently without feeling an affectionate admiration of his character surely no man ever possessed in so high a degree that rare union of tenderness and spirit which is so particularly engaging to our sex or such admirable delicacy of manners without a shadow of artifice or affectation o lucy i could scribble a volume on the excellence and peculiarity of his attractions but though his perfections will more than justify my good girl your ardent friendship for him i feel that great as they are they cannot afford a sufficient sanction to my love it is enough that my conscience repeatedly informs me i must not indulge it conscience my good lucy is a much safer guide than friendship herself however zealous and enlightened and when we act against the dictates of this internal monitor even in points that seem hardly material how deeply are we punished alas i am a sad example how deeply i offended this inflexible judge when i complied with the pressing solicitations of our dear harriot in attending her hither what i have endured since i came under her friendly roof you may partly guess from what i have told you already but alas my dear lucy i have not yet told you all my weaknesses or my sufferings you have probably heard what i allude to from our communicative harriot because it was a weakness that i confessed to her and confiding in your kindness and secrecy i lay her under no restraint in what she says of me to you yet her tenderness perhaps in this point may have spared me i will therefore be frank enough to tell you under my own hand that i have within these few days been the weakest and most unjust of women i have been fool enough to grow most absurdly jealous of him whose addresses i had determined to reject oh lucy i did not think there had been such inconsistency in woman much less in my own heart you i know will rather pity than ridicule me when i tell you that upon accidentally seeing seymour caressing our young louisa in a mere frolic i felt as if my whole frame was shattered on the rack of all the sensations that i remember to have endured in my life this my dear friend was the most hideously painful it seemed as if my heart was absolutely torn away from its seat and there was nothing but drear vacuity in my bosom heaven have mercy upon the jealous if such are the tortures they endure but my pain could not be owing to mere jealousy it was rather the effect of a sudden surprise upon nerves that have been dreadfully shaken i think i could see the same thing again without feeling any emotion at the sight yet i will not pretend to more fortitude or more justice than i have you have often very feelingly lamented your own weakness to me my dear friend and i am now abundantly returning your confidence i have a double reason for thus unfolding to you every instance of my folly first as proof of my perfect regard for you secondly because i hope in thus showing how thoroughly i am aware of my own infirmity i may gain credit with you for the strength and wisdom that i mean to recover and exert i have formed a plan in my own mind for my deliverance upon which i am particularly solicitous to have your opinion because i think no one can enter into my feelings so thoroughly as yourself our dear harriot and her most friendly husband judge me too hardly or rather too tenderly from their eager wish to exempt me from pain they suppose me unable to endure it they both believe me so incurably enamoured of seymour that they think no event but our marriage can preserve my existence but weak as i feel and confess myself to be i have still i am convinced a strength of spirit far superior to what they imagine our dear and zealous harriot is so vehement for this impossible marriage that she wants me to overlook the grand and insuperable objection she tells me that i ought to be satisfied by such concessions as seymour she says is very willing to make that if i have the most unquestionable assurance that all my children shall be religiously educated in the christian faith and my own principles unmolested by opposition i have no reason to disturb myself concerning the private creed of my husband but situated as i am i feel it is my prime duty to regard the dying injunction of poor sedley and to maintain the voluntary oath which i was induced to take from an excess of anxiety for my children i might indeed confide in any promise of seymours for stranger as he most unhappily is to the only true religion in all other points he is truth itself if he gave his word to this article i can believe that he never would urge a single argument or attempt by ridicule to shake the faith of my children or of his own but if he did not poison their young minds by his doctrine might he not mislead them by his insinuating example might he not induce even me to grow cold and negligent in the most important duty of life and to relinquish imperceptibly the worship of my redeemer yes my dear friend i will confess to you that i could not promise for my own firmness were i to place myself in so perilous a situation even now i often contemplate the irreligion of the man i love in too favorable a light i am too ready to say like zayre in my favorite french play je le vois trop les soins quon prend de notre enfnce forment nos sentimens nos moeurs notre creance linstrction fait tout and la main de nos peers grave o ro soibles coeurs ces premiers caracteres que lexemple and le teme nos vienuent retracer et que peutetre en nous die seul peut effacer i see too plainly custom forms us all our thoughts our morals our most fixed belief are consequences of our place of birth it is but instruction all  our parents hand written on our heart the first faint characters which time retracing deepens into strength that nothing can eface but death or heaven hills zara  by considering his infidelity as the natural consequence of a fashionable education i frequently lose all the horror with which it ought to inspire me i should not be able perhaps to struggle with this weakness of my heart and mind so effectually as i now hope to do had not the forcible admonitions of my dear harriots father awakened me to the fullest sense of my dangers and my duty good daughter as she is she could hardly forgive him for his vehemence against seymour in that distressed night of which she says she gave you a very minute description yet he certainly acted only the part that became him as a friend and a divine the more i reflect on the many strong and just things he said the more i feel myself indebted to his virtue and the more i hope to profit by his advice though as i have already confessed to you there are times when it has not the slightest influence on my feelings in my more discreet hours i endeavor to fortify my spirit by calling his very powerful lecture to my mind one of his remarks made a very deep impression upon me in entering minutely into the character of seymour after doing full justice to his courage his generosity and his engaging accomplishments he said i will grant you that he is a most delightful companion for your sex at his present period of life there is a vivacity and goodnature in youth that can hide all the hideousness of impiety itself but the main question is what sort of a husband will this man make toward the middle and latter end of his days when his gaiety begins to languish from the emptiness of human pleasures and his lively temper is rendered more splenetic and imperious by the inevitable vexations of the world these are the trying seasons of our existence and if he is destitute of religion as we know but too well he is believe me he is destitute of every thing that can tranquillize his own spirit at the period i am speaking of and enable him to diffuse light and comfort to his domestic circle i have given you i believe very near the exact words of my vehement and venerable counselor for agitated as i was every syllable that he uttered sunk deep into my soul and as there is you know a strange spirit of contradiction in our nature i believe i remember his expressions the more accurately because the too indulgent harriot has wished me to forget them the last time that i recalled some of these to her recollection she was almost angry with me and said in her spirited manner that i should realize the story of the poor lady clementina and drive myself quite out of my senses by my religious scruples but as i told her in my reply our cases are widely different that enchanting character whether true or ideal had many circumstances to distract her from which i am happily exempt she was persecuted by proud and imperious relations the little difference between her own creed and that of grandison was not sufficiently visible and weighty to make her mind clear and resolute in her decision against him alas how different is my case i distinctly see my own duty and i trust i am now completely determined to fulfill it i shall however take a hint from the noble clementina i am strongly inclined to solicit the wellknown generosity of my lover to support me against himself this my dear lucy is the plan upon which i am anxious for your opinion our dear harriot has very innocently increased my misery by her eagerness to relieve it though i had not power to refuse her pressing entreaties i am now too painfully convinced by my own sufferings that i ought not to have made one of the party here my peace is fled and my health is wasting rapidly away i have no chance of recovering a tolerable degree of quiet but in a resolute and hasty retreat to my own solitary mansion i must take however my dear boys along with me for all my force and fortitude originates in them the monsons i know will follow me with their other little pupils in the grateful and sensible caroline i have a valuable bosomfriend most anxious for my lasting happiness though confessedly in the interest of her generous protector  our dear harriot thinks me so totally unfit to be my own guide that i know she would not patiently hear of this project necessary as i feel it is to my peace i think therefore of accomplishing my departure without her suspecting it all this i have settled in my own mind and am much easier since i formed the resolution but now my dear sympathetic friend decide for me the great point that perplexes me shall i or shall i not leave a long letter for seymour unfolding most frankly to him all the painful past conflicts in my bosom and conjuring him by the sincerity of that disinterested love which he professes to let me peaceably pursue the only line of conduct that can possibly secure to me the lasting approbation of my heart and the tranquillity of my mind i know if i asked harriot the question that i have now proposed to you my dear lucy she would wickedly laugh in my face and tell me that the ardent imagination of seymour would consider such an epistle as a delicate hint to pursue me to sedleyhall but our sprightly friend does not i think perfectly understand either seymour or me as to myself i should assuredly wish to be understood as literally sincere in my request and i am willing to think that seymour with all his impetuous spirit has too much penetration and too much delicacy to put so wrong a construction on the language of a woman when she heartily reveals her whole soul to him without a shadow of reserve but tell me what you think and tell me speedily my dear girl suppose yourself exactly in my situation and tell me how you would act yet you cannot do so completely your imagination lively and powerful as it is cannot perfectly suggest to you all the strong feelings of a mother situated as i am but how many striking circumstances have i to impress upon my heart all the great duties of that important character the extreme loveliness of my children the dying request of my poor sedley the admonitions of my own excellent father who delighting in the uncommon name that he gave me used frequently to bid me remember that he gave it me not because it sounded well and was singular but because it had belonged to a roman lady distinguished by the luster of her maternal virtues and because he hoped that if heaven blessed me with children it might make me as attentive as she was to the care of their education o you benevolent spirits who were once on earth the kind monitors of your cornelia and are now perhaps looking down upon her from heaven i will not forget you and the principles which you infused into my soul i will banish all love from my bosom but the love of those dear little ones whom you commended to my care i will live only for them write and confirm me my dear lucy in this only safe this triumphant resolution no words can express the relief that i have found already in thus pouring forth my whole heart to you you will comprehend all its complicated emotions you will compassionate all its weakness you will rejoice in its reviving energy you will applaud my conscientious decision and your applause will operate as a cordial on the still trembling spirits of  your most sincere and affectionate cornelia p s alas what a poor slave am i to time and chance five minutes ago i was exulting in the close of this immense packet and in the comfort i anticipated from your expected answer and now i have a great mind to throw all these closelyscribbled sheets into the fire for behold the great question on which i was so anxious to consult you is suddenly become no question at all my maid has just told me that mr seymour is going from us tomorrow ah my dear lucy what a weak what a despicable creature is your poor vaunting cornelia though i had firmly resolved to fly from him myself i must own to you that i feel mortified to death by his thus retiring from me oh abominable vanity this is a weakness that deserves no quarter but i trust it is only the last fluttering momentary flame of an exhausted fire just on the point of extinction write to me  reprove me  comfort me  exhort and command me to struggle and triumph over all my follies and to maintain that calm dignity of character which you have a peculiar right to recommend from the force and felicity of your example adieu pray remember that i have implicit confidence in your honor and that i depend on your not showing even a line of this letter to your brother    letter iv from edmund audley to seymour if i ever entrust to any man my dear seymour a commission to choose a wife for me it shall certainly be to you for i know not in the world a man more entitled to the old classical compliment of elegans formarum spectator you are indeed an accomplished judge both of exterior and internal beauty of the persons and the minds of women but to choose a wife is an arduous business where good luck as well as good sense is so essentially requisite that without doubting your discernment i may distrust your fortune and the more so because after making one choice for yourself with consummate success for no woman in my opinion can be more suited to you than cornelia you cannot reasonably expect a second instance of mavelous felicity in choosing for your friend did you ever hear of a lottery in which the two twenty thousands were selected by one person as to myself i am you know so far from being sanguine in my expectations of all matters depending on chance that i shall probably pass through the world without once venturing on one of these richly promising matrimonial tickets yet believe me it is not because i think less highly of the sex than you do no indeed after all that wit and satire have written against women and wedlock i am convinced that life is hardly supportable without some female connection and there is certainly no connection so likely to produce lasting pleasure and comfort as a marriage where love may be considered as prime minister under the sovereign authority of reason but our lot as to marriage or celibacy is generally decided by some little incident that starts up in the early part of life and hurries us we know not whither it was my destinity as you are perfectly apprized to be strangely entangled in a tender attachment that i could never entirely approve that time and experience induce me still more to condemn and that i yet want the fortitude or the cruelty call it which you will to terminate in the manner that would be most conducive to my quiet my interest and my reputation man is by nature so subtle a logician in his own defense that he is hardly ever without a very specious reason for such conduct as his private inclinations impel him to pursue thus i impute my celibacy not solely to my secret bondage under the dominion of the too fond and wayward sylvia but to circumstances of a more honorable complexion my good sister lucy stands forth as the fair and ostensible motive for my single life indeed the bitter disappointment which this excellent girl met with in her matrimonial prospect made me very desirous of settling her where she might at least enjoy the authority of a wife she has now presided over my house so long has borne her faculties so meekly and been so clear in her great office that i am inclined to believe we are happier in thus mutually supporting our liberties than either of us would have been under matrimonial dominion  this being the ease you must allow the confirmed bachelor to remain in the quiet enjoyment of his various odities i have just passed the period at which aristotle says the good citizen ought to marry and since i have let the season slip i must content myself with exhorting you to make ample amends for my omission do not however suppose that i mean to throw a double duty upon you or advise you to make love alternately to the virgin and the widow which you seem half inclined to do dangerous frolics indeed pray be a little more constant in your devoirs and a little more temperate in your revenge  heaven preserve your lively louisa i hope she will soon be kissed by lips less vindictive than yours and much younger than those of the halfhoary swain whom your partiality has so unseasonably recommended to be made young again by her quips and cranks and wanton wiles  ah seymour you will find perhaps when you are on the verge of forty that you are a better judge of such disparity but if i were younger than i am i should still dread a comparison with a swain so ardent i should fancy that even the ga louisa though she looked like rosy mirth when panting under your fiery embrace might be metamorphosed into green and yellow melancholy upon exchanging that embrace for the more phlegmatic caresses of your friend leave me therefore to my singularities let providence provide for louisa and do you confine all your gentle solicitude all your tender attention to the interesting and deeply enamoured cornelia for the rest leave all to heaven  be faithful and be blessed  to express my good wishes to you in the words of a play which lucy tells me is a great favorite with your lovely and accomplished fairone  accept our united benedictions and believe me ever  your anxious monitor and affectionate friend  letter v from seymour to edmund audley in closing my last to you my dear edmund i gave you reason to expect very speedily some gay tidings in favor of my love that were just announced to me by the arch smile of the good grateful caroline that most sincere and most zealous friend to my passion had indeed some very delicious intelligence to give me but the excellent creature was so divided and confused between her ardent desire to serve me and her dread of betraying her patroness that i had some difficulty in drawing from her lips what she came on purpose to communicate at length however my faithful minister opened the budget and presented to me such a statement of affairs that my heart bounded in my bosom with vanity and joy my grand wish is accomplished my exquisitely tender cornelia is jealous of me to distraction she happened to spy me from her window folding louisa in my arms and almost fainted at the sight if i do not take pity of her as benedick says i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i shall not add in the words of the play i will go get her picture but i will hasten to get possession of the enchanting original shake not thy head my dear timorous monitor and tell me no more of caution and delay shall i keep such endearing sensibility on the rack of her own affectionate doubts and fears aye but seymour i hear you exclaim remember the great impediment in your way which only time and patience can enable you to oerleap fear not my good friend i am not blind to all the obstacles before me and have lately discovered one of which my sagacious monitor himself perhaps is not aware your kind sister harriot has not dealt quite so frankly with me as she professes to do but i shall show her in my turn that when i meet with reserve and disguise i also can make mysteries of my own and conceal from my intimate friends both what i know and what i intend after the docility and obedience which i have shown to her mandates harriot ought to have imparted to me a secret that i accidentally got a suspicion of and at last with great difficulty extorted from the honest bosom of caroline who nobly chose rather to break a promise which she had inconsiderately made to mrs audley than appear barbarous and ungrateful to me so the good creature reluctantly confessed to me that my dear idol has made a hasty and desperate vow you may guess of what nature pray observe that the soft cornelia can be precipitate as well as her lover but what are vows my dear timid preceptor do we not know from the experience of ages that fond women make them as they make sugar toys with concealed mottos chiefly for the pleasure of seeing them broken i have just formed a glorious and delightful project for demolishing this pastelike but unpalatable vow of my lovely widow as the sweet creature will swear i must make her exchange her rough oath for one of gentler form be not terrified at this intimation my good cherisher of unnecessary apprehensions i am not going to play the terrific jupiter in all his fire with this fond jealous semele and reduce the tender creature to ashes though she seems by her provoking vow to invite all my powers i will not explain to you what my project is because i know there is a tardy caution and timidity in your nature that would not allow you to approve it rest however assured that there is nothing dishonorable nothing ungentle in the scheme trouble not yourself to send me any wise remonstrances for if you do i can only answer them thus sage i have set my love upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the dye   however i may prosper believe me ever  your most affectionate seymour p s pray do not write to this house till you hear from me again at least on my account i am departing immediately for london where i have some short business to dispatch i am desirous of relieving my tender cornelia from the torments of jealousy and of speculating at the same time on the effects which my unexpected departure may produce on her heart before i enter on my grand and at present unutterable project adieu my brain is working with anxiety like that of an alchemist in the approach of the hour which is to make him either a croesus or a beggar    letter vi from lucy audley to cornelia you do me justice my very dear friend in giving me credit for the most perfect sympathy in all you endure indeed i sympathize with you so entirely that my sentiments and wishes seem to follow every variation of yours and the little judgment that nature gave me is reduced i fear to an absolute nothing by the excess of my anxiety for your very delicate and distressing situation i feel at once flattered delighted grieved perplexed and overwhelmed by your most friendly and endearing letter for to imitate your charming frankness i must tell you that i feel myself utterly unworthy to sustain the part of your adviser and your guide which in your kind partiality you seem to wish me to assume you pay me a most animating compliment on the triumph that i gained over my own unfortunate and illplaced affection but what my sweet friend what was my trial compared to yours to alienate a fond and simple heart from a man whole base character had been publicly detected and who clearly deserved general contempt requires i own some painful efforts but such efforts few women i believe would fail to make with success because as you justly remark our pride in such a conflict affords a very powerful support to our reason but to relinquish the most accomplished the most admired the most engaging of men to relinquish such a being when you know he doats on you with the most passionate attachment and when he has awakened all the feelings of reciprocal affection to relinquish him for one unhappy circumstance which is rather his misfortune than his fault to resolve and to presevere in all this may perhaps be within the power of our angelic cornelia i shall be ready to adore you if you make the sacrifice but i must confess that the poor mortal lucy would hardly be able to purchase heaven itself at such a price do not abhor me as an impious creature my dear devout friend for this confession believe me though i am a very weak yet i am still a very sincere christian but i am convinced that our feeble brains may think even of religion too much and as a poet who was very far from wanting piety has very happily told us the worst of madmen is a saint run mad  do not imagine that i think the religious faith of a husband is a matter of little consequence to a wife on the contrary in a connection where unexpected discord is so apt to arise i think the two minds should be as nearly in unison as possible upon all the great objects of human contemplation but where my dear friend is such complete unison to be found perhaps not upon earth marriage would be a rare thing indeed if it were never to be solemnized till such unison could be proved it is the fashion therefore in this necessary and universal ceremony to take a great deal upon trust and many a good wife if she sees her husband go decently to church troubles her head very little concerning his private notions either of god or the devil our ladies indeed in former times were more piously inquisitive i have read i think in hudibras of certain devout dames of quality who tied their husbands to a bedpost and whipped them too to render them more godly  do not think my dear gentle friend that i mean to treat your scruples with a barbarous unbecoming ridicule no i only mean though i attempt it but aukwardly to divert your thoughts from dwelling too seriously and intensely on a subject which if you suffer it to prey so continually on your spirits may undermine your health without promoting any good end whatever you entreat me to suppose myself exactly in your situation and tell you how i should act you allow however that i cannot exactly conceive all your sensations i am glad you furnish me with such a comfortable excuse for my superior weakness for i am dreadfully afraid that in such a trial i should not possess even a moiety of your virtue and resolution my present partiality as a mere friend to this fascinating seymour convinces me of the turn that my feebler reason would take in his behalf i should easily persuade myself that a man whose heart i thought had all the tender benevolence of the gospel and whose life i hoped would have much of its purity might be ultimately more favored by its divine author than many mortals who conceal an antipathy for his laws under a boasted reverence for his name my romantic fancy would suggest to me that if i endangered my own soul by accepting such a lover i should still more deeply endanger his by refusing him and in such an alternative i need not tell you for which hazard a fond generous romantic spirit might decide but if i cannot strengthen your resolution as you expect me to do by sincerely professing myself equal to such a great sacrifice as you meditate i certainly ought in owning my weakness to own at the same time my apprehensions of its consequence i am one i believe of those very common characters just foolish and weak enough to act wrong on a very severe trial and just wise and virtuous enough to feel incessant remorse for having done so were i to marry seymour in your situation i am persuaded i should be wretched if i failed in the hope of leading him by gentle degrees to my own religious persuasion to act on a vain confidence in such a hope would be i acknowledge to act like a fool yet i feel that this folly fortified as it would be by all the illusive powers of love would be infinitely too strong for my feeble reason i should most probably act ill from good affectionate motives and be the dupe and victim of my own absurdity alas what a bitter enemy is the tenderest of passions to the sweet cheerful serenity of female life yet what different effects does it produce in the different characters of our sex to the gentle the artless the openhearted love is often a deep tragedy to the notable and discreet it is a sort of heavy sentimental comedy to the perfectly vain and capricious it is neither better nor worse than an absolute farce now my dearest cornelia in my meditation upon love and you two ideas most easily united i have conceived a wish and a hope that you may disarm the cruelty of this tyrant by treating him with a little levity which though foreign i confess to your natural temper may be salutary and graceful in your present very singular situation i think you are at present so circumstanced and your agitated spirits are in such a tender state that you cannot decide either for or against your lover without incurring such severe pain as all who have the delight of knowing you must be anxious for your avoiding but what necessity is there for any immediate decision trust me there is none pray let me teach you to play the coquette a little tell this precipitate seymour that young and admired as you are you must take some time to look round the world and see what multitudes of accomplished men it exhibits before you deign to bestow your invaluable self on any one of the crew tell him he has not passed through a period of probation half long enough to convince you of his attachment dispatch him as your ambassador to our divine giuliana and bid him listen to that heavenly enthusiast for a twelvemonth trust me my dear friend you may venture to send him round the world without any danger of his nor returning to you with all the loyalty of love but you dear jealous creature would have a thousand apprehensions o how i love you for the very frank confession in your postscript concerning his unexpected departure i should have begun to stand in dreadful awe of you as an absolute angel but for that comfortable endearing confession  there i see my fellow creature there my dear you are a true woman for we can none of us bear to be deserted even by the man whom we are resolute to discard but i can safely assure you that seymour is no more able to desert you than the poor sparrow whose little leg is fettered is able to fly away from the halfhappy and halfterrified girl who holds him in her string be gentle betranquil yourself and in time i am persuaded you will inspire this wild flutterer with as much patience and docility as you can wish him to possess  that heaven my dear friend may proportion your happiness even on earth to the exquisite tenderness and purity of your heart is the cordial and ardent prayer of  your most faithful and affectionate lucy  letter vii from mrs audley to lucy pray my good girl can you send us any comfortable tidings of the runaway seymour to my utter astonishment we are all in a state of dismal darkness concerning him he left us rather abruptly on the pretense of sudden business in london an odd season this for business in the metropolis from thence he has written me a letter that is very unlike himself very aenigmatical and full of cold and formal civility i thought i discovered a great cloudiness on his brow for some days before he left us and i am persuaded that something pressed with unusual weight upon his mind though he would not confess it to me i seem to have disobliged him yet i know not how and my dear audley assured me on seymours sudden departure that he was as much puzzled as i am to account for the striking change in the behavior of our guest the lovers cannot have had one of the petty quarrels so apt to arise between lovers because with a marvelous singularity of discretion and reserve they have abstained from all private interviews i know not what to think sometimes i fancy that his hasty and unexpected decampment is a mere amorous stratagem to try the real force of his fairones affection yet seymour is by no means a creature of artifice sometimes i am ready to fear that like others of his volatile sex and age he is become a traitor in love and that his heart has been seduced by the sprightliness and bloom of louisa to forget its loyalty to the poor pensive and pale cornelia who is in truth most grievously altered of late and seems to suffer a daily diminution of her beauty and her health that wounds me to the soul yet as his penetrating eyes must have discovered that this cruel effect has been occasioned by her unquiet love for him i am rather inclined to believe that it would more increase than diminish the attachment of a heart so generous and so tender but i am weary of conjectures and alas i know not how to end them unless you can furnish us with some authentic intelligence of our too interesting fugitive if there is any one here who is more in his confidence than i am it must he his grateful caroline as he calls her but if caroline is really his prime confidante as i a little suspect she is a very close and trusty one indeed as i cannot force a syllable from her lips that will enable me to guess at his present intentions the warmhearted creature will only say of her protector whom she deems it a crime to mention without confidence and respect that she will pawn her life for the sincerity and continuance of his friendship for me and of his love for cornelia alas the poor cornelia she declares herself greatly relieved by seymours sudden departure and such is this great relief that she can hardly speak of it without dropping a tear but whether a tear of heavenly gratitude or of mortal regret i shall leave you my dear sagacious sister to guess for my part i am quite out of luck in my attempts to study and to correct the restless feelings of both our friends and as it often happens to a wellmeaning mediator i have partly lost the favor and confidence of each seymour is apparently displeased with me and i have offended the gentle cornelia too by representing perhaps too forcibly the inability of her tender frame to persevere without risking her life in an utter abjuration of the man she adores her delicate pride was a little wounded by my distrusting her fortitude but i hope i have made my peace with her by a lucky quotation of a passage from an old obscure play which i happened to light upon very opportunely it struck me as a pleasant hint to us good women who pique ourselves now and then a little too much on the supposed strength of our virtuous resolutions here are the words for you what woman has so sailed about the world of her own heart sounded each creek surveyed each corner but that still there may remain much terra incognita to herself   you i know my dear lucy will smile at the moral truth as well as the poetical quaintness of these lines they made even cornelia smile albeit unused to the smiling mood  in truth we are all grown a set of poor dismal creatures since our knight errant set forth from this castle in quest of new and unknown adventures even the laughterloving louisa has lost her gaiety and mopes like a sick kitten as to myself you will perceive but too clearly by my letter that i am sadly out of tune and spirits but you will not wonder at my being so when you know that besides my anxiety for our dear suffering cornelia i have some inquietude to endure for my husband who is summoned to the deathbed i fear of his old friend and favorite fellowcollegian poor verney an event that gives a double chill to my heart from a painful and perhaps foolish yet natural combination of ideas which you my dear lucy will be too ready to catch but though the health of our dear audley has been ever more delicate than that of his early friend let us hope that he is destined for all our sakes to enjoy a much longer life help us my good girl to dissipate the gloom that hangs over us by your cheerful letters i conclude that seymour will post before he returns to us to his dear privycounsellor edmund and i charge you to give us the quickest tidings that you possibly can of his safe arrival at your gate as we shall otherwise begin to surmise that the faithless rover is fled to genoa or the lord knows whither take pity therefore on our ignorance and our terrors and accepting the united kind wishes of the poor desolate females in this mandeserted castle believe me ever  your affectionate harriot  letter viii from seymour to edmund audley do not think my dearest edmund that i have treated you ungratefully in keeping you for several weeks in suspense and dark inquietude concerning the destiny of a friend for whom you have ever expressed the most engaging anxiety a thousand circumstances have conspired to prevent my giving you more speedy intelligence of my proceedings instead therefore of accusing me for being silent so long give me great credit for attempting to write to you in these moments i say attempting to write for i am not sure that i can even for your sake confine my attention to my paper and you will not wonder at my doubt when i tell you that ever nerve in my frame is trembling with anxious impatience for the expected arrival of my cornelia yes of my cornelia she is approaching to my arms and i am waiting in the house of a good elderly man of god with a blessed instrument in my pocket called a special license prepared on purpose to make the dear angel my own cornelia by the sweet luster of the evening star at this news my dear timid philosopher himself will burst into a shout of triumphant transport but hold i must not betray you into treacherous exultation though i have the most sanguine hopes that we shall speedily exult together on the consummation so devoutly and so profanely wished i have sworn by connubial juno to to make the lovely fond creature my bride this very night if allpowerful love with his capital agents opportunity and importunity can accomplish it do not exclaim against my rashness and precipitancy i have been driven to the measures i am pursuing if vows are taken against me must i not oppose them by stronger vows do you think cupid is such a paltry engineer that if a mine is contrived against him he cannot counteract it by a superior mine of his own contrivance do not fear  the plan of my surprise and attack is concerted in so admirable a manner that i am almost sure of annihilating all powers of resistance but if i can i will tell you circumstantially the steps that have led me to the present heartagitating crisis when i first got from caroline a reluctant account of my lovely widows rash vow i thought it would have made me absolutely frantic and perhaps it might had not my good grateful caroline exerted all her zeal and ingenuity to sooth to comfort and to persuade me that cornelias passion for me is too strong to let her persevere in any barbarous resolution against me however solemnly enforced with what exquisite skill and rapidity do penetrating women decypher one another my kind and zealous comforter whose unabated gratitude toward me is so lively and enthusiastic that i am convinced she would cheerfully hazard her life to ensure the success of my love she i say unveiled to me a thousand touching proofs of my cornelias fondness which had escaped the searching eyes of the lover  she maintained and upon special good grounds that if i had once got my tender idol into a scene of perfect privacy and had a fair opportunity of pressing her to an immediate marriage she would be just as unable to resist me as a ship under way is unable to resist the wind when it has filled every fail i give you this forcible simile in the very words of my excellent comforter and confederate who has you see stored her mind with images as well as her heart with generosity in the course of her nautical adventures we agreed that our dear diffident cornelia stands in dreadful awe of your devout brother and although your pleasant and friendly sister harriot warmly professes herself in advocate for our union yet she sometimes makes use of arguments which produce perhaps an effect rather injurious to my cause by offending the delicacy of cornelia  for these and sundry other reasons we agreed also in the opinion that my dear timid angel would be much more likely to indulge all the tenderness of her heart if i could contrive to pass a day with her at a distance from her pious friends we meditated on various schemes to accomplish this great object chance at length suggested a plan to us that i have pursued with the most sanguine hopes of success you may perhaps have heard of a very worthy old clergyman whose name is danvers and who resales about fifteen miles to the south of your brother with this divine i had a slight personal acquaintance as he is indebted for all his little preferment to the family of my mother he is a primitive simple retired character as unlike as possible they tell me to those modern men of god who have made me i confess not very partial to priests danvers is fond of privacy and peace and he was once uncommonly happy in his domestic circle but death has robbed him not only of an excellent wife but of a daughter who supplied her place in training his younger olivebranches of which as they seldom fail you know in holy ground the good man has abundance these distressing events in his family obliged the honest old parson at the hazard of a little scandal to call in a female assistant and most fortunately for me the humble governess of his younger children is a sister of my grateful caroline while we were debating how to contrive a private interview for me with cornelia at a distance from your brothers caroline happened to receive a letter from her sister who appears to be a good girl almost as warmhearted as herself this letter was to say that having many duties on her hands which confined her at home she was unable to accomplish her ardent desire of coming to wish her sister joy of her fortunate marriage but as the indulgent cornelia had once had the goodness to bring caroline to her she most humbly petitioned for a repetion of that favor on the present joyous occasion  this letter struck both caroline and me as a ray of light from heaven our quick imaginations began immediately to make it our guide in forming the project that i was so anxious to settle it was agreed that i should depart suddenly from your brothers and by not explaining the cause or time of my absence awaken all the little jealous surmises and fond alarms in the heart of cornelia to which that tender heart is sufficiently inclined that i should hasten to renew and increase my acquaintance with mr danvers and engage him most firmly in my interest by every possible expedient  caroline undertook to furnish me with constant intelligence concerning the health and affections of my dear and thus apparently deserted widow alas my tender angel has suffered not a little from this apparent desertion but i hope soon to make her a rich atonement for life and as the intelligent caroline says nothing is so delicious and overcoming as the sudden sight of a lover whom a fond heart has almost despaired of ever seeing again but to resume the thread of my story my excellent confederate undertook also to engage cornelia for a distant day to ride with her in the chaise to mr danverss and to let monson attend them on horseback i was to have early notice of the time appointed that i might arrive there the day before and adjust all matters in the best method i could devise to accomplish the grand object of my wishes i ought to tell you however in justice to the excellent caroline that before she would consent to this final arrangement of our plan which looked she said like betraying her patroness into my hands she bound me by the most solemn oaths that i should not attempt to make cornelia my wife by any species of violence but merely by the fair influence of fond and passionate entreaty an engine which my zealous confederate thinks sufficiently powerful to ensure us a victory heaven grant that she may prove as true a prophet as she is a trusty and invaluable ally i have at length accomplished all the important preliminary points as you know i little regard either fatigue or expense in the pursuit of projects that interest my heart you will readily believe that i have not been inactive or tardy in the great article of making danvers my friend i have been fortunately able to provide for two branches of his family and i have so completely ingratiated myself with this warmhearted old divine that i believe he would be happy to marry me to an empress without stipulating or wishing for a mitre as his reward i have prepared him with a general and as you may suppose a favorable idea of my pretensions and views toward his lovely expected visitant i have obtained a cordial promise from him that if i find it expedient he will appear as my advocate in opposition to any religious scruples that my fond yet reluctant fairone may urge against me for this honest man of god most heartily acquiesces in my leading proposition that if i pay an exterior reverence to our established religion and solemnly engage to have my children educated in the belief of that religion there is nothing further which ought to be required of me and all the rest is a private business between my own heart and heaven this delightful old divine goes farther on my side as he is both in theory and practice a warm friend to the support and increase of the world he says that my lovely widow having promised to wed no other man cannot refuse me without a crime and a great crime too he says no less than a breach of the primitive command a command which she has twice proved herself most admirably qualified to fulfill here is a parson for you my dear edmund a parson after my own heart for whose sake i shall be reconciled i think to the whole fraternity that i have so cordially detested he is in truth a pleasant original character that you my dear moralist would have particular delight in observing it was his maxim he says in early life that if he had a faithful woman to embrace and a spirited book to read with a decent provision of daily bread he should have every thing that his mind or body had a right to require and he held it wiser to sit contentedly down with these blessings than to scramble for the clerical toys of the world in conformity to these principles he devoted himself to his wife and his study the first i know only by her fruits and these do her credit in his study i am now writing and if my heart and soul were not too much occupied by the scene in which i am soon to sustain so trying a part i would give you a minute description of this neat little library and the fathers in folio who are now staring me in the face as if astonished at finding such an unclerical fellow as i am in the midst of such company the worthier master of these venerable shelves is walking in the little orchard that i command from the window and meditating i trust a very pious and eloquent haangue in my favor with two such supporters as this liberal friendly man of god and the zealous beloved caroline i think it is hardly possible for me to fail yet as the hour of decision draws nearer and nearer i feel the agitation of my heart increasing in the most painful degree one moment i am overwhelmed with the transporting idea of perfect success and the next i am ready to sink under the agonies of a fancied disappointment but what should disappoint me if she is a woman and i have pretty good reasons for thinking her the very quintessence of a woman in tenderness and affection she must infalliably yield to the arguments of my love and the passionate ardour with which i mean to enforce them but my dearest friend i really can write to you no longer and trust me i have put no little constraint on myself in writing thus far heaven knows if you will find what i have written intelligible i have no time or faculties to examine my scrawl will at least convince you that i am however agitated and however precipitate in your opinion yet ever  your grateful and affectionate though ungovernable seymour p s i am just withdrawing from the parsonage as i think it better for me not to surprise the dear tender creature till she is refreshed after her little journey i have determined therefore not to make my appearance till after their early dinner heavens if she should not arrive to that dinner how i tremble lest my sweet angels health which as caroline writes me word is growing more and more delicate should prevent her joining this little party though she has promised to be with them for she is all sweetness and goodnature and has contracted an esteem for the venerable danvers adieu i shall put this letter unsealed into my pocket to dispatch to you from the little inn to which i am retreating   p s the second joy joy my dear edmund i am this instant enlivened by a delicious billet from the uthful caroline my angel is actually arrived her health a little restored her spirits tenderly in tune the sweet soul was much gratified by an ostensible letter which i lately sent my trusty confidant expressing the real anxiety of my soul concerning the late visible change in her health now love and eloquence inspire me farewell  the moments grow precious indeed for before midnight i shall be as blessed as a demigod or as miserable as a demon do not blame me the chance is worth the conflict whatever its event i will if i am alive assuredly write to you tomorrow so hope the best and once more farewell    letter ix from the same to the same all is over  we have encountered and how severe the encounter has proved to both parties you my judge when i tell you that each may describe the event in the famous words of poor francis the first of france we have lost every thing but our honor never was a content more obstinately supported victory there is none nor any prospect of renewing the contention i am distracted with a thousand unutterable feelings compounded chiefly of shame admiration and anger i have acted so directly opposite to your counsels that i cannot fly to you for consolation for though i am certain you would still very willingly give me all in your power i could not receive any thing like comfort from you under my present sensations it seems as if i could bear the sound of no human voice but that of giuliana i shall steal away to italy and if i can sufficiently calm my perturbed spirits as i travel i will give you a faithful narrative of the scene which has made me perhaps a wretch for life at present i am so unable to decypher my own complicated emotions that i really cannot tell whether my love is heightened or extinguished in one moment the exquisite tenderness of cornelia is the object of my idolatry in the next her pride and superstition awaken my indignation and abhorrence yet her tenderness  o god my dear edmund you never saw or heard of such angelic tenderness  but you shall hear it all when i grow more composed  farewell  letter x from mrs audley to lucy it falls to my lot my dear lucy to give you that intelligence which i solicited from you would to heaven it were more cheerful but the intractable impetuous seymour has involved himself and all of us in gloom and wretchedness instead of passing a few social and comfortable weeks with you and edmund as i hoped he would this hastly provoking creature has been trying a desperate project with the poor unprepared cornelia he has reduced her shattered nerves to the most pitiable weakness that you can possibly imagine but without gaining the triumph he expected over her religious resolution  you i know my good girl will join with me in admiring in idolizing the unconquerable fortitude of this pure angel and in lamenting at the same time the severe destiny by which her tranquillity and her health are so cruel destroyed but i am talking to you as of your were already apprized of the distressing story that i have to impart you will i know be painfully eager to hear all the particulars and as you have an unquestionable right to hear them i will give you as many as i can  if caroline had not her high obligations her ardent gratitude and great merit of all kinds to atone for one indiscretion i know not how it would be possible for me to forgive her for she has been in a great measure the source of all our present distress she has been the confederate of seymour in a long train of artifice and deceit toward cornelia to which i should have thought her ingenuous nature could never have consented but gratitude like love may be allowed to be blind and this warmhearted creature has acted in the whole affair from such generous motives and is so deep a sufferer in her own heart and soul from the failure of the project that instead of feeling any lasting anger against her she is nearly as much the object of my pity and admiration as our dear unsubdued but exhausted and almost lifeless cornelia herself  instead of beginning my story as i ought to do i am still running into reflections upon it but that i may not torture your affectionate curiosity i will grow a more methodical historian and relate all i know in due order  yesterday morning the monsons and cornelia set forth on an expedition for the day to visit a very worthy old rural divine whose house and young family have been lately entrusted to a sister of carolines and as the girl may be thought rather too young herself for the office of such a governess our good cornelia has been solicitous to countenance her by attending her favorite caroline whenever she went to see her sister i little thought that the expedition of yesterday had any motive on the part of caroline except sisterly affection cornelia was rather inclined to remain with us but i united my entreaties to those of the eager suppliant caroline and prevailed on her to join the little party as i thought the ride and the amusement of a new cheerful scene would be beneficial to her declining health in the evening i and louisa grew very anxious for her return the clock struck nine and no cornelia appeared though we had charged her to avoid the being abroad after sunset as my niece and i were alone we began to alarm ourselves with various fancied and fearful causes of her delay we sauntered in weary expectation and after looking a hundred times over the pales were returning in despair into the house when we heard a horseman galloping at full speed behind us which as we had now only the stars to light us increased our alarm it was monson whom the considerate caroline had dispatched to save us from painful anxiety he assured us that cornelia was safe and well but that the hours had glided away so imperceptibly and the evening was grown so late before she thought of departing from mr danverss that she would not return till the morrow my apprehensions were more awakened than quieted by this message i began to crossexamine monson he is a brave honest creature without any talents for equivocation i soon brought him to a confession that seymour had joined the party judge my dear girl of the unutterable tumult of joy and concern of hope and fear that began to reign in my thoughts from this information i could get little more from monson he conjured me to hope and believe the best and to wait patiently for the important tidings of next day offering to ride back immediately that i might have those tidings with the utmost expedition this however i would not allow we all withdrew to our beds but for my part i could not sleep a wink and about one i heard the rattle of cornelias chaise driving hastily to the door i guessed who it was and flew halfnaked with my nightgown wrapped round me to receive her she had crossed the hall and reached the library but could get no farther the moment i appeared she sprang toward me but sunk into my arms and fainted as soon as she revived she asked wildly for her children and hurrying into her chamber she threw herself on her knees by the side of their bed and exclaimed o my dear infants it is for your sake that i have torn my poor heart to pieces and god himself will rear you in innocence and happiness as my reward but what will become of the lost seymour his violent nature will plunge him in vice in misery in perdition at these words her whole frame was convulsed with anguish  the penitent and affrighted caroline joined with me in conjuring her to be calm and silent to let us put her immediately to bed and give her some of the medicine to which she has frequently had recourse of late and with constant good effect in the severe agitation of her nerves the poor desolate soul was now all obedience to our injunctions she spoke not a syllably more but to express her sorrow for proving such a source of trouble to her friends and to bless us for our attention caroline and i did not stir from her chamber till we had seen her tolerably composed on her pillow we then retired together to my room where the self accusing caroline began at once to condemn and to apologize for her own conduct  it seems this wellmeaning creature had unguardedly betrayed to seymour the hasty vow of cornelia from that moment his fiery indignant spirit became intractable nothing would appese him but a promise from caroline to assist him in the secret contrivance of such a project as they have just carried into execution caroline confesses they both thought and i must own i should have been of their opinion that it seymour could obtain any good private opportunity of urging cornelia to an instant marriage she was too deeply enamoured to have the power of resisting his ardent and passionate entreaties i must say their plot was very ingeniously conducted seymour indefaticable in every pursuit where his affections are interested and sanguine in every hope that his heart and fancy conspire to cherish had contrived to make the od clergyman mr danvers his hearty friend and advocate and had provided himself with a special license that if a single moment of yielding tenderness should present itself he might be sure of rendering it decisive and effectually preclude the dear scrupulous reluctant cornelia from all possibility of receding the vehement and artful creature though he had been lurking some time at mr danverss did not make his appearance till after dinner our sweet unconscious and unsuspecting friend was visibly surprised and delighted at the first sight of him what passed in their private conference my informer cannot tell but i imagine and hope that edmund will have a full account of this rash and cruel affair from the hot brained lover himself alas poor fellow he is probably cool enough by this time for i have some reason to suppose that he passed the night like a sad wild quixote as he is on horseback and perhaps wandering through our woods but more of his nightly adventure in its proper place i must return to mr danverss  caroline says that when seymour had been about two hours alone with cornelia he came with a most agitated countenance to mr danvers and said i have been talking sir to no purpose to the most marblehearted woman that god ever created pray my good venerable friend pray come and try for me if your arguments have more influence with her than mine  caroline remained with her sister while seymour renewed his attack with his reverend ally she says she could hear that their discourse was very warm and loud but as no one came out of the room and it grew late she sent off her husband to me with the best message that she could devise in her confusion to prevent my being alarmed the secret debate was continued with increasing vehemence for more than another hour when danvers came out to caroline exclaiming your lady is an angel indeed i did not think there could be such divine eloquence and such angelic integrity and fortitude in woman but pray go and persuade her not to depart as she talks of doing at this late hour but to honor and sanctify my humble roof by sleeping under it i protest to god she shall be obeyed as an angel in all things i will sooner forfeit all the great blessings that i owe to the generosity of mr seymour than ever appear as her antagonist again she must be obeyed but pray go and try to prevail on her to stay with us to night upon this the poor disconcerted caroline ventured into the room abashed and trembling as she says left she should have incurred the everlasting displeasure of that kind patroness whom it would be worse than death to offend on her opening the door a scene presented itself to her exactly the reverse of what she expected seymour was silent dejected weeping cornelia speaking with a countenance radiant and glowing she interrupted and anticipated the first prayer of the penitent caroline for pardon your deceit my good friend cried the forgiving angel has i know arisen partly from mistaken kindness toward me and partly from a laudible gratitude toward one whose services to you may surely give a sanction to any virtuous excess but for heavens sake my dear caroline order the chaise immediately aye order it immediately cried seymour starting from a sort of sullen reverie the man whose services she condescends to compliment cannot obtain from her the little sacrifice of her pride ungenerous seymour exclaimed the offended angel have you a right to accuse me of pride you to whom i have fondly declared that if you were but a faithful worshiper of the god i worship i would rather be your wife than married to any man however exalted by faculties or station at this very just and tender reproof the sullen and imperious seymour threw himself at her feet and began to kiss her hand with great vehemence bathing it with his tears caroline paused and hoped that the order for the chaise would he recalled but alas it was repeated by the unshaken cornelia it is decided then cried seymour springing up with a frantic air we are to part for ever caroline heard no more but quitting the room went to order the chaise and to her astonishment saw cornelia get into it unattended by seymour she says that her own panic at that moment was the most dreadful she ever felt for she concluded that being resolved not to survive this galling disappointment he was preparing to destroy himself and she expected to hear the sound of his pistol an irresistble impulse hurried her she says in this idea into the little parlour where cornelia had left him she found him sitting with a terrific sternness of features and eyes flashing with a disdainful fury but at the sight of his grateful and anxious caroline his proud heart softened he caught her in his arms and exclaimed heaven bless thee thou most generous of friends thou art the only being that i have ever met with on earth whose ideas of love and friendship appear equal to my own  go and enjoy the blessings which thy affectionate heart has so well deserved and i conjure thee let them not be poisoned by too keen a sense of my miserable lot the extreme acuteness of my present anguish cannot last long go my tender caroline go to thy happy monson who shall find me his friend whether i live or die caroline having hastily extorted a promise from him that he would do nothing desperate to destroy his life or impair his health now followed cornelia who was receiving the compliments or rather the adorations of the venerable danvers who had handed her into her chaise and continued to express his admiration of her principles and conduct and his high sense of the honor which her visit had conferred upon him as soon as they drove from his door caroline began to repeat her entreaties for pardon but the poor cornelia was in no condition to reply the great efforts she had made to sustain her spirit in this long conference and final parting as she imagined with seymour had so miserably exhausted her little portion of strength that as soon as she was alone with caroline she sunk into such a state of debility and tears as frightened her attendant to the greatest degree the terrified caroline thought it would be hardly possible to bring her home alive and earnestly implored her to turn back and pass the night under the friendly roof of mr danvers but in spite of her extreme bodily weakness the dear angel was firm in her purpose of returning she declared that she was already much relieved by her tears and that if caroline would have the goodness to let her be quite silent her strength and spirits would gradually revive caroline says they were perfectly mute for several miles cornelia herself broke the silence by asking her in what condition she had left the rash mortified and indignant seymour when caroline described the change in his features from pride and fury to tenderness and gratitude and repeated the kind words in which he took leave of her the poor cornelia burst into a fresh agony of tears and just as this had subsided they arrived at our door  cornelia in getting out of the chaise thought to support herself on the arm of the servant who had attended her on horseback but to her astonishment she perceived in reaching the ground that she had leant upon seymour she started and exclaimed o heaven are you come to persecute me here no madam replied her hasty lover severely galled by her exclamation it is you alone who have the spirit of persecution  i persecute no one  i thought it my duty as a man to guard you hither and since i am rewarded only by a reproof i here bid you farewell for ever with this bitter adieu he sprang hastily upon his horse and galloped away with all possible speed as if he had no desire but to get at a distance from the woman by whom though he knows she loves him to distraction he thought himself insulted it was i imagine this last unexpected meeting and parting which occasioned the fainting of our dear unhappy friend at the time when i flew to receive her  alas how very grievous it is that two such very amiable creatures so mutually enamoured should only prove a source of misery to each other yet i am now sadly afraid that they are destined to be so as long as they exist what is become of the fiery seymour heaven only knows i most cordially hope that he is bending his course to your house as there is no place i think where he can be so kindly and properly taken care of in his present vexatious delirium i charge you my dear lucy to give us the first news or him that you hear with the utmost expedition this indeed i deserve for writing to you as i do at present with sleepless and aching eyes i was so eager to get all the particulars i could from caroline that we sat up together till five this morning and i quitted my bed again before nine to visit my poor cornelia and to dispatch this long history to you by the post of today my dear patient has had a wretched night and is so faint and dejected that i have insisted on her remaining in bed till she hears the first dinnerbell  my dear audley is at present in happy ignorance of all these distressing adventures and i believe i shall keep him so till he returns to us for he has vexations more than enough where he is poor verney died as we expected and my good husband has a very troublesome executorship to engross his attention  i tell him that i shall begin to give him a bad character to the world to exempt him from these burdensome offices which he has so frequently drawn upon himself by his activity and benevolence  i have kept this unsealed to the last moment in hopes that i might tell you wish comfort that cornelia was a little revived she is just come down stairs but alas with looks so piteous and such an appearance of weakness and dejection that you my dear tender lucy could hardly cast an eye on her sadly altered countenance without bursting into tears even our young and joyous louisa says she never saw a figure so affecting this good girl has a very tender heart with all her wild vivacity and behaves to cornelia with a sweet compassionate gentleness that pleases me very much adieu pray write to us directly and accepting our united good wishes believe me ever  your affectionate harriot  letter xi from lucy to mrs audley you are entitled my dear harriot to my most cordial and speedy thanks for your very kind and interesting but grievous account of your lovely guest and the provoking ungovernable precipitate seymour i know not whither he has most excited my anger or my pity by this frantic measure which his desponding friend edmund says will prove his utter destruction i never saw my brother so deeply vexed and mortified by any mischance relating to himself as he is by this rash and luckless proceeding of seymour as to myself you know i seldom catch his despondency on any occasion and i derive a ray of hope which i am truly happy to communicate to you from one expression in a brief and hasty billet that edmund has just received we suppose it was written just after the fatal conference and perhaps before he attended cornelia to your door however that may be the expression that inclines me not to despair is this after describing the turbulent wretchedness of his mind he says it seems as if i could bear the sound of no human voice but that of giuliana  i shall steal away to italy now my good harriot do you not join with me in hoping that our divine enthusiast of genoa may repay the important service she received from this generous misguided mortal and after soothing the fiery tumult in his affections restore him to us the reasonable religious being that we have so vainly endeavored to make him and as the fond cornelia once exclaimed to you were he but christian what could man be more  his many noble and endearing virtues have i confess made such an impression on me that i cannot bring myself to think very ill of him or his destiny i cannot allow my imagination to believe that a man whose good deeds have been so manifold and great i might even say so christian will be utterly abandoned by providence no my dear i am persuaded that instead of being plunged as edmund ears in a long course of licentiousness and distraction he will be awakened by his and our good angel giuliana to a happy sense of all his errors and return at last to repay us for all the painful inquietude which his blind impetuosity and unsettled faith have occasioned to us pray support the dear drooping cornelia by this idea pray tell her also that i am ready to worship her religious magnanimity and that i speak with a prophetic confidence when i say that i shall see it rewarded heaven bless her and all your household i close in extreme haste that i may answer your anxious enquiry by the returning post  ever your affectionate and sanguine lucy ps pray let me hear again very speedily of the dear sufferers health her soul i perceive is fully equal to the severest of trials but alas what a feeble second has that pure and resolute soul in her very delicate and now enervated frame    letter xii from mrs audley to lucy we revive a little my good girl your very kind and animating suggestion has done us more essential good than all our medical restoratives since i wrote to you i have passed some days in the most bitter anxiety the sensible and sanguine brensil himself who is you know my oracle in medicine was so affected and alarmed that he was little able to furnish me with that hope and courage which i endeavored to catch from him and which on most occasions he is much inclined and well qualified to inspire he says he never in his life beheld a human frame reduced to such extreme debility by the mere agitations of heart and mind as he is you know perfectly worthy of confidence i thought it best to entrust him with the whole private history and i was pleased with the extreme sensibility which he discovered on hearing what his two friends had endured the tenderness of cornelia and the gallantry of seymour had interested him so much in their affection that he was mortified as much as we are by the unfortunate turn it has taken though he professes to admire the devout fortitude of our friend i can perceive that he would gladly have given a dose of opium to her piety and of hartshorn to her love to secure a prosperous issue to the precipitate enterprise of the engaging seymour who as brensil says can know him and not wish his prosperity it is i am convinced an affectionate dread of proving the bane of his prosperity that gives the keenest anguish to the heart of cornelia fond as she is of the fascinating creature she could i am now persuaded easily relinquish his society enchanting as it is and feel herself recompensed by the delight and pride she takes in devoting herself to her children if she were not haunted by the terror that her rejection of seymour will plunge that impetuous mortal into the most ruinous excesses of vice and folly this terror had gained such dominion over her thoughts that she could hardly utter any other idea in the two or three first days after the cruel conference indeed we allowed her to speak but little and she was and still remains much more inclined to silence than to conversation at first it seemed as if all her bodily faculties were exhausted and destroyed by the conflict she had endured she had utterly lost her appetite and even her palate at times a sort of cold insensibility like petrefaction appeared to be creeping over her frame this would be succeeded by such a tremulous irritation of the nerves and such a tendency to tears that a single word addressed to her would sometimes make her weep brensil was grievously afraid that she was sinking into a rapid atrophy which would hurry her to the grave he has watched this most interesting of patients with a paternal anxiety he has got various prescriptions for her from the physician whose insight into human maladies and affections is much deeper he says than that of all his fraternity but they both agree that as the heart of our tender friend is the main seat of her disorder nothing will so effectually contribute to her restoration as the balm of sympathy and friendship assiduously applied to this lacerated heart their opinion has been visibly confirmed by the favorable impression which your kind letter my dear lucy produced upon her spirits when i read to her what you say of giuliana a sudden flush arose on her pale cheek and her sunk eyes sparkled with momentary joy ah my dear harriot she said kind as you are lucy understands me better than you do my hapless love is much more disinterested than you imagine believe me i would most gladly renounce all expectations and every wish of seeing seymour again in this world if some kind angel would give me an assurance of meeting him in heaven but to think that i may be instrumental to the final perdition of a being so generous and so beloved  it is that she cried bursting into an agony of tears  it is that which has distracted me but recovering herself with an astonishing quickness and spirit no she continued i will no longer suffer this horrid apprehension to persecute my poor brain i will cling to lucys most comfortable idea  he is  he is too good to be abandoned by providence  you may judge my dear from your own heart how zealously the penitent caroline and i labor together to make the most of your consolatory suggestion and to confirm our angelic patient in this train of thought i must do caroline the justice to say that however blameable she might be in her secret and unfortunate but tempting conspiracy she has made every compensation that a tender and contrite heart could make by the most indefatigable and affectionate attention to our dear invalid the state of cornelia is such as requires the most delicate management and without the assistance of caroline i should find myself very unequal to it this good creature full of gratitude and every quick feeling has the rare talent of knowing how to be very assiduous about the sick without molesting or fatiguing them  one of the most difficult points we have had to regulate has been the degree of indulgence we should show to our dear patient concerning her children she has been frequently distracted between her desire to have the sweet boys with her and her want of strength to support their society to make the matter more distressing we have not been able to keep the little lively rogue william from asking his mother perpetual questions concerning his favorite mr seymour such as why he went away from us when he will come back whom he is gone to see and a thousand other continually suggested by infantine curiosity and affection  there have been days when such little question as these were like so many daggers but at length i thank heaven the palpitating heart of our dear harrassed friend is grown more composed today i think i see something of her former self both in her countenance and conversation she has been so deplorably low that i have rather rejoiced that my husband was abroad as she could not have supported even his society but i begin now to wish ardently for his return because i think her so materially revived that his gentle and soothing manners will i am persuaded in her present state contribute to her recovery we do not however expect him this week and i hope before that time the sweet trembling convalescent will receive the most powerful of cordials in a good account of the wanderer for whose safety and welfare she is so painfully anxious  as he departed in such indignation i question if he will have the grace which he certainly ought to have to address a letter of apology to cornelia but at all events edmund will hear of his movements and i need not request you to dispatch the first tidings you receive as rapidly as you can to  your affectionate harriot p s my dear patient charges me to send her love and to add her protection that she is sure she is infinitely better than i have represented her whatever my representation may be my only way of taking vengeance for this oblique stroke at my veracity shall be to read this postscript aloud and this only after adding to it that i sincerely hope and expect to see my patient quite herself again in another week or two farewell    letter xiii from seymour to edmund audley at length i am got to dover but with a mind more tumultuous than the sea i am going to cross it was not thus with me my dear edmund when i was last at this port with our lovely enthusiast the truly impassioned giuliana that heavenly woman could never have uttered such an insult to the man she loved as i have heard since i dispatched my short and hasty billet to you from the lips of her whom i was once fool enough to think superior in tenderness to giuliana herself  when the inflexible bigot ordered her chaise to depart from danverss late at night as it was indignation and resentment seemed to deprive me of motion i could not put her into the carriage which was to convey her with such unseasonable barbarity from him who had hoped to pass a bridal night in her arms she bade me adieu with a cold stately pride it robbed me of utterance and almost of my senses i continued sitting in the room she quitted with a brain ready to split with rage and disappointment my good grateful caroline came to give me a tenderer farewell her softness was my preservation i wept upon her bosom i began to think less harshly of cornelia because this most faithful of creatures still labored to convince me of her love i dismissed this kind and sypathetic confidante with the benediction of my heart whose fiery anguish she had softened and relieved as soon as they drove away from danverss i ordered my horse that i might attend them unsuspected and before i mounted to gallop after the chaise i scrawled my short and dismal letter to you i soon overtook the women it was my intention merely to see them afe home without letting them know that i did so but as i approached your brothers my heart was more and more softened by a recollection of many little proofs which cornelia had there exhibited of her fondness toward me and i could not resist the temptation of helping her to alight from the carriage she started at the fight of me and asked me with an insulting tone that is still reechoed round my heart if i was come to persecute her there i hope the spirit of my instantaneous reply has convinced her of the injury she did me by that base and barbarous expression if it has not my present conduct shall soon prove to her that an injurious word was never more misapplied if i have any knowledge of my own heart and mind never was a human being less inclined than myself either to inflict or to endure persecution in any shape my soul abhors every shadow of tyranny my evil destiny seems determined that i shall only prove a source of pain to those whose permanent happiness i had the most ardent wish to promote but in removing far from them i may diminish perhaps this unfortunate influence on their comfort one satisfaction i shall at least possess that i can no longer be upbraided with a design of persecuting her whose tranquillity ungrateful as she is i would willingly die to secure to relinquish life indeed would be no sacrifice to me at present i never wished to live but for the sake of conferring happiness on the objects of my affection but as my perverse stars seem to put this out of my power they may terminate my existence whenever they please i can die as i have lived without fear because assuredly i never meant to do any great deliberate evil and i have vainly hoped to accomplish much good in which i have been thwarted i know not why by that mysterious power to whom for the want of a better name we give the title of destiny or chance the good caroline expressed to me a terror for which i must love her still more than i did though it shows more the trembling sensibility of her own heart than her knowledge of my character she was terrified left i should destroy myself in the agony of mortified affection but as you know my dear friend i have ever considered suicide when it does not proceed from frenzy as the act of a coward and a fool it is cowardice to run into the cellar because the house you inhabit happens to be shaken by thunder it is folly not to reflect that if chance has unexpectedly made you wretched the same chance may as suddenly reverse her operation  you see i can play the resolute philosopher even in my fits of bitterest vexation i confess however that my mind is dismally out of tune but time and a change of scene with a little bodily repose to which i have been too great a stranger of late may do much to tranquillize my spirits i have taken a very long journey since i wrote for i have been at my own house and arranged all matters with my steward for a very long absence heaven only knows when i may return to this island perhaps never but wherever i may exist there my dear edmund you will certainly have a faithful though perhaps a very unhappy friend in  your affectionate seymour p s i thought of writing a few lines to my good caroline but on reflection i shall be silent lest i should say too little or too much and lest i should involve the excellent creature in new difficulties and expose her to unpleasant suspicions from her inflexible patroness be so good however as to inform this kind anxious humble friend of mine that i am alive and tolerably well as to cornelia i shall not persecute her with any message whatever  i promised you a full account of our very long and illconcluded conference and i have begun at times to throw some parts of it upon paper but the impression of the agonizing scene has recurred so strongly upon my heart in these attempts to describe it minutely that i have hitherto been able to make but little regular progress in my narrative i have written however many detached parts of it as they struck my memory it shall be my evenings employment as i travel to methodize these and i will send you in my first packet from the continent a fair transcript of the whole i must now bid you hastily adieu for my baggage is already on board the wind is fair and i am summoned  my thoughts are already sailed to genoa i cannot explain nor express to you the passionate eagerness that i feel to hear again the touching voice of giuliana farewell    letter xiv from the same to the same the restless wanderer for whom my dear edmund you will be too solititous is safe at lions i was eager to reach this city for various reasons and chose in the vain hope of amusement to take a new way of approaching it at calais i procured a french coasting vessel and landing at rochelle crossed the country by the shortest road to lions the sea pleases my fancy at present much more than land i had a curiosity to see this part of the french coast and was somewhat amused in reflecting on the different scenes and characters that it brought to my memory at the sight of la hogue i felt a momentary triumph while imagination presented to my view the splended ships of tourville destroyed by the matchless bravery of our english sailers as we sailed by belleisle i could not help giving a sigh but it was a sigh of envy rather than compassion to the shade of the accomplished sir william williams repeating with peculiar satisfaction as my eyes were fixed on the little island here foremost in the dangerous paths of fame young williams fought for englands fair renown his mind each muse each grace adorns his frame nor envy dared to view him with a frown you remember grays spirited epitaph on this gallant young soldier  what a capital advantage it is to have found an honorable place in the pages of an unperishing poet i might have sailed twenty times by belleisle without honoring the memory of sir william williams had he not been immortalized by this epitaph  in passing the isle of rhee all the vanity and vices of buckingham presented themselves to my thoughts but when i landed at rochelle i forgot my own countrymen in recollecting the brave hugonots and the heard extremities they suffered here in defending themselves against a barbarous persecution i think there is something peculiarly soothing to the spirits in the gentle motion of a vessel and the mixture of sea and land prospect as you sail along an extensive coast i found this part of my expedition much the most medicinal to my mind when i began to be jolted in a chaise again all my splenetic sensations returned with new force the scenes as i passed though they had the advantage of novelty afforded me no amusement the ragged gaiety of the french peasants instead of tempting me to smile filled me with a mixed emotion of pity and contempt poor merry fools said i ye have not sense enough to perceive your own glaring misfortunes  since my arrival at lions my harsh and untuned spirit has been a little softened and disciplined by an affecting circumstance among the good people who were particularly kind to me and the poor giuliana during my alarming illness in this city there was a widow lady a native of switzerland advanced in life of an admirable understanding and most engaging manners her only child a very handsome and accomplished young fellow had just got a commission in the swiss service the first news i heard at my hotel was the luckless fate of this fine lad who lost his life about three weeks ago in a sudden fray concerning a beautiful girl of family and fortune whose hand he had great hopes of obtaining i felt myself bound in gratitude to pay a visit of consolation to his afflicted mother as soon as i heard of her calamity our unexpected meeting has i trust been of great service to us both in catching the tenderness of her sorrow i have certainly corrected in some degree the asperity of my own mind and if i have not reconciled her to her loss by argument i have at least soothed her anguish by sympathy when she related to me with the frankness of true affliction all her very bitter maternal sensations i could not help exclaiming would to heaven my dear madam that i could restore your son to you by supplying his place in the grave such an exchange would be a blessing to us all for my life has lately been made as wretched as his had the prospect of being happy i said this to ease the fullness of my own heart and to call off the mind of this deeplyfeeling mother from her own poignant distress the latter effect it produced completely for struck by the pathetic energy with which i had uttered this wish she caught hold of my hand and conjured me to tell her what could have poisoned the enjoyments of a person who in recovering health she said seemed to have recovered every thing that could be wanting to ensure his felicity  in the hope of diverting her sorrow i gave her my whole history she listened to it with great attention and made many sensible and friendly remarks as i proceeded when i had finished she expressed with that touching eloquence which keen feelings generally inspire her admiration and her pity for cornelia good heaven she exclaimed to lose such a lover and to lose him from such a motive must be still more excruciating than the death of a darling child for if the beloved object is not so dear to her which i think in nature it cannot be yet in her case there is the dread of losing it through all eternity have you my dear sir have you ever cooly reflected on the horrors which this idea must impress on the heart of a tender impassioned woman poor poor cornelia she is more miserable than i am my son was i bless god untainted by the wretched infidelity so common in the world and i trust a few years will restore us to each other in a better life this blessed trust is my support but what my misguided friend what is there to support your divine yet desolate cornelia what would the prospect of heaven itself be to me if i had no assurance of meeting there the idols of my heart yet in one point of view this lady for whom you have made me weep though i thought my tears all exhausted or engrossed by my own selfish sorrow she i say has still one advantage over me the god that she and i worship has ceased to open the grave he recalls no second lazarus from the tomb buy such a miracle as might change her affliction into joy is still frequently visible on the earth  perhaps a day never passes in which his divine mercy does not recall to himself the alienated heart of some unbeliever o that i could reward you for the generous interest you have taken in my affliction by being in any degree instrumental to such a blessed change in my young and most unfortunately misguided friend but alas she added with a deep sigh i have seen in a brother of my own the intractable and obdurate pride which an early taint of infidelity inspires and since the arguments and the tears of your angelic cornelia were unable to convert you i should be vain indeed if i thought any thing that an afflicted old woman could urge to you might produce that effect no my dear rash friend god only can produce it and i most devoutly hope that he will the good old lady uttered her pious hopes with such an air of maternal tenderness and anxiety for my welfare that i was affected almost to tears and felt for the first time in my life that i had lost a great deal in losing my mother before i was old enough to comprehend the endearing charm of maternal solicitude and affection i soon turned the conversation to other subjects that i might say nothing offensive to her friendly and devout spirit we perfectly agreed in one serious sentiment that those who die early seem to be the favorites of heaven and we parted both pleased and pained by each other and both i think the better for our interview for my part i felt my mind as i have already told you much softened and i began to think of cornelia with tenderness admiration and pity instead of fierce disdain and indignant resentment indeed this turn of mind had been already produced in some degree by my gradual recollection of all the tenderer passages in our long conference at mr danverss  my soul was at first so full of indignation for the bitter and unmerited insult with which she dismissed me at your brothers door that in trying to throw all our discourse on paper i could for some time only recollect completely those parts of it in which her bigotry and her pride were most conspicuous but by degrees every tenderer expression occurred with new force to my recollection and in the enclosed paper you will find a very faithful narrative as i promised you of our important conference i will only detain you from its perusal while i make one very honest confession and it is this i have perused the fair transcript i send you several times and at every fresh eading i have without shrinking from my own tenets felt myself more and more enamoured of my lovely eloquent and tender zealot nay i profess to you i would instantly turn back and make her my own for life if i could do it by any means that would not expose me to my own contempt but in my opinion no man deserves the possession of such exquisite beauty who will condescend to purchase it by playing the hypocrite or the fool yet such is the folly or perverseness of women in countries where they are free that beauty seems to be seldom obtained upon any other terms men are forced to play the fool for it in some shape or other i begin to think the turks are the only sensible fellows in the management of the weaker sex so if the divine giuliana does not reconcile me to europe you may perhaps hear very soon that i am gone to pitch my tent with the musulmen yet as osman says in my cornelias favorite play their laws their lives their loves delight not me  alas like that generous and illfated sultan with the purest relish for the refined enjoyments of chaste affection and with the prospect of having them within my grasp i am destined perhaps to derive only wretchedness from her whom i fondly hoped to make the most happy as i think her the most lovely of women but in spite of my wounded pride i am still i perceive playing the foolish lover on this paper and continuing to prate to you of my mistress after protesting that i would not say a syllable more adieu my dear friend i charge you and the kind lucy not to be too anxious about me yet write to me i entreat you and do not fail to let me know how cornelia supports my absence if you direct to genoa your letters will certainly find  your sincere and affectionate seymour  enclosed in the preceding letter an exact account of my last conference with cornelia you will recollect my dear edmund that in order to give my lovely invalid sufficient time and tranquillity to recruit her spirits at mr danverss i refrained from appearing there till after she had dined on my sudden entrance a smile of surprise and i believe of tender satisfaction illuminated her countenance she seemed pleased to find me so familiarly acquainted with a worthy old clergyman but when the parson who is a man of eager spirits contrived a little too rapidly perhaps to leave us shut up alone in his little parlour she seemed to be alarmed and would have quitted the room upon my humble supplication that she would listen with patience to many important things i had to say to her she sat down with a placid dignity that filled me with a mixed sensation of awe and delight i began by expressing my tender fears concerning the very delicate state of her health and spirits i said that i had sacrificed my highest joy in the daily sight of her at your brothers to an idea illfounded perhaps yet certainly generous that her mind might be more tranquil if i quitted the party here edmund the lovely creature blushed immoderately from a fear i believe that i alluded to her jealousy of louisa i soon relieved her from that apprehension by showing her i meant only that embarrassment and inquietude which naturally arises between two people who have much to say to each other on the most delicate of subjects and have not arrived at the period appointed for discussing it i hoped that we might both be more tranquil in a short separation but on my side i had felt all the pains of that egregious mistake the attempt to direct my thought to other objects had only convinced me that to pass even a day from her was torment that finding my life a burden to me in the cruel suspense i labored under i could no longer delay to solicit a promise of her hand that my hopes were sounded not only on that ardent and perfect love which triumphs over fear but on the animating assurances which i had received from many of our common friends who considered us as happily formed for each other and who had confirmed me in the blissful persuasion that my passionate attachment to her had awaked a tender partiality in her bosom which i regarded as the pride of my life and the basis of my felicity when i paused and waited for her reply with an anxiety as intense as if her sentence were to fix my eternal doom instead of casting her modest eyes toward the ground she fixed them upon mine with a look that seemed to scrutinize my soul and without any prudish efforts to force from me her hand which i had fondly clasped she said you know my dear sir that i have professed to treat you with the frank and ingenuous tenderness of a sister my obligations to you are infinite my esteem and admiration of your character not inferior to that of the many friends by whom you are so zealously beloved how far those kind and wellmeaning friends may have flattered and deluded you and themselves in what they have said on a prospect of our union is a point that must depend entirely on yourself then you will be mine angelic creature cried i in a transport of frantic joy for i construed the last sentence into an immediate consent pardon me my too hasty friend she continued with a serious air that half petrified me i have said no such thing do not i conjure you wrest any of my words to a wrong meaning and i promise you in return that difficult and painful as i find it is to speak to you at large on this subject i will yet endeavor to speak to you with all that unequivocal openness of heart which constitutes in my opinion the essence of true friendship i thanked her kissed her hand and continued to listen in silent adoration i will not pretend said the dear ingenuous creature to be angry with you for a step which has however surprised me it is natural for you to wish a speedy termination to your suspense indeed it is highly desirable for us both that nothing like indecision should appear between us i have told you with great sincerity that it was my resolution to live unmarried for the sake of those dear children who have the most engaging claims to my love and have been peculiarly recommended to my care men are not apt and i confess they have no great reason to give entire credit to such resolutions at a time when my solicitude for your life made me extremely anxious to tranquillize your agitated spirits i gave you a promise which believe me i shall never wish to retract that you shall never see me the wife of another i will confess to you my dear friend that this was not a promise of mere pity but of genuine affection yes seymour i am not ashamed to say that i love you because my reason has taught me to set bounds to my regard and i can tell you with firmness though not without pain that i must and will reject your very flattering offer because there is an insurmountable obstacle to our union which some late occurrences and your own conscious mind will explain to you with my veins thrilling with rapture at the sweet avowal of her love i had caught her in my arms before she uttered the steady and stern declaration that she would not indulge it no i exclaimed with mingled sensations of transport and of horror there is no obstacle  there shall be none we are united by mutual love the most sacred of all bonds and no powers in the world shall divide us there is a power more sacred than love replied the steadfast angel and it grieves me seymour to the soul to perceive it is a power that you do not acknowledge i need not tell you she continued that i mean religion  a power which i trust will ever regulate my conduct and which forbids me to be your wife  i endeavored though i believe very aukwardly to treat her apprehensions of my irreligion with levity but the offended angel rebuked me and said i beg sir that our conversation may be serious if you have no respect for religion you at least profess yourself most inviolably attached to truth and honor and indeed i must do you the justice to say that i never knew any human being on whose generous veracity i could more implicitly confide wretched indeed should i feel myself at this moment if i were destitute of that consolatory confidence but my esteem for you seymour is such that i am firmly persuaded you have truth and magnanimity sufficient to support a weak woman against yourself instead of trying to delude me by any species of hypocrisy into a marriage which must render us both wretched if our religious sentiments are so widely different as i have reason to apprehend you i am convinced will have the generosity to avow that difference if it exists and to applaud my adherence to my duty in pronouncing it an insurmountable obstacle to our union i thanked her for the noble confidence which she placed in my truth and assured her most solemnly that i would never attempt to deceive her in any article whatever still repeating that there is and shall be no obstacle to our union  here edmund the kind soul in her turn caught a sudden ray of delusive hope by half construing my words into a confession of faith and looking at me with an angelic sweetness of countenance she said can you seymour can you truly affirm that you revere and believe in that religion which i have been taught to regard as the only sure foundation of happiness both in this world and the next i endeavored to evade the question by vindicating the freedom of thought and the native rights of the mind to keep any ideas secret that related only to heaven and itself but shrinking from me with a face of horror she said i know seymour you are too noble to utter a direct falsehood and do not i entreat you do not stoop to an evasion there is no necessity for any thing so foreign to your nature i have no right to pry farther into your sentiments i have done with the subject for ever and have only to pray which i do most devoutly that however misguided your early life may be you may not end your days in this terrible delusion here the tender enthusiast cast upon me a look so piteous that i believe at that moment she beheld me in her fancy hurried away from her by fiends and sinking into eternal perdition the image whatever it was overwhelmed her she burst into tears hid her lovely troubled countenance for a few moments and then endeavored to quit the room this however i could not suffer her to do i detained her by passionate supplications i conjured her not to be so flagrantly unjust as to condemn me unheard i said that she had hastily and cruelly adopted the most terrific ideas of my impiety from the base suggestions of a proud pharisaical priest who injured me in her opinion because with a foolish good nature to indulge his passion for wine i had plunged into occasional intemperance which i had not a priestly stomach to bear i was growing still more severe against my sanctified enemy dr ayton when cornelia interrupted me with vehement displeasure and said with an unusual keeness of manner you give me but too evident proofs of an unchristian spirit in this asperity against a worthy divine who did full justice to your many virtues and only said of your failings what his duty and his conscience obliged him to say  i caught fire at this double insult this reproof to me and panegyric on the man whom i have reason to detest i reminded my severe monitor of the many diabolical injuries which these overrighteous zealots have committed in every age under the stale pretenses of their duty and their conscience and i protested that i had rather be the vilest outcast of the world abandoned by earth and heaven than one of these sanctified dealers in slander who poison the peace of their acquaintance by misrepresentations of men more honest than themselves and at the same time pretend to be the only true servants to the god of truth this divine said i whom you commend my dear cornelia so much beyond his desert has impressed a barbarous panic on your tender imagination he has made you consider me as a monster of impiety i am apprised you see the force of the brutal idea and of the brutal expression with which he labored to divide us but i will appeal to your own honest heart against your terrified imagination except in that fatal night when intoxication bereaved me of my senses and when true charity would have cast a veil over my frantic words and actions have i ever merited this outrageous appellation nay i will go much farther i will consent to rest all my hopes on the issue of this candid question do you not think in your conscience from the perfect knowledge you have of my general character that if you bless me with your hand my future life will be affectionate and virtuous ah seymour said the dear creature with a soft emotion in which love and terror were blended you have such insinuating address that i must not listen to you on a point in which it would prove so very fatal to me to have my weak reason overwhelmed or deluded i shall be ever ready to do the most grateful justice to your many noble and engaging qualities but i must never forget that it is my duty and my determination to protest in the most decisive manner that nothing shall ever tempt me to become the wife of an infidel i remonstrated against the injustice of giving this title to any man who paid a decent regard to the established religion of his country we skirmished for some time on this ground till at last finding her inflexible and being sorely galled by some harsh things she said i went to summon my reverend ally mr danvers to my aid and cherished a little hope that i might be able with his assistance to give a more happy turn to the contest  since madam said i introducing my venerable old friend since you are so cruelly deaf to every thing i say in my own favor will you have the condescension to let this worthy man of god plead with you in my behalf he does not reckon me a monster of impiety though a wretch of his order has basely represented me as such to you i am sorry madam said the good danvers that many of our dignified clergy are so apt to forget that charitable meekness and indulgence which would become them much better than the contemptuous and cruel pride with which they often treat persons whom they suppose inferior to themselves in holiness because their station is different i was once nearly branded as an atheist myself by an offended bishop because i had the spirit in my young days to resist an arbitrary abuse of his episcopal privileges i triumphed in the vindication of my character but have suffered not a little perhaps in my ecclesiastical fortune the rank of mr seymour happily exempts him from being injured in the manner that we poor little parsons may be injured yet if any cruel misrepresentation has prejudiced him in your good opinion i will venture to say my dear lady that such prejudice is a greater misfortune to him than the loss of the richest benefice in the kingdom could be to me and i shall think myself happy indeed if i am able to redress the wrong that has been done and to reinstate him in your favor for my part i have ever regarded those men as the most meritorious servants of god who do in proportion to their abilities the greatest number of good deeds and i believe it would be difficult to find any man of mr seymours age in the kingdom who has been more distinguished by acts of charity and munificence for my own part i am bound to bear witness to his virtues as long as i exist for he has saved one unhappy child of mine from impending destruction and given efficacy and happiness to the honest exertions of a second we have all the highest reason to bless him and it would grieve me to the soul to see a lady so lovely and so truly beloved as you are make such a suitor unhappy perhaps for life in consequence of any religious prejudice against him unworthily instilled into your tender mind it was in this manner my dear edmund that my honest parson began to trumpet forth my praises while i watched every change in the varying features of cornelia though she listened i danvers with more serenity than she did to me there was still an air of trouble on her countenance and instead of encouraging my advocate by a smile of acquiescence in his panegyric she seemed to be collecting all the powers of her mind to support a firm resistance against the combined petitioners by whom she saw herself so pertinaciously besieged from the expression of her face while danvers was speaking i expected a very tart reply but here i was agreeably disappointed with that engaging and majestic mildness which is peculiar to herself she said to my warmhearted panegyrist we are not likely my good sir to differ on the generosity of mr seymour to which it seems we have both of us very uncommon obligations for my own part i am willing to consider it as a new proof of his generosity toward me that he has chosen a man of your age and character to be the arbitrator of the painful but important difference between us for you my worthy old friend you are involved in a situation somewhat similar to mine i can feel for you as i feel for myself you are partly overwhelmed by a sense of gratitude and attachment to mr seymour and yet will find yourself as i am under a bitter necessity to pronounce against him i am confident that a man so respectable as you are for a long life of piety will never advise me to accept as my husband an enemy to the god whom you serve heaven forbid exclaimed the spirited danvers if i were weak and wicked enough to do so for any worldly temptation believe me madam i should be like the penitent and pious cranmer distracted by the sense of my own infirmity and eager to atone for it by martyrdom but on the other side my dear lady let us be cautious for heavens sake and not treat any person too hastily as an enemy to god surely that very hard appellation cannot be justly applied to our generous friend i speak not with any reference to his bounty toward myself there have been god knows many enemies of god who have lavished their treasure on his unworthy ministers but surely these men have been widely different in their characters and their pursuits from mr seymour here edmund the gentle cornelia appeared confused seemed to think she had gone too far and looked halfrelenting i would not interrupt my devout advocate and only pressed her hand in silence i will tell you my dear madam very frankly continued danvers that mr seymour has confessed to me that his mind was never disciplined and instructed as it ought to have been in the principles of our faith like most young men of his rank he has hitherto thought too little or too lightly of our most important concerns yet instead of calling him an enemy to religion i should rather call him its friend since he expresses a great desire to adopt more serious ideas and since he pursues the most likely method to make him a good and religious man by trying to connect himself with a lady so attached to her sacred duties and by promising that his children shall have the advantage which he has unhappily wanted himself of an early religious education surely a man so benevolently disposed will be gradually enlightened by the perfect knowledge of that divine master whom he is desirous to know and whom when he ha once truly known the beatitude of his service he can never forsake your virtue my dear madam will have the glory and the delight of accomplishing a work so angelic do not therefore i entreat you by a precipitate rejection exasperate the high but welldisposed spirit of an ardent young man who loves you almost to distraction do not make him what he has been too hastily called an enemy to religion cornelia was so deeply affected by this unexpected entreaty from the good old divine that her gentle bosom began to heave with emotions that i was willing to suppose the effect of returning tenderness as she had hid her lovely impassioned countenance i thought i had every reason to construe her silence into consent and exclaimed with impetuous rapture my sweet angel yields to your heavenly persuasion she will be mine o thou worthy man of god said i clasping the hand of the delighted danvers thou shall speedily complete thy blessed work here is an instrument that will authorize thee to unite us immediately for ever  at these words i drew the special license from my pocket but it seemed to turn into a warrant for my death the moment i beheld the countenance with which the recovering cornelia ow gazed upon it her modest eyes lightened with indignation at the sight she accued me of presumptuous vanity  of indelicate precipitation she expressed a horror o seeing her name indecently and fradulently united to mine in the public papers in short she discovered a degree of anger and resentment that i thought her gentle spirit incapable of feeling upon any provocation but as this was the mere upon of offended modesty which i had not meant to offend i thought myself almost sure of appeasing it i assured her with great truth that i had taken effectual means to guard against a consequence which had shocked her imagination so much and that so far from being really guilty of any intended offense to her delicacy i was ready at that instant to pay it perhaps the highest compliment that was ever offered to that most amiable quality in woman that if she would only permit the excellent mr danvers to read the service to us i would allow her the moment it was ended to banish me to any part of the globe and for any period she pleased  i would never claim her as my wife till the very hour arrived that she should herself appoint i said much on this topic and with a romantic tenderness and sincerity that entirely banished her resentment she appeared indeed so much softened that my reverend ally conceiving fresh hopes began to renew his supplication but before he could finish a single sentence a most deep and terrific sigh burst from her heart and she exclaimed o danvers danvers is it possible that you can desert me then heaven is my only refuge and heaven inspire me for my defense desert you madam cried the high spirited though simple danvers much galled by her expression heaven is my witness that i never yet deserted man woman or child in any kind of distress and you my dear madam would be the last person in the world toward whom i could be tempted to act so dishonorable a part i may be deluded by my own gratitude but i protest to god that i speak unconscious of any improper or selfish bias i have advised you to accept my friend and have given that advice not from a sordid motive but upon a religious principle because i deem it our general duty rather to allure a wellmeaning though unsettled mind to the true religion by gentleness and indulgence than to drive it into confirmed infidelity by any rigorous treatment forgive me my venerable friend said cornelia extending her hand to danvers with a sweetness of manner peculiar to herself forgive me i entreat you and be assured that i have the most perfect confidence in your integrity the mild and christian principle which you have professed does you honor as a minister to the god of mercy but a little reflection will convince you my good friend that it cannot be applicable to my cruel situation when you hear the arguments and the feelings which i have to oppose to your advice and which render me inflexible in the resolution i have taken you i am sure will never wish me to give my hand to any person who considers that gospel by which we endeavor to regulate our lives as a mass of absurdity and imposture barbarous barbarous cornelia cried i with a brain that seemed on fire with indignation is it by cruelty alone that you can prove yourself a christian but let me show you madam the baseness the inhumanity of this treatment i will suppose for a moment that such an idea as you impute to me exists in my mind is it candid is it charitable is it just that you should violently tear open the recesses of my soul force from thence any secret i would hide and make it the ostensible ground of your argument against me let me show you the unutterable barbarity of such proceeding by turning it back upon yourself let me suppose for an instant that you had a foible hid in your heart which you would rather die than discover  let me suppose forgive a vain supposition introduced only for argument  let me suppose that you loved me with an affection so exquisitely jealous that you could not see me throw an idle sportive arm around a young damsel without being ready to faint at the sight would it be fair in me to argue as you have argued from the supposed foible of my antagonist could i have a right to say madam i have searched into your heart and soul and you ought to marry me because you will die with jealousy if you refuse yet if i argued thus i should argue far less ungenerously than my cornelia has now argued against me  here edmund i must confess to you that my own heart began to revolt against my tongue and though i could not recede i felt that resentment had hurried me too far when i saw the deep and burning blush that seemed to drown all the features of cornelia when i hazarded my supposition too cruelly founded on truth as soon as her eloquent blood betrayed her emotion she hid her face from us i paused for her reply half ashamed of what i had said and half terrified at her expected reproach but here the gentle creature triumphed over me by language a thousand times more powerful than the most vehement invective  removing her handkerchief from her lovely and half recovered countenance she turned to the good astonished old divine and said to him with an inconceivable tenderness of voice mr danvers i consider you as a very kind and very indulgent father i shall not therefore scruple to confess in your presence all the weakness of a heart that is weak in the extreme yet is still i trust supported by heaven mr seymour i find is perfectly apprised that my affect on for him has run into great extravagance and folly i am not angry with those who have betrayed to him my infirmities because i know they have been influenced by the purest and most benevolent intentions and because i have no vain wish to appear in mr seymours eyes superior to what i am a very weak and fond woman o seymour you accuse me of cruelty and pride i hope i never had those qualities but if i had i am now humbled in the dust this venerable this indulgent judge of human frailties will pity and forgive me while i own to you to soften your exasperated spirit that you are as dear to me as my own soul both he and heaven i trust will applaud me for adding that you are not and i am convinced you never can be so dear to me as the more precious souls of my children this repeated and most ingenuous avowal of her love melted me into tears i threw myself at her feet and protested with great truth that if her children had been my own i could not idolize them more than i do i repeated all i had ever promised concerning their religious education the good danvers was greatly affected and while he applauded cornelias maternal piety expressed a hope that he should yet live to see us forming the happiest family in the world  never sir said the sighing yet more and more resolute cornelia there is a noble romantic yet dangerous pride of spirit in mr seymour which renders him very unwilling to relinquish any opinions he has adopted and he has been most unhappily led to think the gospel an imposture good heaven how grievous it is that a mind so generous so tender so apparently formed by nature to exult in the blessings of christianity should consider the prophets and apostles of that religion as a set of despicable deceivers  whence but from heaven could men unskilled in arts in several ages born in several parts weave such agreeing truths or how or why should all conspire to cheat us with a lie akd their pains ungrateful their advice starving their gain and martyrdom their price while the beautiful enthusiast repeated these spirited verses of dryden there was an angelic luster in her countenance superior to every thing that i ever beheld danvers and i stood almost entranced with admiration  strange and terrible continued the lovely preacher as infidelity appears to a tender and devout spirit we see alas that it is dreadfully prevalent and particularly among those persons of rank and fortune who are most likely to be the associates of mr seymour and hence there can be little probability of an early change in his mind indeed i have read in the works of one who had deeply studied all human failings and who judged of them with true christian tenderness that impiety is of all mortal infirmities the most difficult of cure because the pride of incredulity different from many dangerous passions which naturally decline in the latter stages of life springs afresh in that season and is fortified by age note by the editor  cornelia seems to have alluded here to the following passage in the eloquent sermons of massillon il en est pe qui revenent des routes egaees ou limpiete les conduit lon ne revient gueres de la depravation impie de la raion les annees murissent les passions mais lorgueil de lincredulite renait et se fortify avec les annees pius les anrees deviennent serieuses plus else donnent du creit et une sort de bon air a la philosophy de limpee et la vieillelle est le tems ou limpie sen fait plus dhonneur et ou elle lui attire aussi plus dcloges de la part de ses imitateu paraprase de pseaume xiii    you my dear unhappy seymour are probably destined to a long life and it shall be my fervent prayer that you may prove an happy exception to this rule but without any expectation that we can be ever united i am convinced that we never can and believe me in my firm rejection of your offers however cruel you may call it i am influenced by motives of kindness toward you as well as by a sense of my own duty were i your wife at this moment i should see you supremely wretched here i interrupted her with vehement protestations of her mistake but she replied with a calm dignity hear me patiently i entreat you seymour because since i have ingenuously laid open all the fond weakness of my heart to you and to our venerable friend i can now talk to you with an ease and confidence that i never could attain before and i am persuaded i shall make you though not a convert to religion would to heaven i could yet a convert to the propriety and to the kindness of my conduct i must repeat and maintain what i have said you must be wretched were i your wise because you must see me haunted by terrors that you could neither cure nor condemn i should not only feel that painful solicitude for your eternal felicity which i must ever feel however divided from you but i should be distracted by an incessant dread that my dear boys who as they grew up must naturally look to you as the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all observers would imperceptibly catch from you that impiety which you would be too generous to teach them they would laugh at their poor credulous devout mother and tainted by the infectious though unavowed spirit of the alluring infidel they would plunge  o god my whole heart is convulsed with anguish at the bare idea of this universal misery no seymour whatever agonies i may endure in tearing myself from you nothing shall ever tempt me to incur the hazard of proving the bane the perdition of my children you my good danvers you will no more advise me to a marriage that offers such a prospect to the keen preceptions of a mother no my dear madam cried the deeply affected old man i would sooner forfeit all the blessings  owe to the bounty of mr seymour and all the little property i possess in the world than urge you to act in opposition to the dictates of your own angelic spirit and of that heaven by whom you seem to be inspired  the honest old man was quite overwhelmed by this scene and having kissed the hand of cornelia and bathed it with his tears he quitted the room to tranquillize or to conceal the visible disorder of his nerves for my own part i was not so much softened by her maternal tenderness nor even by the frank confession of her love to me as i was galled mortified and exasperated by her saintly pride and determinate rejection of my hand as danvers was going out of the room she had desired him to order her chaise and though the old man in a broken voice had begged her to stay the night she peremptorily refused and pressed for the carriage immediately this contributed to increase my spleen my resentment my depression i sat confounded and stupefied with a thousand wretched sensations the poor caroline came in to us trembling in her turn at the proud saints displeasure but to caroline she was all goodness  pardoned her for her share in the conspiracy and renewed her commands for the carriage this obstinate resolution to depart provoked me to upbraid her for her pride but by an affectionate rebuke she reduced me to kneel and ask her forgiveness she forgave me but was resolute to go this rendered me half frantic again and at last astonished and almost petrified at her inflexibility i sat silent and motionless while she bade me farewell and hastened to her chaise  all the subsequent occurrences my dear edmund i have related to you already i shall therefore close this long narrative by observing that the whole adventure appears to me rather as a wild and troubled dream than as a series of incidents that have really passed what influence they may have on my future life heaven only knows at present i pity cornelia and pity myself our strong mutual affection has made us both completely uncomfortable nor can i see any clear prospect that we shall ever conduce to the happiness of each other  tantum religio potuit suadere malorum such devilish acts religion could persuade these i think are the words of poor creech in translating this celebrated line but if they are so he translated like a booby and his language is too gross to be applied even by offended passion to my dear and delicate though inflexible cornelia  letter xv from seymour to edmund audley i am once more my dear edmund in genoa after passing a road whose mountainous horrors surpassed every thing that i was led to expect from report and i had chosen it in one of my darkest humors because such a road suited the gloomy habit of my soul  my perverse stars seem to be determined that i shall no more enjoy any pleasures of a more cheerful and tender sort after passing the dreary and hideous mountains between antibes and this city which completely satiated my appetite for savage scenery my mind began to fix itself with an eager fond and pleasant expectation on the smiling welcome of the sweet giuliana by which i thought myself secure of being speedily refreshed consoled and reanimated judge edmund of my bitter blank vexation when instead of the friendly faces of the good seignor pinelli and his lovely daughter i ound only a poor old woman who told me in words that sounded more dismal to my ear than ever human voice did before that the family were all gone to visit a relation in the neighborhood of rome that they talked of extending their excursion to venice and perhaps they might travel still farther before they returned i feel disposed to pursue them round the world for i have lost all relish for common society my feelings and affections seem to be halfpalsied and i have i think no desire alive except a passionate yet believe me not an amorous desire to see and converse with giuliana  as to my solicitude concerning the sanctified cornelia it grows less and less in proportion as i suffer more and more from her saintly pride a woman who can so triumphantly command her affections will never suffer much from the absence of any man however dear to her he in his hours of vanity may suppose himself few women indeed have sufficient energy of heart to feel real love according to my ideas of that sublime passion for i think of it as osman does in cornelias favorite tragedy and i might say to her with a little variation in the words of the sultan i can believe you hate since you have power to love with moderation  but love i shall endeavor to banish from my thoughts and think only of my sweet friend giuliana as this city appears to me a mere desert since she is not here i am hastening o uit it and hope to surprise the dear travelers at frascati where i understand they are residing at present you will forgive my being so lacome as i am preparing to fly with eagerness to a spot which is hallowed in my imagination by the retirement of tully and the birth of metastasio a spot which in my days of tranquillity i have eagerly visited on that account but which i am now impatient to reacn from motives yet stronger because i hope to meet there not the spirits of tully or of metastasio but friends in whose conversation i may find the dignity of the philosopher and the sweetness of the poet  my good humor is beginning to revive in this expectation and in bidding you adieu i must add because i know it will give you pleasure that my heart feels at this moment less heavy than it has done at any time since i reached the continent but however loaded or lightened that heart may be in the course of my rambling be assured it will ever be full of the kindest good wishes to you and your sister  direct to me at rome and believe me in all places  your most affectionate seymour  letter xvi from mr audley to his brother my dear edmund the joy that i felt in returning to my own comfortable house from the desolate mansion of poor verney has been grievously damped by the clouds of trouble in which i found my good harriot involved her generous anxiety for my quiet had kept me till i returned a perfect stranger to all the late vexatious occurrences i am inexpressibly grieved to find that my prophetic fears of your precipitate yet still interesting friend have been so painfully realized i am still more anxious if possible than ever to save him from himself the worst of all enemies and indeed the only enemy as i think you once told him that he has to fear our incomparable cornelia has behaved i understand like an nel in a trial infinitely too severe for a frame to delicate heaven grant that we may not have to say of this trial the saint sustained it but the woman died  i own to you that her countenance alarms me for her life though her attentive and quicksighted friend harriot assures me that her appearance is greatly mended within the last fortnight and is confident in the hope of her perfect recovery in some private conversation which i have had with the lovely sufferer she has affected me with more compassion i think than i ever felt for a human creature before though she is unshaken in her opinion as to the religious rectitude of her conduct and though she was highly gratified by the hearty and affectionate applause that i bestowed on her maternal virtue yet an incessant dread that her rejection of seymour may hurry this impetuous young man into those vices from which he was uncommonly free preys upon her heart she expressed her apprehensions to me in language so eloquent and pathetic that she made me feel them in all their force while i labored with little success to inspire her with more cheerful expectations indeed her fears are too well grounded there is nothing i think more to be dreaded than the fiery spirit of a young man who has failed in any plan of virtuous happiness a revolt to the powers of vice in these cases is frequent i believe in every rank of life for most mortals who mean honestly think they have such a right to be happy that when they find their good moral projects produce not this effect they hastily conclude that the world is governed by chance and are content to follow a guide and ruler who thouh allowed to be blind is suppoed to be irresistible  but not to morlize too long my dear edmund let me hasten to impart to you an idea which i think worth pursuing in the present state of affairs it strikes me that you might afford great relief to the tenderly anxious spirits of cornelia that you might recover and confirm your own altered health and finally that you might render most essential service to your very engaging but wild rambling friend by taking a sudden trip to the continent what delight would it give to your grateful ward giuliana to be surprised in genoa by an unexpected visit from her english guardian and from how many rocks may you have a chance of saving your rapid and muchendangered friend who is driven forth on a stormy sea not only without the important ballast of religion but with a very scanty freight of prudence and discretion pray think of this hint speedily and seriously you can easily send lucy to us who is you know always welcome and we flatter ourselves very willing to reside under our roof if your finances are not perfectly suited to foreign travel there is a sum at my bankers sufficient to conduct you round europe and it shall be devoted to answer your drafts in the excursion i recommend to you i need not add that no mode of employing this money can afford me so much pleasure and that by allowing me to minister to your convenience you will in truth confer a most agreeable obligation upon  your affectionate brother harriot with her love to you and lucy very ardently joins in my request and even cornelia has the frankness to say it would give her infinite satisfaction to know that the impetuous seymour had with him a friend and counselor so calm and considerate as you are    letter xvii from seymour to edmund audley gone from frascati too how malignant are my stars to all my expectations yet my stars do not seem my dear edmund at present to be as shakespeare says the most maidenly stars in the firmament for they have twinkled upon me so wantonly they have led and lighted me in such an adventure but hush  stand with your finger on your lips like the god of secrecy and silence and you shall hear of such a nightly exploit as might have converted the most rigid worshiper of diana into a votary to venus  i thought all my warm blood had been turned into gall or phlegm but nature chose to vindicate her rights and accident convinced me of my mistake  on my arrival here i felt not a little chagrined in finding only the good old aunt of giuliana to whose house i had been directed  my friends of genoa are again on the wing but they are expected here in about three weeks and this very polite old lady pressed me most cordially when she heard my name to await under her hospitable roof the return of her relations this i declined as civilly as i could promising to be with her again at the time she mentioned and choosing to pass the interim at liberty to amuse myself in excursions to rome and in any fanciful pursuits that the interesting scene around me could suggest but chance soon threw in my way a magnet more attractive than the politeness of my old lady in returning to my inn from her house which stands at a little distance from this pleasant town i passed another single house with a small but charming garden on the slope of this cheerful hill at the door of this house stood a splendid carriage and just as i reached it an elderly man of a dignified appearance leaped into it with eyes that sparkled with fury and was driven rapidly toward rome this circumstance led me to cast a curious eye round the house he had just left and at an upper window which looked obliquely upon me because it was within the gardenwall i beheld the most fascinating of all sights a young and beautiful female in tears our eyes met and seemed to understand each other as there happened to be nobody near me i stood gazing on the lovely stranger not with looks of impertinent curiosity but of the most tender compassion i endeavored to explain to her by gesture my very ardent desire to aleviate her affliction she made a signal in return which seemed to bid me wait and disappeared from the window my hear was now thrown into all the tumultuous sensations of fond solicitude and suspense i looked anxiously to the window and soon beheld the beauty who had vanished returning like the sun with increasing luster though her situation rendered it difficult to convey any thing to me because as i have told you the gardenwall was between us she contrived to throw with great force and dexterity a circular billet at my feet for the dear ingenious creature to make her paper heavy enough to reach me had wrapped it round a silver medal of the pope i was charmed with her contrivance and you must not pretend my dear monitor to reprove me since you see that our loves commence under the guidance of his holiness  what strange things happen in this odd world and how little did i ever expect to kiss the image of a roman pontiff with more than catholic devotion yet this i now did as the most expressive answer that i could give on the spot to the tender inviting billet which the holy father had so faithfully wasted to my hand this billet was written with great spirit and in good italian it said that if i had sensibility and courage enough to venture through many dangers to hear and pity the distresses of an oppressed and unfortunate girl i should take my station at midnight near a door at the bottom of the sloping garden and a very trusty old woman would lead me to the person for whom i had appeared to feel so much generous and consolatory compassion here was a temptation my dear cautious philosopher which i think even your discreet worship could not have resisted especially had you heard as i did at my inn that the house to which i was so enchantingly invited had been lately taken by a whimsical old nobleman of portugal a don manoel coutinho who is described as half a great genius and half a madman he is a scholar an antiquary a medallist a fencer a fiddler a mechanic a chemist and above all a voluptuary he has been in all parts of the world and speaks all languages the accounts i hear of him put me in mind of the scottish wonder the admirable creichton and of our wortley montague he seems to be a compound of those two extraordinary characters and if report says true he understands every thing except how to confer happiness on a young and beautiful girl though not a science fairly worth the seven  however the enterprizing and universal don manoel thought himself equal to this branch of knowledge as he lately brought off from venice a young creature who may be justly reckoned the most consummate model of voluptuous beauty that nature ever exhibited even in the country where she is most lavish of those alluring exhibitions such was the report my dear edmund that i heard of my fair incognito and her tyrant who is so barbarously jealous of his lovely treasure that he keeps hi like a stateprisoner and yet is so vain of hemharms that once they say he wanted to dispy them in the condition of a new created eve to a set of licentious and halfintoxicated guests at his table the beautiful venetian whose name is violante and who in spite of a villainous education is truly more modest than vain revolted against this proposal and has been more barbarously treated in consequence of a virtue which a voluptuary more refined than the old tyrannical portuguese would have considered as her capital charm you will easily suppose my dear edmund that as my fancy was inflamed by this history i flew with ardour to my assignation i will spare both you and myself a relation of the unpleasant and humiliating steps that i was forced to take to reach in safety the apartment of my charmer and only briefly say that after passing through the darkness of tartarus i was at last very happily ushered into lysium i must not however be such a hypocrite as to insinuate that the joys i found here were all of the spiritual kind no my dear philosopher it was a scene that would have annihilated the continence of a scipio represent to yourself a young beauty not yet eighteen more exquisitely more voluptuously fashioned in voice in feature in form than any girl that your eyes ever beheld represent her provoked by an old tyrant who had absolutely beat her and pleased by a young adventurer who had freely hazarded his life for the pleasure of soothing her affliction the lovely creature was not ungrateful but i will not tantalife your philosophy by any glowing descriptions of the transcenntly beautiful and extatic violante nor is it  person alone that i am charmed with sh as a heart mind and soul fully equal to her exquisite form my cautious monitor will tell me that i can be no judge of these in my present situation as i view them all through a very illusive medium granted my dear philosopher yet as our friend prior says however it is well that while mankind in fas perverse meander errs we can imagined pleasures find to combat against real care   at all events violante is too good for the old barbarian who has her now in his power and i have some unsettled thoughts of contriving her escape and transporting her to england what say you my dear edmund will you receive the admirable creature as a new tenant for your empty cottage she is not i confess so angelic as giuliana but she has her merits believe me and her failings are only such as arise from her cruel destiny and not from her natural character but it would be no easy matter to accomplish her freedom the old don is a fellow of desperate vigilance and dexterity he might indeed have made an excellent magician in darker times for violante showed me many wonderful specimens of his rare skill both in mechanism and chemistry she reckons him little less than an absolute conjuror and has therefore i believe double delight in outwitting him nothing is so dangerous as an attempt to govern a woman by cunning it always provokes her to soil her governor with his own weapons violante i believe would be the most openhearted and faithful creature in the world to a man who treated her with kindness and confidence but you shall hear more of her as we grow more intimate we shall have frequent opportunities to cultivate our acquaintance because the old seignior passes two or three nights every week in rome where he is reported to be carrying on many deep and secret machinations he has certainly some private reason for not taking violante with him and he leaves her under the guard of an old trusty portugueze secretary uncommonly devoted to the service of his master who delivered him from the gripe of the inquisition a benefit indeed that ought never to be forgotten and i shall not therefore attempt to corrupt this dependant trusty argus as he is i have luckily eluded his eyes and may contrive perhaps hereafter to bear off the treasure that he is commissioned to watch however this may be take care i beseech you that the private history i now send you may never reach the ear of cornelia for if she retains any great affection for me which i can hardly suppose i should be sorry so mortify and insult is foolish obstinate bigot what would i not have given to have made her as happy for life as i made for some hours the more beautiful yet still less attractive violante deuce take this involuntary reflection it has halfpoisoned my raptures past and to come and since my spleen is thus unexpectedly awakened the kindest thing my dear edmund that i can do by you is to bid you abruptly farewell so believe me ever  your affectionate seymour  letter xviii from miss to mr audley my dear brother it was surely a good angel who suggested to you the idea of recommending to our dear edmund an immediate excursion to genoa i most cordially hope that he will embark for that excursion before many days elapse and not so much for the friendly purpose which you have in view as to alleviate his own particular distress for i grieve to tell you that he is at the moment one of the most distressed beings that you ever beheld a dreadful incident has happened in our neighborhood which though i trust it will ultimately be the means of giving tranquillity to his life has affected him so deeply in the instant that he is utterly incapable of ting even to you indeed my nerves have been as much shaken as his but as my heart less concerned i have greatly recovered myself and shall hasten to relieve you from the m which this opening of my letter will i know occasion in you and our dear sympathetic harriot  though you are both of a nature too noble to pry into the secrets which decency and discretion would keep as much as possible out of sight i know by slight hints which have fallen from you both that you are apprized of what our dear edmund wished to think an impenetrable mystery revealed only to me i mean his long and incorrigible indulgence in the pleasures of illicit love alas how heavy a price is paid for those pleasures even by the sex which is supposed to obtain them on the most easy and advantageous terms to our poor afflicted edmund they have proved what i fancy they prove to most men a very unquiet dream ending abruptly in a start of horror but to my mournful story as death the great discoverer of latent foibles has now utterly torn in pieces the halftattered veil of secrecy i am at full liberty to tell you that the unhappy though alluring object of edmunds clandestine attachment was a beautiful girl of this country she was the daughter of a reputable farmer but like most of the farmers daughters in our days she was little occcupied in the salutary labors of rustic life the universal passion for dress and sentiment very early seized on this lively damsel instead of carrying her butter and eggs to the neighboring market town she never went thither but to purchase gauze and cram her pocket with novels from the circulatinglibrary from these she soon learned to consider love as the only business of life and thus disposed about ten years ago she cast her eyes upon edmund he resembled the hero of her favorite romance she contrived to throw herself alone in his way in a sweet shady lane one romantic step led to another and after a few sentimental meetings the sad old sensual and common catastrophe ensued the only extraordinary part of their amorous history is this although the poor idle girl whom edmund distinguished by the whimsical title of sylvia made the first overtures she has been inviolably faithful though extremely capricious in a connection of many years yet their intercourse has been attended with a sufficiency of troubles the usual mischief happened very early and poor edmund who has naturally a tender conscience was halfdistracted with the idea of destroying the peace of an honest unsuspecting father but providence prevented the scene of paternal angush which had terrified the imagination of the two delinquents the old farmer finished his days without suspecting the condition of his child poor sylvia had no mother and by the charitable assistance of an aunt the humble widow of an humble divine she avoided public disgrace and produced a daughter which edmund has reared with the utmost privacy and only visited as misers visit their hidden gold  after the birth of this lovely infant he resolved to break the connection but philosopher as he calls himself he found that this project though strongly recommended both by virtue and prudence was much easier in theory than in practice sylvia more beautiful and more fond than ever settled herself with her aunt in a neat little retired house but a very few miles from us humanity required that edmund should sometimes carry her accounts of the child whom she was allowed to see very rarely and by stealth alas this humanity my dear audley with mortals less virtuous or less happy than you are is apt to lead them even with their eyes open into sad follies it led our dear brother to hamper himself more and more in this attachment which he clearly saw was unfriendly to his comfort his tranquillity his reputation fortunately no new encumbrances arose in the shape of children at times many good resolutions were formed but frailty passion and habit prevailed against them spinster as i am i feel myself a little bound to argue as far as i decently may in extenuation of our dear edmunds frailty because i really believe that i have been though very innocently instrumental to its continuance i believe his very kind desire to sooth my troubled mind and to give me a house to manage when i was so bitterly disappointed of one that i expected to call my own prevented his thinking seriously of a wife at the most proper season and of course had a tendency to prolong his restless bondage under the halftender and halftyrannical sylvia  however this may be they have maintained a secret intercourse for several years in which their disquietude and their vexation have far exceeded their tenderness and their pleasure if i may credit the poor frail philosopher who for my edification confesses to me all his weakness though he will seldom follow my sage advice at last indeed he had resolved on a thorough reform tired to death of the spleen and discontent of his way ward and querulous sylvia he had exhorted her to settle in a mode of life whose advantages she would often enumerate with envy he was ready to sacrifice his own pleasure to her happiness or her tranquillity she might marry whenever she chose it and his generosity would facilitate that event after a million of debates bitter squabbles and tender reconciliations on this wide field of argument all things were at length adjusted and poor sylvia to improve her temper was to be consigned to a husband she had an ardent admirer in her own rank of life who being frankly informed of her part life very generously persevered in his addresses the day of marriage was appointed an event that filled me i confess with strange mingled sensations of gladness and terror of gladness because i had long wished to see the poor enthralled edmund set free and of terror because i clearly perceive that although his reason rejoiced in the prospect of this freedom his passions were in such a state that they might induce him to spurn the blessing in the very moment when he seemed to have secured it while affairs were in this anxious situation our whole country was assembled at the great fair in our neighborhood  sylvia attended her destined husband young evans to this motley scene of business and merriment as neither edmund nor i wished to be there we intended to remain comfortably at home and give the servants an opportunity of enjoying the gay spectacle by themselves a message from our neighbor mrs clayfield disconcerted our quiet plan being confined herself by indisposition and her husband being abroad she requested me to take her daughter charlotte to the puppetshow edmund whose goodnature is always ready to gratify a child ordered our chaise and rode with me and my happy little charge to the fair we were all not a little mortified to find ourselves too late the booth of exhibition was so crammed that it could not even admit another infantine spectator poor little charlotte began to cry at the disappointment but soon dried and forgot her tears on being told that the puppetshow would begin again before it was time for us to go home and then she might depend on seeing it it was indeed a providential blessing to us that we were not admitted among the first audience the master of this canvas theater to collect the more money had built something like boxes and an upper gallery but this structure was so hastily and ill prepared and so overloaded that part of it gave way as we were sauntering about a hundred yards from the great booth we heard a most horrible outcry and soon beheld several men and women rushing forth in great consternation the first report was that many persons were crushed to death by a fall of the scaffolding edmund instantly put me and the child into the chaise and begged us to wait while he ran to enquire into the real extent of the calamity think audley what our dear brothers agony must have been when he found that the first unhappy sufferer brought forth from the ruins was poor evans hideously disfigured and quite dead edmund plunged as he has since told me with a frantic impulse into the crowd and overset some of the persons employed in bringing out a female figure it was poor sylvia with a frame most deplorably shattered and almost speechless yet she possessed her senses and at the sight of edmund fastened one hand which was all she could move upon him with a shrik of anguish and affection he brought her to the chaise and having with great difficulty got her into it and offered a reward to any man who could most expeditiously bring a surgeon to the house of her aunt he placed himself by the side of the poor halfexpiring sufferer and drove from us promising to send the chaise back immediately for charlotte and me for this however we did not wait as a friend of mrs clayfields conveyed both the ld and me to our respective homes i now passed some hours of the most melancholy solicitude and suspense wishing to do every thing  the best and yet doing nothing for fear of doing wrong at last the chaise returned with a request from edmund that it might bring me immediately to him you will easily believe that i felt no prudish scruples at such a moment i could willingly have sacrificed reputation to alleviate the horrid sufferings of this poor dying creature but alas i had not the mournful satisfaction of finding her alive the surgeon and i were both too late i found my brother in the fondest agonies of grief and pressing in his arms the breathless object of his love yet my arrival afforded him great relief he rose eagerly to tell me with what admirable expressions of piety and affection the hapless girl had expired she blessed god he said that poor evans had suffered none of those bodily tortures which had fallen justly on her she considered the dreadful event as ordained by providence to save that worthy young man from much impending misery and herself perhaps from much guilt for she confessed that although she had consented to the marriage she had found her heart and soul indissolubly attached to edmund she conjured him to cherish her child and above all things to give her such an education however humble as may best secure her from following the fatal example of her unhappy mother you will readily conceive with what tenderness our gentle edmund replied to these heartpiercing entreaties he assured the tender expiring parent that i should prove a most attentive and affectionate mother to the dear orphan fanny the name of their daughter at this idea he says her bodily anguish seemed quite suspended and she answered him in a tender transport oh my dear edmund i can believe any goodness in those who are related to you if your sister though i have not deserved such an honor would but comfort my parting spirit with such a promise from her own lips my death would be a blessed one indeed it was in consequence of this speech than edmund sent immediately for me but alas as i have already told you i came too late the little remaining strength of the fond sufferer was exhausted by her impassioned dicourse with edmund and after conjuring him most tenderly and repeatedly to her last gasp to love the poor little fanny and to think more of heaven she expired in his arms about half an hour before my arrival  the good old woman with whom this unhappy girl had long resided is too far advanced into second childhood to feel this horrible event with very poignant anguish but on our dear feeling edmund it has made the deepest impression it was with the outmost difficulty that i could persuade him to quit the apartment of the deceased and when i had drawn him from it i could not prevent his returning to gaze with insatiated grief on that lifeless frame which he had idolized though not with a happy yet with a vehement affection at my entreaty however he at length forced himself from the house though not before the dawn of a new day and it was between five and six yesterday morning before we reached our own door since that time i have been greatly refreshed by much comfortable sleep a blessing which our dear afflicted edmund has not enjoyed his mind however is as calm as i could expect it to be his health i trust not materially injured though his nerves are at present in a painful agitation at one time he talks of flying immediately to the school of his poor little fanny and of bringing the child home directly at another he thinks himself not able to support the sight of her at present and i think he seems most disposed to follow the suggestion of your kind letter which arrived the day before this dreadful event and to join his friend seymour abroad leaving me to take care of his little fanny which you will readily believe i have promised to do to the utmost of my ability and with all the tenderness of a real mother this plan i think very much to be preferred to all i can think of for various reasons with which i will not continue to lengthen this immoderately long letter if you think with me my good audley pray write a  soothing lines to our dear edmund and exhort him to the excursion you have already suggested i am miserably wearied by writing so long and so eagerly and can only add god bless you pray let us hear from you by the returning post and believe me ever  your affectionate lucy p s pray tell harriot with my love that the more i see and hear of life the more i admire not only your virtues but your rare felicity may heaven long preserve it adieu i need not remind you that it is the peculiar duty of the happy to comfort the afflicted    letter xix from mr audley to his brother my very dear edmund i was just folding up the enclosed letter which i had written to your friend seymour in the hope of its traveling to him in your portmanteau when i was surprised and shocked by the melancholy account of your recent distress believe me we sympathise most cordially in your sorrow whatever failings may have belonged to the dear unhappy girl you have lost they are outweighed in our imagination by the force and fidelity of her affection to you and i must assure you both in harriots name and my own that you may send your interesting little fanny at any time to us and depend on our treating her exactly as a child of our own if you approve our system of domestic education and if lucy will resign to us a charge so precious we shall be happy to enlarge our infantine circle by such an acquisition  as to yourself my dear brother i can perfectly enter into all the various trouble of heart and mind in which you have been so suddenly involved to behold the calamitous destruction of a lovely being by whom you knew yourself beloved though not wisely yet too well must make an impression on your feeling spirit too forcible to be counteracted by any vain condoleance or consolation the very sailings of the dear departed must have a tendency to increase the fond vehemence of recent grief it is surely natural for you to think with the more tenderness of her affection from reflecting on the severe price she paid for its indulgence alas how full of bitterness is the ordinary lot of women your poor sylvia never happy even with you would have been a wretch indeed in that state from which the mercy of providence has snatched her the religious point of view in which the fond dying girl beheld her own destiny has endeared her memory to me and the child she has so anxiously recommended to your care will be an invaluable bequest if she serves as i trust the will to retrace and perpetuate on your heart the affectionate lesson of piety bequethed to you by the lips of her expiring mother  overwhelmed as you must have been my dear edmund by this heartpiercing scene i still hope that you will soon be able to recover the natural tranquillity of your cultivated mind and that you will speedily pursue the project of foreign excursion nothing can be more medicinal to the anguish of afflicted love than to force yourself with a generous ardour into the immediate service of friendship indeed little force will be necessary on this occasion as i am persuaded that no selfish sorrow can diminish your anxiety for the perils of a friend so justly dear to you as seymour you will perceive by the enclosed that i am greatly alarmed for him myself no youth indeed can more truly want a mentor in his travels than this accomplished but hasty young man especially since his natural impetuosity is inflamed and exasperated by a disappointment which his high passions are so little able to brook if any thing can save him from plunging into such licentious dissipation as will complete his misery it must be the vigilance of your friendship heaven grant that you may be the means of preserving each other from all evil under the auspices of your angelic giuliana with what delight would your friends of this country see you both restored to it with a new cast of mind and disciplined by affliction into a perfect sense of religion i flatter myself this is no improbable event and i well know it is an event which would make some tender hearts under this roof leap for joy among them believe me the heart of  your affectionate brother p s pray tell lucy who is ever you know a most welcome guest at this house that we conure her not to remain in solitude but as soon as you depart to fly to us with her new little charge whom i must again assure you my dear edmund we are all eager to embrace i need not tell you what kind and devout wishes are formed by the females around me for the prosperity of your voyage    letter xx from mr audley to seymour my dear hasty young friend on my return from a distant and melancholy expedition i was astonished and grieved to hear that you have driven yourself to the continent instead of returning as i hoped you would a contented and welcome guest to this house i do not my dear seymour write with an angry pen to upbraid you for what is past nor to remind you of the hopes you gave me that you were resolved to pursue a very different line of conduct i know how apt we all are to forget our rational resolutions and one of our old classical acquaintance has particularly taught me not to require reason and method from the madness of love on your late measures i will trouble you with no remarks but allow me to cast a friendly eye to the future some meditations on human nature have induced me to think that of all traitors an ardent affection like yours my engaging rash friend is the greatest and most perilous traitor to itself on being thwarted in a point which it too vehemently pursues it is apt to draw conclusions unwarranted by truth and directly opposite to its own interest dive into your own bosom for an illustration of my remark and tell me ingenuously if you have not frequently concluded that cornelia has no real love for you because she did not comply with your late importunate and too cruel request the chief purpose of my letter is to preserve you from a natural selfdeception in this very important article believe me i speak the language of strict truth and of steady though offended friendship when i assure you that the female heart never felt affection more genuine and intense than the affection which the desolate cornelia still retains for you though her reason and religion enjoined and enabled her to decide against you in your late contest yet the agonies of heart which that angelic victory cost her threw her life into great danger the consciousness of having acted in a manner to merit the approbation of heaven and earth has proved the most effectual medicine in restoring her to that degree of tranquillity and halfrecovered health which she possesses at present the love which has ceased to convulse her heart still exists undiminished in her bosom and is become indeed so much a part of her existence that whatever your destiny may be she i am convinced will never attach herself to any other man the heart of cornelia was formed to love only once you have been and ever must be the only object of its tender idolatry and your generous spirit ought to admire and applaud the divine fortitude with which she endures to sacrifice even this idol to her god  but alas my dear seymour it has been your misfortune as it is the misfortune of thousands at your age and in your rank of life to look on piety either with contempt or compassion as it has proved an inpediment to your desires you will be tempted to consider it with peculiar spleen and injustice there are times i dare say when the piety of your accomplished and beloved cornelia appears to you a most degrading infirmity the mark of a poor a timid and feeble mind though in truth it is exactly the reverse believe me her piety is of that genuine kind which elevates the understanding and ennobles the heart by uniting with the tenderest and most powerful of all natural sentiments i mean her maternal affection it gives a transcendant charm to her character and makes her at once perhaps the most interesting and most perfect of human creatures with all the softness of woman and all the energy of a saint i wish my dear friend that i had the power of conveying to you in the most vivid colors of eloquence a complete idea of all her merit all her loveliness all her affection not to exasperate your regret for a treasure you have lost but to awaken you to an early just sense of what it is still very possible for you to acquire however angry and unjust toward her you may feel at present a day will surely come and it is the wish or my heart to accelerate that day when the conduct of cornelia will appear to you as lovely as her person it is impossible that a spirit like yours however mortified and offended can meditate on such a woman with long and unrelenting injustice for had not education indulgence and fashion given a fatal bias to your mind believe me it would have been in all points the counterpart of cornelias i never beheld a couple in my life whom nature seemed to have fashioned more happily for each other or whom time and chance had united in a more ardent affection you have both the same exquisite sensibility the same openness of heart the same generous abhorrence not only of every thing that is mean but of every thing that borders upon meanness in short whenever i think of you and that is not seldom you strike me as the first pair in the beautiful description of milton how happy should i think myself in seeing your nuptial couch prepared under the auspices of heaven i am persuaded my dear seymour that time and experience will soon show you the emptiness and instability of all enjoyments which do not rest on the basis of religion if providence uniting with your own excellent understanding should speedily produce that happy change in your religious sentiments which i am so eager to behold pray let this letter serve to remind you that you will certainly find under my custody perhaps the most valuable earthly reward which god can bestow upon any man for correcting the errors of his mind a woman of exquisite attractions and as full of purity and love as the religion she professes let me add that when i see you entitled to this reward it will be consigned to you by a person whose joy on the occasion will almost equal your own farewell and believe me  your very faithful and affectionate friend charles audley  letter xxi from edmund to charles audley you are the best of brothers and the most indulgent of friends how can i sufficiently love and thank you both on seymours account and my own alas i am ill able to express at present the double gratitude that i feel yet i must thank you for your most affectionate and soothing letter from the bottom of a heart very deeply and i confess very foolishly afflicted ah my dear charles i begin to conceive how much the balm which religion administers to a wounded spirit may be superior to all the boasted consolations of philosophy i vainly thought that i had disciplined my own quiet and contemplative mind in such a manner as to render it superior to the malice of accident yet the event of a minute has thrown me into a disorder of heart and spirit that i might blush to confess to any person less indulgent or less dear to me than you are good heaven of what little use and efficacy is the mere unassisted reason of a creature who vainly prides himself on his rationality my reason has told me a thousand times that it is foolish to lament the death of an unhappy girl who frequently seemed to live only to torment me yet i own to you her loss has affected me so much that in losing this lovely tormentor i feel as if i had lost every thing which could reconcile me to life  she was indeed a very extraordinary and enchanting creature to atone for a temper perhaps the most capricious and selftormenting that ever existed she had the strongest natural understanding and the most pointed wit that i ever met with in woman a pretty and a speaking countenance a delicate body still more eloquent and affections whose ardor was equalled by their fidelity oh my poor sylvia among all the infinite varieties of character which the sex comprizes i never shall look upon thy like again  but i deserved to lose thee as i did for being so coldhearted a wretch as to think of placing thee for life in the arms of that hapless simple fellow who had not faculties to comprehend thy most engaging attractions nor sense to pity and correct thy selftormenting infirmities oh my dear charles if there is as you so confidently and so cheerfully expect a happier world to come after this surely she will not be exclueded from its beatitude who never discovered even to the eyes of a prejudiced inquisitor any failing that did not arise either from a neglected education or from organs too delicately constructed but i will endeavor to turn my thoughts from the dear lost object of my very turbulent and fatal love to that poor little orphan whom she has enjoined me to cherish with unblameable affection the very tender and generous manner in which you speak to me of this dear desolate child and the fond interest which our incomparable sister takes in its preservation have proved the most soothing and beneficial medicine to my dejected spirit you will not doubt the warmth of my gratitude to you both on ths occasion when you recollect how seriously i have ever thought of parental duties if a tender vigilance is due from every father to his child how doubly incumbent i this duty upon those who have rashly introduced their offspring into a world of trouble under such a disadvantage as no heart that is truly parental can think of without the tremors of apprehension if not of sorrow heaven grant that my sweet little fanny who is indeed a very promising child may live to reward you by her improvement for the extreme kindness with which you speak of her education i consign her with gratitude and confidence to my too equally dear and excellent sisters lucy shall bring her to your house as soon as i am gone but i cannot quit the kingdom without folding the dear little orphan once to my heart though i am well aware that the anguish of that moment will equal its delight her school lies in my way and lucy will attend me so far i am eager to be gone on every account and particularly because i have received some very alarming intelligence from our rash and ungovernable friend  you will grieve to hear that his hasty spirit has driven him into the snares of a venetian courtezan who lives with an old voluptuary of portugal he is so captivated by this young sorceress that perhaps his next letter may be too full of licentious rapture for a female eye to peruse at all events you will join with me in thinking that it is much better for us to keep our women in absolute ignorance of this perilous folly i have therefore taken precautions that all his letters to me which may arrive in my absence shall be secretly delivered into your hand  the friendly solicitude you express for him entitles you to their perusal and however unguarded they may be i can securely trust them to your virtue and discretion ah my dear happy charles had your brother and your friend been your equals in these invaluable qualities their lives would have been less imbittered than they have been and i should most probably have escaped the double load which now presses on the spirits of  your dejected but most grateful and affectionate edmund  letter xxii from edmund to mrs audley if i have been my dear sister as you have frequently told me the great support and comfort of your life in a season when the powers of your own heart and mind deserted you how amply have you now repaid the affectionate obligation i have no words half expressive enough to tell you my grateful sense of the intelligent tenderness with which you treated my poor little sensitive fanny and her distracted father in our painful interview and more painful separation my best mode of thanking you will be to confess very frankly that without your assistance i should have been utterly overwhelmed and unable to pursue the expedition to which so many powerful motives have conspired to invite me our dear inconsiderate seymour little thinks that i am hastening to his succor and much less could he imagine what pangs of heart it has cost me to force myself into his service eager and solicitous as i ever am to serve him but while i held my dear little weeping orphan in my arms i felt as if all my life ought to be devoted solely to her and in the moment when i tore myself at last from her sweet little infantine embrace my poor sylvia seemed to die a second time ah my dear lucy as i drove away from you both i felt such bitter anguish and dreariness of soul as no language can express it was not till the next day in my power to recover my reason enough to think of you as i ought and to enjoy the reflection that i had left my child happily disposed to obey and love you and secure of finding in your tenderness all the fond vigilance of a real mother heaven bless you both and heaven grant that the services which i am trying to render our rash friend in italy may be as great as the pains i have endured in setting out on the adventure  i have been so engrossed by these sufferings that i have not yet told you i am now on french ground i had a quick passage across the channel and without any sickness except that of the heart as i traversed the deck of our vessel i continually thought of our dear angelic giuliana and her similar sufferings in this very passage alas my dear lucy i call our sufferings similar but to you i will confess and with shame confess their difference in searching my own dreary heart i find no portion of that divine resignation and enthusiasm with which our adored giuliana supported her sorrow and converted into a blessing the very bitterness of affliction oh philosophy i begin to abhor thee as the most treacherous of guides thou art magnificent in thy promises but contemptible in thy performance in the twilight of ordinary unafflicted life thou only servest to drown by thy loudtalking our salutary apprehensions but when the darkness of real tribulation falls upon us our loquacious leader becomes a mere mute and all the impression which thy voice has left upon the heart is regret and shame for having trusted it so long oh lucy if it shall be my lot to see you and the dear orphan no more pray remember it is the request of my heart that you will infuse into the very promising mind of your precious little ward an early serious sense of religion do not my dear sister let your tenderness take any alarm at a suggestion so little expected from me do not i conjure you suppose that i have any gloomy presage of hastening to the grave on the contrary i can assure you my health is already mended by my travels and i begin to be animated by the hope of accomplishing the devout wish of our dear charles and of bringing back an unexceptionable husband to the most interesting of enamoured woman our matchless cornelia perhaps in laboring to preserve the unballasted spirit of my precipitate friend i may save my own also from a wreck that i did not apprehend happy indeed shall we be if after all our various difficulties and distress of mind we at last form all together a little firmly settled society united not only by human but celestial ties with this animating idea i will bid you farewell dear and excellent guardian of my little treasure give our sweet fanny a parental kiss for me and assure her that i shall return with my pockets better filled with pretty toys for her than she ever found them in her life i hope this will findyou both comfortably lodged in the cheerful house of our dear charles pray do not fail to tell me very frankly what kind of first impression our little fanny makes on every creature at audleygrove i have no doubts of her meeting with great kindness but i have an anxious and ambitious desire to know whether the sweet little fairy in the moment of her first becoming visible to our friends appears as lovely to them as she does my dear lucy in your eyes and in those of  your most grateful and affectionate edmund  letter xxiii from cornelia to miss audley surely no human creature was ever so deeply indebted to all the various branches of one family as i am my dear lucy to yours it is not enough that your relations of this house have watched over my poor feeble frame and more shattered spirits with incessant unwearied tenderness and parental anxiety even your dear sedate edmund is to quit for me i find that quiet and comfortable home to which he is so much wedded and to wander for my sake over seas and mountains to genoa i might indeed play the ungrateful prude and pretend that i have no concern in his travels but the spirit of your cornelia my dear lucy was never formed for any unworthy subterfuge any vain or ungenerous disguise no my dear i entreat you to tell your friendly edmund that my heart will for ever call itself his debtor whoever attempts to serve our dear precipitate misguided seymour will assuredly render a service to me that i shall ever be most willing to acknowledge i will freely confess to you my sweet friend that i feel the idea of edmunds journey as the first ray of cheerful light that has glanced on my benighted spirits since i sunk into the wretched state of debility and dejection from which my incomparable friends have been laboring to restore me it is not my dear lucy that i fondly catch at a false and frivolous hope of making the beloved fugitive my husband no believe me that heaven which gave me strength to reject the most insinuating the most dangerous the most idolized of all mortal tempters still prevents my sinking into a weak apostasy from which i have so fervently prayed to be preserved in this point i have some reason to be satisfied with myself and whenever i cast my eyes on my children those precious sources and rewards of my resolution i feel an inexpressible maternal triumph in my soul which i am convinced no temptations in the world could ever induce me to forfeit yet supported as i am by a proper sense of my own conduct and flattered as i am by our dear friends of this house on my fortitude alas they know not how weak a wretch they flatter i am distracted with the dread of a thousand evils into which i may have driven the lost seymour oh god how bitter is the condition of my own safety since i could obtain it only by the hazard of proving a source of wretchedness to the man whom i have so many reasons to love ah my dear lucy you who know as well as i do his fiery and precipitate spirit will pity the agonizing terrors which it incessantly awakens in my heart how often do we hear of impetuous men who rush into a desperate and sudden marriage from motives of resentment and indignation oh heavens my dear lucy i could not hear that seymour was married thus and survive it merciful god preserve me from a blow that would irritate my poor shattered brain into madness yet why should i feel it thus oh lucy are these sentiments that become the firm votary of reason and religion no my conscience tells me they are not yet i feel they are so interwoven with the fibers of my heart that i know not how to tear them from my breast o jealousy thou keenest of tortures i did not think it was possible for thee to exist when hope was utterly extinguished but i feel that thy stings can pierce even the cold armor of despair and against them there is no defense but the dark shield of death o lucy i have thrown my poor trembling nerves into such disorder by the phantoms which my own troubled fancy has conjured up that i must throw down my pen and resume it at some season of more tranquillity if such a season never arrives this paper shall never reach you  the preceding pages have waited long my dear lucy for this postscript but in the interval how deeply has my heart been affected with sorrow with pity and with gratitude in hearing all that i have heard of your amiable afflicted brother  poor edmund has he too experienced the turbulent anguish of an unwise and fatal affection and overwhelmed as he must be with recent grief has he still the generosity to surmount his own immediate distress and proceed directly to assume the guidance and protection of our rash rambling seymour reward him for the noble deed just heaven for this one action guard him and distinguish him with signal mercies and with great deliverance let him know nothing else but good on earth and everlasting blessedness hereafter heaven indeed has almost granted half this prayer in giving him my dear lucy such a comforter as you are and such a blessed guardian for his poor little deserted fanny but haste i conjure you and bring this dear interesting orphan to us i long to take the little hapless innocent to my bosom and cherish her as my own daughter i perceive already that she will prove to me a sweet and soothing companion for my full heart will seem at least to relieve itself while i am caressing the child from that burden of unutterable gratitude which i feel toward her father haste therefore my dear friend i again conjure you to a house where every heart is eager to bid you welcome and none more so than the poor bruised and troubled but still warm and feeling heart of  your most affectionate cornelia  letter xxiv from miss audley to her brother edmund my very dear and generous traveller it is with no little portion of pride and delight that i thank you for all the kind things you say of me in your affecting letter it return i shall give you so speedy an account of the dear little fairy queen whom i have the pleasure to attend more as a worshiper than a governess that i am persuaded my letter will reach genoa long before you can i figure to myself the great joy you will have in perusing under the roof of the dear sympathetic giuliana the pleasing history i have to give of my delightful little companion i love your parental anxiety in asking me to describe the first impression she made on the friendly circle here but my dear edmund when you made this request you should have inspired me with powers of description far surpassing the humble ones i possess for the scene you wish to have represented to you requires a very masterly hand  o that i were a shakspeare in petticoats for your sake i would then present you with such a fairy drama as would draw some tears of tenderness and delight from your parental eyes but as it is i must content myself with asking you a simple question did you ever observe the female faces in the gallery of a playhouse when extraordinary talents were displayed by some liliputian prince or princess if you have you have seen those speaking faces express a tender admiration and something like a doubt whether the infantine performer could be an infant or not and having seen such faces you may have in recollecting them a very good idea of the first impression made by our dear little fanny in this friendly theater where all her infantine graces are admired and all her early talents called forth you know we are fond of children and believe me no child can have a more bewitching manner of conciliating affection harriot thinks her extremely like you and every time she says so cornelia is ready to press this living miniture of you to her bosom in a transport of gratitude for those services which we trust you are now rendering to our whole party by the important object of your excursion how happy will your letters make us all if you are able to send us accounts as good as i have now the pleasure of dispatching to you i have not only the great satisfaction of assuring you that your child is idolized and made happy here but i am able to add that she is an absolute cordial and a very salutary and delightful one to the tender spirits of cornelia they have taken a prodigious fancy to each other so much so that i should be quite jealous if i did not consider cornelia as a kind of second self  apropos of jealousy we have had a most ludicrous little example of that tragical passion and a proof how very early it begins to agitate and distress the poor female heart my sweet little niece and namesake whom cornelia wishes to see in future days united to her eldest son and who is already styled his little wife has begun young as she is to weep for the inconstancy of her william the liliputian traitor was so enchanted by the more womanly attractions of our blooming fanny that he grievously deserted his more infantine cara sposa the points and freaks of jealousy at three years old appeared very laughable to harriot and me but cornelia who has i believe much more genuine tenderness than either of us says we are absolute barbarians and she could not rest herself till she had made the tiny tormented heart quite easy this she very dexterously accomplished and diverted us not a little by her mode of managing the affections of our fairy groupe in which she professed herself much assisted by the intelligence and goodnature of fanny who has with great sweetness of disposition accepted the younger sedley as her swain to all these matters i alluded when i told you that had i the talents of shakespeare i could send you a very interesting fairydrama believe me the quarrel and reconcilement of titania and oberon are not more highly dramatic than the scenes that have passed between our little lucy and william  had i not seen so much of your parental tenderness i should be afraid of your thinking me a sad old gossiping nurse for having talked so long of our little folks they have indeed engrossed so much of my paper that i can only add a few words of our grown gentry  these however shall be serious words and first let me say that our dear charles dropped a tear of paternal joy over one passage of your very affecting letter to me i need not tell you which passage nor with what cordial satisfaction he speaks of that happy revolution which he says is now working in your mind and which cornelia sometimes i believe considers as a blessed harbinger of a similar revolution in the mind of a certain person still dearer to her than you are  pray tell our beloved giuliana that if she wishes to make a little paradise on earth for her english friends she has only to lead in person the two converted wanderers to this door that will almost leap from off its hinges to give you entrance here  heaven grant that me may see a day of such universal happiness such is the constant prayer of our domestic circle and particularly my dear edmund of  your affectionate sister p s fanny charges me to tell you how exactly she has done every thing you desired and how dearly she loves you she is in truth a sweet little model of obedience and affection  adieu    letter xxv from seymour to edmund audley at length my dear and too long disregarded prophet the mischiefs you have frequently foreboded are fallen on me i am paying at this moment a heavy penalty for having laughed so often at your prudent timidity in the pursuit of pleasure while you without a rival in your rural love and unsuspected by the graver part of the world are quietly enjoying the tenderness and even the whimsies of your constant though capricious sylvia i am thrown by my impetuous folly on a couch of pain penitence and dishonor a sad example i confess my dear cautious edmund of the maxim from our favorite poet which you have so vainly endeavored to fix as an amulet on my hasty spirit  that violent delights have violent ends but you will rejoice that i am still living when i tell you it has appeared a matter of great doubt whether my half departed life would return to me or not you would not easily guess the person to whom i am indebted for its immediate preservation i must hasten therefore to tell you that i owe it entirely to the humanity the nobleness of nature and i may add the medical skill of the very don manuel whose private rights i had so grossly invaded ah edmund if i should live i have learnt at least one lesson and that is never to believe what rumor says to the prejudice of persons who are distinguished by extraordinary talents men of genius are too much inclined perhaps to desspise the world but the world takes ample revenge by giving them quick credit for a thousand unexisting enormities  i had foolishly believed that my noble seignor of portugal was an old voluptuous brute and tyrannical barbarian i have found him exactly the reverse he is indeed as report said of him a prodigy of universal knowledge but he is equally admirable for candor indulgence and generosity violante is in truth no mistress of his but a wild and licentious though lovely daughter of eve whom the kind seignor with more zeal than prudence undertook to discipline and reform for a young noble friend who loves her to such a pitch of distraction that he has serious thoughts of making her his wife nor would any one find reason to censure his idea if superlative beauty and talents could atone for the want of chastity in a married woman though the charms and allurements of this siren have nearly put a sorry end to my life i cannot even now speak of them without praise but you will grow impatient for my own particular history let me pause a little my dear edmund and you shall have it i am so feeble and so constrained in my posture that i can only write a few lines at a time but after a little rest i will begin my disastrous adventures and proceed as far as pain and langor will give me leave  during my second visit to violante we were alarmed in the middle of the night or rather toward morning the fair agile venetian sprang hastily from her pillow and having listened a few moments on the outside of her chamber door she flew rapidly within and turned the key the old seignor is certainly returned cried the terrified violante  the secretary has watched and betrayed us  if the old tyrant catches you here my love he will take perhaps both our lives  i am certainly ruined for ever if you cannot contrive to escape from this window  i think you may  for heavens sake try if it is possible such were the suggestions of my poor frighted companion while she ran backwards and forwards to a window in a little adjoining dressing room close to which grew a tall poplar so very near the window that i could easily touch the leaves with my hand but there was not any strong branch within the utmost reach of my extended arm  there was however a short and slight pole laid across from the window to the tree which served as a passage to a favorite tame squirrel of violantes which lived alternately in her room and in the tree my only chance was to spring lightly over this pole and seize the large limb of the poplar on which it rested as i have ever been you know a little vain of my agility i thought i could safely accomplish this hazardous step and i was induced to attempt it by the agony of terror which was visible in every look and gesture of violante and by her extreme anxiety to preserve her reputation after giving her a very hasty kiss and receiving from her all the little aid she could afford me i set my foot on the fatal pole and not being a squirrel made it crack beneath me i had just time enough to throw myself forward and catch hold of some quivering boughs which served they tell me in some degree to break my fall and saved me from instant death though not from utter stupefaction  how irresistible are the sudden emotions of humanity anxious as violante was to save her own credit by removing her luckless paramour with the peril of his bones she could not refrain from a loud shriek in beholding my fall and that piercing shriek which rung in my ears as i fell is the last thing i can recollect till after a suspension of sense and life which continued they tell me during several hours i awaked to the full perception of pain and infirmity in a lower apartment of the house  judge my dear edmund of my equal astonishment and anguish when in first opening my eyes i beheld the striking countenance of don manuel who was employed at that moment in chasing my temples with all the kind anxiety of a medical friend i fancy a wounded conscience gives peculiar quickness to the powers of recollection for in the instant that i perceived the kindness of my majestic attendant i felt more anguish of mind than pain of body though my whole frame was in a very horrible condition my head though much bruised had escaped by luckily pitching on soft ground in a mavelous manner especially as my body struck obliquely against an antique altar of marble which stood as an ornament to the garden and wounding me with its rough broken edge shattered two of my ribs and lacerated my breast whether it was owing to my extreme weakness from the blood i had lost and the bruises i had sustained or whether i may impute it to the natural sensibility of my temper i cannot tell but i must confess to you that at the sight of don manuel i burst into tears and exclaimed oh seignor i cannot endure this friendly attention from the man whom i have injured he answered me in italian with a mild dignity i entreat you my young friend to keep your spirits as calm as possible i can assure you that you have not injured me though you have from an imprudence very natural at your age engaged in a rash and perilous adventure which has nearly cost you your life i trust however that we shall save you and if your name is seymour as i have some little reason to suspect it is i shall have a particular delight in your preservation you will easily conceive my dear edmund how my astonishment redoubled when i found myself not only known but endeared by being known to my generous preserver don manuel it seems is a very old friend of giulianas father and has frequently been their guest at genoa in a late visit to them he heard the history of my restoring that angelic wanderer to the parental arms of pinelli and as manuel is himself a singular enthusiast he conceived a great prejudice in my favor and a vehement desire as he tells me that chance might introduce me to his personal acquaintance it has now indeed accomplished his desire and in a manner which shows me very forcibly how providence seems to please itself in rewarding an action of disinterested benevolence i little thought that the slight services which i rendered to giuliana would ever procure me such an assistant in an hour of calamity  as soon as i found that i possessed some unexpected influence on the generous spirit of the old seignor i began to exert it in behalf of the too attractive violante upon my making some anxious enquiries and interceding for this lovely delinquent her noble guardian imparted to me the private anecdote which i have mentioned in the opening of this long epistle or rather series of epistles he acquainted me also with his resolution of sending her home to her native city with a handsome provision for her life and his hope of persuading his young enamoured friend to relinquish the preposterous idea of marrying a beauty whom the most splendid prospect of ambition could not reclaim from the most provoking incontinence poor violante indeed is as frail and false as she is fair the vehement quarrel between her and the old seignor which proved such a snare to me arose from a very warm expostulation which her noble guardian thought it his duty to utter against a tendency which the lady had discovered to connect herself with a young frenchman of fashion whom the cautious don manuel had ingeniously contrived to remove in good time from the reach of her attraction her quick passions irritated by this disappointment had hastily made me the hapless instrument of her revenge but here i must again drop my pen not only for ease of posture but to converse a little with my admirable kind friend and physician don manuel  this noble portugueze is a very engaging character but alas my dear edmund how different is the anguish of the wounds under which i am now smarting from that which confined me at sedleyhall my sufferings here are my shame but there i had a delightful pride in every pang here is no tender cornelia to soothe and console me to convert pain into transport by that angelic sensibility and gratitude with which she showed me how deeply she felt that honorable wound which i received in her service ah my sweet cornelia perhaps i shall never see thy lovely compassionate countenance again yet in my minds eye i behold thee at this moment yes i behold thee angelic as thou art in all thy radient perfection the mist of pride and indignation that did thee such cruel injustice is banished from my mind oh edmund what an idiot but i must not indulge this fond emotion of returning tenderness nor lay thus weeping like a sick girl over my own infirmities i will take a little chearing sustenance and then endeavor to chat with you my dear edmund a little longer and if i can in a more manly style  i am much revived by a little wine and water and still more by the blessed intelligence that i shall tomorrow see the longwishedfor giuliana i have the additional comfort of being pleased with myself a little for having just passed with some firmness and spirit through a scene that i thought would affect me in my present weak condition much more than it did poor violante who is just setting forth on her return to venice requested to be indulged in a conference with me for the sake of being assured that i perfectly forgive her for all the severe sufferings which her amorous indiscretion has drawn upon me  our interview was very friendly though not very tender on either side the halfpenitent and halfaffrighted girl looked upon me rather with a look of terror than of tenderness as a man whose death might throw a grievous burden on her soul i on my part surveyed her with a fixed and serious concern in reflecting on the sad contrast between the probable misery of her life and the rare accomplishments that she has received both from nature and from art  though every spark of desire was extinguished as you may well suppose in my shattered frame i could not behold her without a kind of fond pity and fresh admiration of her exquisite beauty these emotions however seemed to be confined to my eyes for my heart was hardened against her insinuating voice by the remembrance of her unnecessary lies these were manifold and as you know how much i despise a liar in either sex you will not wonder that they had entirely annihilated my esteem for this alluring fair while she slowly approached me i could not help murmuring to myself in the words of shakspeare that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites when she drew nearer i discerned in her countenance such signs of timidity and compunction as made me eager to relieve her from the dread which i saw she entertained of my death she threw herself on her knees by the side of a little tentbed in which they had placed me and in great agitation implored my forgiveness you will easily conceive that i said every thing which i thought most likely to tranquillize her spirits but you will not perhaps imagine that in giving her my full pardon for all the deceit which she frankly confessed i gave her also much sober advice  grieved as you will be for me my dear edmund i think you will hardly forbear smiling at this picture of your impetuous friend employed in preaching a sermon upon truth and continence to a venetian courtezan  i preached i believe though speaking is very painful to me as my lungs have been injured with some energy of language but i doubt with little effect i mean permanent effect on the future life of my fair auditor for during my oration which was often interrupted by my pain and difficulty of utterance the poor trembling violante professed to regard me as a heaven inspired oracle of purity and peace indeed soloman himself was never in a condition to descant more feelingly on the vanity of voluptuousness i spoke however not so much from the impression of present pain as from my longsettled sentiments for assuredly no man was ever formed with a heart and mind less disposed to play the libertine no man has a more perfect esteem for the chaste pleasures of genuine love than i have ever felt though it has not been my lot to obtain them and now perhaps  but i will not touch a plaintive string violante is gone and heaven grant that i may prove as she told me i should the means of rescuing her from a course of life whose first prospect appears to be paradise and whose latter stages are hell to repeat an expression from my lecture to this very beautiful and temporary penitent i am sorry to say that don manuel gives me little hope of her lasting reformation  you would be highly pleased my dear edmund with my noble friend of portugal he is wonderfully active for his age which is full    both in body and mind his eyes still retain all the fire of youth though he is completely emancipated from the imperious folly of that season and thanks heaven he says like old sophocles that he has at length got rid of the wild beast he considers love as the transient madness of early life and thinks it the duty of every man to whom age has given the secure possession of his senses to succor all who are laboring under this dangerous delirium in short he is one of the most lively pleasant and charitable elders that i ever met with my particular obligations to him are too great for any words to express but alas i am soon to lose the comfort of his society some very pressing and private affairs oblige him to revisit his own country with the utmost expedition i am to be removed this evening to the house of his neighbor the good courteous aunt of giuliana with whom the seignor is intimately acquainted and whom he has kindly prepared for my reception i can write no longer at present but will add a few lines from my new quarters tomorrow and then dispatch to you the united fragments of a narration that will i am afraid afflict you philosopher as you are much more than it ought to do  what a blessed set of beings are all who are related to giuliana their courtesy is the courtesy of the soul here have i been watched half the night by the good old lady under whose roof i am exactly as if i were her own son my condition in truth is such as might excite pity in a less gentle bosom for bruised and shattered as i am i make a most sorry spectacle the motion in removing hither though rendered as easy as possible seems to have hurt me not a little and i am seized now and then with tortures so sharp that i cannot suffer them in silence though i endeavor to do so sad experience my dear friend has taught me that sighs and groans by nature grow on pain i have within me some internal mischief that my surgeon who is a frenchman sent from rome either does not comprehend himself or will not explain honestly to me i am almost as sick of his shrugs and evasions as of my wounds

side she forbids me to write more she will address a billet to you herself oh edmund what a perfect angel she is heavens how she has talked to me of my cornelia with what eloquence what enthusiastic admiration has she displayed the merit to which i have been so barbarously blind how has she made me abhor all my past cruelty and injustice to the dear injured object of our mutual idolatry but i must resume this animating subject at a calmer season i am now doubly exhausted by pain and delight i must lie quiet and meditate with tears and gratitude on the exquisite angelic tenderness of this incomparable friend farewell my dear edmund pray divulge not my follies or my sufferings till i can speak of them as i ought to the dear circle at audleygrove heaven bless you and all you regard pray

should we be to meet yo under our own roof and how delightful should we all unite together to make a speech perfect cure of the engaging penitent seymour when i said this to him he replied no  it must

bless you both encor adio    letter xxvii from seymour to edmund audley alive alive my dear edmund but how can you who know how much i live on that sweet food of the heart good tidings from those i love how can you suffer me to be so long without a letter from england if the dear injured cornelia has banished me from her mind you my faithful edmund will have only thought of me the more but i am again injuring by my wild conjectures the divinest of women who forgets every injury and chronicles every benefit in a heart as pure and perfect as the records of heaven  yet why my dear edmund are you silent so long this unusual silence in a correspondent so tenderly attentive to your absent friend as you have ever seen fills me with a thousand fears some evil must have happened either to yourself or to some one very dear to you  no my good consoling angel giuliana will not have it so she says the foreign posts are illconducted and letters from dear england her constant expression when she mentions our country are frequently lost oh edmund this truly angelic comforter will not follow me to have a secret pain of mind or body that she can possibly prevent i must bble volumes to you if i attempted to give u a full idea of half what she has said and done  preserve my life and make it worth preservation i am made indeed a new creature in many points by the tender vigilance and exertons of this heavenly attendant oh edmund  i recover  but why should i alarm you with n if when i am almost able to tell you that i  recovered  within the six days that i have nw been watched and cherished by my good  for as such i must ever regard our dear guliana i have made considerable advances wards health of body and still more toward ealth of mind the most dismal appearances of my contusion are passed away and though i am not perfectly free from internal pain at particular times yet i can now not only stretc myself out to my full length which i could no at first do without torture but i can walk a lttle without appearing to suffer from motion  the kind giuliana has had a consultation o surgeons that she might indulge me in w which i feel with an extreme solicitude that i cannot perfectly account for of being remove immediately to genoa my good old friend pinelli who is very anxious to have me un his own roof is almost as eager for my removal s i am and i confess i am eager for it to a degree perhaps of childish impatience i cannot bear to trouble any longer the very kind but infirm old lady of this mansion whethe my destiny be life or death and i thank god i can abide the doubtful issue without any perturbations of unmanly terror i most zealously wish to receive the appointment of heaven in the house of the pinellis where i shall feel myself perfectly at home and in the arms of a father and a sister to whom my heart is gratefully attached and in whose presence i can most willngly meet either the pleasures of returning health or the awful though undreaded pangs o dssolution the kind seignor has been very fy in making preparations with the sanction of three surgeons for my speedy removal we are to travel partly by water and partly by land and every possible convenience is provided for y safety and comfort oh edmund i am overwhelmed with the sense of my unutterable obigtions to these dear and excellent friend pray assist me by expressing in your letters our ed gratitude for all their goodness  write to me i conjure you the moment you receive this and direct to genoa on the day that i arrive there i will not fail to tell you how i have supported the removal you have now my permission to mention my illness but in such a manner as to awaken only a tender interest and not a painful anxiety in the feeling bosom of cornelia alas i have given that gentle bosom too much pain already whether i shall ever have the power to atone for that pain as my heart and soul are desirous of making the atonement heaven only knows hope the best my dear edmund and believe me with our united good wishes to dear england to use giulianas comprehensive words  ever your sincere and affectionate seymour  letter xxviii from edmund audley to his brother my very dear charles it was a good angel indeed as lucy said that prompted you to engage me in this distant expedition had i not visited italy little alas would my chance have been of ever beholding the interesting countenance of our dear inconsderate seymour again even now when i am arrived at genoa i know not whether i may yet see him alive it is with the deepest anguish of heart i inform you that i find him not in this city and here he is slowly traveling ither very grievously wounded by some hord casualty the particulars of which i am unable to learn it is yet a great comfort to me to know that he is under the immediate care of our dear giuliana and her excellent father  i have been interrupted just as i was beginning to pour out to you all the dark anxiety of a dejected spirit by a most welcome unexpected and for some time unknown visitor as we unluckily possess but little of each others language our conversation has passed more in gesture than in words our hearts however being both full of the same ardent wishes understood each other completely and mine has caught new life and hope from the honest affectionate creature who labored to the utmost of his power to inspire me with both  this agreeable enlivening visitor is pietro the good old servant of signor pinelli whose name and character you will recollect in seymours interesting account of giulianas return to the house of her father the active pietro had hastened to genoa to prepare all things at home for the reception of his family and their dear wounded fellowtraveller the honest fellow who did not quit them till they had passed through considerably more than half their journey assures me that seymour supports it to admiration to use his own forcible expression he seems indeed to think so highly of our friends noble  that i believe he hardly reckons him a  at least he will not allow me to harur the grievous apprehension under which i began my letter that our friend may not reach genoa alive pietro protests that i shall see him much recovered tomorrow indeed the kind llw offered on seeing all my terror and anxit to set off with me again directly though he is but just arrived and escort me to surprise my friend on his way but this i would not think of for various reasons especially as it is now evening and the travelers are to come by water from lerici to avoid the mountain  i have acquiesced however in another proposal of the good pietros because it seemed as i i should break the honest fellows heart if i reed his request this is to remove immediately from my inn where i am now writing and sleep under the roof of his master he says he could never look in the face of the angelc giuliana again if he suffered her dear english father as i find she constantly calls me to rman in any house but hers there is a mixture of simplicity and energy in the manners of this affectionate old domestic that delights me exedingly the comfortable hope which he has taught me to cherish has made me so partial to  that i shall very willingly put myself under his direction as i am convinced the pinellis will be particularly pleased to find me waiting to receive them in their own mansion i will not however detain this paper to add an account of their arrival but seize the departing post in my egness to send you most speedily this promising account which i am the more anxious to do because i think it probable that you have been alarmed by some history of the mischance the particulars of which i tried in vain to collect from pietro who yet seemed i thought to know more than he chose to communicate even to me though i have the honor of standing very high in his good opinion i shall lay down my pe in the cheerful hope of resuming it tomorrow to begin such a history as you will most wish to receive perhaps my dear charles the painful incident whatever it may prove which has made me tremble for the life of my engaging friend may ultimately be what you call a blessing in disguise one of those heavendirected events which lead us through transient affliction to lasting comfort as some inundation very richly repay by permanent fertility the ravage of an hour  the recent alarm which i have suffered for seymour absorbed my thoughts so entirely that i have said little of myself i will not however close my letter without confessing to you my dear brother what i know you will hear with fraternal satisfaction i begin to think mysef an example of your maxim that to a mind disposed to sarcastic scepticim nothing is so salutary as a sudden unexpected blow on the heart mine has bled indeed from the wound it received so suddenly in england much more than i thought it could have done from a wound of that kind but i now perceive that i wanted the correction and i trust it is sufficient heaven preserve my friend let me not run into a melancholy key just in the moment when i intended to close with a very cheerful adieu a thousand thanks to you all for your extreme kindness to my dear little fanny pray give her a parental embrace for me and believe me dear charles with the most fervent good wishes to all around you  your very grateful and affectionate brother  letter xxix from the same to the same at length my dear brother they are arrived and never did any meeting of anxious and grateful friends more abundantly call forth the tears of tenderness and delight mingled alas on my part with the keenest sensations of pity and of terror  i will not attempt my dear charles to cheer you with any hopes that i feel not myself and i am therefore under the painful necessity of telling you that the grievously altered appearance of our friend alarms me in the greatest degree heavens what a deplorable change in his gay and gallant figure has this orrible calamity produced his florid cheeks are grown as pale and hollow as the very image of death his whole frame emaciated and feeble  yet his native cheerfulness and good temper appear unimpaired and there is a look of intellectual vigor in his countenance superior i think to what i ever observed in his most healthy days though intelligence was at all times the characteristc of his features we can easily account indeed for his being so extremely reduced as he has taken no sustenance but liquids and those only in small quantity since the horrible mischance whenever he has ventured on the smallest portion of solid food even of the simplest kind his cough and pain became almost insupportable but i will not speak farther on this point at present as i am resolved to draw up his case in the most circumstantial manner that i possibly can and enclose it in this letter entreating you to send us brensils opinion upon it immediately and desiring him to let that opinion be followed by others which i request him to procure from those persons in london whom he would himself wish to consult they tell me here that i am too much alarmed that i do not make suffcient allowance for the depressive and fearful effect which a sudden sight of the great alteration in his figure has produced on my vious spirits they say that time alone asstd by seymours very fine natural constitution at his period of life would undoubtedly accomplish a cure but as the injury sustained was extensive and complicated the cure must be a work of considerable time heaven grant that thee hopful conjectures in which the warmhearted giuliana and her father have much greater confidence than i have may prove justly founded at all events we shall try every possible expedient to restore him and at present even i with all my fears must allow there is no immediate sign of impending death  i have quitted my paper to take a fresh view of this dear interesting patient and have this instant left him under the care of his good angel as he calls giuliana who is reading to him some chapters of st john from her italian bible i have prevented his answering your very kind letter today which he wanted to do it affected him so much that he dropped tears of gratitude on every page of it and having perused the whole with great but silent emotion he gave it to giuliana with the following expressive words and a look still more expressive here my good angel here is a letter that you will read with delight because it was dictated by a spirit as angelic as your own giuliana did not think less favorably of the writer and you will give me credit my dear charles for the joy i felt in hearing praise most cordially bestowed on a brother whom i have every reason to love but my best way of thnking you for all your kindness to my friend will be to pursue the purpose for which i resumed my pen and to give you as good an account as i can of our meeting here and of such conversation as we have hitherto held together  my eagerness to salute the travelers with a welcome they little expected made me loiter yesterday for some hours by the waterside till pietro finding me faint and almost sick with expectation and anxiety persuaded me to retire for refreshment and wait to receive them at home promising to tell them nothing more than that an english gentleman was arrived with letters as i wished to have the pleasure of surprising them i had refreshed myself and endeavored to beguile the anxious minutes in the seignors very noble library where taking up a volume of metastasio i had just thrown my nerves into a very tender vibration by his sweet description of friendship in the opera of olimpiade when the dear friend for whom i waited so anxiously arrived  having heard that a gentleman from england was waiting in the library giuliana darted first into the room with that celerity of motion which quick affections inspire o heaven exclaimed the lovely enthusiast it is my dear father edmund so saying she threw herself into my arms in a transport of gratitude this is kind indeed she continued it is almost a miracle surely you cannot have received my letter no my angelic daughter and have not you heard of our poor seymours sad accident yes i have then surely my dear edmund you are a magician and have some secret art of knowing what happens to your absent friends and some supernatural method of conveying yourself to comfort them in distress bless the good spirits who have brought you to the house of your far distant child just in the moment when she most wanted you to assist her in restoring your favorite friend here she embraced me with fresh emotions of truly filial delight but recollecting how i must be shocked at the dreadful alteration in the countenance of her dear patient she was beginning to prepare me for a sight of him when his emaciated figure appeared slowly creeping through the halfopen door giuliana had supposed him to be resting himself in another apartment but his quick ears had caught the sound of edmund on her first lively exclamation and he had followed her as fast as his infirm and painful condition would allow him to do the first sight of me affected him so much that i believe he would have fainted if i had not sprung forward and supported his languid frame in my arms he fell on my neck and burst into tears but soon recovered himself enough to express the most lively joy on my arrival he declared with his usual kindness and warmth that my society would do him more good than all the surgeons in europe and that now he had a perfect assurance of a speedy cure provided said the affectionate invalid with a look of anxious enquiry that you can truly tell me you have left all the dear circle well at audleygrove all well i replied or very nearly so i can assure you and the circle as numerous as it was for i have sent lucy to fill the vacancy made by the return of the young louisa to ireland what happy chance then my dear edmund conducted you hither for you must have quitted england i think before the news of my calamity could have reached it o he is certainly a magician as i have told him said the smiling giuliana he has conveyed himself to us in a very mavelous manner today and tomorrow i suppose by a flourish of his wand he will transport even the divine cornelia into this apartment and then my dear patient he will have doubly ratified your cure not so indeed my good angel cried seymour with a ghastly smile if your magician were to exhibit such a proof of his art at ths season instead or restoring he would utterly demolish me there is nothing that i could so ill sustain as unmerited kindness from the injured object of my idolatry before i have had time to make any kind of expiation oh exclaimed the quick giuliana i love you for your ideas of expiation but if the dear magician can set the idol before us i will answer for it that all past injuries shall be soon expiated and soon forgiven this i trust we shall see in due time at present it would be wrong perhaps to make such rapid and encroaching demands on so kind a magician he has already done much for me and the blessed hour is now come in which i may in my turn afford him perhaps the very pleasure which his heart is most eager to receive oh my dear edmund continued the lovely enthusiast with an air of more serious delight i cannot rest another moment without informing you that the cruel impediment is removed we have only to restore the health of this dear invalid to confer upon your divine cornelia all the happiness she deserves you delight me indeed said i pressing her hand in a transport of religious joy and i am thoroughly sensible what thanks are due to our good angel for so blessed an event oh my good english father repld my lovely and most grateful hostess how often have i hoped that heaven would indulge me with some opportunity of expressing my gratitude to you in person did seymour tell you after he had conducted your poor brokenhearted giuliana to her distant home did he tell you how often and how vainly i argued with man in our travels did he mention one evening in particular it was at avignon when my anxiety for his salvation had shaken my very soul i threw myself on my knees and addressing the spirit of my dear sainted peverell i prayed most fervently that in some period of my life i might have the blessing to behold my generous misguided friend and protector awakened to a just and timely knowledge of that god whom my dear departed love had taught me to worship with rational adoration that prayer my dear edmund that fervent prayer was heard you may now tell the most severelytried and the most meritorious of women that all the cruel conflict in her bosom may cease for ever you may tell the incomparable cornelia that she may now indulge without a scruple all the exquisite tenderness of her heart for the god whom she has served so fthfully gives a sanction to her love  but where is my other father cried the lovely enthusiast recollecting that i had not yet been the old seignor oh edmund it has plded heaven to bless me also by an equal ange in his spirit though it has not been my destiny as i wished to pass my life with my dear peverell yet my pure love for that most perfect of mortals has proved a source i trust of eternal blessedness not only to my own soul but to others as dear to me as my own here she darted a smile of devout cheerfulness on seymour and after charging him not to hurt himself by conversing too eagerly with me she left us to ourselves and went in quest of her father  what a perfect angel she is cried seymour to me as our dear hostess withdrew oh edmund i am convinced that your calm and boasted philosophy is but a plausible cheat and that sentiment and honor the more eagerlyfollowed guides of my early life are no better than luminous vapors to a benighted mind that lead it we know not whither your brother my dear friend is assuredly in the right it is religion alone as he says that can give solid value and real permanent luster to human life it is religion alone that can remove danger from prosperity and anguish from affliction let me conjure you my dear friend to contemplate the beneficent efficacy of this principle in this angelic conduct and heavenly state of mind that you will find more and more reason to admire in giuliana and if an opposite example may be also instructive i need not point it out to my dear edmunds attention but on this subject we shall both i trust have leisure for much private discourse when talking will be more easy to me let me now enquire into a point that fills me with a most uncomfortable alarm the letters that i have lately written to you i would not for the universe have them fall into the hands of the dear injured cornelia yet if lucy opens them she in the simple affectionate frankness of her heart  i interrupted him to quiet this fear and assured him his letters would be perfectly safe in your hands as you have the most tender solicitude to keep the gentle spirit of cornelia as free from all painful agitation as it can be kept after all that has passed he was perfectly satisfied with this assurance and spoke of you with the most cordial esteem gratitude and confidence he then questioned me very closely on the immediate cause of my expedition i told him all that i have recently suffered dwelling my dear charles with particular satisfaction on the great comfort you afforded me in my distress and your invaluable kindness to my dear little fanny we were both affected too vehemently in the course of my sad story and i was afraid that the extreme sympathy of my tenderhearted friend might be very injurious to him in his present weak state but he assured me to the contrary and i observed with pleasure that my mournful narrative considerably increased that religious turn of mind which i have mentioned in our friend and which as i know my dear charles it is the great object of your benevolent wishes i am desirous of displaying to you exactly as it showed itself to me  just as i had finished my melancholy tale we were agreeably relieved from the sad impression it made upon us by the entrance of the majestic pinelli and his incomparable daughter i never beheld a scene of joy so touching as the joy of giuliana in introducing her two fathers as she calls us to each other indeed my vanity or i may rather say the honest pride of my heart was never more gratified than by the many kind and grateful things that were laid to me on this occasion as to giuliana her delight seemed to have in it something supernatural placing herself between us as i and the seignor stood together she clasped us in her lovely arms with a graceful energy of gesture peculiar to herself and her fine face became indeed as radiant as the face of an angel there was a circumstance that i have not yet mentioned which completed the plenitude other joy her noble father having conducted his infirm guest and his daughter to his own door stepped without imparting his design to them to the neighboring house of a very old medical friend who lives retired from business and is only consulted as an oracle upon great emergencies the answer of this oracle to the point on which he was consulted inspired the benevolent pinelli with the most lively hopes of our dear friends during well and the forcible manner in which the zealous giuliana imparted to us this intelligence added not a little to the general felicity of the moment  you will allow me my dear charles to close my long though hasty letter with this animating pressage heaven grant it may be true at all events you may depend on receiving fresh intelligence very soon in the mean time i submit it entirely to your superior judgment and tenderness to communicate as much or as little as you think proper of this information to our very tender and interesting cornelia accept and distribute to all around you the ardent good wishes of this house and particularly those my dear charles of  your very grateful and affectionate edmund  letter xxx from mr audley to his brother it was very kind and considerate in you my dear edmund to send me so speedy a letter from genoa without waiting for the arrival of your expected friends i had indeed according to your conjecture been alarmed in no moderate degree by an account of seymours misfortune which he had addressed to you the privilege of perusing the letters which have arrived in your absence has cost me dear they have filled me with inquietude the more painful because it was such as i felt myself under a necessity of confining to my own bosom i could not venture to impart this alarming accident either to lucy or harriot as neither would have had the power of keeping such a secret from the piercing eyes of our anxious cornelia whose affections have so quickened her senses that i could hardly trust myself with so agitating a secret in my bosom within the reach of their scrutiny  i am grown however less fearful since i have been comforted by the lively hopes of the honest pietro and still more by the last letter addressed to you from seymour there is a passage in this letter which inspires me with the most delightful of all expectations i mean a happy change in the religious sentiments of our friend which if his life is out of danger as i trust it is will ensure to him that felicity in marriage which we are all so eager to see him attain as to the present state of our dear cornelias affections i shall enable you to form a perfect idea of them by imparting to you a few particulars of our private conversation she is eager to seize all opportunities of chatting with me alone on the flattering pretense that she draws from my conversation the power of correcting the infirmities of her own tender mind but in truth though i believe she is not aware of this motive to indulge herself in conversing on her favorite topic and to draw from me all the intelligence she can as we were yesterday alone together and engaged on our perpetual theme i said to her now my gentle friend as there is a lovely frank simplicity in your nature infinitely superior to the artificial reserve of your sex tell me heartily which would give you most pain to hear that seymour was dead or married she started at my idea and after the pause of a moment replied this is a cruel question indeed but i will be as frank as you desire and tell you that my mind immediately proclaims one answer and my heart mutters another married no distract me not with such an idea yet what right what reason have i  oh my good audley why will you show me to myself in such a hateful point of view my friend my guardian my director clear my heart i conjure you if you can from all these wild excesses of a hopeless passion whose tyranny and injustice i perceive and detest here she pressed my hand in an agony of tears that made me reproach myself for the idle barbarity of my question though i hoped to make her ample compensation for all the pain it occasioned but before i had time to do so heavens exclaimed the fond sufferer what a hideous insight have you given me into my own troubled thoughts how have you made me abhor the turn of mind that i have lately fallen into and which i never condemned before because i never understood the secret cause of it till this moment here my curiosity was very strongly excited i requested an explanation do not hate me my good audley said this ingenious selfaccuser while i confess to you i have lately thought it would be a blessing to seymour to be taken early from the world i reasoned thus at present his life can be stained with no important evil and he has hitherto employed himself in generous munificent and charitable deeds in such a character surely heaven will either pardon his youth the unintended crime of incredulity or in closing his existence reveal to him in a merciful hour those important truths to which he has hitherto been so unhappily blind but if his days are prolonged under the tyranny of those proud and disppointed passions which have driven him abroad what calamities may ensue what a horrid change may be wrought in his noble nature thus under the idea of securing his everlasting welfare my fond and feverish imagination has been sometimes inclined to hurry him from the earth but you have shown me the hideous source of these ideas i now feel for the first time that they sprung from a corrupted heart laboring under a secret horror of beholding this object so cruelly dear to me the husband of another oh audley is it possible that love which boasts of being the most disinterested the most generous of all the passions can be the most selfish of all if it is may i henceforth be alive only to that parental affection which partakes or the purity though not the peace of heaven you flatter me on the resolution with which i have tried to discharge the great duty of a mother but i am willing to show you all the unworthiness which lurks in the spirit you have flattered that i may the better engage you to assist me in correcting it aid me i beseech you with those stronger powers of mind where have given such envied tranquillity to your life help me to eradicate from my bosom a weakness so tormenting so disgraceful and make me f my own comfort and your credit more deserving of your praise she uttered the last sentence with a tear and a smile that doubly endeared to me the tender frankness of her hear how i thought it best to tranquillize her agitated spirit you will easily guess to an enamoured woman a particle of hope is of more not value than a ton of reason and as i had soe good and honest hope to give i bestowed it or my gentle friend with particular delight what i assured her that i had solid grounds for believing that seymour had lately resolved never to form a connection with any other woman he soft and sad features became almost as radient ever i mentioned his accident very slightly and as a mere trifle it alarmed her however considerably but i gradually dissip that alarm and finally dismissed our love friend from this private conference very visibly cheared and enlivened having rendered this pleasing little service to a fervent though unwillingly votary of love let me perform another equally pleasing for a certain parent who though new to me in that character is not the less interesting for such novelty let me assure you my dear edmund that your sweet little fanny is grown not only dear to us on her own account but as much at home as if she had been educated here from her cradle you would be diverted as i am to see what rivals cornelia lucy and harriot are for the highest place in her affection i am convinced however this distinction belongs completely to cornelia and from a cause which does honor to the heart of the dear little damsel she has observed the air of melancholy and mental or rather cordial distress which is often visible in the sweet countenance of cornelia and this has awakened her early sympathy and made the tender fanny attach herself peculiarly to the widow she is however as sprightly and playful as you would wish her to be and to give you our idea of her character in a few words which i should tell you are the words of lucy she has all your engaging qualities without one of your foibles  i am obliged to bid you hastily farewell but i do so with the less regret as i hope to receive to morrow or next day the confirmation of our hopes and to tell you immediately with what joy that confirmation is received by  your affectionate brother p s my three graces as i sportively call them salute you with every kind wish and commission you not only to bring seymour home to us as soon as you can but the noble seignor and giuliana to whom you are desired to say for us every thing that is friendly    letter xxxi from seymour to charles audley most truly and most successfully my dear audley have you followed a sublime precept of the religion which you so happily profess you have indeed overcome evil by good in reading the letter which you so generously sent me by our dear unexpected edmund i know not which was the stronger my sense of your extreme kindness or of my own demerit how indulgent how parental has your conduct been toward me and how ungrateful the return that i have hitherto made to such favors but my hour of retribution is come not only toward you my dear illtreated friend but toward that bright injured angel whose exquisite perfections you so nobly endeavor to impress upon my heart i have perhaps toward her beyond atonement sinned or i should rather say that heaven will probably with great justice preclude me from an earthly blessing whose real value i have been so slow to understand and acknowledge  you will undoubtedly have a faithful account from edmund who is all kindness and attention to me of my real apparent situation but you cannot hear from him what i think it best to conceal at present from the infinitely tender and too anxious friends who surround me i mean my own strong persuasion not only that i shall never behold dear england again but that i shall drop this poor earlytattered vestment of mortality much sooner than my friendly attendants here will allow themselves to imagine nor should i my dear audley imparts this idea to you had i not observed with what peculiar justice and felicity you have long estimated life and death for my own part i am thankful to my creator that timidity has never been characteristic of my frame when my mind was in utter darkness concerning futurity i was a stranger to the dread of dissolution and since that blessed power to whom i was blind too long has illuminated my spirit with his promise of a superior existence since he has allowed me to use the words of a great living poet who is rich in religious eloquence a flight into his arms e yet mortality fine threads give way i feel doubly confirmed in the idea and in the sensation that death is the last thing which mortal ought to sear yet how many objects my dear audley now press upon my fan that might render earth for some years a paradise to me with what delight should i bend myself seated once again in that circle of perfect benevolence your hospitable mansion awakened as i now am to a full sense of all the  merit by which it is ennobled with what transport should i receive from your friendly has that inestimable treasure which you have wi such generous ardour excited me to deserve oh my dear friend the being must be de to every fine emotion of the heart who would not wish to live while earthly bliss of such purity and luster seems to solicit his enjoyment i wish indeed  but i have learned at last to submit the most presum tuous of my wishes is the will of him in whom we live and more and have our being  how just my dear audley was that motory remark of yours which i once refused is admit that pride was the great source of all m errors and all my infelicity you allowed  remember it was a generous pride and so deed it was in its appearance but not in its effects i entered young into splendid life heathy opulent uncontrouled conscious that my heart was free from every malevolent and every mean propensity i trusted entirely to the native impulse of an ardent and affectionate spirit i thought that honesty and honor to whom felt myself inviolably attached were unexceptionable and sufficient guides for my conduct as early insight into the despicable characters  some unworthy priests gave me a strong prejudice against religion i felt no attraction toward a faith whose ministers of every sect appeared to me as a band of intellectual gladiators who seemed to have done the very thing which a certain philosopher with a benevolent sarcasm recommended to the athenians and as a preliminary to their conflicts to have pulled down the altar of mercy we agreed i remember on this point my dear audley when you were so good as to converse with me so patiently and alas to so little good effect at that time on the sources of incredulity we agreed that the ferocity of christian divines to each other is a common and extensive source of laical irreligon how can a youth who has never studied h bible expect quiet and comfort from the gopel when he sees those who preach it very furiously mangling their brethren like the savage rebels of scotland who were routed by the gallant montrose and who used for their word of battle jesus and no quarter i am convinced by my own past feelings on the subject that no source of infidelity is more powerful than this it has pleased heaven to correct in a very paticular manner those early prejudices of my mind which i have still such singular reason to linent i have beheld the beneficial influence or religion one of its most striking examples i have seen it not only bind up the broken heart o giuliana but confer upon her an angelic serenate sweetness and strength of mind which under her cruel calamity nothing else could have given her it has enabled her not only to bdue the most depressive of passions in her own tn but to newmould the heart and spirit of an exasperated and worldlyminded father and finally my dear audley it has enabled her accomplish that conversion which has been it much the object of your friendly desires her far the bodily anguish the shame and the disgust which i have felt in reflecting on some recent occurrences may have contributed to this event i will not attempt to examine a fever argues better than a clarke is a sensible and spirited line of youngs that you quoted to me i remember in expressing a hope that you might one day see our dear mund also converted a fraternal hope which i must tell you my good audley is even now as the point of being fulfilled and which if it is as i believe my destiny to die soon i most sincerely pray that my death may complete f my own part at the earnest request of our angelic giuliana i have devoted the daily leisure of an invalid to hear and meditate on the gospel it has been very assiduously preached to me by this lovely and eloquent preacher whose owe life affords so strong an argument in its fvour it has entered into my heart and soul by listening deliberately to the new testament i am indeed completely persuaded that christ  the true ambassador of god i require no other cedentials than his own affecting history with the mavelous power of his precepts to militate against every evil by which human nature our be assailed and to counteract all the agents  darkness after a cool and candd though brief comparison of philosophy and revelation i fl most strongly impressed with the idea that no being could have delivered a system of instruction so perfectly adapted as the gospel is to all the weaknesses and wants of man except a personage inspired and commissioned by his creator if i examine the conduct of individuals or of communities i perceive that every abuse of christianity every deviation from its primary precepts is attended either by misery or peril if i search into my own bosom i find the fullest internal proof that christianity alone as you my dear audley once said with so much kindness and truth can supply me with a proper corrective for the constitutional impetuosity of my spirit and an antidote to the poison of my own presumptuous and delusive imaginations i am not afraid of tiring you on this subject because i know all the warmth and all the tenderness of your friendly zeal as i have formerly given you much pain by uttering the prouder sentiments of my misguided spirit i am the more solicitous to show you at present how truly i stand corrected though alas for our temporal happiness this correction is come too late ah my dear audley must i give you so hard a proof of the strength and sincerity of my new faith as to resign without a murmur that inestimable blessing which you in exhorting me to subdue my incredulous pride so generously proposed to me as an incentive and a reward must i expire without a benediction from that offended angel cornelia without expressing to her with my own lips the perfect homage of my corrected heart and without receiving from hers a single tender kiss of reconcilement peace and pardon  perhaps it is better that i cannot be indulged in so fond an inclination perhaps it is ordained so by that god of mercy whom i acknowledge and obey in compassion to that dear and deep sufferer shaken as her health has been by the barbarity of my frantic love she could not now support the anguish of such a personal adieu  no my divine cornelia i will not wish to soften even the pangs of death by an indulgence that might prove so injurious to thy lovely frame  let me rather strive to emulate thy perfection and make the fondest emotion of my heart submit with resignation to the will of that god to whom thou have adhered with a tenderness truth and fortitude so angelic oh thou most exquisite of women my proud spirit which once insulted thee so cruelly now does thee full justice thy triumph is complete  my heart at this moment idolizes thee more than ever and at the same time i revere thee in my soul thy sisterangel giuliana yields the palm to thee that generous admirer of thy excellence if i commend her as a striking example of religious virtue will hardly allow that she has any merit compared to my cornelia i have done nothing she says which i did not learn to do from the man i adored and perhaps his pure spirit has ministered to my support if i attached myself to god it was in the hope and the conviction that he would lead me to my love  how different how superior is the heavenly perfection of your cornelia who in a trial the most excruciating that could be devised for a bosom so tender tore herself from the idol of her heart and adhered to heaven  such is the affectionate applause that our lovely foreigner bestows on the unseen cornelia how would she speak of her were she as thoroughly acquainted with the enchanting graces of her person as with the purity of her conduct  to you my dear audley who know it so well it seems superfluous to speak of my cornelias perfection but it is the paramount subject of my thoughts and as i am writing to you most probably for the last time i restrain not my pen but pour out every idea as it arises in my mind  it is time however both for your sake and my own to close this long letter  farewell my indulgent my generous friend if it prove my lot as i am more and more persuaded it must never to clasp again your benevolent hand let me live in your remembrance think of me i need not say kindly for kindness is the characteristic both of your temper and your religion  let me entreat you though i feel indeed that such a request is unncessary yet to relieve my own heart let me entreat you to break by all your gentle and friendly address the shock of my unexpected death to cornelia i know pure angel as she is i know that i am very dear to her and even now while my life is rapidly vanishing away i feel a delicious pride in that knowledge which however short my existence may be i would not relinguish for the world i am aware that her affection for me must produce on this occasion no trifling anguish in her tender bosom but that anguish will be blended with more permanent delight the delight of reflecting on our mutual love not only without those cruel pangs of terror and remorse which have hitherto attended such reflection but with hopes as firm as the veracity of heaven in whose beatitude i am confident we shall finally be united i will employ my last hour on earth if i have strength to do so in bidding her farewell  if i have not you my dear audley will remember my intention and sooth her sorrow for me by every testimony of my love  you my friend will be a better guardian than i could have been to her two charming boys let not the brave little heart of the heroic william forget me utterly but recall me now and then i beseech you to his tender recollection what exquisite delight i might have had in training this nobleminded child into that engaging accomplished manly character which i trust for his own and his lovely parents sake he is destined to form but i have not indeed deserved such delight the justice and i should say perhaps the wisdom of providence assigns me a very different fate yet i feel for this dear interesting boy who will have all the quick sensibility of his mother with all the fire of his own sex i feel for him at this moment the most poignant parental solictude i am forcibly struck by an idea that it is possible for me to prove a very useful monitor to him long after i shall have ceased to exist if i had yet strength enough to execute a design i have conceived but alas my dear audley the shades of death are even now gathering round me  the pen drops from my hand a faintness like dissolution itself begins to steal upon my senses  it is but transient  it comes  it goes  it returns  o my dear friends and dearer than every friend my cornelia my heart is not yet chilled it still embraces you with its native impassioned ardour and struggles against this deathlike langor that it may bestow upon you all the fervent benediction of  your truly faithful and affectionate seymour  letter xxxii from edmund audley to his brother alas my dear charles what heartrending scenes have i had to sustain but they are passed we have lost that enchanting friend whose heart i verily believe was the warmest and most generous that god ever bestowed upon a mere mortal  our beloved seymour expired yesterday evening giuliana and myself had the grievous yet delightful office of catching his latest sigh he died with his head resting on her bosom and his hand clasped in mine  no human eye ever beheld a more affecting or more enviable death it was indeed the death of a true christian and such as might induce the most callous infidel to renounce his infidelity and exclaim in a devout triumph o grave where is thy victory o death where is thy sting he had in a most singular degree what he had particularly prayed for the full possession of his faculties to his last moment indeed they were rather brightened than impaired  i do not remember to have read of any person except the french chancellor seguier whose intellectual powers appeared with such luminous vigor in the closing hours of life all the engaging peculiarities of our dear seymour attended him to the last his generosity his courage his imagination were never more conspicuous than on the day of his decease  through the whole course of his malady he discovered a perfect exemption from that very common and pitiable selfishness which is so apt even in noble characters to spring up with disease and contaminate the closing scene of many honorable lives so far from feeling the timidity of an invalid and being anxious to spare himself he considerably increased his bodily sufferings and accelerated perhaps in some degree his last moment by his repeated exertions in writing from which we found it impossible to restrain him his long reply to your kind letter he intended to dispatch to you immediately but after he had sealed it he changed his mind and begged me to enclose it with a short billet which he hoped he said to write to cornelia in the first packet that i should send you upon his death besides these letters he has written others which affected him very much but he took particular pains that i might not know to whom they are addressed a reserve which surprises me the more because he has fully talked to me on the disposition of all his extensive property and appointed me his executor he insisted on writing his own will which is by no means a short one and it was indeed to the dear invalid a work of considerable labor and pain he has fully displayed in it all the tenderness and magnanimity of his corrected spirit i am persuaded that he has not omitted a single person who had any claim however inconsiderable to his remembrance at present however i will only mention to you a few of his bequests  after giving his landed and patrimonial estate to his namesake and legal heir with expressions of regard and esteem he disposes of his personal effects which are various and valuable to cornelia he gives only a picture of himself and the watch he wore but he assigns a considerable sum from which he requests her to take annually an hundred pounds on the birthday of her eldest son and bestow this sum or more if she thinks proper as a marriage portion on the most meritorious humble pair within the wide circle of her patronage to her eldest son he bequeaths a casket of jewels which he has sealed up himself and which is not to be opened till the period fixed for its delivery the day when young sedley shall be of age a day which the testator desires me and lucy if we are alive to assist in celebrating at sedleyhall i believe this legacy is of very singular value most of these rare gems belonged to the mother of our friend and as he valued them more for her sake than for their own costly charms he has ever kept them within his reach and in his hours of tender regret for her untimely loss i have seen him kiss her favorite ornament of intermingled emeralds and diamonds with as much fond devotion as a catholic would bestow on the relics of a saint to balance this bequest to the elder sedley he has given his excellent library to the younger boy to yu my dear charles he has given the choice of three pictures to honest danvers a thousand pounds to the monsons two  but i cannot bear to talk any longer on this subject and thus to repeat his whole testament with the apathy of a jew by items yet i must mention one memorial of his truly christian forgiveness he has bequeathed a ring with a ruby of considerable value to dr ayton and with an expression borrowed from his favorite stern he bequeaths it as a peace offering to a true and conscientious minister of god from a man who once thought and spoke of him with injurious asperity surely no man ever quitted the world with a greater degree either of benignity or of courage these indeed were his two primary characteristics and he displayed them to the last with the most affecting frankness but without a particle of ostentation  when the angelic giuliana expressed to him her comfort in beholding him so singularly free from the fear of death o my good angel he replied though i leave in this world what the human heart may be allowed to regret yet surely n the next i can have nothing to fear i have done i acknowledge some foolish and some wicked things but i trust they are fully expiated by my sincere contrition and perfect resignation to the will of the almighty under circumstances peculiarly trying to a spirit so affectionate as mine perhaps my dear giuliana i could not meet death so composedly as you now see me sinking into his arms if i were not impressed with an idea that my early departure from the earth like that of your beloved peverell may prove a greater blessing to some objects of my regard than my life perhaps might have proved in uttering these words he cast a look of inexpressible kindness upon me  for he alluded to a discourse which had passed between us a few days before and which he had closed with this tender and memorable expression i exult my dear edmund in the idea that my death will ratify your conversion  there could indeed be no stronger persuasive to christianity than the death of such a christian who could refuse to acknowledge the beneficial influence of religion in seeing how it had given both softness and energy to a spirit once so impatient of discipline and advice  in seeing that it taught him not only to relinquish life without murmuring and just at a period when it offered him the very object of his impassioned idolatry but to cheer his mind with a persuasion that his death might prove religiously beneficial to those whom he loved  about two hours before he expired he threw his arms round giuliana and me as he rested between us and exclaimed with a most pathetic fervency of spirit oh god let me not prove a source of injurious grief and anguish to these dear friends  no i beseech thee make me both living and dead make me only an instrument of good to all the objects of my affection  nothing has comforted him so much as the idea that his death may be ultimately more a blessing than a misfortune to cornelia in this idea which he first conceived in remarking the angelic state of mind so visible and striking in giuliana he has been encouraged by that good angel ever since she found that there was no chance of his recovery and that it almost offended him to suppose he could recover it is impossible to describe to you all her infinite attention and kindness to her dear patient  but i must mention the manner in which seymour spoke or it  as she quitted his room yesterday morning he said to me  how kind how admirable is giuliana never to distress me by tears her tenderness toward me is extreme it surpasses the tenderness of woman it has all the calm sublimity of angelic visitation her love to peverell has made her the blessed being that we admire oh edmund there is nothing more sublime or perhaps more desirable in lfe than affection thus tempered by piety and strengthened instead of being impaired by the unexpected removal of its idol from earth to heaven let me but persuade myself that i shall prove in dying as much a source of good to my cornelia as peverell has proved to giuliana and under that persuasion i can most thankfully embrace my fate it is possible that i may be so yet more than peverell oh edmund  here he seemed inclined to impart to me something that he thought of moment but he repressed himself and one of his frequent fits of extreme langor coming on he did not resume again the subject whatever it was that i thought him preparing to communicate  i grieve to add another piece of painful intelligence to this melancholy letter the good old seignor is confined by illness to his bed so that giuliana has had double occasion for all her strength both of mind and body her exertions have been almost supernatural i believe her father will recover but i cannot leave her while he continues so ill i have given orders to secure the dear remains of our departed friend in a leaden coffin and as soon as my worthy old host revives i shall set forth on my return with my mournful charge and perhaps take my passage in some vessel from hence at all events i will land at dover where i entreat you my dear charles to let me find letters waiting for me from you and do not fail to inform me how our poor cornelia supports this unexpected calamity alas she has not so strong a frame as giuliana but it is the blessed privilege of religion to support both the strong and the weak i am inclined to wish that lucy and my dear little girl could meet me at dover yet on second thoughts i cannot bear to expose them to many tedious days perhaps of disappointed expectation at an uncomfortable inn let me find however soothing letters from you all for i feel that the office of conducting our dear breathless friend to that shore where i hoped to see him receiving and imparting delight to so many that are dear to me will be a btter office indeed to the dejected spirit of  your grateful and affectionate edmund  letter xxxiii from seymour to cornelia enclosed in the preceding my ever ardently beloved though once insulted cornelia it pleases heaven to chastise my proud and blind barbarity toward you by taking me hastily from the earth just when i might render its prime ornament my own the pride the fierceness the arrogance the ingratitude the impiety of your misguided but affectionate seymour are now corrected for ever  of all my vehement sentiments toward you i retain only those of love and admiration my admiration and my love were never more intense than in this hour when i feel my life hastening to its end they will adhere to me to the latest moment of my mortal existence if my memory continues unimpaired and they will attend me i am persuaded into a blessed futurity i have written to you more than once within these two days and burnt my letters  my heart and soul tell me they have a million of kind and serious things to say to you yet when i attempt to throw any of these things on paper they offend me by being either too weak for my feelings or too strong for yours my fluttering spirit is divided between the eager desire of sending you a last farewell expressing all my increased improved enlightened affection for you and the anxious dread of giving more pain to that infinitely tender bosom which i have barbarously tortured already o thou most lovely most ingenuous of women with what delight should i expiate my past offenses toward thee by living only to cherish and applaud thy perfection but heaven requires a very different a severe expiation the hand of death is upon me it tears me from my cornelia  i must be either less or more than man could i refrain from telling you how i feel in every fiber of my heart the unutterable anguish of such a separation yet i acknowledge the graciousness of god who in dividing me from an object so intensely dear to me has called me to himself o cornelia this alone could have enabled me to quit thee thus i cannot say without pain but i can say without a murmur o heaven behold my resignation and if it is meritorious as i trust it is reward it by pouring the purest of thy blessings on that justly valued idol of my heart from whom i depart at thy command let me live in her affection not to afflict but to sooth to animate to fortify her mild gentle spirit let my fatal errors be made sources of instruction and security to her beloved children oh my cornelia thy precious boys are as dear to me as to thy own maternal heart i have endeavored  alas i have not strength enough to tell you what in time will tell itself i am dying  but i die with my eyes perfectly opened to the mercies of my god and to all the rare merit of my insulted and idolized cornelia the most lovely of his works as well as the most faithful of his votaries oh cornelia i am dying but in death i feel a pride it is a pardonable pride in your affection you have loved me you will continue to love me and that angelic attachment though saddened by grief yet now untroubled by terror of selfreproach will be dearer and more delicious to your heavenly spirit than all the gay vanities of the world o cornelia what a proud heart have i had since i can discover pride but i thank heaven it is a purified sort of pride blending itself even in these moments with my love and with my religion i bow to the will of god i feel that i am going to his presence my soul is not terrified but impressed with sentiments for which i have no language i feel only that i am going to appear before him who created and who will support my cornelia as he has supported her sister angel giuliana just seated by my side and uniting at my request her tender benediction to this adieu o ye two lovely and blessed spirits sisters in affliction in tenderness in purity reflect only on the obligations which i acknowledge to you both ye have been the ministers of grace who have opened to me the gates of that heaven for which i am departing while you continue pilgrims of the earth pray cultivate your friendship for each other and remember that i bid you farewell in the firmest confidence that we shall be eternally united in the beatitude which is promised to us by him whom you have taught me to revere farewell thou idol of my heart whom i can only behold in idea yet so strongly art thou present to my affection that i seem to clasp thy hand at this moment oh cornelia let me indulge this fond illusion and seem to pour into thy tender bosom the last affectionate sigh of thy expiring  seymour  letter xxxiv from giuliana to cornelia enclosed also in edmunds letter with the preceding very dear though never seen friend i must tell you in few sad words that my sense of what your poor gentle heart has now to suffer makes all my old wounds to bleed afresh we are veritably sisters in affliction as our dear dying seymour has said but the good god who supported unworthy me so graciously will not fail to support my pure gentle sister who has title so much better than i to protection from heaven o how the good god showed his goodness in making obedient and truly christian the high and longrebel spirit of our dear friend how did i wish to die as he died in his place that might have made us all happy but our almighty good governor knows what is best for us better than we know and my dear sick father still wants his poor child upon earth if it please god to make him well again we will come to dear england and i will tell my sweet gentle sister in affliction much more than my troubled mind can now write i will come and sooth her bleeding heart by telling her what thousand things her dear dying seymour said and all so divinely just and kind of his beloved cornelia i will come and talk and weep with you my dear sistermourner day after day but at present i can only repeat may the good god support and console you i know you will kindly receive this brief cordial prayer from  your truly sympathetic and affectionate sister giuliana  letter xxxv from mr audley to his brother prepared as i was my dear edmund for the grievous event which your last kind letter imparts to me it has afflicted me so deeply as to shake even my health what a bitter issue to all our friendly hopes and projects but we must not murmur and it would be particularly wrong to do so when the almighty and allwise disposer of events is so gracious as to mingle consolation with our distress however wrong and misguided the life of our enchanting friend may have been he has died the death of the righteous and we ought not perhaps to mourn so deeply for him on earth when there is joy over him in heaven but it is impossible not to feel extreme pain in the loss of a being whose qualities were so delightfully engaging for my own part i must confess his pathetic farewell to me has made such an impression upon me that my nerves are become almost as tremulous as those of our poor cornelia who is i will not say afflicted but affliction itself i never beheld sorrow more poignant or indulged with more avidity she says the anguish of heart that she endures on this occasion is a very just punishment for her having thought so inhumanly that his death would be no misfortune but i am forgetting my dear edmund that at the time you will open this letter which i dispatch to wait for you at the port appointed you will be able to procure speedy and i hope better intelligence of us all from those who are as eager to fly into your arms in the hour of your landing as you can be to embrace them i have a most fortunate opportunity of gratifying your wish in this article an obliging friend has just offered me the use of his vacant and commodious apartments in dovercastle upon my accidentally mentioning your wish lucy and her dear little charge are preparing to set forth from hence and are as happy as our present state of general mourning will allow them to be in the idea of waiting in the comfortable quarters that i have accepted for them to receive you in the hour of your arrival i will not detain you from their embraces by adding more to this letter except a request that as soon as you have discharged your last duties to our dear departed friend you will bring both our sister and the dear little fanny back again to this house where affliction my dear edmund longs to fate itself on all the many mournful things you have to tell us minutely where every person is wishing to see you arrive and none more heartily than  your affectionate brother  letter xxxvi from lucy audley to cornelia dover castle i will write only to my most afflicted friend and i should be a valuable comforter indeed if my powers of soothing her sorrow wee equal to the influence that she has upon my thoughts absorbed as you are in grief it will i know still please you to hear that i and my dear little companion are safely arrived and safely lodged in our castle our accommodations are so good our prospect of the town below us and of the calm quiet sea beyond it is so soothing to my mind in its present pensive and melancholy state that i almost repent of having opposed my dear cornelias idea of attending us yet it is surely better for you my dear suffering friend to remain in the more soothing solitude which you may command at audley grove with the additional advantage of comforters so tender and sympathetic as harriot and my brother for heavens sake let me speedily have the satisfaction of being assured by your own hand that you are a little revived  that your pure noble and truly angelic spirit begins to triumph over that deplorable depression which seemed to rob you of more than half your existence consider my incomparable friend what duties what delightful duties you have long to fulfill on earth where can we behold a mother who has a fairer prospect of parental gratification not only from the extreme loveliness of her children but from the honest praise which all who love her bestow on the superlative merit of her maternal conduct to quarrel with this merit as a source of our present bitter affliction must be not only extreme injustice to yourself but no less ingratitude to god who even in afflicting us as the kind audley observed to you has granted the first object of all our prayers  recollect my dear cornelia a noble affectionate angelic sentiment of your own that you once uttered to harriot you told her and i am sure it was with sincerity you told her that you would gladly renounce all expectations and every wish of seeing seymour again in this world if some kind angel would give you an assurance of meeting him in heaven we have now this blessed assurance  our spirits devoutly embrace it as heavenly consolation but alas our hearts have still of much of human weakness about them that they ache with selfish agony even while we are striving to contemplate only the beatitude of the beloved friend we have lost  out upon the vanity of consolatory discourse it is not worth a rush i am a consistent creature indeed to exhort you not to grieve so intensely when my own heart at this moment is bursting with grief and tears gush upon my paper time only cooperating with religion can do us essential good under a loss so grievous and unexpected write to me my dear friend i entreat you as soon as you have even the slightest perception of their lenient effect and believe me with the kindest wishes to you and all with you  ever your affectionate and sympathetic lucy  letter xxxvii from cornelia to lucy audley ou are very good my dearest lucy to w such kind attention to the poor half distract and half stupefied creature who has but too ch occasion as heaven knows for all the dness of her friends to raise and awaken her  juster sense of her duty but frank and ere soul as you are how can you flatter me  such unmerited and therefore such cruel se  o thou dear and compassionate connt of my most secret thoughts and sufferings had truly so much virtue as your partiality ies why does it not comfort and support ow why do i feel as if this terrible stroke of providence had plunged me in a state fa worse than annihilation as if it had left me only a withered and wasted spirit which seems to have no faculty but that of seeing and lamenting its own misery and unworthiness you talk to me of maternal delight but alas my good girl what delight can i take as a mother when in looking on my children my own miserable sensations suggest to me that it would have been better both for me and for them perhaps i such a wretch as i am had never been born  o god pardon me i beseech thee for these unrghteous murmurs of a wounded heart that break from it perforce i confess their iniqut i abhor their ingratitude i acknowledge i am thankful for thy mercy which in taking so suddenly from the earth the dear object of my hapless affection has called him into thy presence where i also if i can but sustain this better trial as i am bound to do  o gracious god look with pity on my distress and terror t not the subtle enemy of souls take such advantage of my extreme weakness as to darken and debase my spirit with such black and rebelliou thoughts as may render me blind to thy goodness and unworthy of thy protection  oh lucy i have been forced to lay down y pen and seek what i thank heaven i have not sought in vain some immediate relief from the indulgence of tears and continued fervency of prayer  my bosom is lighter than it wa and my spirits are more composed i am g i followed your advice which you gave me kind as it was with reluctance in remainin here for i am so deplorably weak in body a still more so in mind that i should have prov a sad burden to you and the dear little feeling frances who has shown for me a solicitude so uncommon and so peculiarly affecting at her tender age indeed i am hardly fit to converse with any human being except our incomparable audley who since i wrote the first part of this letter has talked to me for a considerable time and with an art that belongs to himself has been indulgently trying to turn even my weaknesses to my advantage pray consider said this invaluable friend pray consider my dear dejected cornelia if you find it so difficult to bear the severity of a wise and merciful god how could you have supported such agony of heart as in your situation there was a great chance of your having inflicted upon you by the common barbarity of man suppose our dear misguided seymour whom the indulgence of heaven has taken to itself suppose he had pursued the usual course of young men suppose he had brought a mistress or a wife to this country and in the cruel pride of mortified affection had insulted you with an ostentation of felicity such events are by no means rare in human life i have seen some women support such a test of their fortitude but not under circumstances so peculiarly painful you still imagine my generous cornelia as you said i remember on the day when i imparted to you our most afflicting loss that if you could but restore him to life with all the happy luster of his enlightened mind you would cheerfully submit to the anguish of seeing him united to another ah my gentle friend this idea is but the transient illusive heroism of sudden and immoderate grief which like all the vehement passions gives a brief energy to our sentiment that nature is unable to sustain trust me i know you better than you know yourself and i am convinced by many remarks which i have occasionally made on your very tender and acute feelings that if the supposed event had happened you would have lost either your life or your senses and our beloved friend instead of being as he now is a triumphant angel in heaven would have been tortured himself by these barbarous effects of his precipitate and vindictive love o my good audley i replied by showing me how weak i am on every side you will lead me i hope to the almighty source of all strength you will teach me how to acquire what i grievously want a more cordial obedience and a more fervent and faithful devotion to god how criminal must i be if i fail to acquire this when my beloved seymour has set me such a blessed example of resignation but i shall acquire it by degrees the divine spirit which breathes in every line of the precious letter addressed to me by the dear expiring convert now begins to sooth and to reanimate my heart as i know that most affectionate of human beings intended it should do you saw my dear lucy how dreadfully weak i was in receiving it how instead of consoling me it convulsed my whole frame but this dear this invaluable letter begins to operate as the softest balm to my wounded spirits i read it constantly at stated periods of every day and then lay it on my heart after the example of poor caroline this excellent creature has hardly suffered less than myself on the loss of her generous protector though our feelings are so different she almost made me smile just now by a little circumstance that marked her attachment to him and to relieve you a little my dear friend from the mournful gloom of what i have written i must attempt to relate it to you as i passed the parlour door where the monsons happened to be with a friend who had called here to see them i heard the voice of caroline very loud and with a tone of indignation very foreign to her nature i clearly distinguished the words  no good as she is i shall hate her if she ever loves another man as long as she exists as soon as i saw caroline alone i questioned her concerning the expression which i had accidentally overheard and with her native frankness she declared it related to me and had been drawn from her by a very foolish and illtimed jest of their visitor on the probable duration of my grief you will easily believe that my heart was pleased with her vindication of its truth i can indeed say with the honest caroline that i should hate myself were it possible for me to let seymour have any successor in my affection  no my dear lucy on that point i know myself and fear not the dear dying prophet himself has told me that i shall continue to love him and every movement of my heart and soul impress upon me the conviction that his prophecy is true  i have only to implore the great searcher of all hearts to temper and correct the affliction now arising from this love and so to blend it with my love for my children that these ardent affections no longer opposite but religiously united may form all together the ruling possion of my life this my dear friend is my hope my belief my prayer concerning all the future days that heaven may allot to me upon earth your excellent brother comforts me by an assurance that time will so far restore my shattered nerves as to give me the power of being every thing that i wish to be to my dear boys ah what feeling spirits they will have i am both afflicted and delighted by the sensibility with which my dear william continues to show us his remembrance of that beloved object whom even sportive infancy cannot forget god bless the sweet innocent he has asked me a thousand distressing questions since you left us which i can neither bear to answer nor to forbid i have referred the dear affectionate little enquirer to your brother edmund for whose arrival we are all panting whom i both long and dread to see i must have much conversation with him though i feel it will make me much worse than i am at present yet finally i hope better would to heaven we could see giuliana at the same time but this i must not expect farewell my dear friend did you think the weak creature you left could have written you so long a letter but my strength has seemed to increase with the idea that you would estimate my regard for you by my exertions to converse with you in this bitter season of my debility and distress  heaven bless you and your dear little companion  do not fail to pray for  your weak dejected and affectionate cornelia  letter xxxviii from lucy to mr audley at length my dear brother the long and mournful expected vessel freighted with death and with affliction is arrived the dear remains of our hapless enchanting friend are safe on his native shore and our beloved edmund who looks i think more than half dead himself though he assures me his health is much better than it was has desired me to inform you of his arrival he is himself engaged in settling the necessary arrangements for the funeral and i must tell you that we are both as much pleased as we can be at such a time by the very flattering marks of attention esteem and respect which edmund has found here on his landing from the relation of our lost friend every precaution has been taken to render my brothers mournful office as little troublesome as possible all things have been kept in readiness here to conduct the funeral procession from hence in any manner that edmund may direct and the liberal heir of our dear seymour is waiting at his seat to receive my brother who had announced to him his intention of attending the remains of the dear deceased to the vault of the family at seymour park edmund finds that without driving indecently fast he can reach the spot in two days and a half by crossing the country and as he thinks a scene of this solemn nature may make a useful impression on a young mind he has determined to take little frances and me with him in one of the mourningcoaches the fourth seat in this carriage is to be occupied by a person whose presence at this juncture affords me more pleasure than i thought myself capable of receiving and now my dear charles can you tell whom i mean no i think you cannot our beloved seymour seems to retain even in his coffin the enchanting power of surprising and delighting those who love him by new instances of tenderness and munificence this unexpected and welcome person is the old and venerable danvers who has a heart so overflowing with grief and gratitude that he is to me at this season one of the most interesting companions that i could possibly have met with especially as the occasion of his joining our party does so much honor to the heart of the dear friend we lament as soon as our beloved seymour found there was a probability of his death he wrote to his cousin whom he has ever treated as a friend and who as he really wanted no increase of fortune is i believe sincerely sorry to gain it by such a loss among a few private requests which our seymour made to his namesake in case of his early death was the following that whenever the old and infirm incumbent should drop the living which belonged to the proprietor of seymour park should be given to danvers it so happened that this aged minister died very lately at bath while the present mr seymour was residing there who immediately wrote to danvers to acquaint him with his cousins intention in his favor as danvers though old is full of activity and gratitude he went to return his personal thanks for a letter which filled him both with joy and anxiety as it mentioned the illness of his distant and considerate patron he was actually conversing with mr seymour in the moment when that gentleman received edmunds letter announcing the death of our dear generous friend judge my dear charles what the good warmhearted old mans sensations must have been at that time he says the death of one of his own children did not affect him more and in truth i believe him before he quitted bath he entreated permission that he might wait to receive the body at dover escort it to the grave and preach a funeral sermon on the occasion it seems the good old man has a little tincture of professional vanity and in this particular and now almost neglected office of a divine he has long taken a very pardonable pride but he is this moment come in not only to cut short the little sketch i was about to give you of his character but to tell me i must instantly prepare for our mournful procession  god bless you all i can only say to our dear cornelia and harriot that i consider this letter addressed to them as well as to you i entreat you all to suppose that i have said every thing kind to you for myself edmund and frances once more god bless you all i will certainly write again from seymour park f the affecting ceremony i am to go through does not overwhelm and suspend all the poor faculties of  your very faithful and affectionate lucy  letter xxxix from lucy to cornelia our distressing duties are done the dear remains of that enchanting friend who still holds his empire over the affections of us all have been deposited with the most aweful solemnity and universal sorrow by the side of his departed parents o my very dear cornelia though once i confess i wished to have you with me i am truly glad that we opposed your strong desire to be present at a scene which i am now convinced by my own experience you would have been utterly unable to support i you know have ten times your present bodily strength and my feelings for the dear deceased are certainly not so exquisitely painful as yours yet i protest to you the sadness of the spectacle was too much for me and it was with the utmost difficulty that i continued during the whole ceremony in the church  all the numerous dependants and rural neighbors of our universally idolized seymour were assembled the face of genuine sorrow was so multiplied that wherever i turned my eyes some visage struck me which reflected back upon me with new force the powerful anguish of my own heart there were many infirm persons in the congregation who owed their subsistence to the bounty of the dead never surely was any man so young distinguished by charity so extensive and considerate the good danvers did noble justice to his virtues and without varnishing his foibles this worthy preacher has in truth the rare talent in which as i told my brother charles in my last letter he has long indulged a very innocent pride in our journey hither he spent more than half of each night that we passed on the road in composing alterations and additions to his occasional sermon and i question my dear cornelia if your favorite massillon himself ever made an audience weep more by a funeral discourse most assuredly he never delivered one that came more immediately from the heart this excellent old man was indeed so thoroughly affected himself that at last his feelings became too strong for his powers and this very circumstance increased not a little the pathetic effects of his eloquence as he drew toward the end of his dicourse while all were weeping or sobbing around him he caught the infection so strongly that his voice began to fail  he paused  he wept  he attempted to proceed  his utterance was imef   he paused again and gave vent to hs ters  he tried again to conclude  he could not articulate more than half a sentence  he hd his face  but after the pause of a few minutes he closed his book with an air of religious triumph and said aloud o my friends and brethren you want not more words from my faultering voice  the virtues of the dead are speaking more forcibly in your hearts let me only request you to remember that the most grateful honor which any of us can pay to the spirit of a good man made perfect is to imitate to the utmost of our ability his benevolence and goodness may the gracious god who has called our departed example to his heavenly reward give us grace and power to persist in that purer and more perfect tribute to his memory so that all of us who are now mourning for our generous friend and benefactor by being fond and faithful copies of his christian merit upon earth may finally be his associates in the beatitude which this merit has secured to him in heaven  so ended our venerable preacher whose white locks and affecting simplicity endeared him to all his audience pressed as i am for time for the post is on the point of departure i could not help sending my dear cornelia the close of a discourse to which i know her pure and full heart will so devoutly add an amen as there is a chance that you may see us in a few hours after the arrival of this letter i will only add that from the amiable new master of this noble mansion we have received every soothing civility he is you know a widower and his only daughter is about the age of frances a circumstance that has proved of great use to me in managing our dear little feeling child edmund has still some business to adjust with our obliging host but he tells me it will all be finished early tomorrow we are equally impatient to fly as fast at possible to the dear mourners at audleygrove and indulge with them at leisure in all the quiet luxury of grief  accept our united love to all and believe me ever  your affectionate lucy  advertisement by the editor  it may be proper to inform the reader in this place that the subsequent letters were written above fifteen years after the preceding it is not however necessary to detain him by a relation of any events which happened in that interval as the important ones are mentioned in the two letters which immediately follow  letter xlviii from mrs moreton to cornelia my dear madam if the name of moreton is a stranger to you which i am vain enough to think it is not may i still flatter myself that you have a perfect and friendly remembrance of a person whom you once called the pretty madcap of ireland  mercy on us what long years have rolled away and what cruel events have happened since you bestowed that flattering affectionate appellation on the pelt and flippant louisa at audleygrove alas dear audleygrove ah my dear madam what a loss have we there  how bitter is it to me in my return to england after passing twelve terrible and trying years in the east to miss relations so dear the most benevolent and most engaging friends of my youh i had the consolation of hearing from my mother that my beloved aunt harriot died according to a wish that we have both heard her express very soon after her incomparable husband and that she consigned to you my dear madam the long and justly valued friend of her bosom the care of her dear little lucy that sweet child who used to divert us so much by the petty caprices of infantine sensibility how i long to see what a lovely girl she is become under a guardian or rather a second mother so tender and accomplished but is she at present under your roof and may i have the happiness of finding you both together if i can contrive to reach sedleyhall i am now they tell me not above forty miles from you at the seat of colonel moretons father we have been only five days on shore after paying our duty to the aged parents of my husband he has kindly promised that we shall proceed to visit my poor infirm mother in ireland we are to make london in our way and it will add not a little to my delight if you will allow me admission at sedleyhall at the end of our first days journey from hence  i long to present to you my noble colonel and two playful little eastern monkies that make a part of our train i must certainly blush as much as a sallow asiatic skin will allow me to blush in presenting to you my second husband if you ever read as doubtless you have the panegyric that i sent to audleygrove on my first  poor major masey was in truth a glorious character and i was preparing to return as you probably heard to lament him in europe when my generous colonel who thought it wrong that such a little shatterbrained woman should wander so far to find comforters took on himself the kind office of soothing my sorrow and tempted me to relinquish my immediate passage to england for which i had actually engaged  now my sage cornelia you must not think the worse of your irish madcap for this speedy iteration of nuptials to use a saucy phrase of my favorite congreve for to tell you a truth of which you serious ladies in the cool salubrious climate of england may not be perfectly aware a poor european female who is got into the burning ustle of the east has no time to indulge herself in the slow decencies of sentiment she must scramble as well as she can in a scene where interest rages through all ranks like an epidemical disease and where death is so rapid in his visits that his usual harbinger grief has hardly an opportunity of appearing in his suite you see after all my troubles and adventures i am returned as great a attle as i went  alas my pertness is the only article in which you will not find me most dismally altered as to beauty of which your partiality once gave me credit for more than i ever possessed i have not a particle remaining the horrid suns of india have burnt it all to ashes so pray my good friend be thoroughly prepared to see the once rosy light and capering louisa metamorphosed into a sallow heavy and waddling gossip in complexion somewhat like a withered leaf where green and yellow are contending for preeminence in person not very unlike a certain little fat and grotesque chinese animal that used to divert the children at audleygrove  i can now laugh at myself you find as i used in those days to laugh at every body else not sparing even our beloved and admirable cornelia you know my dear madam that i always piqued myself on not having a spark of envy in my composition and i am now going to prove to you my perfect exemption from that base foible which the men very impudently and iniquitously presume to be most prevalent in our sex it is surely proved that i have it not when after telling you how sadly i am altered myself i express the sincerest pleasure in the very different representation that i have received of you  i have just been told by some visitors here who have the honor of your acquaintance that your health is perfectly recovered from those severe shocks which it sustained from the most cruel afflictions at an early period of life that you are handsomer than ever and to use the words of a gentleman who spoke of you with a spirit for which i was almost ready to embrace him that you enjoy a tranquil happiness and dignity of character very rarely attained by mortals of either sex your sweet boys they say are grown two most promising and delightful young men  believe me my heart exults to find that providence has rewarded you for all you endured from your tender attachment to that dear fascinating and cruelly lost friend of ours whose name i will not allow myself to write as i could not write it without a tear and i wish to salute you in this epistle as cheerfully as i can  the account i hear of you has indeed made me happy but at the same time it has made me almost wild to hear and see more pray take compassion on my affectionate impatience and as we must not move from hence under three weeks at least have the goodness to write me a letter of comfortable length i have a million of questions to ask yet will not allow myself at present to ask one remember however i beseech you that while i was in india all the intelligence i gained of my european friends was miserably imperfect  many many letters were lost that i wrote and that i should have received i have some reason to believe that no letter of mine ever reached your hand though i really wrote to you at three different times and once sent you a little oriental present but of no great value which wnt alas with an unfortunate friend who promised me to deliver it into your own hand to the bottom of the sea but of all these matters when we meet at present i will only add that my dear colonel is almost as eager to be presented to you as i am to fly into the arms of my incomparable friend who is still i find the admiration of all her acquaintance and who formerly used to look with endearing indulgence on all the idle flippancy of  her affectionate louisa  letter xlix from cornelia to mrs moreton welcome most cordially let me again say welcome my dear louisa to that country from which you have been absent so long and where some of those friends are still remaining whom you used to enchant with the sweet pleasantry of your sportive youth i have often grieved at not hearing from you for all your three pacqets to me were lost and i have hardly felt a sensation so joyous during the long interval since we parted as i felt on the agreeable surprise of this charming letter which has told me you are returned yet my present joy is very singularly mingled as all my joys have been with regret in rejoicing most heartily on your happy return i cannot help lamenting that our dear harriot has not lived to see a day which was so frequently the object of our hopes and our prayers with the fond inconsistency of affection i have almost wished to call her back from heaven that she might share with me in the delight of receiving our long lost louisa whom her warm heart never ceased to love as a child of her own ah louisa i have indeed been singularly familiar with affliction since we bade each other farewell at our beloved audleygrove never did any mortal lose two more valuable friends than i lost in the late dear possessors of that lovely spot but i have learnt to be very grateful to heaven for having lent them to me so long and at a season when i had such bitter occasion for all the balm of their friendship instead of murmuring at the heavy loss i have sustained in their decease i had the melancholy satisfaction of attending them both in their last hours and must tell you that they both died as they had lived models of tenderness and fortitude i ought certainly to grieve the less from our dear harriots having left me to use her own lively expression her corrected and embellished self in her daughter who as the dear ingenuous parent truly said has all her good qualities without her particular foible if that indeed ought to be reckoned a foible which rendered her so very dear to us all i mean a little excess of spirit and eagerness in projects that she loved to form for the advantage of her friends her milder and blooming lucy is now i think  but positively i will not tell you as i was going to do what she is you shall see and judge for yourself i will only say she is as impatient to embrace you as i am and in truth my dear louisa except my two boys or rather young men as i believe it is high time for us to call them there is no traveller in the world whose arrival under my roof can delight me so much as yours i must however beg your indulgence in one point and desire you to let me receive you with your noble and happy colonel the dear eastern little creatures and all your train not at sedleyhall but in st jamess square the truth is i have promised my sons who are now returning from italy to be waiting for them in london the week after this you i am sure will readily pardon a mother for not breaking such an appointment as my sons are so unfashionable as to say they set a high value on their mothers society and as they are certainly to me the most interesting companions in the world i have lately taken into my own hands again our great london house and hope to play the cheerful housekeeper to them both till one of them shall desert me for a wife a kind of desertion that i shall be more solicitous to encourage than prevent come then my dear louisa to a house where you know there is plenty of room for us all and where believe me your presence will add not a little to the gaiety and happiness of the domestic circle to show you how very free i intend to be with you and that i do not stand in awe even of your military lord i shall begin to scold you on paper for your abominable flattery surely my dear you must have brought home with you all the eastern arts of adulation since you can address such fine flourishing personal compliments to a simple quiet motherly woman not far from forty who has been for some years so perfectly emancipated from all the personal vanities of her sex that she lives only in her children ah louisa my former and more selfish life was a sad troubled scene as you know but too well heaven grant that my new life in which self has truly as little to do as possible may be more tranquil and more fortunate it will be hard upon me indeed if after being almost a martyr myself to a calamitous passion i am destined to see my children suffer from any hapless affection i have endeavored to guard against this evil by every precaution in my power i have done every thing that i could do to render myself a pleasing companion and a bosom friend to my sons alas how weak and fruitless are such expedients against all the perils of passion ah my friend the dear youths are just arrived at that stormy season can i think of scenes that you and i so well remember and not tremble for them o louisa i have an additional circumstance to quicken my anxiety i did not mean to communicate to you in this letter what i now feel an irresistible impulse to impart to you you know what an eager benevolent projector our dear harriot was on the wide and dangerous sea of affection in bequeathing to me the care of her sweet lucy it was the fond hope of her friendly and maternal heart that the dear girls residing with me might ultimately make her the wife of my eldest son the connection would delight me as much as it could have delighted my dear departed friend but alas how chimerical and how perilous in general are such distant parental projects i said all that discretion could urge against her idea but you know the affectionate vehemence of our dear harriot and your quick spirit will conceive in a moment how full of hopes and fears of a thousand delicate and distressing perplexities my present situation must be your cheerful and benevolent spirit seems restored to me by heaven to give me new animation at this critical period my sons have been absent from me almost two years but i have great reason to be pleased with their conduct and their improvements in that time they are returning to make their first appearance in the world william will be of age in less than two months and a seat is prepared for him in parliament where i have set my heart on his proving what his independent father and a certain person who loved him also with paternal affection often prophesied that he would prove i mean a manly and ingenuous character equally distinguished by talents and integrity i think you will smile my dear and still sportive louisa when you see how far maternal love has made a politician and a patriot of me in the simple and good sense of those hacknied words but of this and a million of other matters when we meet come and call me old polonius in petticoats if you please provided you will but assist me in promoting the happiness of the dear young ophelia deuce take this ill omened allusion which has in it an air of propriety in one sense that wounds me for between ourselves i am already convinced that the dear girl loves the young prince more than the young prince appears to love her god forbid he should ever drive her to distraction if he does he destroys us both o louisa a charge so delicate presses upon my mind and heart with a formidable weight hasten therefore i conjure you and give with your benevolent vivacity new energy to the spirits of  your faithful and affectionate cornelia p s your cousin lucy joins me in a very earnest request that you will delay your expedition to ireland and return with us from london to celebrate my son williams birthday at sedleyhall we are sure your good mother however impatient to see you will indulge us with the privilege of detaining you on this occasion as it will give you an opportunity which you may not otherwise find of meeting some friends who love you very much particularly your old swain edmund and lucy the elder they are both still single and as amiable as ever though poor edmund has been lately teized with frequent fits of the gout pray remember if you do not write by the first post to direct to st jamess square and pray also remember that you are to proceed immediately to that quarter whenever you arrive in town the first thing that i shall do there will be to order the best apartments in the house to be instantly prepared for our dear eastern magnificient and yet laughterloving princess louisa    letter l from mrs moreton to cornelia ill meet thee at phillippii   aye and i will put to flight this ugly phantom that haunts the imagination of my dear cornelia famous as she is like brutus himself both for gentleness and fortitude but in plain english my very dear friend let me return you a thousand thanks for your most affectionate letter and above all for the dear communication of a secret so precious it delights it enchants me bless the memory of my charming aunt harriot she was indeed an affectionate projector but though she failed in one of her darling schemes her projects were generally successful this her posthumous project as i may call it has quite set me on fire with zeal to assist in its completion courage my excellent friend thou most delightful of guardians and mothers what should we fear cannot you and i adroit and experienced as we are in affairs of love cannot we easily manage the pliant hearts of an ingenuous youth of twentyone and a sweet simple blooming girl of eighteen i warrant you trust me my dear they shall be a pair of amorous obedient puppets in our hands we will so pull and direct the wire of their ductile passions that they shall represent for our pleasure the most interesting drama in the world we know indeed that in the common puppetshows of love and matrimony the devil plays a very busy and tyrannical part but in ours he shall not exhibit even a nails breadth of his cloven foot no my dear it shall be all virtue harmony and delight well i am returned at a happy juncture indeed to assist in preparing the machinery for such an entertainment but my good cornelia when we have taught this lovely young couple to be deeply and furiously enamoured of each other you must not come forth with a common matronly maxim that early wedlock is imprudent that misses should wait till they are twentyfive etc etc positively i will have nothing to do with any scheme of keeping two lovers in a flaming purgatory for i know not how many years for my part i think of marriage as macbeth talks of murder if it were well when it is done twere well it were done quickly note by the editor  louisa has here quoted shakespeare very inaccurately but her inaccuracy gives at least a clear meaning to a passage quaint and obscure      a good match in my not humble opinion can hardly be celebrated too soon the objection most universally urged against early marriage deserves i think no consideration at all the people who fear that their children may tread too closely on their heels do not deserve the blessing of a child and had better not marry till they can escape all probability of such an encumbrance you see my dear friend i have brought home again my old romantic spirit all the heats of india could not draw it out of me but you and i shall hardly differ on this article and if we do we shall have time enough to adjust our respective opinions in amicable debate at present i scribble in extreme haste to salute you with my thanks and ardent good wishes before you set forth for the great city a good journey to you and a most happy meeting with the dear travelers whom you must expect with the most affectionate impatience poor ireland must forgive me if i am more slow than i ought to be in paying my filial duty there my sin shall be thrown on your shoulders and heaven knows you have merit enough to counterbalance the sins of half your acquaintance yet to me you are a wicked tempter and i confess myself unable to resist the lure that you have thrown out to detain me in england  my colonel desires me to say a great many fine things for him but i answer not one for he will not sleep under your london roof though he says he will pay his personal devoirs to you very soon and very assiduously these men are proud creatures my dear and they must have their way my commander take him for all in all is one of the best i believe of these lordly beings i will venture to say you will not dislike him and be assured you will see enough of  your very grateful and affectionate louisa tell the dear lucy i am so eager to see her that i dream of nothing else    letter li from cornelia to edmund audley my very dear friend london distant as i am from you i can turn to you only for counsel in a most cruel surprise and consternation that almost robs me of my senses on my arrival here i find an anonymous letter left for me at this house of which i enclose you a copy for heavens sake tell me what i ought to think of it i am distracted with a thousand contradictory ideas is it only a barbarous trick to torment me yet whom can i have provoked to such inhumanity of malice is it an artifice to gain money alas i am ready enough to relieve the indigent without forcing them into fraud is it finally a calamitous truth that must render my latter days more wretched than my early life god in his mercy forbid surely if such peril existed the sensible honest and vigilant monson must have perceived it and would have given some notice of it before this time either to me or to you i am quite bewildered in the maze of my own thorny conjectures pray give me your instant advice yet before i can receive it i shall probably venture on a step for which i should have been glad of your sanction i feel suspense so torturing in a point where the lasting happiness of my child is deeply concerned that i would rather face the most formidable creature existing than not to try to put an end to such suspense i must see and converse with this terrible unknown the moment i gain any farther light you shall hear again from  your infinitely distressed but ever affectionate cornelia p s love to lucy and frances i should have had infinite delight in telling you and them that louisa is returned from india and will meet you all on williams birthday had not this cruel blow rendered me at present insensible to joy    letter lii anonymous to cornelia madam though i must confess that selfinterest or rather passion is the prime motive to this letter in which i must surprise and give you pain yet be assured i mean well to you and we may prove very useful friends to each other though for various reasons you must excuse my adding a name to this unexpected epistle  let me assure you however that i am a gentleman and subject i own to many of the distressing follies too often found in that character my present distress is of such a kind as you i am sure if you are the amiable and indulgent and generous parent that i have heard you represented will be most ready to pity it is distress of heart arising from a passion certainly not wise in its excess and i must own not the most honorable in its purpose yet under a passion so circumstanced i am bold enough to hope and to solicit your assistance even while i regard you as a paragon of virtue because in assisting me you may probably preserve your eldest son who is above all praise of mine from the imminent hazard of wretchedness and dishonor  be not too much alarmed my good lady and let me conjure you by all that is dear to us both to treasure up in your own breast the very important secret which i am going to confide to your honor and your discretion if you make any imprudent any ungenerous any unguarded use of it we are both ruined for unconnected and different beings as we are this momentous secret my dear madam involves the happiness or misery both of your life and mine perhaps if you will condescend to let the writer of an anonymous letter have a private conference with you and will give him your word of honor not to betray your knowledge either of him or his designs perhaps in this case i may converse with you on a topic so painfully interesting to us both for i have a thousand things to say that i cannot crowd into a letter but let this be as we may find expedient hereafter my present business must be to give you as clear an idea as i can upon paper of certain circumstances which threaten much anguish to your maternal heart and have already given tortures of a very different nature to mine  in explaining this mystery i had better i think say too much than too little perhaps madam as you have lived i understand a most virtuous happy and retired life perhaps you know not even the name of a most celebrated fair creature who though confessedly not a model of virtue is universally reckoned the most bewitching object that was ever followed by licentious idolatry the person i mean is the famous emily belmont she is the daughter of a deceased british general by a venetian actress and inherits not all the opulence but all the spirit and all the captivating qualities of both her parents after being the mistress of three peer and two commoners and after rejecting offers of marriage from an elderly duke and a young viscount emily went last year to rome with lord t  in italy for our mutual inquietude i fell in love with her and she fell in love with your eldest son as emily pques herself on a peculiar frankness or spirit she told me very honestly that she had given her whole heart to sedley to sedley she said in a tone that expressed the most passionate fondness to sedley more beautiful than all the boasted marble gods and heroes in this country and alas half as cold  so far her generosity told me to effect my cure but she did not tell me what i had the address or i should rather say the good luck to discover by a certain female friend of hers i mean that her love to sedley was utterly unlike all the attachments that she had hitherto formed she is seriously in love and for the first time in her lie it is the great ambition of her heart and soul to make herself the wife of your son she is now pursuing this point with such a mixture of cordial sincerity and refined artifice as those only can thoroughly conceive who have had opportunities of studying her very singular and fascinating character i have kept the keen eyes of jealousy upon all her movements and can fortunately apprized of all her private machinations she has animated the marble whose coldness made her sigh she has wound up the passions of her young adonis by granting him many indulgences that could excite and not one that could abate the fervency of desire she has produced in him what all her exquisite talents and attractions have been exerted to produce a sentimental delirium in short my dear madam affairs have been thus settled between them the fair penitent expressing a graceful horror for her former illicit life has deserted lord t  and is already in london your son who cannot i think be here under a fortnight has promised that he will not attempt to see her till he has settled all his concerns at the important period of his being of age which i understand is very near and in the following week they are to be privately married  now my dear madam i am confident that you are as eager as i am to counteract with your whole heart and spirit this alarming design but how to do so is the grand question for heavens sake do not trust to your maternal influence you are indeed as sincerely beloved by your son as a mother can be but what are the entreaties or the commands of a parent to a young man whose more imperious love has been so artfully excited trust me such commands are but chains of flax that are instantly burnt asunder in the flames of opposed desire i speak from fatal experience pardon me if i speak too strongly but what is to be done i have long cracked my brains to find the most effectual expedient and to save you at the same time from all painful explanations and all dissension with your son i think i have found this expedient if i can persuade you madam to condescend so far as to have a secret interview with a female in a rank of life so different from your own but on this point i persuade myself your pure and noble heart will not hesitate for the preservation of your child  emily notwithstanding her frailties is in truth a creature of sentiment and soul in her heart and understanding even you madam will find much to admire for i may justly say setting aside the fond prejudice of a lover that she has every female virtue except chastity i cannot give you a more forcible idea of her character than by telling you what is literally true that she quitted a certain earl who loved her passionately for no other reason but to restore the injured health of his sister a lady of tender spirits and of a scrupulous conscience who made herself seriously unhappy from her brothers illicit attachment i happened to learn all the particulars of emilys very singular and generous conduct on this occasion and they suggested to me the first idea of the plan that i am now recommending i know that this accomplished though frail beauty has a noble mind that abhors the idea of proving a source of inquietude to any amiable family i also know my dear madam that she has a very great and tender veneration for your character and i will tell you how she acquired it by being indulged in the privilege of reading your letters to your son which i have heard her commend as the most exquisite letters that ever flowed from a parental pen and in points of literature she is allowed to possess great discernment and delicacy of taste  now my dear madam situated as you are and possessing as i have heard the most insinuating sweetness of manners what influence may not you hope to gain over the feeling and generous emily if you will condescend to converse with her on the great object of our terror you must not however betray me however tempted you may be to do so this would effectually ruin our hopes but you may say that certain hints have been given you by the tutor of your son that maternal anxiety made you resolve to obtain an interview with a person whom you have heard very singularly commended both for generosity and truth emily is indeed a model of both and i question if any mortal exists in either sex that has a more magnanimous disdain of uttering a lie if you can but contrive to see her in private of this you may be sure that although she may not perhaps think it prudent or just to your son to acknowledge to you the whole truth yet she will not attempt to deceive you by any absolute falsehood as i understand madam that you are very opulent i could wish you to make a forcible impression on the heart of emily by a liberal unexpected offer of promoting her independence what sum might be sufficient for this purpose i cannot precisely say but i fancy it might be done upon terms very easy to you i know she has a private revenue not inconsiderable though not equal to her wishes because i have heard her say that if she possessed an independent income to a certain amount she would settle herself for life at a favorite spot on the continent  perhaps your maternal tenderness and generosity may incline you to give her the power of gratifying this desire as the noblest means of obtaining from her the great sacrifice of her very dangerous attachment to your son yet supposing you are willing to do so i have still some doubts whether it may be possible even for you to prevail on the highspirited emily to accept your bounty this i perfectly know she would not accept such a gratuity from any man breathing perhaps to a lady of your admirable character her very singular and honest pride may feel itself more indulged than mortified in being materially indebted in this article i am really unable to judge how she may act but you will have a still more effectual expedient for preventing the dreaded marriage by showing her with mild maternal eloquence the misery it must produce not so much from her rank in life for there i know your generosity will spare her but from the no less material inequality of age for emily is at least nine years older than the youth she loves but alas at thirty she is a thousand times more fascinating than all the younger damsels in the universe  at length my dear madam pray let our mutual hopes and fears excuse the familiarity of my address at length i have said to you all that i think it necessary to say in a letter for the prolixity of which i should apologize if that prolixity had not been occasioned by my earnest desire to gratify the natural curiosity of the amiable parent whom i have been obliged to alarm for the honor and happiness of her child pray consider what i have said with your best judgment but without consulting too many friends and have the goodness to let me know what steps you think it most prudent to take at this very alarming and critical time i enclose on separate slips of paper a direction to the house near portmansquare which emily has just taken and a fictitious name by which you may direct to me at the st jamess coffeehouse  i will earnestly implore the favor of at least a line from you within these two days for the time you know is pressing and you will have the goodness to remember that although my terrors on this occasion are very different from those of a mother they are not less tormenting heaven guide you my dear madam rest assured that i most sincerely wish to be as useful a friend to you in this perplexing affair as you can desire any mortal to be and especially  un inconnu  letter liii cornelia to the unknown sir if you are as i must suppose from your letter a gentleman who really wishes well to the unhappy mother whom you have both terrified and obliged i must entreat the favor of a personal conference with you in st jamesssquare at eleven tomorrow morning you will see only myself and a very old female friend of mine believe me you may depend on the secrecy of both indeed the subject of our conference is of a nature too painful to be lightly and indiscreetly communicated to any person from whom you could wish it to be concealed by  sir your faithful afflicted humble servant cornelia sedley  letter live from cornelia to edmund audley my very dear friend before i can receive your answer to my last distracted letter i think myself bound to give you the satisfaction of knowing that i am a little relieved from my extreme perturbation though not alas from my chief terror by the sudden and unexpected arrival on the dear aimating louisa this warmhearted friend has left her noble colonel with his aged father and being as impatient to see my boys as i am she has kindly flown with her usual vivacity to wait with me here to welcome their return she could not have arrived at a more seasonable moment the sight of her has afforded me inexpressible comfort i have opened my full heart to her which gave me the more ease as i had carefully concealed the horrid contents of the distressing anonymous letter from my dear little tender lucy it would have cost her many pangs of the heart not less bitter than those i endure and it shall be the constant study of my life to secure this sweet girl as much as possible from pain if i cannot establish her happiness in the manner i would wish  by louisas advice i have just dispatched a billet to my anonymous correspondent and having such a second in my lively friend i have ventured to invite this terrific unknown to a private conference in my own house i hope i have not done wrong but i shall be content to wander a little from the strait line of propriety and decorum if i can but preserve this dear impassioned boy oh seymour thy prophecy in this point is but too true this beloved youth has all the perilous sensibility that embittered the early days of his mother gracious god teach me how to save him from this horrible impending mischief without alienating from me his filial affection  farewell dear friends for i speak to all and all i know will feel kindly anxious for the restoration of my peace i long for your opinion of the distressing letter i think when i have seen and talked with the writer i must feel a little more at ease heaven knows i am far otherwise at present adieu you shall very soon hear again from  your troubled affectionate cornelia  letter lv from edmund audley to cornelia moderate i beseech you my very dear friend the fond excess of your maternal apprehensions though i must confess you have puzzled your privy counselor still i maintain that you ought not to harrass your tender spirit by giving way to the worst suggestions of your affectionate terror surely we have time enough before us to prevent any serious mischief from this impending danger whatever it  after repeated perusals of the alarming letter i am utterly unable to form a settled opinion whether this threatened danger is real or fictitious but i strongly incline to believe the latter there have been so many accomplished and ingenious personages ruined of late by dissipation and reduced to prey upon unwary opulence by the dexterity of their devices that fraud like many of the nobler arts has been cultivated and refined among us to a surprising degree from many anecdotes which i have lately heard of this kind i am led to suspect that your anonymous letter forms a part of a subtlyfabricated project to draw a considerable sum of money from the unguarded purse of a mother whose opulence is well known and whose tenderness and generosity cannot have escaped the notice of any keen necessitous adventurer who might wish to draw from them by fradulent ingenuity an immediate supply for his distress you may reckon me perhaps a too timid and suspicious recluse when i prophesy that your terrific unknown and his boasted emily will turn our two profligate worthless characters not utterly unlike our old acquaintance don raphael and camilla in gil blas it strikes me as a capital stroke of pecuniary contrivance in a necessitous courtezan to practice on the liberal fondness of a mother by pretending to sacrifice a perilous passion for her son i give emily however handsome or plain she may be great credit for this idea but i must give you also one caution my very dear and generous friend if you really feel disposed in this business as i know you can afford it to throw away a considerable sum rather than enter into a painful perhaps and rather indelicate explanation with your son i entreat you let the money be paid in paris and to the formidable lady in person this point your friendly banker will readily manage for you with great ease and i think if you generously incur any such expense you ought to be rewarded by the most perfect assurance that the fair object of your alarm is safely out of the kingdom i have lived so sequestered a life for some years that i know almost as little of this celebrated emily as you can do i am indeed acquainted with her name and i know a channel by which i can speedily obtain the fullest information in respect to her real character for this i will immediately apply and have it dispatched to you with the utmost secrecy and expedition you judge very generously and very justly of monson he mentioned once but very slightly this alarming fairone in a letter to me but his apprehension subsided and if any sort of connection exists between the parties which i do not believe it has completely eluded his vigilance this circumstance itself is highly improbable and the more i ponder on the whole affair the more i am persuaded the allaccomplished emily will be found only a delicate impostor whatever she may prove i foresee that you will be tempted both to see and converse with her what mother with such feelings as yours would not feel curious to see a fair creature who desperately loves or desperately pretends to love a son so idolized by herself well my dear friend you are certainly a privileged character and i see no mischief that can ensue from your indulging such a desire except perhaps the trifling mischief of your being tempted by the nobleness of your nature to throw away more money than the object may deserve but if the hapless fair creature strikes your fancy and interests your feelings you may surely indulge yourself in the charitable pleasure of putting a few loose hundred pounds in her pocket and send of the beautiful jade to the continent i am persuaded my young friend william will be too happy in his return to you to grieve very long for the absence of such a lady and i am still more persuaded that he is much too wise to have ever seriously thought of marrying a courtezan who is almost twice as old as himself  that i may reply to you as rapidly as possible i will only add our united love and our cordial prayers that you may be thoroughly repaid for your present cruel inquietude and for every past suffering by seeing the dear object of our general anxiety as happily married as we all wish him to be lucy the elder gives a deep sigh for her dear young namesake on this occasion but i repeat my excellent cornelia you and my sister are frightened too much i need not tell you with what eagerness we shall expect a farther account farewell and believe me ever  your faithful edmund  letter lvi from the unknown to cornelia my dear madam i am highly flattered and pleased and yet i own a little distressed by your obliging appointment forgive me if i request your word of honor before i make my appearance that if you happen to recollect my features for i must confess you have seen them formerly you will never communicate either my follies or my zeal to serve you which are strangely blended as vice and virtue too frequently appear to any of my relations  do but favor me with this assurance by the bearer who waits for your reply and you shall instantly behold  your devoted inconnu  letter lvii from cornelia to the unknown sir your billet has considerably increased my very eager solicitude to see you i do not hesitate to give you in the most unequivocal manner the promise you require whatever confidence you may think proper to place in me i will venture to say that you shall have nothing to apprehend from the treachery or indiscretion of  your obliged and faithful servant cornelia sedley  letter lviii from cornelia to edmund audley comfort comfort my very dear though too timid and too courageous friend in one and alas the great important point you confide too much in the discretion of the dear ensnared youth but in regard to other persons and circumstances your suspicions and your fears have outrun the truth  no my dear cautious counselor the terrific unknown is not a don raphael i can assure you he bears indeed a greater resemblance to poor gil blas himself though i must not allow you to suppose for a moment that emily is a second camilla she is believe me in my estimation a very different and interesting character though i shall not be surprised if when you arrive at the end of this letter you think me a simpleton and a dupe and incline to the very opinion concerning emily which i tell you i would not have you entertain  i have so much to tell you and am so flurried between joy for what has passed and apprehension of what may still happen that i hardly know how to begin relating you to the many things that i wish to you hear first for my unknown i am bound as you will see by the two enclosed billets which passed between us and which i send you as an apology for my reserve i am bound i say not to tell you who he is but have a little patience my very dear and affectionately curious friends by tomorrows post a certain person without any treachery will impart to you this teazing secret which though i hope the sage edmund will bear the inquietude it may give him like a man our dear and truly feminine lucy the elder will be dying to know let me just say for her relief that this alarming unknown is a person for whose welfare and reputation i am interested in no trifling degree  nay i absolutely love him and certainly not the less for finding him inflamed with a vehement passion for the same dangerous and enchanting object who has captivated my son  my new friend as you will naturally suppose is as eager as i can wish him to be in his zeal to assist me in the preservation of my child the great wish of my soul is to preserve them both if i can accomplish this i shall think myself blessed indeed i am more sanguine than usual in my hopes upon the subject because providence seems inclined to befriend me by having conducted some little incidents in such a manner as to surprise and support me with unexpected comfort and i may say delight all this riddle will be explained to you tomorrow at present i must only talk to you of the alarming the dangerous the attractive the fascinating and let me add with gratitude the admirable emily you have a good guess my dear edmund at the secret feelings of a fond mother i confess to you i felt a great longing to see this too interesting personage i have seen her and what will you think of me when i also confess that i am almost as much in love with her as my poor artless william or my more experienced  fie on my slippery pen it had nearly written the name of my nottobenamed unknown but i was speaking of this fascinating creature who puts all discretion to flight in both sexes never did i behold any female who would be so likely if i were a man myself to make me the absolute slave of her attractions instead of that insolent or alluring vivacity of feature which often marks her condition the face of emily has all the exquisite modest sweetness and simplicity that a painter would wish to represent in a newcreated eve the charms of her conversation are still more captivating than those of her countenance  you will not wonder that i thought them so when i tell you she perfectly convinced me that her passion for my son is no fictitious no artificial no selfinterested passion believe me and experience alas has made me too good a judge in this particular it is genuine ardent and miserable love the love of a woman unfortunate indeed in her condition but exquisite in understanding as in beauty fully sensible of her own infelicity and disgrace yet noble enough to be ready to sacrifice her fond ambition which she wants not perhaps the power of indulging to the real happiness and honor of the youth she loves  oh generous emily thou have my pity my affection now my dear edmund do not laugh at me do not ridicule that cullibility of heart which to use your own abominable phrase you have sometimes told me makes a part of my character do not think me an egregious fool when i tell you what i have done  assuredly i have not paid too high a price for the satisfaction that i at present enjoy you remember the advice gven me by the friendly unknown concerning a pecuniary offer to emily as many circumstances upon the truth of which i could rely had fully convinced me that this unfortunate fairone has a very generous heart i determined that my offer should be so considerable as to make a forcible impression on her feeling spirits  the large sum which you know i have saved for the pleasure of presenting it to my two boys when each shall become his own master supplied me most conveniently on this occasion i felt no scruple in making free with this money because i knew that if i even expended all which i designed to give charles that dear generous boy would one day tell me that i could not have employed his property more to his deliht than by making it conducive to the preservation of his brother animated by these ideas i went well prepared to be liberal to emily after a very long conversation which cost us both many tears and in the close of which she most gracefully acquiesced in the plan which i wished her to follow of retiring to the continent i presented to her a set of notes payable to herself in paris for ten thousand pound her reply to me was this o my dear madam how you delight and torture me in the same moment it is indeed a triumph for the wretched emily to have engaged the tender regard of such a pure and exalted being as you are but what would my felicity ave been if my destiny had saved me from perdition and made me such a daughter as you might have received without a blush abject as i now feel myself in your presence allow me my dear madam to imitate in some degree the nobleness of your mind of the sum which you so generously offer i will accept only as much as may be sufficient to relieve your parental inquietude by convincing you that the object of your fear is as far removed from this country as you justly wish her to be  let me but flatter myself that i carry with me your esteem and you shall find me a voluntary exile here a little generous contest arose between us which was at last amicably settled by my insisting on her taking five of the ten thousand and this she would only consent to do on my promising to receive it again whenever opulence which her superlative beauty may indeed command shall enable her conveniently to replace the sum that i forced upon her  shall i own to you the whole extent of my weakness shall i tell you that i not only wish to make this beautiful frailone independent but i wished also to make her virtuous and devout here alas i have no chance of being gratified this lovely infidel who is as far from being a hypocrite as she is from being a saint unveiled to me her inmost soul the fatal philosophy of france in which she has been trained has so alienated her mind from all ideas of true religion that i could not hope to influence her conduct by any arguments that i might draw from thence  happily however for the great object of my immediate anxiety i found her most tremblingly alive to all the motives of honor sentiment and affection i am convinced that her love for my son is genuine by the manner in which she consented to sacrifice her own gratification to his advantage though i was prepossessed in her favor by the impassioned report of the unknown i was yet greatly surprised to find a person who had plunged for some years in a life of such splendid infamy still possessed of feelings so visibly acute so delicate and refined as to her age my anonymous friend must surely be mistaken i cannot believe that she is more than four years older than william she has at least youth enough to make all the mother tremble in my heart when i think of my poor fond and fiery williams attachment alas what has this dear simple ardent youth to suffer even on the best possible regulation of this unfortunate affair i should not love him so intensely as i do had he been of a nature not framed to feel agony in the loss of an idol so attractive i shudder not only at the thoughts of the anguish which i know his poor guileless deluded heart must feel from disappointed passion but still more from a dread of losing his filial affection though my son has great tenderness in his nature yet he has also a great portion of that uncontrollable imperious spirit which belongs to most of your lordly creatures if in the delirium of his early love he believes his passion to be under the guidance of virtue he will not only disobey but he will even hate me should he discover that i have secretly labored to prevent its indulgence  o merciful god let me not become i beseech thee an object of abhorrence to my child  the very idea convulses my whole frame alas this emily is so singularly captivating and her own passion is so vehement that i even doubt her own power of keeping the promise which i am confident she made to me with cordial sincerity what have i not cause to apprehend from two beings so unhappily under the dominion of a blind and fatal passions when even i myself while was conversing with this fascinating emily felt a strange succession of vehement and even opposite emotions there were minutes during our long conference in which i was almost tempted to fold her to my bosom with pity and admiration and there was an instant in which my brain seemed to be on fire with momentary madness and horror from an expression that she dropped a sudden idea darted across my mind that it was just such a frail enticing sorceress that occasioned the untimely death death of my ever idolized seymour  all my admiration all my pity all my humanity were gone and i darted upon the poor suppliant creature a look of terror and detestation which seemed for a minute as she afterward said to annihilate her existence tears relieved her from the icy and wretched stupefaction which the sudden and to her not perfectly accountable ohange in my countenance produced upon her in seeing her weep i began to weep myself and so by degrees was softened into a compassionate human creature again but oh my good old friend whose experience has given them more reason than i have to dread the fierce tyranny of the passions in a young ardent frame so inexpressibly dear dear to me as my son oh thou dear and never to be forgotten victim of a similar delirium oh my beloved seymour if thy purified spirit has any knowledge of the perils that now surround thy still fond and faithful cornelia save if thou can the lovely youth whose promising infancy was so dear to thee save him entangled as he is save the son of thy cornelia from those fatal snares which hurried thee to thy early grave  alas my dear edmund though i began this long letter with some degree of calmness and even gaiety i have now thrown my poor agitated bosom into painful perturbation by indulging perhaps too much the apprehensions that haunt me i ought certainly to reflect with considerable satisfaction and great thankfulness to heaven on the unexpected comfort and hope that i have been enabled to derive from the surprising incident which you are to hear to morrow i ought also to comfort myself not a little with the very strong assurances which i received from the generous emily that she will quit ngland directly and go by the way of brighthelmsione and dieppe to paris to avoid the great chare of meeting my son at dover or calais in which case she ingenuously confessed to me that she could not confide in the resolution she had formed or the promise she had given  this frankness i must own for frankness you know is a favorite quality with me increased my good opinion of her sincerity whatever may happen you may depend on receiving immediate intelligence i have just heard that my dear boys will most probably arrive in a day or two i call them still boys and almost wish alas that they were still in their leading strings alas that unlucky word reminds me that when they were so i was far from being either tranquil or happy  am i ever to be so  heaven only knows  and let me trust in heaven  as soon as they arrive i shall hurry them down to sedleyhall pray my dear friend contrive to come to us there as soon as you can for believe me your presence will be an inexpressible comfort to the terrified and trembling parental spirit of  your affectionate cornelia  letter lix from louisa moreton to lucy audley the elder and so my dear agreeable old friend you are really a confirmed and contented spinster as they tell me  well providence who regulates our various destiny ordains i am persuaded what is best for us all  never was mortal in a better mood for saying fine grateful things of this said grand and invisible governess providence than i at this minute for behold here am i your old rattling madcap formerly called louisa mountmaurice a most striking and happy example of the care that providence often takes in directing those who are unable to direct themselves  and what does all this mean  patience my dear  i am the very person destined to tell you the secret that you are dying to know  what you louisa you who have been twelve years out of our world are you come like a conjurer to find out this terrific unknown  patience again my dear i must have the pleasure of telling my own delightful little secret in my own way  well but do not fret dear lucy i will not be so cruel as i used to be and tantalize you for half an hour before i impart what you are so eager to hear come let us be grave and all sober serious attention on both sides  well then you have already heard how this terrible unknown was appointed our dear derly cornelia was waiting in high order to ceive him in her dressing room but it happened that when he rapt at the door the flattern louisa was up in her chamber where i was detained for i know not how many minutes by your sweet engaging namesake   well my dear be as impatient as you please to hear of the unknown  i positively will not say a word of him till i have said that this dear niece of yours is one of the very loveliest girls that i ever beheld and then so enchantingly like her dear lost mother my incomparable aunt well i must not speak of the poor departed harriot a present nor let a single tear stain this letter that i wish to be all joy to proceed then in my joyous story as soon as i could shake off the sweet insinuating lucy whose tender curiosity made her a little restless  not being permitted to share with me the priilege of seeing this important stranger i hastened to appear at the private conference where our dear trembling cornelia had told me she should depend so much upon me as her second though not very subject to fear it was with some trepidation that i opened the door of her dressing room but judge my astonishment and my transport when this terrific unknown who had his back toward me as i entered turned suddenly round and with equal astonishment discovered himself to be  my eldest brother  aye verily the gay honest impudent archibald mount maurice himself  surely heaven suggested to me my scheme which appeared at first only one of my wild romantic vagaries i mean the scheme of leaving my dear colonel and his eldest boy with his good old father and of flying hither to pass a little time with cornelia for the sake of assisting her n a certain parental project that she has kindly imparted to me by my arrival here i have had the delight of being very useful to her i shall share with her i trust the blessed office of saving her son and i hope also of reclaiming my less endangered but improvident brother  he had no idea of my being in england though from an apprehension that cornelia might show his letters to some person acquainted with his hand he had taken the precaution of employing a secretary even in his two little billets he is i fancy too much engaged by other ladies to be very minutely inquisitive concerning the movements of his sister  i must however say for him that he could not well have heard of my arrival as we came in a portugueze vessel to lisbon and our return was not notified in the public papers like the arrival of passengers in our india ships poor archibald was both delighted and confounded by the unexpected sight of a person so likely to lecture him severely on the present occasion  but affection triumphed over fear the rogue loves me in his heart which is in truth as warm and as wellmeaning a heart as was ever overheated in the fiery furnace of love and now my dear lucy as affectionate projects are in fash on among us i will tell you an affectionate project of mine but be upon your guard you must not at present for your life you must not say a word of it to the discreet and cautious edmund i want to make this honest idle brother of mine walk as unhurt in the said firy furnace with me like a good angel by his side as you remember the three men with hard names did in no metaphorical furnace according to a book that i should not lightly quote under the roof of our dear devout cornelia but to speak in plain english i have conceived a most eager desire to make a match for archibald with a certain niece of yours named frances who is they tell me not only a sweet character as i should suppose a disciple of yours must be but marvellously like the lovely woman whom my brother had the misfortune to lose when she was just going to make him happy by a fondly expected son and heir who shared the untimely fate of his beautiful and lamented mother i am persuaded that between serious advice and sarcastic railery i shall effectually cure archibald of his licentuous desires and if i succeed he will you know be what is commonly called a very good match for almost any girl in the kingdom he has a good paternal estate but the idle rogue for want of a good young woman to take care of him has contracted some foolish debts and should not in discretion marry without a fortune of seven or eight thousand pounds pray tell me between ourselves if you think your sweet frances may have a sum like this on her marriage if my idea pleases you as i confess it does me i am persuaded we shall be able to manage so desirable an event for it is a maxim with me that a little confederacy of two or three sensible women may guide and fix the passion of an honest warmhearted man on any fair object they choose bold doctrine this yet believe me i have seen it frequently verified and hope to do so at present in more instances than one i am just called away from my paper but will contrive if i can to scribble a little more to you before i seal up this packet for the post  adieu for some hours  joy joy rejoice with us my good friends all here are our two young demigods just alighted among us all the distressing apprehensions of our dear and truly parental cornelia are drowned for the present in the fullness of her delight well indeed may she be proud of such sons and anxious for their felicity what a heavenly pair the twinbrothers of the beautiful helen could not be more gracefully engaging for my part i am glad i am a safe sallowfaced oldwoman mercy on the hapless damsel whatever her condition may be whose destiny condemns her to love one of these godlike creatures without meeting an adequate return but above all may heaven avert such a calamity from our little lovely modest and sensible lucy she must be the wife of the manly heroic william what a singular expression of sweetness and dignity this enchanting youth has in his countenance yet handsome and gentle as he appears he looks to me as if he could be very impetuous very strongminded in his love his features give me the idea of achilles while charles though like him is yet so different that from his serious and contemplative air i could almost take him for a platonic philosopher but i suppose our young sage will soon prove himself an impassioned mortal and as for our young achilles i almost tremble to think how desperately he may rage when he finds that his haughty brifeis is torn from him but courage my dear have we not the sweet soothing lucy to mollify and humanize the outrageously indignant hero courage i say again  i am determined to hope that every thing will end happily though our present situation heaven knows affords but too much room for inquietude and anxiety i meant to have requested the favor of a long letter from you while i remain in town but i now say do not write but come to us as soon as you can in the country for the dear discreet mother has resolved that we shall pass but one day more in this dangerous city the morning after tomorrow we are to set forth all together for sedleyhall and i have happily prevailed on my half reformed brother to join our party which affords infinite satisfaction to cornelia as she hopes by his assistance to gain a greater insight into williams amorous secrets than she could probably obtain by any other channel she has determined and there is i think as much wisdom as delicacy in her determination to abstain if possible from all conversation with her son on the perilous subject heaven bless this incomparable parent and make her as happy as she deserves to be this is an honest little prayer in which i am sure my dear lucy you will most cordially join  your very sincere and affectionate louisa moreton p s i have been delighted in hearing from cornelia that the person we used to talk of so incessantly the admirable giuliana had the address to turn her old father the italian merchant into an english gentleman and that after burying his old bones in this land of liberty and good sense she is happily settled in your neighborhood i am charmed with the prospect of soon seeing this interesting personage dont you remember my saying in my madcapdays that i could willingly walk an hundred miles for a sight of her  ah lucy my legs cannot move as they used to do in those days but my spirits thank heaven have their old or rather young nimble motion and affectionate alacrity as i hope very soon to convince you in person farewell    letter lx from cornelia to edmund audley sedleyhall my very kind and considerate old friend i thank and love you as i ought to do for sending me two such comfortable and animating guests as your sister and giuliana so soon after my return think me not ungrateful or unreasonable if i add that even with these dear friends and comforters around me i feel a painful anxiety and impatience for your arrival  indeed i want a person of your experience and authority to direct we in all my conduct on this very bitter emergency i have learnt from the apparently frank and friendly mount maurice in whom i am halfwilling and halfafraid to confide though his excellent sister assures me he is a very trusty confidant i have learnt that emily has written to my son her letter is a very tender and eternal adieu alas i see but too plainly the excess of poor williams passion in his change of countenance and behavior since this letter arrived his sufferings pierce me to the soul i try to sooth him in vain and i feel it very necessary to check myself in my endeavors to do so lest i should betray what his offended passion would hardly forgive i hope however that the charming little groupe of friends assembled here may gradually dissipate his touching melancholy especially if we can detain him here and as his birthday is now so nigh he cannot form any decent pretense for leaving us before that festival arrives for which we are already beginning to make cheerful preparations alas i make them with a very trembling heart should this dear and most unhappily enamoured youth make a precipitate and blind use of the privilege which the approaching important day will confer upon him all my hopes will be blasted and i must be miserable for ever  you kindly assure me that you and frances will certainly be with us on the evening before this interesting day must then such a long and tedious fortnight pass before i can have the comfort of talking so you on the great subject that presses so heavily on my heart pray get rid if possible of your unseasonable guests and be assured that every additional day which you can bestow upon me before the period you have named for your arrival will be a real benefit as well as an inexpressible obligation conferred on  your most anxious and affectionate cornelia  letter lxi from lucy audley to her brother edmund indeed my dear brother we want you here very much our poor cornelia has just been surprised and is almost distracted by a very unexpected letter from this tormenting abominable emily there is nothing violent or insulting in her letter on the contrary it is full of the most  espect but this bewitching creature has  paid all the money she accepted and seems to intimate though ambiguously that her motive for this restoration is a distant hope of aspiring to that honor which with a modest propriety she had once you know utterly renounced  this intimation ambiguous as it is has put cornelia on the rack we are all puzzled to account for the contents of this alarming letter and the more so as we are certain that the poor enamoured william has not written to his mistress since he received that epistle from her which threw him into a wild and wayward melancholy in that point his pride triumphed over his affection but this perilous affection is just blown afresh into a blaze of joy for he also has a letter from mly as we learn from mount maurice with the contents of which he is visibly transported though our capital spy has not yet been able to ascertain these contents but here is the good zealous sister of that spy here is louisa just come to tell me the whole mystery while her brother is imparting it to cornelia emily it seems did actually set out for france but she was recalled to receive a considerable legacy just fallen to her by the death of a peer with whom she once lived and whom she quitted as you will remember we heard from generous motives of tenderness to his sister were this all we should perhaps have but little to fear the worst is yet to come fortune in her caprice seems resolved to lavish all her favors on this frail and mischievous beauty she has just received from a certain amorous prince on the continent the most dazzling overtures  nothing less i assure you than the offer of a splendid establishment for life and a title of duchess this offer the bewitching emily has enclosed to her beloved william in the ardent hope that so striking a sacrifice of ambition may atone for all past deficiencies in point of chastity and induce even his mother to think her not unworthy of his hand the fond youth as you may suppose is almost frantic with joy and eagerness to embrace the fair who prefers him to a prince mount maurice told his sister that from the impetuosity of his young friend in their private conversation on this topic he did not believe any power in the world would be sufficient to prevent the marriage but the latter part of this information mount maurice has very prudently resolved not to communicate to cornelia till you arrive  no words can tell you how very eagerly your speedy presence is prayed for by all the poor frightened cabinetcouncil here and particularly by  your affectionate sister  letter lxii from cornelia to edmund audley oh my dear friend my last resource though your kind sister tells me she has written you a most pressing letter and acquainted you with all my distress i must send a few lines to you myself alas my dear counselor i begin to fear that this impending evil surely the most bitter that could have befallen me is now becoming inevitable my poor impassioned and impetuous william will be as deaf as the wind to any thing that i can dare to say to him i ventured just now being alone with him to touch though distantly and lightly on the terrific subject i ventured to express a hope that he would never marry without my concurrence  he replied that my dearest mother is more than i must promise even to you  why so  because madam the prejudices of virtue are sometimes as violent as those of love and when they are so believe me they are more cruel and unjust he said this with an air at once so tender and imperious that i could hardly help exclaiming with a bursting heart alas my child thou art a second seymour oh edmund if he is destined to prove like our lost and ever lamented friend the victim of precipitate passion though in a different manner what but extreme misery in the various periods of my life can be the portion of  your afflicted and almost hopeless cornelia for heavens sake hasten to us as fast as possible    letter lxiii from edmund audley to cornelia my very dear friend it grieves me to the soul that i cannot instantly appear upon a summons which my heart is so willing to obey but alas a most cruel unsettled and tormenting gout is flying about me in such a manner that it is utterly impossible for me to quit my own house all i can say at present is that before this letter reaches you my dear frances whatever i may suffer from the absence of such an invaluable attendant shall be on her road to your house and entrusted with that casket of jewels which i had vainly proposed to myself so much pleasure from the hope of delivering in person trust however i conjure you my excellent friend in heaven and the influence of your own pure angelic mind over your son in a conference which you wisely defer to the last moment when you find him on the point of leaving home you must be silent no longer but open your whole over burdened heart to him and exert all the tenderness and all the authority of a parent if it is possible for me to be with you before that distressing explanation should take place you shall certainly see  your very faithful and affectionate though very infirm and much tormented edmund p s pray tell my young friend that as i send my daughter as my proxy to celebrate his birthday if my present malady renders me unable to follow her and i fear it will i shall depend on receiving very soon a charitable visit from him tell him i think both his gallantry and his gratitude will induce him to escort my sister and frances home again when he considers how sensibly such a poor invalid as i am must feel their absence  i flatter myself my dear madam that i might have some influence over his mind if i were able to hold a long and private discourse with him and if i continue unable to move you will i hope use your best endeavors to procure for me the opportunity that my bodily infirmities will not allow me to procure for myself i might say much to him that so gentle a mother could hardly say think of this and i conjure you not to despair adieu    letter lxiv from lucy audley to her brother edmund my very dear brother i thought nothing could distress me more than your illness at this unfortunate time but i believe i love your child still better than yourself and i have been terrified almost out of my senses for our dear frances be not however alarmed she is safe i thank heaven under my care after a providental escape from a most alarming accident which has added to the miserable confusion that now reigns to my infinite sorrow in this troubled house but our dear girl i must repeat to you is safe and though she has a severe gash in the upper part of her left arm her health is not injured and her lovely person not materially disfigured the mischief happened not more than three or four miles from this place a coach full of holiday people with drunken men and wild horses either accidental or with wanton malice drove against your chaise and overset it most fortunately the glass on the side of our dear frances was down but the violence of the shock threw her forcibly forward cut her left arm with the front glass and stunned her for some little time by beating her head against the door her thick hair very happily saved her from material injury or we might have lost my dear edmund the chief support and delight of your life and mine by this horrible mischance let us think of this escape and be as thankful as we ought to be the dear frances behaves with her usual sense and spirit her wound has been dressed by the intelligent brensil who assures us all that we have not even the slightest ill consequence to apprehend the sweet girl however is much troubled in her mind by a loss for which she is certainly not to blame especially as that loss seems to have arisen from her extreme care of the precious deposit with which she was entrusted she had the little mahogany box containing the casket of jewels in her hand at the moment of the mischance and supposes that the shock which stunned her threw what she held from her hand into the road but the confusion was too great for any thing to be known very clearly martha and stephen confess that they thought only of their bleeding young mistress and i believe indeed they would both have given all the jewels in the world if they had been under their care to have staunched the blood of our idolized frances however the evil might happen the casket is lost the road has been searched in vain and i think it proper to send off an express to you with this painful intelligence as i apprehend you may wish to send an account of the loss to london and perhaps to advertise some description of the jewels which nobody can do but yourself i cannot say but i am bitterly grieved for the loss of this casket but what alas are the most costly jewels but vain remembrancers of splendid misery to persons so sick at heart as the dear unfortunate mistress of this noble mansion is at this moment her affectionate and gentle spirit is bent indeed to the earth though with a sweetness and generosity peculiar to herself she labors to hide her own various afflictions and exerts herself to the utmost to sooth and console the immediate vexation of poor frances  i have delayed lending this although the man and horse have been waiting for it some hours to take the chance of a second search on the road but this has been as vain as the former during this interval i had some private conversation with cornelia that has made me as wretched as herself she has been apprized of of all the danger from emily she has had a secret conference with her son it was very short and you will judge of her present anguish of mind from my only repeating to you the last words of that conference reflect my dear child and tell me what your feelings will be if you find that the woman you have married is treated with contempt by all the world  i can answer you my dear madam most clearly i shall feel proud that my own heart has more justice than all the world and believe me i shall return its contempt tenfold  i have done thou dear unhappy youth thou art under the influence of a fatal though a generous delirium from which i foresee it will not be in my power to save thee i have only to pray to god which i do with my whole aching heart that he will either take me from the earth or allow me to mitigate in some future years that excess of misery which i perceive thou art determined to draw upon thyself  alas my dear edmund what a wretched morning is this to make part of a day most eagerly expected and destined in our visions so cruelly delusive to a general festivity of heart  i have just left the dear longsuffering and now overwhelmed cornelia reclining on her bed with our angelic giuliana by her side she has one of these oppressive headachs that arise from such perturbation of heart and soul but this incomparable mother is resolved if possible to collect a little strength from repose and appear with tolerable serenity at this inauspicious feast from which she has had some thoughts of withdrawing but where at the entreaty of her she has consented to preside heavens what a festival all the house seems in trouble though many know not why and particularly our sweet innocent niece poor little lucy is certainly as cornelia says deeply enamoured of william and we have therefore made a point of keeping her as much in the dark as possible this circumstance affects our tender cornelia so much that whenever she speaks to this sweet girl she is ready to burst into tears yet contrives to conceal from her the real cause of her emotion  i must not detain the messenger any longer on account of the pressing business of the lost jewels i will only add that distressed as i am i will endeavor to draw some good out of evil and if possible cheer myself with the hope that this returning express will bring me a better and a more speedy account of your amendment in health than i should otherwise have had to hear that your disorder has left you or at least is settled into the safest appearances will i assure you be a very comfortable medicine to the dejected spirits of  your affectionate sister our dear frances salutes you with the fondst expressions of duty and affection    letter lxv from cornelia to edmund audley oh my very dear and excellent old friend why are you not well and with us to make the happiness of cornelia complete  yes the happiness of cornelia  you will leap for joy in spite of the gout itself at those welcome words and my letter i am confident will accelerate your recovery for what cordial in the world is so powerful as unexpected generous joy to such a warm and benevolent heart yes my dear anxious edmund the distracted mother is made happy  happy for the first time in her life happy to such a degree as language is unable to express but you will guess at the exquisite nature of my present sensations when i tell you that i have recovered the alienated spirit of my son he loves me he obeys me he will be every thing that i wish him to be and the delight of all delights is to be indebted as i am for this unutterable blessing to the provident tenderness to the godlike spirit of our beloved seymour  oh edmund i am so wild with transport that you will hardly understand perhaps what i write yet i should think myself an ungrateful wretch if i did not attempt to you with my own hand a full history of the blessed change in my fate i will begin where your sister lucy left off for she says she dispatched to you a sad picture of me reclining on my bed i had rested there about an hour quite alone and felt my spirits a little composed by quiet and silent prayer when i was agreeably surprised by your sister with my son william in one hand and the lost casket in the other followed by giuliana with her arm round the half reluctant lucy the younger who was afraid of intruding  the warmhearted and active mount maurice being deeply touched by the sweet francess lamentation for the loss of the casket had set himself at daybreak this morning to make a very laborious and patient search to recover it by examining a watery ditch by the side of the road into which frances imagines she must have cast it in her sudden terror of its being crushed to pieces when he returned in triumph with his treasure giuliana particularly requested that the casket might be opened immediately in my chamber and only in the presence of the few persons whom i have mentioned you my dear edmund who have known all my fondness for our lamented friend will easily conceive the emotions of my heart when your sister as your representative unlocked this inestimable casket and after taking out the rich jewels which the young lucy only was calm enough to admire delivered two papers to my son one of these appeared to be a letter directed to him which giuliana entreated him to read aloud he did so and here is a copy of what he read  from seymour to william sedley my very dear young friend i am confident from the endearing spirit of your childhood that at the period when i intend you shall receive this letter you will be one of the most promising and accomplished characters of your time i hope the ornament of your country and above all the delight of your incomparable mother at that period the hand which is now writing to you though i am now but a few years older than you will then be will be mouldered into dust my whole frame very sensibly feels the influence of approaching death but my hand is yet guided by a heart that still glows with a parental anxiety for your welfare and with a most ardent wish to prove a valuable friend to you even long after the close of my existence you will be my dear william what i have been a young man of a high spirit and keen affections with an affluent fortune and heaven will i trust preserve you from what i consider as the chief source of my misfortunes the early loss of an inestimable mother you will i hope long have in yours a friend of the sweetest manners a counselor of unquestionable integrity a guide to whom all the great rulers of the human mind reason and habit religion and love will conspire i am persuaded to render you obedient  but my dear william perverse incidents are very apt to arise in the life of a young man which may tempt him with the best heart in the world to question both the wisdom and the authority even of such a guide the blind tyranny of an impetuous passion may hurry him into a frantic and resolute opposition to this faithful and disinterested counselor whose precepts his own conscience will tell him it is hardly possible to disregard and be happy  oh my dear sedley should it be ever your lot to fall into circumstances of this kind before you take any decisive step listen i conjure you to me repeatedly peruse the papers i bequeath to you alas who can be more qualified by experience than i am to speak as a monitor to any young man under the impulse of a dangerous desire for whose passions have been more precipitate or more fatal than mine but i mean not my dear william to give you a tedious sermon on a hacknied subject the blindness and the perils of youthful passion i am the less disposed to talk to you my young friend of such perils because if i have read your future character with a just prophetic eye you will be as averse as i have been to be influenced by the mere selfish motives of fea or caution but you will possess a heart alive in the keenest degree to all the noble feelings of gratitude and i am therefore most eager to tell you what surely no one can tell you so as myself the rare the superlative claims of your angelic mother to the gratitude the tenderness the idolatry of her children  you will have heard undoubtedly that in the richest bloom of her youth and beauty when the tender affections of her feeling bosom had been awakened and quickened into the fondest attachment she had the resolution to tear herself from the idol of her heart and allow my vanity to say from an idol that few women could have relinquished she had the persevering virtue to triumph over a passion that she could hardly oppose and live and this she accomplished in spite of every remonstrance every entreaty every stratagem employed by the man she loved to make her renounce a resolution which tortured his heart as intensely as it did her own she was inflexible she was convinced that she could not gratify her own ardent affection without endangering the relious principles of her children she perferred their distant security to all the immediate allurements of fervent and reciprocal love what struggles what agonies she endured what admirable faculties and what exquisite virtue she exerted in this conflict you will perfectly understand by reading the papers that you will find with this ltter they contain a long and very circumstantial narrative of a trial perhaps the most severe that ever an impassioned woman sustained oh my dear william she loved me with an affection as fond as vehement as sincere as the female bosom can feel but the love of her children refined and strengthened by her just attachment to god was the predominant passion of her soul  what does a son owe to such a mother your own generous heart will answer undoubtedly a life of the fondest veneration and the most devoted obedience oh my dear william were it possible for a precipitate passion to hurry you toward a marriage which would render this incomparable parent unhappy you must be the most unfeeling and most ungrateful of beings to complete it you could not do so or if you cold in the delirium of desire as soon as that subsided you must grow an object of abhorrence to yourself and of pity if not of detestation to all the world  but let me banish these painful and distressing images  let me cheer my exhausted spirits by a prospect which time i flatter myself will most happily realize it is my hope and my persuasion that this letter will find you my dear william in domestic comfort joy and harmony with that angelic parent to whom you are so deeply indebted yes as my life is ebbing fast away i seem to be blessed with a clear prophetic vision of those sweet scenes of family concord and delight which i most fervently wish my dearest friends to enjoy and which heaven i am confident reserves as a reward for the most meritorious of women your excellent mother my dear william will naturally wish you to marry early in life allow me the privilege of decorating your bride with jewels that belonged to a woman of beauty and of virtue i had once vainly hoped to place them on the more lovely person of my adored cornelia those hopes are past let me now please myself with the idea that her hand may place them as a nuptial ornament on some fortunate fair as lovely it possible in your eyes my dear william as the perfect cornelia was in mine but remember it is the request of your dying friend that these jewels may never decorate any bride of yours however beautiful if she wants the noble ornament of my cornelias esteem and affection ah how vain is this charge what mother can be so tenderly disposed toward a daughter as our gentle cornelia will be toward any lovely girl that you can think worthy to be your wife her judgment and her tenderness can never be corrupted by any sordid motives of avarice or ambition and she is therefore peculiarly entitled to be your prime counselor in this most important article of human life o my dear william may you be happy in your choice you can hardly be otherwise if you have the sanction of that invaluable parent who is at once a perfect judge and a consummate model of female loveliness and perfection build your happiness on hers make her the architect and the partner of your felicity be to her i entreat you the attentive obedient and grateful son which she has so singularly deserved to find you and may your virtues and your happiness long and amply reward her for all she has suffered from the hapless but not ungenerous love still glowing in the heart which while the shadows of death are hovering over it thus anxiously folds you to itself in a paternal embrace and begs you to remember with tenderness  your most affectionate seymour   i will not attempt my dear edmund to describe to you our various emotions while this letter was read i will only say that my dear feeling william soon found his voice falter giuliana offered to relieve him he declined her assistance and continued to read but could not advance without frequent pauses at one passage which you will easily guess he terrified me by starting up abruptly to quit the room but he said in a tremulous tone as he went out i will return in a few minutes these minutes were dreadfully long a thousand terrors mixed with a gleam of the brightest hope darted across my mind in this affecting interval he had the letter in his hand and the paper annexed to it which proved to be a full narrative of all that passed in the house of my good old friend mr danvers  my son did not return to us as he afterward confessed till he had perused this paper and the effects of it on his heart and mind were as full and forcible as our infinitely dear and provident seymour could have wished them to be  that animated sweetness and benignity which you have often admired in the countenance of my dear william but which for some days had utterly disappeared was visible again when he reentered my chamber where the little party remained in almost breathless expectation of his return seating himself by my side he seized my hand and kissed it as he began to read the following words but let us banish these painful and distressing images etc  he concluded the letter in a very audible uninterrupted voice but not without dropping tears on the close of it then throwing himself into my arms with an air of unutterable tenderness he exclaimed dearest and most admirable of parents you have not suffered in vain i feel the hand of heaven itself in the wondrous coincidence of these dying admonitions and the perilous folly of your son oh generous seymour thou were indeed inspired by the spirit of heavenly benevolence oh that thou could have lived to have directed but i will yet obey thee as my father take my dear madam take to your own bosom these invaluable memorials of your unexampled merit and let them be the pledges of my unlimited obedience yes most perfect and most beloved of mothers it shall be the chief pride of my life to be fully sensible of your perfection and to comply with all your desires  oh my dear edmund i could make no answer to my child but by folding him to my heart my voice was utterly drowned and the tears of the two lucys were almost as abundant and overwhelming as mine our dear and more spirited giuliana did not weep but her keen eyes flashed with a kind of fiery exultation and with that liveliness of gesture which is peculiar to herself she caught william in her arms and kissed him saying now indeed you are the true son of our cornelia but come you have done but half your duty i must teach you the rest we all gazed upon her with astonishment and were utterly at a loss to conceive her meaning but she soon explained herself by new and significant gestures taking a very beautiful cross from the jewels that lay before us she slipped a little silk cord into the loop at the top of it and having rapidly fastened it on the neck of your niece she exclaimed here william is the only girl in the world to whom these jewels can properly belong lucy having been trained like yourself by your incomparable mother is the only person alive who can love you both as you both deserve to be loved i confess to you my dear edmund that i was has pleased and frightened by this rapturous and almost indiscreet sally in our dear warmhearted giuliana but she has since truly said to me that she is no bad judge of the human heart and she felt it was a moment when a bold stroke in a young maidens favor might be safely taken the dear modest lucy was indeed distressed by the speech and was covered with those eloquent blushes that say a great deal to an intelligent heart my son with very tender gallantry kissed both the cross and the damsel exclaiming if my sweet cousin can really love me as a husband let her join me in vowing implicit obedience to this best of parents oh replied the poor lucy with a most maidenly embarrassment that is a vow i have sufficiently made already but you will not cried william with a kind of halfjealous quickness that i own delighted me you will not my dear lucy refuse to renew such a vow at my request most assuredly not said the sweet girl with more courage and here i folded them both to my bosom and put an end to a conversation that i now thought it prudent to check by entreating william to call his brother that i might make him and all our guests below immediate partakers of my felicity  our festival though it began in the most gloomy manner has thus my dear edmund proved a day of cordial delight which wanted only your presence to render it complete in some measure however i seem to have had you present in your lovely daughter who is universally admired and particularly by one gentleman to whom i confess myself partial but louisa charges me not to speak on this subject as she says it belongs to her and she threatens to come and talk to you in person i have now been chatting to you a great part of the night no great sacrifice believe me for i am much too much elevated in spirits to go soon to sleep though my guests after the happy festivity of the evening are gone peaceably to their pillows i shall dispatch this to you by an express before the break of day not only from my eagerness to compensate for all the pain i have given you by admitting you as speedily as possible to your due share in my present happiness but to receive i hope a most favorable as well as speedy account of your returning health adieu a thousand kind wishes salute you from this house and particularly from the grateful heart of  your affectionate and happy cornelia colonel moreton who arrived here to dinner says he was a schoolfellow of yours and that he longs to renew his acquaintance with you    letter lxvi from lucy audley to her brother edmund my very dear brother the excellent account which you have been so good as to give me of yourself has set my heart quite at rest i was very uneasy about you in spite of the gaiety here but now i am all peace and exultation the delicious scene of domestic harmony and happiness before me has made me quite young again and as i have wisely resolved not to fall in love any more for myself i have actually fallen in love for your daughter seriously i am persuaded that you will find the frank and pleasant mount maurice a husband not unworthy of our dear frances they seem to be in a very fair way of being sufficiently pleased with each other now do not with your usual quickness of parental anxiety order a chaise and gouty as you are post away to sedleyhall no my dear edmund you may trust me you know for a duenna the only part that i am now fit to play in sober truth you must not come hither though you seem to hint at such a design  why so pray  well do not be alarmed  the real reason is because the whole party here have it in agitation to surprise you with a visit to ask your blessing to be sure etc etc  our enchanting young host here declares that he considers it as a point of duty honor and gratitude to accept your friendly invitation and that he is bound in person to restore your lovely daughter to the father who was so kind as to indulge us all with her sweet society at such a time it was indeed very good in you and we are all grateful heaven will reward you if i prophecy aright by providing here just such a soninlaw for you as i have often heard you wish to find trust me mount maurice is perfectly cured of his furious passion for emily and as he justly observed to me a little taste of true virtuous delight is sufficient to wean an honest heart from licentious allurements he does however great justice to many singular good qualities in poor emily and frankly confesses that he once foolishly offered an immense sum to purchase her favors without succeeding  william has written to her and sent her a very elegant present with which his mother supplied him being charmed as she told me with the spirit and delicacy of his letter i was delighted as she was by his amiable ingenuousness in giving her a sight of this letter he has just received poor emilys reply cornelia brought it to me this moment and as she knows your secrecy allows me to transcribe it  to william sedley your delicate and tender farewell my very dear sedley has only told me what my own reflections had told me more cruelly before for believe me these are counselors that feeling persuade me what i am   the dream of my fondest ambition which suggested my last letter to you dissolved of itself when i reflected more on the character of your incomparable mother pray tell her my love for you is so genuine that your letter though it cost me many tears gave me more satisfaction than sorrow ah sedley this is a severe but a perfect test of my sincerity our destinies call us different ways you are hastening i hope to domestic harmony and delight i to magnificence and disgust yet i cannot be completely wretched if i hear you are happy and i shall feel a spark of honest pride in my bosom if your angelic parent who is better known to me perhaps than you suppose her to be can add a little portion of her esteem to that tender pity with which i am confident she will often think on the illfated  emily belmont your elegant little present i accept with humble gratitude from the endearing circumstance which you tell me concerning it i dare not say more  adieu for ever     and now my dear suspicious edmund i know you will think cornelia and me little better than a couple of wateryeyed simpletons when i tell you we wept in concert over this little billet and gave the writer full credit for the sincerity of her affection  but we will talk no more of such personages thank heaven the period is now come for which we have so often and so ardently prayed i see the heart of our incomparable friend as full of delight as we have formerly seen it of affliction i need not tell you that i take a most lively share who does not in her transport after bitter apprehensions of finding myself a false prophet i exult at length in the veracity of my prediction and with a delightful confidence i go on to prophesy that i shall have the cordial satisfaction of seeing both our matchless cornelia and my dear edmund very thoroughly rewarded for every past suffering in the happy marriage and future permanent happiness of their children the prospect for both is as fair as we can wish it to be and i boldly foretell that the event in each case will be of the same charming complexion  pray as i have not the youth and beauty of a cassandra let me have the comfort of having my prophecies believed and believe me also on every occasion  your faithful and affectionate lucy our dear fanny speaks for herself in a separate letter    the editor has only to acquaint his benevolent reader who may wish to know whether the friendly lucy was a true prophetess or not that her prediction in the last letter was verified completely  cornelia is at this time among the happiest of human beings and a singular example how a fond and tender spirit that has struggled meritoriously through the tempests of early passion may enjoy a delicious serenity in the evening of life she is surrounded by a numerous and beautiful groupe of her descendants of whom she is still the idol and the director while she shares in all their innocent and lively pleasures she is particularly careful to animate and fortify the young mind with a seasonable and deep sense of religion she considers this both as the sole security and prime ornament of a rational being she esteems it the only source of permanent satisfaction  she has a peculiar delight in deriving every blessing she enjoys from the religious purity of her own maternal conduct and from the provident devout tenderness of the man she loved to whose memory her heart has been inviolably faithful  finis
