mrs smith lissetta mrs wrighten to the public the reader will perceive at first sight that the hint of this piece is borrowed from an italian opera entitled il filofofo di campagna there is also a circumstance from moliere which except about twenty lines taken from different publications and thrown occasionally into the songs are the only passages in it that have ever appeared either on the stage or in print  indeed conscious of my own inability i should have collected all the materials had it been practicable but attempting this without success and being unwilling to throw away a subject than which it is hardly possible to conceive any thing more operatical i determined to make a trial of what i could do to it myself and this in no respect with a view of setting myself up for an author but merely from a desire of assisting my reputation as a musician  and now i should very little deserve the pains they have taken for me if i did not in the warmest manner acknowledge my obligations to the performers to whose merit i am convinced i owe a considerable share of that applause the wedding ring has been favored with  i have little more to say concerning the piece the dialogue is given for nothing more than such as would immediately arise from the situations and if the songs are found to be irregular i would beg leave to remark that they were written so the comic ones especially on purpose it being very often necessary that the measure should halt in order to give a novelty to the expression of the music and having said thus much such as it is i take the liberty of submitting this trifle to the public to that public to whom i have such infinite obligations whose humanity and generosity i have so lately experienced and to whose amusement it will always be my greatest pride that i have the honor of endeavoring to contribute  c dibdin february        the wedding ring act i scene i a library with doors opening into other apartments  a table with

be concluded directly takes a pinch of snuff   lis removing the snuff box and putting the chocolate in the place of it i will try to make you feel if i cannot make you hear   pan i dont think she could possibly have done better going to take another pinch of snuff he dips his finger and thumb into the chocolate what the devils that   lis only a little innocent method i took to make you understand i was here sir   pan you impudent jade how dare you serve me such a trick   lis why sir i have been bawling this half hour to you but you was so wrapped up in your deeds and settlements and stuff that i might have stood here till tomorrow morning if i had not taken the way i did   pan so you have been overhearing what i read   lis indeed sir it is no secret we all know well enough that you want to marry my young lady to a spark with more money than understanding and i suppose you was contriving now to load her with riches in return for the happiness you intend to deprive her of   pan did ever any body hear such insolence   lis lord sir what insolence it is no more than what every body says and it is a great shame especially when there are so many reasons to prevent it   pan what is that do you know any thing that will prevent it   lis o yes to be sure you go the way to make me tell you any thing   pan go you fool what could you tell me   lis why i would not tell you any

folks it may teaze my mind is my own and i shall as i please though you threat me and beat me and like a slave treat me conceal it or let it alone to be sure it is no business of mine but put any one else in my stead let them serve a good humored young lady with gifts and promises ready who begs of her lover no word may be said and then let her father come threatening which rather would fright one than make one discover i say in this case let who will take my place and see to which side they would incline  scene ii pandolfo felicia lissetta pan i would fain persuade myself that all the chattering of this wench is no more than the common cant of creatures in her situation and yet felicias disingenuous behavior has half convinced me that there is a lover in the case when she comes i shall be better able to judge and in the mean time i will go and send an invitation to zerbino   felicia i saw what seemed a harmless child with wings and bow and aspect mild who sobd and sighed and pined and begged i would some boon bestow on a poor little boy stone blind not aware of the danger too soon i complied for exulting he cried and drew from his quiver a dart my power you shall know then levelled his bow and wounded me  right in the heart i understood sir you desired to see me but i find you are busy   pan only laboring for thee felicia i am contriving the securest method of adding the vast possessions of sig zerbino to the estate of our family   fell but why should you do that sir have not we fortune sufficient already   pan to be sure fifteen thousand crowns a year well paid is no contemptible thing but as i told you i am desiring this for you   fell i cannot see how i am concerned in it sir   pan why thus zerbinos father was my particular friend and i cannot bear to think that all his vast wealth should be lavished away in equipages courtezans and such sort of expenses so out of friendship to the young man and with a view to your interest at the same time i intend to make him my soninlaw   lis there madam you will believe me another time   pan he is this morning arrived from florence where he has been to take possession of a large estate and i have sent to invite him here   lis oh sir you might have saved yourself that trouble for he has sent to invite himself   pan then i will go and hasten him i dare swear you will be glad to see him   lis how little you know of the matter   pan what is that you say   lis i sir nothing i did not speak a word   fell heavens what shall i do sighing   pan what do you sigh for   fell i did not sigh sir   lis law maam now can you say so she did sigh sir and i have a great mind to tell you what it was for   fell hold your tongue lissetta for shame   lis why maam you know very well what i say is truth you do sigh for something and i should sigh too if i was in your place   pan why i must confess felicia to be ingenuous you dont seem to enter cordially into this proposal of mine   fell sir if in compliance with any request of yours i was sure to be miserable i dont remember to have given the least room for a suspicion that i should refuse it   lis lord maam how can you begging your pardon be so foolish i would not make myself miserable to oblige all the fathers in the world   pan will you hold your tongue it is you that have spoilt her   lis i spoil her i am sure i am always giving her good advice   fell i beg lissetta you will not treat my father in this familiar manner   pan come come i will cut the matter very short you will have a visit from zerbino within this half hour and you may guess what sort of behavior i expect from you to the man i intend for your husband  when we come to the age of threescore by our maxims in vain we set store a girl in her teens will find out the means to fret us and plague us and teaze out our hearts till our giant wit is forced to submit to her puny arts like bells that eternally jangle you may scold you may fight you may wrangle if they are set on it you will see they masters will be nay though you secure them as safe as your pelf they will lead you the life of the devil himself  scene iii felicia lissetta and afterward henrico fell was ever poor creature thus harressd and tormented   lis you are tormented enough that is certain and stand in great need of advice   fell it is too true and i have no friend in the world to give it me   lis no maam to be sure it is not much in my power to be your friend but if sig henrico was to hear you what would he say   fell why will you be always talking to me of him   lis because maam i love to please you   fell heigh ho   lis i say maam dont you think he would be able to give you advice   fell what advice would he give me while my father remains so inflexible or if he could how can i see him   lis should you like to see him and would you not be angry if i was to bring it about   fell dear girl dont trifle with me   lis why then jesting apart you may see him now if you choose it   fell how lissetta   lis by opening that door before your father came in here i took an opportunity unobserved of poping your lover into that closet   fell without my leave what must he think of me   lis bless me madam is this a time to stand upon ceremony you know your opportunities are few enough therefore dont lose this   fell well but lissetta   lis oh madam indeed i must call him out  sir  sir  sig henrico   hen is the coast clear   lis yes yes you may venture   fell indeed lissetta i shall not easily forgive this   hen let me entreat you felicia to forgive her if there is any indiscretion i am the cause of it and believe me i would not have taken this method of seeing you so well i know your delicacy if i had not been forced to it by the last necessity   fell it would be ridiculous henrico to deny that i am pleased with your attention to me but what can it avail my father is obstinately bent on this hateful marriage    hen shall i tamely stand by in the moment you are so kind to confess a partiality for me and see you sacrificed in so cruel a manner   fell what would you do   hen boldly demand you of your father my fortune is not despicable my family unexceptionable and why should not i stand a chance of supplanting this zerbino   fell it is impossible my father would never consent to it   hen have i your leave to try   fell upon condition you will leave me now i give it you for i am frightened out of my senses lest my father should return   lis come sir i think my lady has consented to a good deal if we dont take care to be prudent every thing will be spoiled you had better therefore let me conduct you out but above all things remember the instructions i gave you this morning   hen must i then leave you felicia   fell you see it is absolutely necessary   hen in the afternoon i will see your father till when i shall be all anxiety and inquietude  the travlers that through deserts ride by conduct of some friendly star when clouds obscure their trusty guide out of their course must wander far so i with pensive care and pain in absence still must stray till you my star shine out again and light me on my way  scene iv felicia i am terrified to death at my situation i have not the courage to refuse my father and yet find it impossible to comply with his cruel request why indeed should i comply with it is there the least prospect of happiness for me if i do and does not reason every thing forbid my being compelled to give my hand to a man i cannot love but then is not this the request of a tender and indulgent father who has always made my happiness his constant study and even now wishes this union from no one motive but to see me placed in a still superior situation alas how weak and vain as if felicity was the ceriain consequence of splendor and that all the pleasures and enjoyments of life followed in the train of the great for my part i must have a new mind before i can entertain such sentiments and could wish to be left to the peaceable enjoyment of content though i should be obliged to seek for it in a cottage  happy the nymph who never can know distractions which from riches grow removed at distance from the great who willing lives in low estate one fountain is her mirror and her drink and if she is pleased what others think it matters not  of joy secure blessed in the little heaven has sent her only pride is that she is poor poor but content  scene v zerbino and lissetta lis speaking as she comes on oh it is impossible for any thing to be better contrived  let me see how i go on  henrico is guarded against all that can happen i have told him that when he comes in the afternoon he must expect to be snubd by us all nothing now remains but to get rid of this zerbino and instruct my mistress in her part she is gone into her dressing room i see  how lucky  by that means when this creature comes he will be left to my management and if i dont give a good account of him i will be content to be thought the arrantest novice in loveaffairs that ever lived   ser sig zerbino is come to wait on my young lady   lis oh very well my lady desires you will show him in here i will send him packing i will warrant him   zer bless me what makes me tremble so   lis he is frightened out of his wits   zer what ails me   lis when does he intend to speak i wonder   zer i dont know what to say to her i wish she would speak first   lis i see if i dont break the ice we shall wait till the old gentleman returns and then all would be spoilt  your servant signor zerbino   zer maam your most humble servant  pray maam are you signora filicia   lis i hope sir there is nothing in my appearance should make you suspect i am not the mistress of the house   zer oh no not the least in the world  she has a fine spirit i can see that already   lis pray sir where did you leave my father   zer he is only just stepped to the notary about the writings he will be here presently   lis will he  then i must make good use of my time what writings pray sir   zer why dont you know what i am come about   lis yes yes it has been sufficiently dined in my ears i have been teased and worried to death with it   zer by your father i suppose   lis b i have behaved with a becoming spirit does he imagine that i will suffer an obstinate old fellow like him to control my inclinations as he thinks proper no no most young ladies of fashion like me take delight in tormenting their fathers and i love to behave like other people   zer yes ye told me you was always tormenting him   lis he did and do you think zerbino he goes the way to prevail on me if it was not that there is something genteel and winning in your carriage and behavior i declare out of contradiction to him i should order a servant to turn you out of the house   zer i am sure maam i am very much obliged to you   lis sir you are obliged to nothing but your own merit that to be sure has won upon me but however if it was possible for you to be twenty times more lovely and agreeable than you are    zer lord you jeer me   lis upon my word i am serious i say sir if such a thing was possible and i really believe it is not it would not avail any thing with me for i beg you to take notice that i dont give you my consent out of love but pure obstinacy   zer oh then you do consent   lis what have i in my flurry been guilty of oh zerbino you will despise me for yielding so easily you should not have been so solicitous   zer how solicitous why i hardly said any thing at all   lis no did not you implore me to soften the rigor of your sufferings and with eyes all full of tenderness beg me to have pity on you   zer if i did i dont remember it   lis ah this is always the case the moment a man knows his power he abuses it however sir i think since i have been so condescending you ought at least to say something handsome to me now on the subject   zer why for that matter i have a vast deal to say to you but i dont know how it is i have such a prodigious pleasure in your company that whenever i go to speak i cannot get out a word for the life of me   lis there never was so pretty a thing said in this world entirely owing i suppose to your respect for me   zer oh yes all owing to my respect for you   lis well it is impossible for any thing to be more gallant   zer i like her a great deal better than i thought i should   lis but as you are such a passionate and tender lover i dare say you have not neglected a most material thing in gallantry   zer lord what is that   lis to write some verses on me   zer why i could not myself but i gave a famous poet a hundred piastres to do it for me because i would have em done in the best manner i have got em set to music too and i would sing em in a great style if you would not be affronted   lis oh i am enchanted pray let me hear em now for something fine and ridiculous   zerbino the grand turk with his wives and his mufties and mutes in his shining alcoves in his grottos and shades may carouse to the cymbals or dance to the flutes or sleep to the music of falling cascades or mew up his concubines in his seraglio or decked with a pompous regalia while to every subject his word is a law may direct the divan and keep all to a man from vizier to slave of the bowstring in awe but i even highr than this would aspire and of harsh sounding cymbals and delicate flutes which please the grand turk and his mufties and mutes and grottos and bowers and cascades and alcoves with baths and perfumes amber cassia and cloves and much more having you i have my choice all that is pleasing to me in your person i see all that is musical hear in your voice and compared to your love or your good opinion what is power or title or wealth or dominion  lis sir you give me very great proofs of your affection indeed and if it was not for a certain delicacy and decorum which you must have remarked in me and which i always so strictly preserve i dont know but i should consent to be married tomorrow morning   zer oh let us be married tomorrow morning by all means see here i have brought the wedding ring on purpose pray let me put it on your finger   lis really sir you have such insinuating ways there is no refusing you any thing but sig zerbino the grand point is how are we to live after we are married   zer oh we shall not disagree about that i warrant you i shall be be the most loving creature in the world   lis then i am afraid we shall disagree i shall expect a great deal of indulgence   zer lord you shall do whatever you please   lis yes yes i must make a point of that for my fathers severity has hitherto kept me in the saddest subjection in the world he gives me so little liberty that it makes me half mad and i have a hundred times wished that he would marry me to any body that i might be out of this constraint thank heaven you come very happily for that end and i shall henceforward prepare to take diversions and make up for the time i have lost i dont intend to be unreasonable i believe what with public amusements gaming visits company treats walks balls and a ciscesbeo i shall be pretty well satisfied  i will have my humor i will please all my senses i will neither be stinted in love nor expenses i will dress with profusion i will game without measure you shall have the business and i will have the pleasure by every incentive i will rouse inclination more changing capricious and vain than the fashion in short i will take care by the bent of my carriage to show you the sweets and the comforts of marriage  scene vi zerbino pandalfo afterward lissetta and felicia pan well zerbino have you seen her   zer yes i have seen her   pan and what sort of a reception has she given you   zer oh i never was so happy in my life if she could eat gold she should have it you told me she would put on her melancholy airs and i should be frowned at and truly it made me a little afraid at first but i never saw any thing so coming and so goodnatured in all my life   pan why did not she refuse you   zer refuse me why bless your heart she is quite in love with me   pan it is impossible   zer impossible what do you think it impossible for any body to be in love with me   pan oh no i dont mean that   zer ecod if you did i believe you would find yourself very much mistaken   pan well well but explain this matter   zer why i cannot explain it any more than i have you desired me to come and make love to your daughter by that time i had been here five minutes she was as fond of me as any thing can be before we parted i gave her the wedding ring and we are to be married tomorrow morning  oh how my heart is leaping and skipping and bounding as if from its seat twould come out my head is grown giddy my heels are a tripping and all my five senses are put to the rout  pan i hope she is sincere i will call her again felicia felicia goes off  lis good sir it is in vain coming on you will not make her hear  zer the old man i see is as anxious as me  lis who called me  zerbino wast thee  zer no maam twas your father  lis i rather had hopes it was you  pan felicia  zer he is calling you now  lis then adieu  zer and why so  lis but a whim i am ashamed to confess my affection to him but you on my truth may for ever rely  zer was ever a lover so happy as i enough love enough  lis here he comes i will steal off goes off  pan where where can she be comes on  zer he he he he he she was here sir this minute  pan the deuce must be in it  zer it is true and she told me twas joy to behold me in short she grows kinder and kinder  pan i must and will find her felicia goes off  lis zerbino you would better be gone comes on you will speak to the priest let me see you anon mean time to my father dont mention a word where i am  zer i am not quite so absurd it is enough you command me  lis adieu then  zer adieu think kindly of me i will think kindly of you lissitta goes off zer i have seen her again sir  pan i have searched the house round and cannot see her  zer it is true nor you will not bnt i have no time to waste i am going on business requires some haste  pan but you will come back again  zer back again  to be sure  pan mean time i will attend you dear son to the door go off  fell hold up my poor heart felicia and lissetta comes on what a difficult part lissetta you have given me to play  lis here here take the ring and seem every thing your father can wish that is the way  i will insure you success and hymen shall bless   fell hush hush girl he is here  pan felicia my dear comes on where was you  fell dear sir in my room  pan and have you been kind to your lover  fell you will find that my lover will scarcely complain of his doom  pan you have confessed an affection  fell to his care and protection myself i would gladly resign  pan i am out of my wits  lis how well the plot hits  pan was ere so complying a daughter as mine  fell was ere situation so cruel as mine  fell was ever man gulled like this master of mine  end of the first act act ii scene i the scene continues pandalfo henrico afterward felicia and lissetta pan sir i will not hear a single word more   hen what are your objections   pan sir i shall keep my objections to myself and you must and shall be satisfied with my refusing you without telling you why   hen was ever any thing to unreasonable but sir if it should so happen that the lady is not averse to my proposal would you still persist in refusing me   pan i believe if you stay till you get her consent your patience will be pretty well exercised   hen will you promise me yours sir upon condition that i am so fortunate to succeed with her   pan ay ay with all my heart i believe i may very securely make that promise   hen sir i am the happiest man in the world   pan what then you really have the modesty to imagine it practicable   hen why yes sir i confess i have   pan then know to your confusion that she has given her consent to another and that she wears on her finger at this minute a wedding ring in token of her having promised to marry him   hen well sir since it is so will you as the last request i have to make you allow me to hear a confirmation of this from your daughter   pan what then you dont believe me   hen i dont absolutely say that but it would be a satisfaction to me i confess to hear it from the young lady herself   pan oh sir you shall have that satisfaction in a minute for here she comes  felicia here is a strange importunate sort of a gentleman who has the audacity to expect my consent to his marriage with you i told him of the promise you made me and nothing forsooth will satisfy him but hearing it from your mouth   hen indeed madam what i heard from your father might well surprise me i was in doubt i own and that final sentence which determines the fate of my unbounded passion must be so sensibly felt by me that it can be no offense if i desire a repetition of it   fell sir i would have it known that fate has presented two objects to my view which inspiring me with different sentiments agitate all the passions of my soul one by a reasonable choice whereto honor engages me    pan and your fathers consent   fell possesses all my esteem and love   pan that is my choice   fell and the other in return for his affection has all my anger and aversion   pan that is you   fell to see myself the wife of one is all my desire   pan that is my good girl   fell and i would rather lose my life than be married to the other   pan pray sir are you contented   fell sir he must be contented and if he has the love for me he pretends he ought not to repine at his fate   hen maam so far from repining i admire your sincerity and shall endeavor to behave in this affair as i ought   fell i know it is highly improper for young women to own their love so freely but in the condition fate has placed me these liberties may be allowed and i can without a blush confess that i have declared my real sentiments   hen very well maam your meanings plain enough i understand what it is you urge me too and shall remove from your sight him who gives you this great disturbance   fell you cannot oblige me more agreeably   hen the poor exile who leaving his friends and his home leaves more than his life more than fortune or fame is doomed without hope thus unpitied to roam his sufferings unmournd and forgotten his name but justice condemned him his sentence is past his fate is pronounced and he must be resigned with fortune he struggles indeed  but at last to her rigid will learns to fashion his mind  scene ii pandolfo felicia and lissetta pan poor young man  a very great proof of his affection indeed  rather than make you unhappy he bears his own torments without seeming to suffer any truly i pity him   fell indeed sir it is more than i do   pan nay but that is too cruel   fell sir i assure you if you knew what my sentiments are of him you would not think him such an object of pity   pan nay but consider he had an affection for you   lis very true sir in my opinion she ought to follow your advice and not treat him with so much ill nature   pan we dont want you maam to give your opinion about it   lis lord sir you will not be pleased let one talk how one will did not you say my young lady treated him too cruelly and would not any body in the world say the same is there any comparison now between him and signor zerbino oh maam your father is perfectly in the right show more compassion to henrico by all means   pan and who the devil gave you the liberty of advising my daughter   lis sure sir there is no harm in speaking ones mind i have said no more than what i actually think of the matter and you cannot do better than first of all to marry your daughter to henrico and afterward as a reward for my faithful services prevail upon zerbino to marry me   pan i never heard such a piece of impudence since i was born but i am angry with myself for listening to it felicia i am going to see that zerbino makes all the necessary preparations and shall be with you again in half an hour   lis if that is the case maam i must run ready to break my neck that i may be with him before hand   fell indeed lissetta i dread the consequence of this disingenuous behavior   lis oh maam if you dont exert a little spirit we are undone i have taken care to apprise henrico of all that is going forward and poor zerbino  if he does not repent his gallantry  i have such a battery to play off against him nay i will make both him and your father principal actors in this plot of ours even without their knowledge   fell i have no doubt of either your talents or good wishes for me lissetta but take care you dont provoke my father   lis never fear maam i have conducted you so far on your voyage with safety and i warrant you i am pilot good enough to bring you fafe to land   fell heaven send it   lis besides who would not run a little risk for so handsome a man as sig henrico   fell indeed lissetta he deserves every thing  when first the youth his fears forsook and that he loved i fondly heard what sweetness was in every look what eloquence in every word from her whole store to make me blessed did fortune bid me choose how gladly would i all the rest for love and him refuse  scene iii an apartment in zerbinos house zerbino henrico afterward lissetta hen is your name zerbino sir   zer yes sir that is my name   hen then you are the man i was looking for   zer pray sir what is your business   hen oh sir i shall tell you my business in as brief a manner as possible it seems you have made proposals of marriage to felicia sig pandolfos daughter   zer no i did not twas her father made proposals to me   hen well that no matter proposals were made and pray sir what do you expect as a portion with her   zer oh i am to take her without a portion   hen indeed you are not   zer no   hen no i am to pay you her portion   zer are you and pray what portion are you to pay me   hen i am afraid you will not like it   zer not like it why so  what is it to be   hen blows  wounds  and death   zer a very pretty portion indeed i had rather be without it i thank you   hen nay sir dont hesitate you see i am prepared to pay you and take the portion or i will break off the match   zer you break off the match for what   hen for what   zer ay tell me that   hen because i am in love with the lady myself  because she returns my passion  because  because her father has consented to our marriage    zer her father has consented to your marriage   hen he has and if you dare even to think of her i will tear you to atoms   zer and all this is most certainly true   hen death and fire have you any doubt of it   zer why i cannot say but your arguments are very convincing and yet now if you would but talk a little cool about this affair    hen cool can a man jealous of his honor and affronted like me talk cool  sir    zer sir   hen i have but one short word to say to you renounce all claim to the lady this instant or tremble at the consequence   zer indeed sir you are very hasty only let me get over my fright a little i never saw you in all my life before and how do i know but all this may be    hen a lie i suppose   zer oh no indeed i did not say a lie   hen but you meant it and i will not be trifled with therefore if you value your safety do as i command you   zer oh i will do any thing in the world if you will only give me a little breath and change that terrible countenance oh as sure as i am alive here comes felicia herself   hen ah fond girl do you follow him to his house by heaven i suspected this but i will be revenged   lis protect me zerbino   zer oh i am as much frigtend at him as you can be   hen you have neither of you cause to fear for you madam your infidelity be your punishment and for you sir you are going to punish yourself but as i have still some regard left for sig pandolfo i will take care he shall not be made a dupe of therefore i insist upon your giving this lady your hand before me and promising to marry her   zer that i will with all my heart and shall be glad to be friends with you so easily   lis and as for me i own the height of my ambition is to become the wife of sig zerbino   hen i am satisfied   scene iv zerbino lissetta zer ecod he frightened me devilishly at first but he has behaved very well upon the whole has not he   lis i do assure you zerbino i am very much in doubt about that he is a very insinuating man and had before i came out persuaded my father into such a plot that i am afraid we shall find a great many difficulties to get over yet   zer why you surprise me   lis you must know that this cavalier is very well born and says my father to me soon after you went away  you will pardon me for repeating his words  zerbino has a great deal of money to be sure but then it was all got by rapine and usury and to say truth he is little better than sprung from a dunghill now i have been considering this and am come to an absolute resolution not to let you marry him   zer your father say this   lis these very words  i was thunder struck at them as you may well guess and for heavens sake dear sir said i with tears in my eyes why would you let me see and converse with him why would you let me listen to his insinuating addresses which have won my affections and made it impossible for me to obey you   zer dear kind creature  well what did he say to that   lis oh he continued unmoved says he  in a more resolute tone than ever i heard him speak to me in my life  you must conquer your affections i have heard of a gentleman well born and nearly related to the doge of venice and am so ashamed that i never thought of this man for my soninlaw that i shall not be content with merely marrying you to my friend henrico but you must consent to punish zerbino for having presumed to think of you   zer to punish me and pray how does he mean to do that   lis i am almost ashamed to tell you   zer oh i beg of you to tell me   lis why he intends  to trap you into marriage with my maid   zer with your maid   lis with my maid he is to pass her upon you for me when you come to our house and as a proof of what i tell you he forced from me that ring you were so gallant to present me with and gave it to her the better to carry on his scheme   zer what a deceitful world this is   lis to be sure she is a relation of ours and every body thinks her a very smart girl  but i will assure the minx  to pretend to my lover   zer ay indeed  but suppose we were to go and be married directly that you know would put an end to every thing   lis it must not be i would not have my father think i am so afraid of him therefore come at the time you intended and i will warrant every thing shall go as i would have it   zer oh you may depend upon me   lis my father is coming to you presently and i would advise you to tell him all this only dont say how you came to know it   zer yes yes i will tell him   lis good bye zerbino   zer well but felicia   lis what do you say   zer will not you give me one kiss before you go   lis lord how can you ask such a thing   zer you must indeed kisses her   lis you impudent man you nay prithee how can you indeed i will assure you will nothing then cure you  nay now i declare i shall never endure you you teaze one to death i am quite out of breath i hate and abhor this horseplay besides it is not right to see one this fright lord what do you think folks will say i own too much room you have had to presume or you never with these freedoms would teaze me for though they might please me and with patience i bore em yet at least in ones carriage on this side of marriage one ought to keep up a decorum  scene v zerbino and pandolfo zer how violently she loves me  well done sig pandolfo  who would have believed it  here he comes  i will seem melancholy   pan well zerbino i could not bear my impatience so i came that we may conclude this business as soon as possible   zer yes you seem rather in a hurry indeed   pan how happy shall i be when i once see you married   zer to your daughters maid  i am very much obliged to you   pan what is the matter zerbino you look dull   zer no not at all i was only thinking what a strange sort of a world this is   pan why what complaint can you have against the world has any one done you an ill office   zer how his conscience flies in his face why i cannot say but i have been rather ill treated   pan ay  how   zer you shall judge do you know one sig henrico   pan yes i know him very well has he treated you ill   zer he is well born i believe   pan yes yes he is well born he is related to the doge of venice   zer the very words felicia told me and he has made proposals to marry your daughter has not he   pan i thought that was coming why how came you to know it   zer oh a friend informed me and i will tell you what i have been thinking of signior pandolfo that for all i have a great deal of money since it was got by rapine and usury and since i am little better than sprung from a dunghill i ought not to aspire to the honor of being our soninlaw   pan you astonish me very much by this discourse   zer i am sure i dont know why you should be astonished about it   pan what does it tend to   zer you dont know i suppose   pan how should i unless you tell me   zer why then i will disguise it no longer  it is you have used me ill the same friend that told me sig henrico wanted to marry felicia told me you had consented to it and that you was determined to punish me for presuming to think of her and a great deal more   pan was there ever such a strange parcel of stuff heard of   zer well let it be ever so strange you dont contradict it i find   pan zerbino i should not bear such an imputation so easily if i was certain you had been imposed upon i suppose this is some contrivance of my daughter and her maid   zer the maid indeed may have some hand it but i am sure it is no contrivance of your daughters   pan well let the contrivance be whose it will i am determined to have it explained   zer i will tell you how it may be very easily explained   pan how   zer why let us all come face to face   pan with all my heart i dont care how soon and when we do i am sure you will find these women at the bottom of it  of woman to tell you my mind and i speak from the experience i have had not two out of fifty you will find be they daughters or wives but are plague of our lives and enough to make any man mad the wrong and the right being set in their sight they are sure to take hold of the wrong they will cajole and they will whimper they will whine and they will snivel they will coax and they will simper  in short they are the devil and so there is an end of my song  scene vi zerbino i never saw such a turn in my life  ah sig pandolfo you did not know what you was setting your wit to  how soon i found him out  and how nettled he was  as if i would not believe felicia sooner than him  i dont wonder now at this fine blustering sparks coming so soon to himself when he knew he was so secure of the father  and this after all is the regard he pays to the memory of his old friend in the morning he was dining that in my ears and how much he should be obliged to me and when the notary was reading over all the list of my estates tenements valleys houses barns mortgages and stocks i could have betted em all to a single piastre that if the doge of venice himself had offered to have been his soninlaw he would have refused him for me and now to use me in this manner i am very much deceived if he does not repent it  what the deuce docs he want to make of me   can such usage be borne indeed  i will be sworn he fancies to make me a tool a lacquey an ass but i will not let it pass no no i am not quite such a fool it is all in my head and no longer i will stay but go and see how the nail drives if i find he desires to be friends and strives for this conduct to make some amends not a syllable have i to say but if he thinks to palm on me this minx whose storys i warrant well taught her  lord how i will use him i will scold him revile him reproach and abuse him and then run away with his daughter  scene the last a large saloon in pandolfos house with folding doors on each side which being thrown open discover two different views of venice henrico felicia lissetta afterward pandolfo after him zerbino and then henrico again who comes forward after having concealed himself fell oh henrico what have you persuaded me too i tremble to think how my father will be insencd when he finds we have imposed upon him   hen i cannot see that we have any great danger to apprehend he voluntarily gave me his promise to day that i should marry you if you did not object to it   lis so he did i overheard him and if i had not i would say i had if there was a necessity for it   hen besides when he sees this zerbino make himself so ridiculous    lis which thanks to my ingenuity he will very shortly   hen i then have no doubt but every thing will go in our favor   fell the very thing you build upon i am afraid of   hen well but my dear felicia you have gone on thus far cheerfully and now you drop   fell consider what i hazard i may lose my fathers affection that is all i fear and you should not blame me for if i am not capable of discharging my duty as a daughter what security can you have for my making you a good wife   lis that is all very true maam but its nothing to the business in hand we must to our posts for my part i know well enough what i have to do you sig henrico must get into your old hiding place and do you maam look as prim and as demure as if you knew nothing of what is going forward   hen the merchants that with weary toiling are india of its treasure spoiling well might indeed their traffic prize if rubies pearls and saphires they could find like your dear lips your teeth your eyes or orient gold as precious as your mind  fell a thousand cruel doubts distress me on every side they thronging press me i fear i know not why and though henrico thou art near i tremble droop and sigh  hen ah cease ah cease by heaven i vow till life be past my love shall last as pure as now  fell then wherefore this pain why should i complain  both love befriending joy attending on all our hopes shall smile in thee my love delighting requited and requiting each night and day that rowls away with pleasure well beguile  pan felicia what can be the meaning of a strange story i have heard from zerbino   fell nay sir how should i know   pan i am convinced he could not mean to impose upon me and yet upon reflection i hardly think you could have been guilty of so much duplicity at the very time i had every reason in the world to believe you was perfectly obedient to my will   fell let me understand you sir   pan it does not signify repeating the matter he will be here in a few minutes himself and then  oh here he comes  zerbino i am glad to see you let us now clear up this affair you say you was informed that i intended to refuse you my daughter and give her to sig henrico   zer i was   pal will you be content if i give her to you now and call in friends to witness it   zer i dont desire any better   pal then take her hand and i hope you will both be happy   zer sig pandolfo i did not think you was capable of using me so ill   pan why is the man mad   zer no sir i am not mad nor such a fool as you think me i find it is all true and perhaps you may repent it   pan repent what   zer why offering me your daughters maid do you think i cannot see she is dizend out that way on purpose   pan why fool  idiot    lis oh you have found it out have you   pan what would you have   zer why i would have you keep your promise of marrying me to your daughter here she stands by me frightened out of her wits and poor soul i dont wonder it   pan my daughter that is her maid   zer i knew well enough you would say so but your daughter or not your daughter i will marry her and no body else   pan why i tell you you are imposed upon   zer if i am it is by no body but you and you are only mad that your scheme did not take   pan was ever man thus abused i could find in my heart to let him continue in his ignorance to punish him   lis dont spoil a poor girls fortune sir you see he does not deserve your daughter bestow her then on henrico   pan i thank you for the hint i made him a kind of promise this afternoon and i declare if he was here i would give him her hand this moment   hen sir i take you at your word and hope you will never have cause to repent your promise   fell and can you sir forgive my having deceived you   pan felicia you have not deceived me more than i have dcceivd myself i therefore not only forgive you but confess i was rightly served for opposing your inclinations   lis and now i drop my disguise i assumed the character of my young lady to prevent you sig zerbino from interrupting her happiness it has answered my end and i am sufficiently rewarded   hen come come lissetta you are two diffident this gentleman made a promise to marry you before me   zer i made a promise to marry her before you   hen sir you know you did   zer well then if i did i will tell you what  i will keep it  she has wit enough in all conscience and she ought to be made a gentlewoman of and as for money i have enough for us both so let us have no more misunderstandings but for the future be all friends  what do you say   pan i accept your proposal with pleasure since things have turned out in this manner and lissetta is in some sort a relation of mine my friendship and countenance you may command upon all occasions for my part i am perfectly convinced that two young people who have an affection for each other are able to baffle all the precaution in the world and for the future i would no more attempt to oppose the decrees of love than i would the decrees of fate   pan as lightning shoots from place to place which through the clouds we wondering trace or darts a beam from phaebus face whose flight no eye discovers or from the moon a silver ray will glittering on a river play so pointed arrows wing their way to wound the heart of lovers  lis i am your voucher here is the pair but trust me they may thank my care remember sir the carrier who praying did endeavor to help his team along the road cries out this time is ill bestowed friend clap your shoulders to the load or you will stay here for ever  hen what will you say in excuse your maxims are in little use too often we find it is wealth profuse the female heart bewitches but you an instance rare remove the shameful prejudice and prove though riches most prefer to love some love prefer to riches  fell zerbirto take your wedding ring of serious sacred use  a thing that used or well or ill will bring to mortals joy or sorrow it saved us both to day  ah think from a rude precipices brink where plunging we were sure to sink in misery tomorrow  zer i see it and the ring once more to its right owner thus restore by whom twas won it should be wore trust me i will prove no rover and now if fortune kindly sends that we have pleased these best of friends i have gained my most ambitious ends and all my cares are over  the end
