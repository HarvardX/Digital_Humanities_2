travels in various parts of europe asia and africa during a series of thirty years and upwards  by john macdonald a cadet of the family of keppoch in invernessshire who after the ruin of his family in      was thrown when a child on the wide world the ways of which with many curious useful and interesting particulars he had occasion to observe and has taken care by means of a regular journal to record while he served in various departments a great number of noblemen and gentlemen english scotch irish dutch etc etc  london printed for the author and sold by j forbes covent garden mdccxc  preface the following pages the production of a candid though uncultivated mind show how much it is in the power of natural simplicity and good sense to make their way to the heart without the lessons of the schools and the aid of artificial composition the author relates the catastrophe of his family the various accidents that befell himself and the observations which he had occasion to make on a great variety of places objects and characters with an air of truth and sincerity which gains a more ready and firmer belief and takes faster hold of the mind and heart than narratives seasoned with profound reflections and composed with the greatest care and artifice he never as he honestly declares takes his own part he seems always to speak from the bottom of his soul he confesses on every occasion his own weakness or folly the simple strokes of truth and nature with which he paints the caprices the vanities and vices of others possess all the force of satyr and the attentive and enlightened reader finds a gratification in observing how objects strike a sound and sensible mind free from all system and prejudice of education for our untutored traveller cast on the wide world an orphan of only five years of age learned to read and write and cast up accounts merely by his own application and industry  placed in a vast variety of situations and departments in the service of a great variety of persons of rank and fortune he had an opportunity of contemplating both high and low life of becoming acquainted with the ways of the world and of treasuring up as he has done in the journal of his life many anecdotes and remarks interesting and useful both to masters and servants  if john macdonald possesses not the learning and the wit of gil blas he draws more from truth and nature and he has had though in a humbler sphere almost as many adventures another circumstance not to be omitted in an apology for the publication of these travels is that their author mindful of the helpless state of his infancy embraces every occasion of illustrating the beneficence of an allruling providence this indeed may be considered as forming in some measure the principle by which he connects the various incidents of his life  these are the remarks of the editor to whom mr macdonald committed his manuscript for the purpose of correcting and improving his style but who judged it unnecessary and even improper to make any other alterations therein than a few that seemed here and there necessary in order to render it intelligible  the life and travels of john macdonald it was formerly customary for the younger sons of gentlemens families in scotland that did not go into the navy or army to become graziers my father who had no estate of his own rented near a thousand acres of the lord of grant he reared cattle and drove them to the south of scotland and into england where he sold them he married at the age of twenty a daughter of some family of the name of mackay but i never knew any thing of her family my mother bore a daughter to him and four sons but he being a rover in disposition and always hankering after the army addicted himself to the use of the broadsword in which he excelled and being very hot and quarrelsome challenged and fought many gentlemen with the sword and target which affronted many families in the neighborhood and broke my mothers heart  i was born in the beginning of the year      and about two years after my mother had another son of whom she died in childbed on this my father was almost distracted swore he would never marry another woman and said often to the children thy mother i shall never forget then he turned extravagant did not stay at home so much as he should have done but neglected his business and when the rebellion began in      he raised a number of men of his own name whom he employed as his drovers and marched them up to prince charles whose first camp was about twenty miles off my fathers house the prince received him very kindly and made him a captain of the macdonalds clan he then left his business to the grieve or foreman and very seldom came home he was in all the battles that ensued in scotland till he fell at culloden having thus given an account of my parentage i shall go on with perfect impartiality and without taking my own part to relate every thing that i did or suffered whether good or bad  the lord of grant thinking things would go wrong with prince charles took possession of what cattle was left and put a person in the house in his name which indeed saved it afterward from the flames when the rebels horses were burnt in their stables the man that had the charge of my fathers affairs went with the cattle and had a place at the lord of grants his name was boyd he took my eldest brother as he had a great regard for the boy and the boy for him and then we four were left with the maid who took no care of the house or any little things that were left as she never expected any wages but soon went off with a lover we were now left alone but my sister being by the providence of god bold of an heroic disposition and strong withal was prepared to go through the following hardships  boyd having read a letter dated from my father captain macdonald at goolens inn and livery stables head of the canongate edinburgh an answer was returned but i believe all the letters to prince charless camp were intercepted for we never saw or heard from our father more  after the letter came from our father my sister was never easy but going from one town to another on foot sometimes to inverness then to see my brother out and in to and fro this made the people take notice and say she had something extraordinary to go through now we had no person with us in the house but the neighbors came to see us now and then my sister had it in her head to go to edinburgh to see my father she got all the money she could get together which was fourteen pounds scots or twentythree shillings and fourpence english with this the letter from my father in her bosom and her three brothers in her hand out she sets for edinburgh from the parish of urquhart about the middle of september      now our ages were as follows kitty fourteen duncan that was left with boyd between ten and eleven daniel seven i four and a half and my brother alexander two years and a half she chose for her departure a moonlight night that the people should not stop her and so she got into inverness about breakfast having traveled nine miles my sister carried the child on her back daniel carried the bundle and i ran along side of both in this manner we traveled from inverness to edinburgh which is one hundred and fifty measured miles in the space of two months  now you shall see the providence of god toward helpless orphans that are left to his care alone as we traveled we were the surprise of every one as we were so young our money being expended we were obliged to beg our bread we were kindly used by some and harshly by others that were against the prince one kind woman equipt us with a little bag for oatmeal for people that would not take us in would give us a handful of meal she gave us a round wooden dish also which my sister put our pottage in when she met with good people that would let her bake it or bake cakes of oatmeal on their gridiron the chief of our food was pottage and milk or cakes and milk and sometimes if we met with good friends at a farmhouse we got a bit of meat if it rained we waited at a farmhouse sometimes for two or three days on the journey we had two things to recommend us although begging from house to house the things we had on were all played and of the finest kind for an extravagant father cares not what he buys our apparel looked like that of a gentlemans children and we had a great share of beauty oftentimes where we came folks would fay poor dears they certainly are some gentlemans children others what if they are a gentlemans bastards so as god knows all things that are to happen if he takes one thing he gives another and he has promised to take care of fatherless and motherless children for nothing can happen without gods knowledge we never marched when it rained if it had been two or three days and on a fine sunshining day we played on the road till near night when we continued to shuffle forward if we could not reach a house my sister would cover us with our plaids and cut the tops of brooms with her knife to lay on and cover our plaids in this manner we lay at nights for weeks and always set off in the morning when we had any brook to cross or small river my sister would carry over my young brother then come for me and afterward come back to take my brothers hand one time as she was wading a river with alexander when she came near the other side the water overpowered her and carried her and my brother into a whirlpool where they floated till a man who was digging potatoes at a little distance saw her distress and ran to her relief he took her and the boy out of the pool and carried my brother and me over also he then took us to a farmhouse where we had victuals and drink and our clothes dried and at night we we were put into a barn amongst the straw if at any time we happened to be benighted and could not get quarters we sometimes lay in an old house without a roof or any house near it another time if the weather was fine near the road side amongst some fine broom one day in the morning before we got up a lunatic who was coming along heard us speak he drew aside and stood over us for some time he never spoke but seemed amazed he then ran away as if he had been afraid and we were very glad my sister next night was told that he was out of his mind for love a gentleman in the country gave him every year a suit of clothes he went where he liked he would work sometimes well and when the work was over they would take some method to affront him that he might set off in a pet without asking for any wages this they did not consider as any act of injustice for if he got any money he would hide it under a stone and forget where he laid it so that the money was lost to the public one time he worked with a farmer for the whole time of hay and harvest when the season of his labors was over the butcher came one night with his cord his knife and steel felt his neck and loins told the farmer he was fat enough and that he might be killed in the morning but before morning he was gone many miles he often told afterward how he had deceived the butcher many things of this kind we met with too tedious to be mentioned when we came near to dundee not far from the town on the side of a river there was an old castle where there was a blacksmiths shop the blacksmiths wife was as good a woman as ever lived she put hay in one of the corners of the castle where the rain did not come in and there at night we lay in the day we went a begging to dundee and at night we came home she let my sister dress our pottage and bake cakes so we staid here three weeks after which we set out again on our journey when it was fine weather and we came to a rivulet my sister washed our second shirt and stockings for we either had no more at first or else she did not choose to bring any more with her when we came to a river where was a ferryboat we begged our passage over then we came to perth where we stayed a week or two the letter from my father was now so worn with fretting and chaffing that it was scarce legible but a gentleman made shift to copy it for us afresh from perth we traveled to kinghorn where we staid a few days till we could get our passage to leith a gentleman who was a passenger in the same boat with us paid our fare before we left the boat the same gentleman made a collection for us he raised halfacrown as we passed through leith we went into an eatinghouse and had plenty of bread meat and broth for fivepence in those days a workingman could dine well for twopence after dinner we set out for edinburgh on a fine walk a mile and an half in length  now my reader let me tell you that for what i have wrote hitherto i have been obliged to my sister for i was too young to remember it as we were passing onward to edinburgh by leith walk a countrywoman of ours spoke to us and asked my sister where we were going and from whence we came my sister told her she answered that prince charles was gone from edinburgh and all his army with him on hearing this we sat down and cried and the woman cried out of pity then she took us to goolens inn mr goolen and every one in the house was surprised and sorry to see us in such a situation mr goolen gave us some victuals and told my sister he would get us into the workhouse for he was a very good man and beloved by every one that knew him my sister would not hear of the workhouse nor of any confinement but took us away immediately we strayed down toward the bottom of the canongate staring at the signs coaches and fine horses at the house below the duke of queensberrys in the canongate a woman who stood at the door seeing us strangers and in the highland dress took us in and asked us several questions concerning our situation which we answered she was a widow and let lodgings her husband before he died was a masterchairman of the name of macdonald born near the place where we were born the woman let us sleep in a lumber garrett on an old mattress and gave us an old blanket or two we had a shilling left from the collection made for us in the boat with which we bought provisions next morning we set out again and returned at night and in this manner continued to live for some time when we were tired of the town then we went and begged our way in the country sometimes we lay in a barn and at other times in a barnyard in such situations my sister would not let us cough lest we should be heard and we set off early in the morning for fear of being seen in this manner we traveled round the country to berwick and to morpeth in england we now began to get a little money and old clothes with other things left off by both boys and girls  in the month of april      we returned to edinburgh by the cheviot hills and coldstream we went to mrs macdonalds as before and she let us lie in the lumber chamber as usual brother daniel and i when we got up one day in the morning went out to play with the boys and would not be kept under command by my sister who had the young child to take care of so that in the daytime we were seldom together we went on in this manner for some time till an unlucky accident happened which separated us all one day as the countess of murray who resided in the canongate was returning from an airing with her coach and six my sister and the child on her back crossing the street were both run over by the carriage my sister and brother screaming for fear and the people calling stop stop made the countess faint away kitty and alexander were taken from under the horses and as god would have it no bones were broken they were both taken into the ladys house and duly taken care of when they recovered the boy was put to nurse by lady murray and one mr vernon an englishman who had been butler to lord murray and by him placed in a good office in the excise took my sister for a servant and clothed her thus my sister and alexander were both done for as to daniel and me we both of us begged and played our time away strolling round the country and stopping sometimes in the barnyard and at other times in a barn in town we lay in the stairs for about edinburgh as in paris and madrid many large families live upon one staircase they shut their own door but the street door is always open there was an opinion at that time very prevalent amongst us poor children of whom after the rebellion there were a great many that the doctors came at night to find poor children asleep and put sticking plasters to their mouth that they might not call out and then to take them away to be dissected and indeed i believe it very true for what every one says must be true and the poor highlanders were more despised at that time by the scots in general of the other party than the devils in hell so when we passed the night in a stair or at a door one slept and the other kept watch in our rounds we went to see our brother sometimes at nurse and one time to see my sister but she wept so much that daniel having more sense than me said after we came away he would not go again because our being poor and helpless hurt her so much another day we went a begging to mr campbells a mastercarpenters and who should come to the door but one of my fathers servants the man on seeing us was greatly affected and a scene ensued which took the attention of many but nothing touched our hearts we had no sorrow nor the least uneasiness one morning we strolled within the gates of the city of edinburgh to see the fine high houses and were taken up by the soldiers of the city guard for none may beg within the walls of the city and the soldiers have an allowance for every one they take up our names were given to the captain of the guard and entered in a book young people that could not find protection were sent abroad in merchantships in a situation little better than that of convicts though not under the same disgrace  those who were kept in the guardhouse lived well by the side of a good fire with three rolls and three pints a beer per day in this comfortable state we remained for three nights and two days till the council chamber met but when the guard soldiers found who we were they were very sorry at what they had done for they were mostly all highlanders and from our shire of inverness they asked us if we knew any person in town my brother mentioned mr goolen at the liverystables at the head of the canongate  this worthy man appeared for us at the council chamber before the lord provost and gave him such information concerning us as induced him to set us at liberty we went with mr goolen and as there was one of his houses next door to his dwelling house empty he let us lie at night in a closet on hay when we had a mind to go to rest we got both of us together into a cornsack we went out in the daytime as before a begging but at night we had a whole house to ourselves like gentlemen now daniel being the oldest and about the size of mr goolens son his only child he got his old clothes and played with the boy and went on errands and there remained  i was still left to my shifts and went out as usual to beg and play for about one year sometimes i was desired to get in the ride and at other times to ride a horse to a brook about a mile out of town in which employment i very much delighted at night when i came home i lay down at the door of a warehouse till my brother came to bed he always brought me something to eat and some halfpence for the next day one morning as we were getting up a woman came into our empty house where she saw a played that mr goolen had given to cover us she asked if we took that out with us we said no  never she went away and as usual we left the door on the latch but she afterward came and stole our played which contained six yards soon after this the house was let we then slept in the stable in the haystall  about this time one mr frazer a master shoemaker took me to rock the cradle i did not like the confinement of this i pinched the child in the cradle and made it cry i was turned off accordingly which was the thing that i wanted i was now taken into a gentlemans house to turn the spit they gave me stinking veal for dinner  i put it behind the chest and set off  i went next to lead a blind fiddler with whom i lived four months he taught me to play on the bass he carried the one instrument and i the other on my back  one time we went to a wedding in the country near roslin castle thither he rode on his ass  i walked in the middle of the road and the ass followed  we lived well all that day and my master took thirty shillings at night we both lay in the barn amongst some hay but we forgot the ass in the field when the fiddler recollected this circumstance he sent me for him and when i had brought the creature home i tied him with his halter to the strong beer cock in the night the ass drew out the cock and the beer was spilt at daylight i saw the place all wet and told my master what had happened the fiddler beat me well with the strap of the fiddlecase so as i had got two shillings at the wedding in my pocket i left my master the ass and the fiddles and ran as fast as i could into edinburgh i went next to a farmers near corstorphin about five miles from edinburgh i would not stay in the farmers two days  like lots wife i looked back to the city whither i returned i now began to leave off goolens lane or close and found out gibbs lane a little below about thirty yards distance  mr gibbs kept hackneycoaches and chaises and twenty horses i got some victuals and drink from the coachmen and postillions for doing what they desired me and i slept in the large tub in which they mixed the oats and corn for the horses in this situation i continued for some time when i left my brother he was taken to sleep in mr goolens house i saw him every day about this time one of the coachmens sons died and as i was all tatters he gave me his clothes which fitted me to an hair when a coachman went into the country with a family to their country house i went in the boot and came home with them again and when i told them on their asking who i was they often gave me sixpence or a shilling which i spent immediately with the coachman and postillion i liked this life with all my heart in october      my brother duncan in the highlands hearing that we were about edinburgh that our father was killed in the battle of culloden which is within twenty miles of the place where he lived with boyd that every thing belonging to the rebels was destroyed and their houses set on fire by the duke of cumberland came to edinburgh dressed very genteely with two guineas in his pocket one of which he had received from the lord of grant and the other from mr boyd for he never tasted of poverty as we did when he saw us he was amazed and grieved to the heart and thought bad worse he stopped at mr goolens with his brother and paid what he called for mr goolen asked him if he would be a mason he said yes so in a week he sent him to falkirk to his brother a stonemason in great business and credit with whom he was bound apprentice for seven years  between this time and the year fifty i became a postillion to mr gibb who set his carpenter to make a bedframe for me over the haystall in one of the stables and gave me blankets bedding and sheets every month mr gibb was a man of great possessions he had a whole lane of houses the largest coachyard in great britain a garden and a gardener he put me in livery and looked upon me as his apprentice i was fitted out with a green jacket with a red cape a red waistcoat and a leather cap with the forepart lined with red morocco mr gibb was a gentleman the son of a gentleman and dressed as a gentleman every day in his ruffles which is uncommon for men over horses and carriages and never drove a coach in his life the coat of arms he had on his carriage was a hand in hand within a double treasure of flowers his motto the gibbs contract he married a gentlemans daughter her father was the lord of craigleith when he was courting his mistress i always drove him in the chaise to see the young lady and then i lived well in those days genteel families took a coach and six horses as there was no chaise to be hired but single chairs with two wheels and the second horse was often fixed to the left side to draw it along so in returning to town the coachman would make the postillion drive the set of horses and i was postillion while the coachman was in the inside by this means i learned to drive and soon became the roadpostillion myself in which station i enjoyed a very pleasant life when we went into the country with gentlemens families to their seats we had good living on the road and when we arrived at our journeys end most commonly noblemen and gentlemen made us stay a day to rest our horses my master pitched on me to go into the country because i was light when i was put on the horse i had a strap about my waist and fastened to the crupper of the saddle so that if the horse stumbled i could not pitch over his head the roads in those days were very bad traveling of course was not so easy as it is now it was therefore thought to be a matter of consequence to have drivers of light weight and i was the littlest postillion in scotland or any other country when i went the falkirk way i used to see my brother duncan the mason he was very happy to see me he came sometimes to see us in edinburgh my master after a short courtship married craigleiths daughter he had fifteen hundred pounds with her soon after their marriage she gave a feast in my masters own house to the blacksmiths wheelers harnessmakers painters coachmen and postillions and helpers and all their wives and children my master and mistress dined with them and after dinner spent the evening abroad leaving mr gibbss neice to conduct the entertainment at home with plenty of wine rum punch and ale and a fiddler every monday morning mrs gibbs gave the stablemen a cold joint of meat and the broken victuals of sunday and strong beer now every thing was agreeable my sister and two brothers were always in town we saw one another frequently and wanted for nothing all the others had education i had none but learned wickedness  the year    0 was a remarkable era in my life john dalrymple eldest brother of sir hugh dalrymple of north berwick bart in east lothian at the death of lord bargeny succeeded to an estate of four thousand pounds per year in right of his mother a daughter of lord bargenys eldest son though as the estate came by a woman the title was extinct mr dalrymple now changed his name to hamilton after he had been for some years in possession of the estate and returned from his travels he married lady anne wemys daughter of the earl of wemys in fife by whom he had ten thousand pounds there was one of the finest coaches made for mr hamilton at mr humes coachmaker in edinburgh that was in scotland when it was ready the coachman was sent for it to town with the old coach to be left with mr hume the coachman in coming to town with the old coach foundered one of the horses by giving him cold water when he was hot so the horse was unable to work as the new coach was very heavy more like a statecoach than one for the road and carried also a large chest of plate the coachman found that in order to take the coach to the country house he must have four horses he went to several stableyards but he could not get black horses to match his own they were greys or bays or not at home but when he came to my masters whose horses were all black he hired three which with his own made four and as one must go to bring the horses back the coachman pitched on me as i was light to ride the sick horse so we set out for bargenyhouse ninety miles distant which in the condition of the roads at that time was three days journey at the town of air eighteen miles from bargeny when the coachman at the inn where we staid all night got in company and was merry with punch and chattering amongst those around he said i took great care of the sick horse which i certainly did for i got off and walked up all the hills and by this time jemmy sor that was his name had got better and as i pleased the coachman very well he hired me to be postillion for two pounds a year all my clothes and a third part of the vails next day we arrived at bargeny in fine weather near the end of april the coach was admired as well as the plate i was taken into the parlour to see if lady anne liked her new postillion i was admired in my livery for my littleness being only nine years of age lady anne told me to come back again after i had taken home the horses after i had staid two nights and got the money i set off with the three horses i rode one and led the other and the third followed after the other two i paid for the expenses of the horses both in going and coming back after i had got the hire and took bills from each inn i took the horses and money safe home it was the first time i had been out so far by myself so i got great applause i forgot my being hired and thought no more of it for a month as i was coming back one day with a chaise and horses from the queens ferry i took up two gentlemen to town they gave me two shillings for the nine miles it happened that my master saw the gentlemen come out of the chaise and give me two shillings he knew the gentlemen and asked how they did they said they had an opportunity of his chaise very cheap  for two shillings so in the afternoon when my master came home and i had given him the hire to the queens ferry he asked me if i had any person back with me i said no what did you with the two shillings the gentleman gave you he searched my pocket and found the money which i intended to spend at the publichouse for that was our custom amongst the postillions he took and strapped me well and took all the money in my pocket i went on this to my brother and told him what had happened and of my being hired into the country so on sunday morning he set off with me out of town as far as fountain bridge he desired me to go to bargeny gave me two shillings and returned to edinburgh  now before i go farther i shall give a set of men a character they deserve  i mean the hackneycoachmen in edinburgh who differ from all men in europe in their station there is no stand of coaches in the street on a sunday the postillions and helpers do the work in the stables and the coachmen dress like gentlemen and tradesmen and go to church where they have the first seat in the canongate church for all the coachyards are in the suburbs no man may drive a coach on the street till he enters into their corporation and have the coachmans word and whistle by the whistle they call one another out of any house the coachmen dress always genteelly the coaches and horses are like gentlemens there is only one stand for coaches and that is in the high street one of the finest in europe near the cross and the royal exchange where all the noblemen and gentlemen meet between twelve and two when the musical bells are playing it is a hundred to one but any gentleman in town may be seen there at noon if a coach is wanted on sunday it is sent for to the master and goes out as a daycoach there is no luggage admitted in a coach there there was not a coachman in edinburgh that had less than forty or fifty horses if any nobleman or gentleman wants a coachman they send for one of them for they are men of good character and i have known them refuse a noblemans service in general they are more respected than in other countries  when i parted with my brother i set off with my postillionwhip round my shoulders and one shirt in a handkerchief which was all i had i ran along about six miles when i met a helper that lived with my master he asked where i was going i would not tell him he took hold of me to take me back  i roared and cried he kept hold of me thinking to get a present for taking me to my master the people asked me if i belonged to that man i said i did not so they took me from him and i ran fifteen miles to livingston to dinner then i ran to the kirk of shots eleven miles where i stayed all night i set off in the morning for hamilton ten miles then to streven and to new mills at night eighteen miles more i went to all the inns where the coachmen put up next day i went to the city of air eighteen miles to the inn where i was hired and there stopped all night the landlord went to madam duffs mr hamiltons sister the sheriffs lady to know if they had any letters for bargeny i got a letter and set off in the morning twenty miles i got there at noon the gardeners being at work and seeing me before i reached the house told me that another postillion had been hired lady anne not expecting me as i was a whole month behind my time i sat down on this and cried my bellyfull for i was afraid to go back to my master but the head gardener mr macmorlin took pity on me and desired me to go with him down to the house and see what he could do for me when i went into the servants hall i saw the boy that was hired to be postillion a stout lad about sixteen years of age whereas i was a little lad not much turned of nine i therefore thought little of myself and sat down and cried heartily i then sent letters up stairs from madam duff and master scot the valet de chamber told i was below the company consisting of mr hamilton lady anne and lady eleanor wemys her sister lord ray and miss ramsay sent for me i went up with my whip shirt and handkerchief my all round my shoulders mr hamilton asked me why i did not come sooner i said nothing but cried for i knew in my own mind that if my master had not flogged me i should never have come at all they asked me if i should like to go back to my master but they perceived tears in my eyes so i was sent down stairs and the coachman was sent for  john bell you enticed this boy from his master and you have hired another how are you to do in this  sir he did not come according to his time and that is not my fault  if you can send this country boy home satisfy his father and i will pay you for he knows nothing about being a postillion and as for the other he knows nothing but riding postillion  so go down and settle it among yourselves amongst the servants there was a division for me mr macglashan the butler alexander campbell lady annes footman who afterward kept the great inn at perth and mr macmorlin the head gardener all the rest being low country people were against me but all the ladies were for me the other lad therefore was sent away he swore revenge against me whenever he should meet me lady anne now set the housekeeper to make shirts and stocks for me and i had new liveries boots and shoes in the course of that summer and harvest the bargeny family visited a great deal so i came into a pleasant life though i remained longer at begging than my sister or brother i met the greatest pleasure at last bargeny is situated in a fine valley about twelve miles long and three broad with a river running through the middle called the water of girvan which on each side receives brooks from the hills which are well covered with woods and parks  sir john whitefords house is the first then the seat of barskimming next sir adam fergusons of kilkerran colonel kennedys at drumbart mr kennedys of dolwherren mr macheath of brunston next bargeny sir john cathcart at killochan on one side boyd of pinkills and on the other side of the river boyd of tarchrig and at the bottom of the river the town of girven which belongs to bargeny near this by the seaside is the seat of mr crawford of ardmillan and just opposite to this valley twentyfour miles in the sea a very high hill called ailsa which contains solon geese and many other birds it belongs to the earl of cassillis my master had a large estate of twenty thousand acres of ground he loved to encourage all trades he had salt pans by the sea side and several coal pits he had shepherds in the mountains thirty milch cows eight young fellows for gardeners he had also goats and asses for milk and whey in the season mr macmorlin as already observed was head gardener mr craig over the farmers mr maccrinel over the parks and cattle mr macconnel over the hedgers and ditchers mr heaton over all the salt pans and mr whorter over all the milch cows mr davidson over the carpenters and coopers and mr macmichin head smith he soon raised his estate from four thousand to six thousand pounds a year by renewing the old leases besides his own fortune before he came to the estate of bargeny and his ladys the family have eight upper or ladymaids four chambermaids two laundrymaids two dairymaids a plainworker a first and second mancook a kitchenmaid a butler two footmen a coachman with postillions and helpers  lady polly and lady nelly wemys were often there they had each of them five hundred pounds per year and each a maid and footman the oldest sister lady betty was married to sir james stuart who joined prince charles in      in company with his wifes brother lord elcho so that the attendance on mr hamilton some mornings of his farmers and head men was like a little levee  after the new coach was come that summer and harvest we rode over all the west of scotland one fine day as the family was going from the earl of cassilliss to air and lady anne was looking out of the coach to see the country my postillionhorse stumbled and i fell over his head lady anne screamed and fainted away the coachman stopped the six horses before the wheels touched me and as god would have it the horses stepped carefully over me so that i was not much hurt i was now obliged to take to my old way of having a strap round my waist and fixed to the crupper of the saddle  another day as we were going through an avenue down to the earl of dumfriess at lochnores my lord who happened to be looking out of the window said to lady dumfries i see the coach and horses with the coachman and two footmen riding after but i can see no postillion i was very small and wore a dark brown jacket as my scarlet jacket was not come from edinburgh  when the family returned to bargeny i had a great desire to learn to read and the servants gave me a lesson when time permitted wherever i went i always took the spellingbook with me i thought that if once i could read the bible i should not go to hell in the winter the whole family went to live in air where almost all the families came from their countryhouses to spend the winter in routs and assemblies  next year the bargeny family made a tour of all the east part of scotland we set off from bargeny in the month of may for edinburgh i called to see my old master mr gibbs in place of being angry was glad to see me dressed in a scarlet jacket trimmed with silver and as i had about a guinea i treated my old friends the coachmen and postillions i saw my sister and my young brother my brother daniel was on the point of binding himself to a plaisterer and stuccoworker at haddington for seven years we visited about the lothians a great while at last we went to the earl of murrays the countess of murray was a relation of lady annes the servants were telling in the hall that lady murray had a boy of my name at nurse that had been run down some years ago by the horses in the canongate i made answer that he was my brother and that i had been at the nurses to see him i also took occasion to mention my sister and all that had happened to our family this account went into the parlour and i was sent for by lady murray who asked me if i knew alexander macdonald i answered i did and that he was my brother it was now whispered about what my father was and from that time i was more in favor than before for lady annes brother lord elcho and her sisters husband sir james stuart had borne arms on the side of prince charles and the earl of murrays name was stuart we visited in the three lothians and fifeshire the earl of murray the earl of balcarris my masters brotherinlaw the earl of wemys my ladys father at the earl of haddingtons lord colstons hamiltons of puncaitland sir hugh dalrymples my masters brother mr charteris my ladys second brother who changed his name for an estate of twenty thousand per year the richest commoner in scotland the estate came by his mother the countess of wemys being the only daughter of the infamous charteris the third son of the earl of wemys had his fathers estate because the eldest son lord elcho forfeited his right thereto from east lothian we set off for dunce wells in the shire of berwick a place of great resort for nobility in those years situated in as fine a country as any in great britain in the morning the company went to the wells in their coaches came home to breakfast before dinner went an airing and at night to ball another thing contributed to render dunce wells very agreeable and pleasant the noblemen and gentlemen that have estates by the tweed side in the summer and harvest give what they call a kettle of fish the entertainment is conducted in the following manner they all have marquees for the purpose which they pitch near the banks of the river orders are given for a large dinner and plenty of wine and punch the fishermen take the salmons out of the water and that moment cut them in pieces throw them into boiling water and when done serve them up on table this treat is called a krab of fish there is always music to play after dinner some of the company walk along the banks of the tweed others play at cards and the younger part of the gentlemen and ladies dance countrydances on the grass they conclude with tea and syllabubs and then go home it is the custom for strangers too to give entertainments of this kind as well as gentlemen who reside in the neighborhood there are often fifty or sixty in company besides servants  we went for one week to leith races and returned to the wells and remained till october we went a short time to bargeny and to edinburgh all the winter  about this time lady annes two sisters were married lady nelly married colonel dalrymple lady polly a french nobleman in the spring of the year the family went from edinburgh home lady anne at this time had for companions miss duff mr hamiltons neice afterward countess of dumfries sir john cathcarts daughter miss cathcart miss ramsay from air and miss crawford of ardmillan all these young ladies with the miss kennedys of drumburle came and accompanied lady anne in their turns and went out with her in the coach till they married off by degrees  when mr hamilton and lady anne were informed that i was desirous to learn to read they put me to school as there was not much to do only when the coach and six was wanted or when any of those young ladies went home or a visiting for then i was always sent with them with two little ponies because i was light in the course of time i got reading writing and arithmetic but the coachman became jealous and gave me a flogging for when he was out with the coach and four horses he thought i did not give all the vails i got when i gave gentlemen their horses the helper being a labourer and not in livery was not allowed to lead a horse out the coachman flogged me sometimes till the blood came out of my legs at such times i went crying to mr hamilton then the coachman was called to know what his flogging was for he told mr hamilton that i neglected to clean the stable or harness or coach or chariot i had taken to keep foxes hares ravens otters magpyes and the eagle etc etc he said i minded these things more than my business this passed on for a great while for mr hamilton did not know the right as the cooks gave me raw meat for my birds and beasts i assisted them in the kitchen particularly in the evening when i had nothing to do in the stables by this i learned a little of the art of cookery  as my troubles drove me to be religious and to read the bible the coachman damned me and said i disturbed the horses by praying i never went to a fair harvest or any merrymaking if any person died within a mile or two i went and sat up with the dead and there we all told stories and talked on religious matters i was always to be found at those wakes  if the first and second cook went out to dancing or any merrymaking they always pitched upon me to stay in the kitchen with the maid and dress supper then i made pancakes for myself as many as i pleased if any other person wanted to go out they asked me to do for them and i did  the people in the west of scotland are very religious and i hearing of so many good people that had died and knew beforehand the exact time of their death had the vanity to think that i should make my peace with god and know when i should die i have prayed a hundred times that i might die having heard so much about heaven i commonly when supper was carried up into the dining room went by myself into a private part of the garden and kneeled down to pray to god i had a great desire to see the devil and often looked behind me to see if i could see him that i might rebuke him for i was confident he could not hurt me  i had nothing to do in the evening but be in the kitchen or see the servants at diversion in the hall i often went out with the two greyhounds and brought in a hare that sport i much delighted in as also in going out with the tame otter to catch fish as for my fox when he could break his chain he would go out four or five miles in the night kill the fowls in the gentlemens henhouses and come home in the morning but before he was three years old he was killed by some of the gentlemens servants  the coachman still continued his severity to me often flogging me unmercifully and turning me out of the stables the servants desired me to speak to mr hamilton in the garden in the morning mr hamilton could not tell lady anne for she gave me shirts stockings and neckcloths and ordered the housekeeper to take care of me my master did not know what to do he did not like to turn bell away for his family was there when mr hamilton got a servant that answered his purpose he desired him to bring his family and he gave them houses so that on each side of the road a quarter of a mile from bargeny there was a little village with gardens behind the houses enclosed with a ditch and two rows of hedges for which houses he made them pay a small rent yearly  the coachman took another method to get the money from me but i must first tell how i got it myself we had two little ponies that seldom went out but when i went with them i went twice a week for the letters to maybole the post town and i was often sent on a message to air to mr duffs and i was often going out with the young ladies taking them home or going for them or at the holiday times for mr duffs sons to stay a few weeks when i used to ride out with them by all this i got money for in those days there was money in plenty as trade flourished and there were not many taxes when i came home john bell would ask me what i had got i commonly denied that i had got any thing but he searched my pocket and told me he would take care of it and that he would give me his daughter when we grew up so that it would be all the same to me when i had her for a wife and he desired me to mark it all down after this when i came home i hid my money in holes and some of it is there to this day for it slipped down so that i could not get it out again  in      our family made a tour of the west highlands we set off in the beginning of may by air glasgow and dumbarton we next went to luss where my master stayed three weeks at mr leachs inns and drank goats whey luss is a village close by the side of lochlomond this lake is fresh water twentyfour miles long and across between luss and the duke of montroses house eight miles in other parts the lake is not so broad sir james colquhouns house is at the bottom of the lake there are twentyfour islands in it that belong to the duke and sir james some of these are covered with fir with birds and with deer my master and lady went in a boat at different times to see them all and an airing by the side of the lake every day on each side of the lake are high mountains we left luss and went to the tarbet ten miles further on the side of the lake there we stayed all night right over against the great mountain of benlomond where the snow lay on the north side almost the whole year and in the finest day in summer a cloud covers it like an umbrella and by the shape of the cloud they can tell what weather it is to be next day we set out for inverary where the duke of argyles house stands on the road to this place we passed gentlemens seats went over mountains round great lakes and through glens inverary is a neat little town on the side of lochfine and the dukes palace is at the end of the town one of the finest sights in great britain the house gardens woods hills and cascades would be a fine treat for a londoner from this we went to the races at leith and returned to bargeny in harvest and staid there the winter following in the year      the family received company at home then we went to balls in air and a visiting round the country  in that year a report was spread of me concerning one of the fair sex a pretty fairhaired girl of our parish was put apprentice to a mantuamaker in the posttown maybole fourteen years old about my own age she came home on saturday afternoon and stayed with her mother a widow that kept a farm she had to walk about five miles the third saturday after i saw her i spoke to her and asked if she would ride she agreed and ever after when i came for the letters she rode behind me even the two ponies knew her when they saw her and drew near the bank for her to mount sometimes she came at night to meet me and then i walked near home with her so in time the people began to speak of us at bargeny and made me much ashamed one day mr scott the clerk of the parish came about business to my master for mr hamilton was ruling elder of the parish and this mr scott was schoolmaster where i went to learn he had all the children in the parish both high and low he taught english latin and greek he kept an usher and a woman for the girls his income was greater than the parsons of the parish he had a boy to teach those that were in the spellingbook he taught his first scholars the shorthand writing he wrote the sermon every sunday in church and taught the gentlemens sons to do the same when mr scott was not well on sundays the gravedigger gave out the psalms and wrote the sermon as well as mr scott well after dinner in the second table room where mr scott dined the upper servants told him of me and the girl and for their own diversion called me in jack said mr scott i have been with mr hamilton about you i hear strange accounts of you about decoying away sally macrath the church must be satisfied i must have you before the minister and all the elders so they roasted me in this manner and all the other servants were laughing one to another it afforded them fine sport  i have nothing to mention till our journey to edinburgh mr hamilton and lady anne made an appointment with their friends to spend the winter in that city and to be there before christmas a house was taken but in the beginning of december a great snow fell which in hollow places filled up the roads mr hamilton told my lady that she could not go before the snow was melted but she would not be disappointed for she was very proud and valued herself much on account of the great family she sprung from macduff that killed macbeth king of scotland she wrote a letter to mr macglashan chairman to send out her chair with six of his men to carry her through the snow as mr macglashan butler and his wife the housekeeper at bargeny were uncle and aunt to the chairman he came to see them and brought five of his chairmen for he carried as one himself after the men had rested two days we set out for edinburgh before christmas with the coach and six the butler first cook and two footmen on horseback and a horse in hand for my master so when the roads were bad and deep with snow lady anne took to her chair mr hamilton rode along side of it and the two ladies and ladys maid got up behind the servants in this manner we traveled and arrived in five days all well in edinburgh where we continued till the month of april       we stood at boyds liverystables at the head of the cannongate six horses and two saddle horses the coachman had board wages mr boyd charged five shillings per week for me but on account of the eight horses at livery mr bell being so called as he was a sixhorse coachman had his victuals for nothing all the winter we both slept at boyds inn as well as boarded mrs boyd had a brothers daughter that lived with her and acted as barmaid a beautiful girl of fifteen she took a liking to me and i to her i made her and the english cookmaid presents of ribbands silk handkerchiefs and silver sleevebuttons and miss cochran called me her sweetheart the cookmaid made me often kiss her and she liked me much when john bell saw how she liked me he said jack you are a damned fool if you dont marry kitty cochran for she will be a fortune for you as she is heiress to mr boyd who is rich and has no children he said miss cochran will you marry john macdonald she answered i will john bell saw what would have been good but i had not the sense to see it myself if i had seen it i might have had her for the parson that married those that came from england every week lived within forty yards and would have married us for half a crown but if you will not when you may when you will you shall have nay  we had a very agreeable winter and as god would have it i had the best part of it we never went out with lady anne even an airing with less than six horses with the two footmen on horseback with pistols and furniture complete when any one of the young ladies went on horseback i went with her when mr hamilton rode an airing i went with him also the coachman was too heavy and the footman had enough to do at home the young gentlemen envied my life and often said i wish i had as pleasant a life as you if my master wanted to dine at a gentlemans house he would say jack go to the inn with the horses and there is half a crown to pay for the horses and you sometimes the servants asked me to dine where my master dined and by that means i had it in my power to save a shilling or two and now and then mr hamilton would give me half a crown which served me for pocket money to spend in the evening at boyds when there was company the coachman and i waited at dinner and i went to the house every morning for orders  when i heard that they were speaking of going to bargeny one day as i was riding out with my master i gave him warning he asked me for what i wanted to go i said i was too big to ride postillion and that i wanted to get a coachmans place he told me if i would stop he would give me the saddle horses and a stable for myself and that i should be groom i told him that would make john bell worse against me than ever i hoped his honor would let me go well said he see if you can get a place before i go out of town yes sir i said i am sure he had a great regard for me god bless him to all eternity next day he told john bell when he came to the stable that he must hire a postillion if jack should get a place for he would not have a country boy that did not know how to ride i would have taken the grooms place it was as good as a guinea a week but i did not like to be in opposition to the coachman for i looked upon him as my benefactor next to mr hamilton he and lady anne were the means of my having education and being put in a way to get my bread next morning when john bell and i were in mr humes yard the coachmaker where our coach stood as we were cleaning the coach mr hume came along john bell asked him if he knew of any place for john macdonald was about to leave bargenys service  mr bell how long has he lived with you he has been postillion with us six years since we hired him from your neighbor mr gibbs good god said he how old are you jack sir said i i have entered into sixteen well said mr hume that is a great character indeed to live six years out of fifteen in the world in one place i have received two letters for postillions one from the earl of glencairn for a set of horse postillions the other from the earl of crauford for one to drive the postchaises and four horses to have the charge of the saddle horses and to have a boy to assist him and ride postillion  i liked this place as i was to have no servant over me and told mr hume that i had known lady crauford for years when i was out with the ladies as beforementioned  she was often in their company for her father had a house in the town of air where my master had one she had been married to the earl of crauford at christmas mr hume hired me for five pounds a year to the earl of crauford the first earl in scotland the chief of the craufords and lindsays he wrote to lord crauford that he had hired a servant for his purpose from his neighbor mr hamilton of bargeny and that he would enter into his service on the fifteenth of may mr hume let us see the postchaise that was finishing for lord crauford one of the first that ever went out of the yard i gave the man half a crown to drink and was very well pleased with my engagement john bell hired a postillion from boyds liverystables from amongst the postchaise boys near the end of april we left edinburgh for bargeny and i took leave of miss cochran i wrote her a letter and she answered it but absence is a great enemy to love ross the waiter got her with child and married her so i lost her and she lost herself ross was a good waiter but otherwise a bad character when mr and mrs boyd found they were married they were both turned away she bore a boy that was blind and she herself broke her heart and died so there was an end of one of the finest girls in edinburgh  lady anne never saw the postillion till the morning after we left edinburgh on our way to bargeny at hamilton when he was getting on behind the coach as we were going away on the journey lady anne asked what boy was behind the coach mr hamilton told her it was the new postillion is jack going away then yes lady anne he is hired to the earl of crauford he told me he wanted to go as john bell and he could not agree  it is very odd after rearing him six years and giving him education to let him go and hire one in his place and me never to hear any thing of it at night when lady anne was going to bed she said to her maid if i had known i would have brought john macdonald up to be my footman and not to be used as he has been by john bell  we arrived at bargeny and on the   th of may mr hamilton called me into his study to pay me off he asked me what money i had i told him twenty shillings  have you ever received any wages from me i said no sir my master said jack if i give you two pounds that will be enough for your pocket lord crauford will give you money when you want and i will give you a note of hand for your ten pounds and five per cent for it and when you see me in air call for me when the interest is due and i will pay you i told him i was very much obliged to his honor and said god almighty bless you and thank you for your goodness i got the note of hand and set out next morning on one of my masters horses for air where i staid all night and next day i hired a horse and went eighteen miles to kilburnie the seat of the earl of crauford  when i arrived i sent the letter up from mr hume and i myself being in livery the servants did not know who i was till i was called up stairs and told them that mr hamilton and lady anne desired their compliments lord and lady crauford when i came down to the hall the servants knew who i was and came to look at me again and said pray sir is your name john macdonald i said yes they said it is very odd as my lord has this day discharged his gardener who lived here three years he is gone to edinburgh and his name was john macdonald are you his son i said i never heard of him before but the farmers called me his son now lady crauford till last christmas was miss hamilton of bourtreehill one of the most accomplished young ladies in scotland for appearance virtue and a fortune mr hamillon of bourtreehill had four daughters lady crauford was the eldest each of them had ten thousand pounds but a fine estate at mr hamiltons death was to come to lady craufords children and what money he had was to be divided amongst his daughters  many gentlemen of fortune in the shire of air paid their addresses to them and amongst them colonel montgomery brother to lord eglington who wanted to have been married to the eldest mr hamilton offered him ten thousand pounds  but colonel montgomery wanted fifteen thousand pounds down  by this disagreement the match was broke off so after this the earl of crauford paid his addresses to miss hamilton and she left her fathers lodgings in edinburgh without leave or ceremony and was married to the earl by whom she had three sons and two daughters next year colonel montgomery raised a regiment of highlanders on the estate of sir james macdonald his nephew who was then at school in england the colonel went to america with his regiment for several years at the death of his brother the earl who was shot by mungo campbell the exciseman he got the estate and title and afterward married lady jane lindsay lady craufords eldest daughter if he lost the mother he gained the daughter i began the first night of my service with dancing there were two fiddlers at kilburnie for a week i went begging to mr gibbs crying to bargeny and dancing to lord craufords in a week our chaise was sent from edinburgh with the harness we had four fine long tailed greys with good saddle horses our liveries were blue and scarlet trimmed with gold lace we had a pleasant summer and harvest for visiting and seeing company  my ladys sisters were commonly with her or with their father at bourtreehill in a week after i came to kilburnie the grooms daughter amelia burn came to be chambermaid to lady crauford under the ladysmaid she was the handsomest girl in the parish or in the shire her father james burn lived twentyeight years in the family her mother had a house to live in and so much a year and took care of a natural son of my lords james burn died about two months before i came home so i took his place and my own from the first day amelia took a liking to me and i to her lady crauford and the young ladies told her the imprudence of being so fond of jack macdonald but all to no purpose one day as i s toying with the plain worker amelia drove her away and struck me i went into the stable and said to myself if i toy with any other girl it is all foolishness for none is so beautiful as herself and i must respect james burns daughter so i never put hands while i staid at kilburnie onany girl after i called to see her mother every day i commonly carried a pudding or some tarts for my lords son so that it became a byeword among the servants that the chambermaid and the old wheels became jack macdonalds perquisites she made me shirts at her leisure hours and i was as happy as a prince  one day as we were going to mr macdougals of castle semple as i was walking the carriage and four fine horses round the green the two saddle horses for the footmen and the sidesaddle horse for my ladys sister following after the carriage the young ladies remarked that they never saw any equipage turn out so clean as jack macdonalds did lady crauford made answer i dont wonder that it is reported jack macdonalds father was a captain in the princes army for he certainly is some gentlemans son or some nobleman or gentlemans bastard i might mention twenty things of this kind but it would be the same thing over again  in the harvest my lady was brought to bed of her first child afterward countess of eglington after she recovered my lord and mr hamilton his fatherinlaw went to see the duke of argyle at inverary in argyleshire as i had been there before with mr hamilton of bargeny i could the better describe the places to my lord when he saw the mountains lakes rivers and valleys near inverary he said there was not such a pleasant place in all europe and he recommended it as such to my lady and told her that archibald duke of argyle had invited her to inverary in the summer when he should come down from london so accordingly they went  the family of crauford kept their christmas with their friends and lived at kilburnie all the winter for the last time  in the month of april      as i was going to the stable to my horses about five in the morning on a sunday as i looked back to the house i saw the smoke coming through the roof very fast i returned and alarmed the family when i went into the house amelia burn was just come down except her the whole family was in bed none of the men servants slept in the house we all slept in an office adjoining i told her to let my lord know there was a fire in the house she went up and gave the alarm my lord came down hastily to me i told him the upper part of the house was on fire my lord and i got the key of the first garret which was a place for all the lumber we saw the fire was in the barrack room where there were four beds for strange servants and when there were no strangers the place was shut up  when we came to the door the room was like an oven i opened the door and the flames burst out against me with such force that in two minutes it spread through all the other rooms my lord called lady crauford and her sisters and took the young lady her daughter out of bed and in twelve minutes the room where the child the nurse and the housekeeper lay was in flames  they lay in a room in the three pair of stairs at the further end of a long passage which was soon stopped by the progress of the flames my ladys sisters and all the maid servants lay on the same floor and as there was no engine nor water the noble house of kilburnie the ancient seat of the viscounts of garnock was burnt down to the ground  a message was sent to mr hamilton at bourtreehill and the family went to the rev malcolm browns house the minister of the parish mr hamilton came and made my lord an offer of bourtreehill to live in telling him that he himself would live at his house in air my lord accepted the offer and went to bourtreehill and remained there the servants apartments at kilburnie were altered for my lord to live in when he came a shooting or to do business with his factor mrs burn lived in the house with my lords son and dressed what he wanted when he came i was respected after the fire for being the means under god of preserving three families  in the month of may the family set out for inverary by glasgow and dumbarton they stopped at luss six weeks to drink goats whey and take pleasure on and round lochlomond and then went to the duke of argyles where they remained two days with the duke at his palace we went an airing to see his woods hills and cascades and a sailing on his salt and fresh water lakes  we left inverary and went to edinburgh to be at leith races in the harvest we went home to bourtreehill and soon after thismy lady was brought to bed of a son the lord viscount of garnock in the winter my lord went to london and my lady frequently went out on horseback but when her sister went with her she went in the carriage she never once went out the whole time i lived there either on horseback or in the carriage but i was with her if any person spoke against me to my lord or herself she told me who the person was because i saved her daughter lady jane from the flames she delighted in riding out and coursing a hare with the gray hounds my lord began to take a dislike to me for which i was very sorry  and my readers i cannot tell you for what soon after this in the harvest of      i gave my lord warning and was discharged the fifteenth of november being the term day and amelia came away with child at the same time i went to kilburnie and took a room near her mothers as she had a milch cow and plenty to give her i gave her six guineas and other things necessary i thought to marry her when i got a place i went to bargeny to get my ten pounds from mr hamilton  when i came to bargeny thomas hardy the english coachman had been drowned two weeks past one dark night coming from a public house he fell into a coalpit mr hamilton sent for a coachman to edinburgh and i drove lady anne till he came  about three weeks after this when i got my money i went and staid a week at kilburnie one day i went to the ministers house and desired the favor of him that when amelia was brought to bed he would be so good as to christen the child he promised he would and so he did so one of my fellow servants and i set off for edinburgh and amelia went a little way with us he asked her if she would like to have john macdonald for a husband she answered she would wait twenty years and then beg her bread with me for life  when we arrived in edinburgh i lodged at my sisters house all the winter she had been married some years the young man who accompanied me to edinburgh got a place and i put myself to hairdressing  when mr hamilton came to edinburgh on his way to london for he was in parliament he saw me and asked me if i had got a place i told him i had put myself to hairdressing  then jack call for me when i return from london i said i would i stuck close to the shop till may i lost no time i dressed the customers at home and abroad when mr hamilton came from london i called to see him he desired me to dress his hair and i pleased him very well he told me that james scott had taken the haughhill farm and was to leave him when he went he married the ladys maid so mr hamilton hired me for his own servant mr scott lived twelve years in his service and saved six hundred pounds near the end of may mr hamilton lady anne and miss duff set out for bargeny with the rest of the family in the year    0 i went with my postillion whip round my shoulders and now in the year    0 to the same house to be mr hamiltons body servant  i now set out on life without conduct or this worlds cunning i was a greater plague to my master and benefactor than one would think i did not know the value of good luck nor of money coming into two such plentiful families i thought the whole world was the garden of eden my master knew what was good for me but i had not the sense to take his advice gentlemen know the world better than we i was put out of my latitude by contrary winds i mean women mr and mrs scott went to their farm one mrs manderson took her place she was not there three months till she was discharged and sent back to edinburgh and an elderly woman was sent for to be housekeeper  the chambermaid spoke something about mrs manderson and me and lady anne said i would ruin my soul with her after this a report was spread about the chambermaid and me so the housekeeper always locked the rooms as she thought thereby to keep us from meeting as the general election was to come on next april this harvest was spent by mr hamilton in the shire of galloway that he might pay his respects to the gentlemen he took me the postillion and postchaise and the helper to take care of the horses we traveled thus through the whole shire making interest giving balls and feasts to the gentlemen and ladies at stranraer and wigton a pleasant time we had of it we returned home and in november went to edinburgh where lady anne lived all the winter but my master and i went post for london when the parliament broke up in march      my master and his brother sir hugh dalrymple returned to secure their election when they arrived in edinburgh they had a mind to go immediately to the country but the duke of douglas died which stopped them some time to get all things ready for the grandest burying that has been in great britain for a hundred years past  the procession took two days in going from edinburgh to douglas castle on this occasion there was the greatest feasting and drinking i ever saw there were about three hundred persons in carriages and on horseback with all the family honors all the company returned to hamilton and there dispersed mr hamilton and sir hugh returned to edinburgh and directly set out for bargeny  my master set off for galloway with the same servants as before our place of entertainment was at wigton the contest was great between the earl of galloways son the hon keith stuart and my master there was such riding back and forward and drinking for one month that was enough to kill the devil the election was gained by my master who gave a ball to the ladies and gentlemen and returned to bargeny in triumph i sent a letter to amelia burns and her son to come to bargeny she came and lodged at the publichouse two weeks she was much respected and the boy much admired six weeks after my master went to glasgow about business going through kilburnie parish he asked questions and said are these the walls of lord craufords house yes sir who perceived it first i did sir and alarmed the family about five in the morning have you not a child in this parish yes sir in that village before you well you may go and see him i shall ride gently on i went and saw amelia and the boy and having had something to drink went after my master it was only three miles to mr macdougals of castle semple where he was to dine and stay all night  when we came there and my master had his shoes on and his curls let out i had a horse from the groom and went back to amelia and staid three or four hours my master staid next day and i went back again  we went next to glasgow and then to edinburgh mr hamilton returned to air where lady anne met him and staid three or four days with his sister mrs duff  when they went home they took mrs innes with them that had been on a visit at mr duffs she was a widow lady daughter to sir andrew agnew whose husband when alive was very much in my masters interest in stranraer mrs innes wore a wig and for the headache had her head shaved three times a week without the least harm or evil thoughts on either side but the ladys maid told my lady that i went into mrs inness room very often before she came to breakfast  one night lady anne wrote her a card and sent it into her bedroom desiring her to make herself ready to return to air in the morning for at bargeny she should not sleep another night it quite surprised mrs innes and she asked the chambermaid if she knew the reason of this card being sent to her  madam i believe she thinks there is something between jack macdonald and you for lady anne turned off the housekeeper chambermaid and her own goddaughter when she thought there was any love between them and jack and you know madam the earl and countess of crauford have been parted almost a twelvemonth and i dare say you have heard for what very well betty give my respects to lady anne and i should wish to go off at six in the morning the chaise was ready and she went to air to mrs duffs to breakfast mrs duff said what made you come away before breakfast mrs innes she showed her lady annes card there is my warning for having john macdonald to shave my head the same as jack ever does to me when he comes to mr duffs mrs duff was extremely uneasy and said for gods sake dont speak of it to mr duff this is a fine return to me for mr inness friendship to mr hamilton at his election my master asked for mrs innes at dinner lady anne said she was gone to air to air said he without taking leave it made him a little uneasy for he thought that something was the matter after dinner he asked lady annes maid if she knew what mrs innes went away for in such a hurry she answered i dont know sir lady anne sent her a card but i did not know the contents who carried it to mrs innes she said the chambermaid send her to me  when she came he asked her if she knew for what mrs innes went away  sir i believe it was because john macdonald went into her chamber to shave her head  he turned round and said nothing but it turned my master against me as i soon discovered for next day a number of gentlemen met at girvan to play at the golf or cricket the gentlemen after dinner drank freely and my master was in liquor in the evening when we came all home to bargeny he asked me for one of the clubs that was not in the chaise with the rest i answered sir i suppose it is left at the inn with that he took one of the clubs and broke it in pieces over my back and said you damned scoundrel provide yourself with a place sir william maxwell mr kennedy and mr macculloch saw him strike me lady anne mrs duff miss duff two miss kennedys and miss crauford of ardmillan seeing my master a little confused and i not waiting at supper lady anne asked mr hamilton what was become of john macdonald but no answer sir william said i believe my lady he is not come yet from girvan after supper the ladies having heard what had passed were very sorry but they believed me to be innocent and so i really was i was called up next morning to dress mr hamilton  neither he nor i spoke a word about what had passed last night and i directly forgot all evil we set off for east lothian to see his estate and his friends on the journey he hired a servant of colonel dalrymple a servant of experience and mr hamilton made a man of him for in a few years he put him into one of the first inns in air  my master saw that i had no conduct and did not know the value of a good place  when we returned to bargeny some time after there was a race of horses at girvan  when mr hamilton came to mr stuarts inn where all the gentlemen went to dine he said to me as i was dressing his hair john i think the best thing you could do would be to marry jane stuart for by doing so you would soon make a fortune  sir i am obliged to you for your advice but i thought light of it and thought no more of it jane stuarts father and mother were dead and she had the inn to herself  next day i told mr scott whom i succeeded what mr hamilton said concerning jane stuart mr scott said he thought if you was to marry jane stuart he would have you then to go with him always when he went into the shire of galloway  about the beginning of november we set out for edinburgh on my masters way to london lady anne accompanied my master in a coach to hamilton there was one place of the road that was dangerous where the company commonly walked on foot my master walked on and lady annes servants went to carry her out of the dirty road into the footway she would not let them do this office but called me to carry her when we came to newmills near the earl of loudons house the inn where we stopped belonged to the earl of loudons head cook whose two daughters kept it he took no account of it himself half a year before this the mother bad died and the two girls were left alone we knew one another from children after dinner mr hamilton called jane robe her fathers name was robe into the other room and spoke something to her about half an hour after that the woman cook called for me into the garden and told me she heard i was going from mr hamiltons now said she as i have known you a long time if you will take my advice i will tell you how you may do yourself good all your life how said i by making love to miss robe and i am sure she will have you if you make love in a respectful manner i had no desire but i told her i would come back and make love in a few days when i had left my master i went in and called the two miss robes to drink a glass of wine with me that was the best chance i ever had in my life if i had embraced it we set off for edinburgh the day that my master was to set out for london to join the parliament my successor came to his place mr hamilton told him to go and order a postchaise and saddle horse at john bells his former coachman i shall go to rock vale my house in east lothian and to dunbar at night if you have any business to do in town come to dunbar any time this evening i shall take john macdonald with me all day and he can return with the chaise in the morning  when i returned to edinburgh in a day or two after i went to live with colonel skeene till the servant he had hired could come home at this time i visited a person that had lived fellow servant with me at bargeny he lived with mrs dalrymple wife to colonel dalrymple governor of guadaloupe the french governess was turned away on my account and afterward the housekeeper then a report went through edinburgh concerning me colonel skeene told me of it when his servant came home and desired me to go to london and get a place for no family here said the colonel will hire you for fear of their women and the servants in edinburgh said damn you macdonald i suppose when you was born you was thrown into a womans shift and that the women and you are still striving for it i went after the earl of aboynes service the lady asked my name they said if they wanted me they would send for me i went next to a mr campbell who being newly married refused me  i have often heard the ladies say as they were walking along the streets of edinburgh one to another is that him yes says another i always went very clean for i delighted in dress and powder my name was commonly the french macdonald when i went into mrs bells one day i told her what i heard the ladies say in the street  she said if you dont take care the women will be your ruin i said to her you have known me from the year    0 pray tell me what you think what makes the women take to me so johnny said mrs bell there is nothing in it further than this they think you have so good a temper and never hear you say an ill word and you are so obliging in your way for a disagreeable word will turn away the affections but you are always praising their beauty there was duke hamilton that married miss gunning he was very debauched in bad womens company but amongst ladies he was one of the politest and best behaved men in great britain and there is nothing that gains the affection of women so soon as to be always obliging to them  i thought i should never get a place but montgomery the hair dresser told me to go to major joass facing the trone church he wants a servant make use of my name as he spoke to me i went to the major in the morning  sir i hear you want a servant  yes i do after several questions he hired me he asked me who would give me a character sir i believe mr charles dalrymple brother to mr hamilton of bargeny  very well call on me tomorrow when i came the major said i shall take you for my servant for you must live with a single gentleman no family will admit you into their house i like a man that is given to women  that is gentlemanlike  but to drink and swear is to be a blackguard i entered my service next day to the best of masters  at the house where we lodged there was a pretty girl called kitty hamilton there was no other person in the house her mistress lived at another house where gentlemen lodged we breakfasted and drank tea in the afternoon together every day she told me this gentleman and the other offered her one guinea another two another five i said to her this reminds me of a circumstance where i was born a young man loved a girl he said i should be glad to go to bed with you my dear jenny she said you fool why did you ask me such a thing i said kitty in place of asking he should have put her to bed without asking she said that is the best way of doing one day after a chaise was ordered for the major to go to mr abercrombies of tullibodies when he said john call for me in the chaise at balfours coffeehouse near the cross at such a time for i shall sleep at tullibodies tonight the house of tullibodie was near alloa in the neighborhood of stirling about thirty miles off  when i was going i said kitty good bye and gave her a kiss at that time she was making the bed where i lay in a room that had no light but from the passage i said we shall be back in three days i laid her on the bed and began toying with her  she screamed out at that instant a woman and two men were coming down the stairs they all came in and said sir are you going to ravish the young woman i was very much afraid when they surrounded me and were going to take me into custody the one said to the other go and call the guard soldiers and take him but the woman said you had better not be in such haste ask the young woman the particulars pray young woman did this gentleman offer to affront you no sir quite the reverse i just received a letter from the country of the death of my mother which put me into fits and john only took hold of me that i should not hurt myself  very well young woman all is well and sir we beg you a thousand pardons and will treat you with any thing to drink but i said no gentlemen i forgive and shall treat you i brought two bottles of old port and we drank them i went after my master the major in the chaise to tullibodie one day at dinner one of the housemaids said ever since the major came here our young ladies lock themselves in their rooms is it for fear of the major or his man it went round the table as a joke we returned to our lodging in edinburgh and after staying a month set off for london in the year      and remained till the beginning of june when we set off for chester and then through wales to holyhead  my master was much delighted with the country and the fine weather the major traveled very slowly and every place we came to he had the harp played to him at holywell we staid one day at connoway we staid two and by a contrary wind we were detained at holyhead one week  we set sail in the packet for dublin and landed at dunlary in company with several gentlemen we all breakfasted there we hired two hackney coaches to bring the company to town and a cart for the luggage  the gentlemen came out and went into the coaches but the coachman of the first coach where the major was seated was not in the way my master said john get on the box and drive on i did so by and by dunnie patrick got on the second coach and they directed me which way to go for the four miles when we drove through dublin along essex bridge near the hotel the coach i drove broke down and dunnie patrick came up in such a fright but he saw it was not my fault the gentlemen crawled out of the upper window and said it is johns fault  another why did john drive but the major said damn it how can it be johns fault dont you see the two side braces are broken dunnie patrick said upon my soul i forgive all your honors the two side braces upon the very one side are both broke and is it not a wonder now that the two braces on the other side did not break first and the devil burn the harness maker for they are both old and rotten  we walked up to the hotel and as it was sunday staid all day next day we went to lodge in margaretstreet at a cabinet makers the mistress of the house was a londoner the master and mistress were both civil and i was very happy for my master dressed after breakfast i seldom saw him any more till night he was amongst his old friends for he had lived sixteen years in ireland in the scotch royals and in colonel bagshaws regiment he was the best of masters i very often walked about dublin one of the pleasantest places in europe the major had very often tickets that he did not make use of so he gave them to me and i being out of livery could go to smockalley the royal playhouse the garden and marlboroughgreen when it was wet i employed my time in reading books and perusing maps of which the major had a great many he entrusted me to measure the distance of one place from another by the scale my master had always plenty of fine tea of which i drank some in the afternoon and with which i treated the maid and the maid also at the next house where a gentleman lived who had a natural daughter the maid brought her in to see the books and maps with which she was much delighted i asked her to drink tea and as i behaved civilly and appeared genteel she drank tea and went out a walking with me and to smockalley and the royal playhouse the two maids were very well pleased to see her go out with me  next day the major went to lodge where he had lodged before in a very pleasant situation at the corner of keppelstreet we could lie in our beds and see the people walk along essex bridge our landlord was a mr henderson who kept a seed shop he was a scotchman and was very fond of me i cut the childrens hair the mistress let the two little boys and the two little girls walk out with me mr henderson told me he had a large seed garden near bloodybridge and that if i chose i might walk there with the children as it amused me i went with them there was the greatest plenty that a garden could produce it was all for seed nothing was sold or used but what he had in his own house i brought nothing away in my pockets but cucumbers and onions  it was always in the afternoon that we went and as i had the children in company i went boldly to margaretstreet to ask miss edgworth to go with us she was glad of the opportunity for she ate what fruit she pleased and we brought her to her own door which was on our way when the major dined in the country i went with him to many seats the earl of rothess mr connolys and many other houses  i thought myself in paradise there is such living and the irish servants are such hearty fellows they looked upon me as one of their own country being of the name of macdonald for that is a great name in ireland  when my master and mr lowrie chaplain to the royal scots and we two servants left dublin we traveled in two chaises and our baggage went by sea it is needless to mention any little village we stopped at we stopped all night at lusk and next night at duleek and passed through a fine country as a man could wish to see duleek was out of the highroad but my master wanted to take leave of his old friends as he had been so long in ireland and did not expect to come back again  next day we crossed the water of boyne and dined at drogheda major joass showed me where the battle was fought and the stone where king williams royal standard was set up at night we stopped at dunleer a pleasant town next night we stopped at dundalk next day we passed by newry mountains formerly famous for robers we stopped all night at the pleasant town of newry and next night at banbridge we dined next day at hilsborough as it was a fair day and a great deal of merrymaking the major stopped all night amongst his friends in the morning we set out for belfast where we stopped all night one of the pleasantest towns in ireland at the head of the lake of carrickfergus next day we went to donaghadee from whence we were to take our passage for scotland we waited one day for the vessel i went a walking by the seaside to look at the beauty of the country i said to myself what can be the reason that noblemen and gentlemen dont come to see the three kingdoms before they go on their travels and become acquainted with their own country before they go abroad it would be of service to their education and their future experience we landed at portpatrick in the shire of galway after a passage of twentyfour hours  we breakfasted there and went to dinner at the borough of stranraer where i had my freedom when living with mr hamilton and where almost all the children knew me in the afternoon we went along the seaside and across the hills eighteen miles to the town of ballantree the whole of which belonged to mr hamilton next day we went to girvan fourteen miles distant and dined at the inn belonging to jane stuart after dinner as we were looking out of the window dennis oflaghan mr lowries servant asked me pray now john is this hill in the sea is this now the very hill we left at port patrick yes said i dennis that is the island of ailsa devil take me said dennis but that hill has traveled as fast as we have done for these two days what made him think so was that the land came partly round the island  at night we stayed at daily a village near bargeny where i formerly went to school in the morning before breakfast as we were preparing to go away mr charles dalrymple as he was riding to the mineral waters near this place saw the major and me he was the gentleman that gave the major my character he said major is it possible to see you here it is said the major they breakfasted together and mr dalrymple took the major to dine with him at bargeny so i saw the place once more and the people and mr hamilton ordered me a bowl of punch after dinner at night we arrived in air at mr duffs for mr duff was a relation of the majors from air we set out for stirling through glasgow about the end of august the major took the command in the castle of stirling he had a fine house in the castle well furnished and plenty of liquor his aunt in edinburgh hired two elderly servants a cook and a housekeeper the major made one of the soldiers footman and groom and employed another to clean knives and assist in the house so we began housekeeping the gentlemen round stirling came to see the major as he was coming to settle amongst them and asked him to come and see them at their houses the major gave the gentlemen and ladies in stirlingshire a ball and supper in the town of stirling in the morning when we came home he said john which of the ladies took your fancy miss fairly sir  i will be damned but that is the one i took notice of and he laughed heartily for he was of that free and merry turn i never knew him angry in my life often after he was in bed he would make me stand half an hour speaking about things after i had got the candle in my hand to go out of the room after this colonel masterton gave another great ball all we servants that waited had a card hung at our bosom for that is the custom in scotland  we went to edinburgh sometimes for six weeks together and at other times to gentlemens houses a pleasant life we had when he was going to edinburgh oftentimes a gentleman would want to go in the chaise with him and offer to pay halfprice but he always determined to go sooner or later than the time proposed when he came home he would tell me such a one was desirous of accompanying him but he would not consent as he was determined at all times to be master of the carriage in which he traveled i always rode in the chaise with him  when the major had company in the castle after breakfast was over and he was dressed i usually put on a waistcoat with sleeves with a white apron and cooks knife stuck before me thus equipped i would go into the parlour to ask the major what he would please to have for dinner the dinner he wanted was ordered and i appeared at dinner at the sidetable the gentlemen said major i never knew a servant like yours you must certainly give him great wages that i do indeed i give him great wages  what country is he of major he is one of the macdonalds of invernessshire  the housekeeper was one of the best common cooks in scotland and she was up to the gossip in the parlour for the gentlemen thought i was the cook she and i were upon very good terms and if she had now and then a glass of good old port and some fine tea in the afternoon all was well  and that we had but every thing in time has an end for the major was courting miss abercromby of tullibodie whom he afterward married i told the major sir i hear you are going to be married to miss abercromby and sir servants that live with single gentlemen are not good family servants so sir if you please to get a servant by the fifteenth day of may and i shall go a little further he was sorry to take my warning but reason bore the sway he was reconciled at last and hired a servant in the country  at the time appointed i was paid off and came to edinburgh near the end of may      i took my passage in a ship for london and left all my friends behind me when i had been a week in london i met the irish chairman that carried mr hamilton and major joass when in london i said to him do you hear of any place for me by g  d johnny i do go to major libbelier he lodges at a hairdressers in lower grosvenorstreet go to him johnny early tomorrow morning  i went  the maid told him i was below  call him up  well sir what are your commands were you ever in ireland look to my recommendations  he read them and said i know colonel skene and major joass in particular then you have been through ireland  i have sir  very well i will give you fourteen shillings a week and if i go to ireland i will give you sixpence more a day on the road  sir i agree  i dressed him and he was pleased he called the maid and said to her you must make a bed for john and i shall account for it  and john you will call me every morning at seven oclock for i go out at nine sir do you want any thing more of me today no i came home at night and said to the maid shall i sit up for the major she said there is no occasion he comes home before we go to bed and all he wants is to light his candle he is a very sober gentleman so i served him two hours each day he paid me my money every week about the end of june we set out in a chaise for chester in our way to dublin the major hired horses through wales to holyhead and we soon had our passage for dublin where i saw all my old friends i had all the day to myself as in london the major was a polite man if he met me in the streets of dublin and i lifted my hat he returned it but no more one thing i can say i never served him with a breakfast dinner or supper all the time i lived with him when major libbelier was on the road he sent me from his table what he left and of every bottle of wine he sent me a tumbler glass full near the end of august he discharged me having no further occasion for a servant after he returned from dublin  next week i called at mr lamares in hollesstreet cavendishsquare for daniel douglas who lived fellow servants with me at bargeny i told him i had left major libbelier he said i wish you had been here yesterday for the basketwoman told us of a place but said he to the cook if master john will wait a little the woman will be here from the butchers presently when she came she told me to enquire for major deibbiege at mr sandbys he wanted a servant i went and was hired he gave me a livery he was just come out of scotland and had married a scotch lady miss seton sir henry setons sister soon after my master made the tour of norfolk to see his relations he went to newmarket races swaffham races and assembly raynham hall holkham hall houghton hall norwich lynn and many other places in the county from the singularity of my livery they asked me if my master was not an ambassador i told them he was an american scalp  when we had seen all the places about norfolk we returned to london i lived with the major till after christmas he was not going to have a carriage and as i did not like a family so well i gave warning  in march      i heard of a place in aldermanbury and went after it two single gentlemen mr ferguson brother to sir adam ferguson and mr creighton lived together many others came after this place as well as me but as mr ferguson was born in the parish where i lived when i was at bargeny and by that had a little knowledge of me i had the preference i was hired for twenty guineas a year and two suits of clothes they told me they did not want me to wear a livery i went to their tailor and was measured for one of fustian to do my work in and another of blue yorkshire cloth i did not want to be fine i wanted to be like a servant the gentlemen were pleased with what i ordered when they saw them as mr hamilton was in london he gave me a character i entered home liked my place and was very capable of it i was part of every thing there i marketed kept the book and had the keys of every thing in the house i was steward valet butler housekeeper headcook and footman i taught the maid to dress the scotch dishes when she wanted assistance she had her sister a married woman to help her and i paid her as a chairwoman we went on very well and had always the sunday to ourselves mr andrew grant of broadstreet had a house at hornsey the two gentlemen went there on saturday night and returned on monday morning when it was my sunday to go out the maid had her sister with her we were very careful we had always tea and sugar allowed us when i was at home i had sometimes one or another that came to see me this went on near a year and i was determined to take more care of myself than i had done thinking on what was past and i made a vow to this purpose but no man can foresee what is to come as i was going to bed the maids room and bed facing the stairs as i came up she in bed and the candle burning i could see her at different times uncovered i went to bed once or twice and took no notice but one night the candle was very near the bed and she nearly all uncovered very tempting to a man for she was a pretty young girl i spoke to her and told her the danger of leaving a candle burning and falling asleep so i put it out and came away from that time she could never bear to see me a few weeks after on a saturday night the gentlemen told me they were to sleep at mr bogles in lovelane and that i should bring linen and dress them by eight in the morning because they were to dine at richmond i got up at seven which was rather soon to go to the gentlemen i therefore took the key of the door and went over to the publichouse to have something to drink i had enough at home but i did not care a farthing for it as there was no company near eight i came home the door was bolted susan went to bed again she wanted to make me disappoint my masters i knocked and alarmed the street till near eleven i got in but said nothing i went to the gentlemen and as god would have it they were late up and did not want to dress till after breakfast when i came home the maids sister was come as it was my day to go out i told her how susan had served me in the morning she was very sorry as i was so good a friend to them we had many words and she struck me on the face this so enraged me that i kicked her backside and there was great confusion i dressed myself and went out for the day next morning she told mr ferguson what i had done how i gave the wine in the kitchen to people and that when i made the scotch soup if it was not made use of i warmed it up next day if they dined at home and charged it again my master told mr creighton and after they were dressed i was called up into the office my two masters were there and the two clerks mr ferguson said john susan tells me strange things of you which i am sorry to hear she says you struck her  yes but she struck me first  call her in  i did  well susan did john strike you  yes and if he stays in the house i will not  i said sir if you please i will tell you all on saturday night you told me to bring a change of linen to mr bogles and dress you both by eight in the morning i got up at seven took the key of the street door in my pocket and went to the publichouse to have some drink when i came back the door was bolted i knocked and walked there till eleven oclock then susan let me in i got the things and dressed you both yesterday when i came back from mr bogles i told her sister how she had served me she was so ashamed that she struck me on the face which enraged me so that i gave her two or three kicks on the backside  susan is this true  yes sir but he told my sister lies of me  very well susan  but my master added she said you gave the wine away in the kitchen  sir certainly i have given a glass of wine to susan and her sister and her sisters husband and to several noblemens and gentlemens servants out of a decanter but oftener to her sister and brother than any other therefore sir she is a wicked girl and ungrateful her brotherinlaw is footman to a gentleman  mr creighton who was afterward sheriff of london said as to giving a glass of wine away as you are a winemerchant charles i dont think much of it  but mr ferguson said here is something worse than all that she tells me when the soups are left untouched you warm them up the next day and send them up to table what did you do that for to make me pay for it twice  no sir you are mistaken and if you turn me away and hurt my character i leave you to god and your own conscience  he said explain yourself  sir in cold weather soup or barley broth is just as good the second day as the first oftentimes sir when you were both dressed you told me you both dined at home but did not know of any company many times however you have brought home from change two or three gentlemen to dinner then you would tell me to get more you know sir i always had cold sirloin of beef or haunchbone or buttock and you had something of fish or of fowl now the soup that was made the day before saved us from the trouble of going for any thing else sir that is all the view i had in it not to have to go out  bring me your book said my master and the butchers bills and i shall speak to you both by and by they both examined the book and the bills but could find nothing against me we were called in again susan was told that they could find nothing concerning what she said of the soups  so you may provide yourself with another place for as you cannot agree any longer it is best to part she went and a cunning devil came after her i believe the two were acquainted for they met very often together the new maid had a sweetheart a porter in a shop though she cared no more for him than for my old shoes she asked me to give them a glass of wine for she knew the other had wine often but i would not i told colonel roys butler how susan had served me he said what can you do never give a glass of wine to any person if any one comes to see you treat them with a pot of porter or two but always take care of your trust for if you do not the first time you have words they will tell of you so i went by his advice i had to teach her to dress the scotch dishes one night i went to see mr bogles servants the butler and footboy said mr john the gentlemen were speaking about you last night mr ferguson said mr hamilton turned away my poor john for fear of his wife mr john did you live at bargeny  yes i did  then we understand for mr hamilton and lady anne are parted  that is not my fault said i  a few nights after captain hamilton was at supper with mr ferguson and the discourse turned about lady anne the captain asked what was the reason was she blamed with taking up with any person as i was going out of the room my master said with him first  what with your servant  yes  the captain said damn it it is a pity those things are ever known did he live there  he was brought up in the family  i was sorry to bear the blame and innocent at the same time  next our maid began her schemes one night before bedtime she was taken very ill and as i thought fainted away i got her something to drink and she came to herself she was so weak that she could not walk to bed i was obliged to carry her when we came there she could not undress herself i was obliged to undress her and to take off her stockings  dear how bad i am master john  i am very sorry for you ellie  pray put some water by my bed side before you lie down i did and went to bed another night she behaved in the same manner i was proof against her nor indeed did i understand her till afterward for i had not the craft of many from this day she became my enemy what a terrible thing is lust how terrible when disappointed  one day the gentlemen dined at mr grants in broadstreet i went to the st jamess end of the town with mr duffs servant we called at different houses and drank several liquors which got the better of my head hugh gibson came home with me and bad me good night i went down to the kitchen and sat down in a chair the heat of the fire made me sick i puked and fell asleep ellie shut the kitchen door so that i could not hear the street door knock she went to the next house and sat with the maid she expected my master home in the evening to write and so he did come and knocked several times but i did not hear him then she came to the door and told my master she left me at home with mr duffs servant she took mr ferguson to the kitchen to see me as i was fast asleep now sir you see how your wine lies on the hearth he said nothing but went up to the office when i went to put him to bed he said john i see how you behave a person i put so much confidence in and to use me so  sir i beg your pardon i went to the other end of the town and drank different liquors which got the better of me and mr duffs man came home with me and i fell asleep by the fire and i became very sick  did not you get drunk at home  no sir i drank nothing at home but part of a pot of beer when hugh gibson came home with me  i can hardly believe you  i do assure you sir it is true my master went next day to mr duffs servant to know the rights of it and as i spoke so he found it so this passed over  soon after there were ladies and gentlemen dined at our house i gave ellie a bottle of wine for herself she drank some wine and porter and by noon got drunk the chairwoman said mrs cook the pot boils will you skim the pot ellie was going to wash her hands and having the soap in her hands she lifted off the lid and went to skim the pot the soap fell in the pot i took it out with the ladle it was the queen of scots soup she was making if it had been spoiled i should have been blamed and if it was good i should have had praise  the queen of scots soup is made in manner following six chickens are cut in small pieces with the heart gizzard and liver well washed and then put into a stewpan and just covered with water and boiled till the chickens are enough season it with salt and cayenne pepper and mince parsley with eight eggs yolks and whites beat up together stir round all together just as you are going to serve it up half a minute will boil the eggs  by the time dinner was sent in ellie sat down in a chair and being overcome by the heat of the fire fell fast asleep and was as bad as i had been some time before so ever after we never did agree now it was reported that mr ferguson was going to be married to miss fordyce mr andrew grants ladys sister and so he was some time after i went to mr grants one day to see the servants the housekeeper mrs gordon asked me if i did not live with the earl of crauford and mr hamilton of bargeny i said yes are they not both parted from their ladies i said yes  little did i know what was brewing  the maid began to dress away some mornings she would not have a shilling to buy sugar or tea but would borrow from me at night she would go out and come home with gold and silver in her pocket one day we had words and i told her i did not think she got her money honestly she went crying to mr creighton and told him that i said she went out of nights along with him he told mr ferguson they were both very angry and i got warning but afterward she lived with him and had children by him the first time i saw mr grants footman he said john i hear you are going away  yes said i on ellies account  not altogether for that master john the ladies say you are not a proper person to live where there are married people  when my time was up i was discharged and soon after i was hired to a gentleman in the city just married who knew my master when i went for my answer he told me he was sorry he could not take me as a relation had recommended a servant to him and he could not be off taking him so i lost that place and was out of service till i had spent all my money to the last five and threepence at last a hairdresser sent me after a place to be butler and dress hair with a gentleman in kent and to wear a livery the gentleman went after my character i went for my answer he said i went to enquire about you and your master did not give you a very good character but i will take you by your looks i went home and liked my place well i dressed my master and his lady my master kept the best house in england he was a powdermerchant for the army there were three more servants in livery by the time i was half a year there the housekeeper raised a report that i had taken up with the chambermaid in the country house  we jaunted round the country a good deal in essex kent and hampshire one day in town my mistress desired the housekeeper to send me up stairs as she was going to send me out to buy something for her i asked her which room my mistress was in she said the bedchamber i asked her if i was to go there yes said she you are welcome enough there i was much alarmed to hear her say so if any of the maids said or spoke any thing that displeased my mistress she came and told me of it one day at the country house something was forgot for dinner i took the blame on myself my master spoke to my mistress of it soon after and she took the blame on herself he said god damn you both am i to be disappointed in this manner between you both such expressions i was sorry to hear i thought of what was past and i would rather have suffered death than to have been the cause of disturbance for i had a great regard for my master and mistress so i gave warning to get out of it one day in the town house the cookmaid said mr john my mistress dont know what to do because you are going away she has not dressed herself these three weeks i was very sorry to hear all this it very much hurt my spirits and i came away very heavy hearted  next i went to live with a mr campbell for the time he was to be in london to take care of his things and dress him his brother mr campbell of shawfield lodged in the same house and his footman was taken very ill he desired his valet to ask me if i would go to the house of commons behind his carriage and to put on the livery greatcoat i told him i would with all my heart when my master was dressed in the morning and his things put away he wanted no more of me for the day i waited on them at breakfast and very often at dinner i lived well if they dined in the country i went with them i was never happier in my own mind before my master went away he bought two horses and i got two guineas by that i lived with mr campbell till he left london he went in his way to scotland by oxford and lancaster and made several excursions that he might learn the modes of farming  the week after his departure i went after a place in st jamessstreet at a gentlemans just come from paris one of the gayest young gentlemen and the greatest gambler that every belonged to scotland though he had often said he never would have a scotch servant nor employ a scotch tradesman john crauford esquire of errol i met him in the passage as he was going to his chair i told him that i heard he wanted a servant who did you live with last i told him he agreed with me for sixteen guineas a year and half a guinea a week and said come in the morning he desired his valet to give directions to mr bocquet the tailor and he measured me for two suits of clothes directly when i got the livery he rung the bell for me and gave me twelve pair of silk stockings in a parcel to wear and said i like my servants to go genteelly a few days after he asked my name i told him john macdonald  what country  i said from the highlands of scotland  very well  it was now the summer we lived in london and jaunted up and down the country till the winter and then he remained in london but being poorly in his health he went to bath in the spring of the year for two months then came to london for some time and then returned to bath again doctor turton thought it most advisable for him to go to the german spa at bath he had words with his valet about the bills the valet said to my master you get worse and worse so he gave him warning when he came to london he parted with the englishman and lord beauchamp recommended him an italian a very good fellow whose name was henry we set off for dover and passed over to calais my master took his own chaise with him which i took care of to clean and grease when we left calais my master asked me if i could make any broth as i had boiled him a chicken or a rabbit with lemon sauce when he did not dine out in london i told him eight or nine different soups which i described but he preferred the queen of scots soup because it being the month of may eggs chickens and parsley were easy to be had so i commonly made him a little of the queens soup which he liked very well we went post at the stage before we came to lisle we slept all night and went away in the morning and forgot my masters little trunk with his money and papers when we had come three miles my master asked me for the trunk i said it must be left behind he desired me to go back for it but the french horse would not leave the chaise for me i told my master that if he would send the postillion back i would drive the chaise and four horses to lisle which he did i drove the four stallions the other ten miles the postillion did not come up to us for an hour after we arrived in lisle i drove so fast that the people in lisle were surprised to see an englishman driving the king of frances posthorses we went on and when we arrived in ghent the people there were making ready for a grand jubilee which had been preparing for half a year the procession was to take place in three days the duchess of northumberland was there and many other english and people from all nations in europe to see this grand sight the duchess and my master went to see all the preparations and all the churches when ornamented the beauty of the procession was beyond description and a grand ball was given every night with two bands of music so that it never stopped we left ghent and the next place we stopped at for a few days was brussels one of the finest cities in europe there were a great many english there i went to see prince charless stables and his guards and i was surprised to find how many english scotch irish and welsh were in his light horse his guards at brussels there are the finest churches in the world from this place we came to liege a fine large city here we remained all night and next day set out for the spa about twentyfive miles distant at the halfway house my master went into the parlour and ordered dinner and we servants remained in the kitchen soon after a dutch gentleman his lady and daughter came to the inn they went in with our master to dinner and we sat at dinner in the kitchen with their dutch footman in a coarse livery and a large dutch hat he would not sit with us nor take off his hat but cut some of the meat and put on his bread and went into the parlour and eat it and kept speaking to his master and the ladies with his large hat on his head about the roads the postillions and the country when his meat was done he came out for another slice and then went in again henry and i laughed till we were like to split our sides to think our master was dining with the footman for mr crauford was so proud that he would not let a servant ride in the chaise with him but would rather be at the expense of a horse the gentleman in the parlour was in full dress in black silk clothes and wore a dress hat under his arm his lady was in a ridingdress and the daughter one of thefinest young ladies i ever saw in a ridingdress most richly trimmed with silver they seemed as much pleased with their footmans behavior as if he had been a prince we all set off for the german spa where we arrived in the evening there was prince ferdinand here and a great deal of company the duke of roxburgh mr smith and our master kept house together at spa for two months there is company at this place from all countries in europe in the season no gentleman is allowed to wear a sword at spa by the prince of lieges orders who sends part of his guards there in the season to preserve the peace the company spend their time in drinking the water riding out walking on the walks feasting with one another playing at cards in public balls etc a merry place much like bath in england for the amusements  when two months were over my master set out for aix la chapelle about thirty miles distant we dined half way at a large town called veviers several plays were acting in the streets and many other sports were going on my master walked out to see them we left veviers and stopped at the next inn between that place and aix la chapelle all night there was a great deal of company in the house but the best room was not engaged my master was let in there he being an english gentleman and supper was ordered half an hour after this a flemish lady and her maid arrived in a chaise she begged to lodge there all night she was told the rooms were all full she said she would make any shift if there was an empty bed the landlady said they were all taken up where such a lady as she could sleep but one which was very good in the closet of the english gentlemans room  then give madame blonds compliments to the english gentleman and that i desire the favor he will let me sit in the room with him till bedtime she was going from the empresss dominions into france he was very complaisant and she came up stairs into the room with all the politeness in the world she said she should be glad to sit in his room as all the apartments were engaged he said she was extremely welcome and he desired me to dress some of the queen of scots soup if i could get chickens eggs and parsley i said i could as for cayenne pepper i always had it with me they went to cards till supper was brought in the lady liked the soup much she asked if i was the cousinier my master said yes and i never lost the name of cousinier till i came back to england for i was mostly every day dressing one thing or other after supper her maid and the housemaid made the bed in the closet ready my master politely said to her madam blond if you like you may have this bed as it will hold yourself and maid and i will sleep in the closet she said by no means i am extremely obliged to you for the privilege of the little bed come madam we will play at cards for the large bed they did so and she lost when the maid came to put her to bed she gave her maid strict charge to bolt the closet door madam blond spoke to my master in french the whole evening she bade him good night and desired the maid again to be sure to bolt the door for the bolt was in my masters room next day madam blond went to spa and mr crauford to aix la chapelle where we remained one month at the hotel of madam buches the ballroom was in the same hotel there was a ball three times a week at dinner every day there was company of all nations in europe my master jaunted all round aix la chapelle to different places a pleasant country as can be and the merriest on sunday in the world in the publichouses dancing and fiddling in the field football and shooting at marks with bows and arrows the shepherd boys meet in the evenings together and play on the german flute which makes it very agreeable as you are riding along the road when my master left aix la chapelle he set off for liege in company with count odenonde with his own saddlehorses and groom john pratt whose brother lived with earl spencer and henry and i followed in the chaise we were two nights at liege from this place we went to brussels in the same manner and remained there one week my master sent home his groom and horses to england and he went to paris at the next stage from brussels there were only three horses at home in the room of four for the chaise only two there being so many passengers on the road henry had one to go on and the postmaster was obliged to drive my master himself with the two horses my master took me in the chaise with himself though he never did such a thing before i said nothing but by and by he asked me some questions then i went on and answered him in many things that he asked me i was so well acquainted with major joasss history and his maps and what instructions he gave me in them that i entertained him a great deal next stage he ordered me a horse for he thought it beneath him that i should ride in the chaise with him i rode on two stages and then he took me in again for another stage he saw i did not intrude to speak till he began himself what he asked me i answered he ordered me a horse again for two stages again i went in the chaise the whole way to paris i gave him an historical account of the families of ireland scotland and wales and a description of the country which i was enabled to do from history and experience in traveling i gave him an account of his own family for five hundred years back i said sir it would be of great service to young gentlemen before they go abroad to make the tour of great britain and ireland and there they would see the seats of heroes and learn many things particularly among the people of scotland ireland and wales whose disposition it is to respect former things and learn their history without trouble sir they are the most rural countries in the world and the best supplied with fish and wild fowl and they give you a view of mountains lakes valleys hills and rivers and to travel through those countries is the best thing a young gentleman can do to lay the foundation of experience by knowing his own country before he goes abroad for the people of those three countries speak about religion and respect the characters of great men but here you will hear of nothing but eating and dress and plays and operas all wickedness is tolerated and the sunday is not regarded the english often take up with mens wives and when the same measure is returned to them they dont like it but in italy and france those things are not so much taken notice of  my master said i would make a good presbyterian parson  in seven days we arrived at paris and put up at the hotel de parc royal we lodged on the same floor with the princess of poniatouski and her sister a countess they both visited my master often we remained in paris three months my master had a coachman chariot and a french footman he did not take me behind the carriage but i got a french master the same as i had at the german spa i lost no time to improve myself my master gave me a suit of french clothes hardly to be known as a livery so i became entirely the frenchman i dressed with my silk bag every day and still retained the name of coufinier for i dressed one soup or other every day and if he dined out if it was not far off i took it to him  one day he had the duc de lauzun count lauragay count oudenard earl of march earl of carlisle the earl of seaforth charles fox esquire george selwyn esquire the princess and her sister my master had always his dinner from the hotel de bourbon but i dressed the queen of scots soup to perfection it pleased the company so well both french and english that my master next day gave me two louis dors i made different sorts of scots soup in place of barley i put rice and made it very strong of the meat well seasoned with herbs and cayenne pepper i called it soup dangleterre i taught the duc de lauzuns cook to make it the gentlemen made parties to versailles chantilly and st cleod and my master treated mr henry and me to all the playhouses and operas in paris i was commonly in the evening to wait in the way if my master should come home to tea the princess had a housemaid a pretty polish girl to assist her waitingmaid as she was obliged to be at home i had her company often to drink tea with me and to walk out when time would permit  in the month of january      we set off for london we stopped for some time at almacks house in pall mall my master afterward took sir james grays house in cliffordstreet who was going ambassador to spain he now began housekeeping hired a french cook a housemaid and kitchenmaid and kept a great deal of the best company my master and henry had words and the valet had warning to provide for himself about this time mr stern the celebrated author was taken ill at the silkbag shop in old bondstreet he was sometimes called tristram shandy and sometimes yorick a very great favorite of the gentlemens one day my master had company to dinner who were speaking about him the duke of roxburgh the earl of march the earl of ossory the duke of grafton mr garrick mr hume and a mr james john said my master go and enquire how mr stern is today i went returned and said i went to mr sternes lodging the mistress opened the door i enquired how he did she told me to go up to the nurse i went into the room and he was just a dying i waited ten minutes but in five he said  now it is come he put up his hand as if to stop a blow and died in a minute the gentlemen were all very sorry and lamented him very much  when henry was about going my master had a servant recommended to him by a particular friend when i saw him and found he was hired to be the valet i was surprised that one who had no experience and was much inferior to myself was preferred before me i was very angry and told my master so he said he is strongly recommended to me so i gave my master warning what is to be must be i had farther to go than stop in london my master had now a footman recommended by colonel campbell of argylestreet one of the most accomplished servants in london he spoke french and could dress hair in perfection his name was samuel cairncross afterward valet to mr seton the earl of panmure and earl of dunmore had he been valet i would have kept my place so i left mr crawford with two scotch servants though before i lived with him he said he never would have a scotch servant or a scotch tradesman after this the people said that i brought the scots into favor  i went and lived with mr la motte the hairdresser in rupertstreet for four months to bring my hand into hairdressing again for i was out of practice one day william boyd servant to david hume esquire met me and said i know of an excellent place for you as you dress hair so well i know you will get the place the gentleman i have in my eye has been in england five months and he had a servant a countryman of ours who has behaved extremely ill he is with my master almost every day and he has been in the kingdom of bengal these fourteen years his name is colonel dow he was at mrs elliots yesterday and i heard him ask her if she knew of a good servant for james said he has used me very ill mr hume lodged at mrs elliots in brewerstreet goldensquare go said boyd tomorrow morning and enquire for colonel dow and tell him i sent you after his place i attended in the morning and went into the parlour there was the colonel and james macpherson esquire they kept house together they asked me some questions mr macpherson knew my former masters so i was hired at seventeen guineas a year and a livery the colonel said you may dress me this morning and stay till afternoon after i had dressed his hair he gave me two guineas and said that is to buy tea for yourself i give the maids the same as for the boy what we leave will do for him and i shall give you my old clothes if you please me there was in the colonels house the greatest plenty things went on very well and i had many things given me  the king of denmark about this time gave his masquerade in the operahouse i dressed the colonel and mr macpherson as two turks the king and queen were there that night in private my master spent so much money on women that i was tired of waiting on them though if many an hungry fellow had had my place they would have taken care of it if there had been a thousand ladies i gave warning merely on that account my master hired a servant from mr adams the architect a highlander the colonel went after his character mr adams gave him a good one he said he is a clean genteel good honest servant but sometimes he will get in liquor and he is given to women  damn him i like him the better for that well answered mr adam he will just answer your purpose  mr macpherson knowing me and whom i had lived with recommended me to the honorable keith stewart brother to the earl of galloway who sent his valet to find me out he had taken a house in piccadilly and was going to set up a carriage he wanted a fervant in livery to dress him and go out with a visavis i went to him and was hired and as soon as the colonels servant came home i went to mr stewart we had a fine visavis and as fine horses as any in town our livery was the genteelest in london richly trimmed with silver and the coachman and grooms turned out as clean as any servants in london mr stewart was as good a master as any in london if a servant was in fault when he told him of it it was only told as advice he was a great hunter and a great gambler and as accomplished as any gentleman in europe he spoke latin italian and french he belonged to pinksley hunt we were there very often and in northampton and at mr knightleys at foasley the earl of galloway and mr nightley were married to two sisters sir james dashwoods daughters it was the pleasantest life in the world to live with him he never was long in london at one time but from one hunt to another there was not a servant in a hundred that could have endured the fatigue of his service his hours of coming home were from two to seven in the morning i have had the chaise at the door many a time by six in the morning to go to a hunt before he had come home when he came at last he would go up stairs take off his bag change his dress clothes and go into the chaise wherever the hunt was he went sometimes fourscore miles sometimes i have come seventy or eighty miles by myself in the chaise to london and my master with another gentleman in his chaise we went to oxfordshire to blenheim to lord foleys lord thanets stow in the hole cheltenham in gloucestershire hampshire and bedfordshire  the servant that colonel dow had got drunk often when the gentlemen came home late at night he would get up to fight them the colonel found he would not answer his purpose for he himself was appointed by the company to the east indies he one day called in brewerstreet to see mr hume mrs elliot said colonel i hear you are going to the east indies again yes but i have got a damned foolish fellow of a servant he gets drunk quarrels with the hackneycoachmen and chairmen and knocks them down they get a warrant for him and i am obliged to be bail for him i wish i had the servant i had last jack macdonald to go with me mrs elliot said he lives with mr stewart you cannot have him at this time i went to see william boyd mr humes servant he said he was sorry i left colonel dow and that the colonel wanted to see me i went and hired myself for forty guineas a year to go with the colonel to india i gave mr stewart warning and told him i would not leave him upon any account but to go to india who are you going with sir i am going with colonel dow mr crauford gave me a character my master did not know the colonel and i said sir i hope you will excuse me as i have a great desire to go away what the devil do you want to go away i used you better than ever i did any other servant i let you ride in the chaise with me and that is more than ever i did to carpeneto though he was out of livery and if you were to stay i would soon put you out of livery  i made no answer  he threw down his pen with which he was writing a letter on the floor and went out  gimcrack won that day and on wednesday in the evening sir charles bunbury sold him for six hundred guineas  the duke and duchess of kingston made their grand appearance there after marriage after the duke had had her in keeping twenty years  my master would not have been sorry if the colonel had gone without me for when the races were over he went to mr nightleys and afterward to farmingwoods a seat of the earl of spencers both in northamptonshire at that time there were nine or ten gentlemen and noblemen now you will see how god orders things that are to be lady spencer was taken ill an express was sent to farmingwoods and arrived at six in the morning when my lord and the company were at breakfast before going a hunting orders were given directly for all the chaises to be got ready with speed we arrived in london in the evening i went to the colonel well john you are just come in time to set off in the morning i told my master at night that i was to go in the morning as the ship was to sail next day he had company at breakfast and i could not get him to take the things off my hands the colonel sent the chairmen for me twice at last the colonels servant came so i came away without my wages or board wages  when i came to lislestreet the chaise and four horses were at the door and all the things ready to go and my trunk in the passage the colonel coming down stairs to go into the chaise on seeing me went into the parlour till i got my trunk on at eleven oclock the colonel and i went into the chaise and at night we arrived at deal we were put in a room with two beds i brought the things into the room supper was brought up the waiter said to the colonel your servant must sleep in this room sir for there is no other bed he said very well as it is late waiter bring some ale and a bottle of wine and you need not wait so i eat my supper in the same room and in the morning captain smith made a signal for all the passengers to come on board the lord camden in the downs and that day we dined in the ship on our way to portsmouth after staying two days at portsmouth and the ship had got her dispatches from the india house captain smith of the lord camden and captain savage of the duke of cumberland set sail together as captain smith was the older captain he took the name of commodore and the other ships had their signals from the lord camden  after we were out in the channel there arose such a storm that we thought we should have been all lost together and we put about glad to get into portsmouth again with our lives and there we remained ten days the gentlemen were at the fountain tavern all the time we had nothing to do but walk about the country at last the wind came about and we made sail on the tenth of april      we went on very well and the ships in sight of each other almost every day  the first place we stopped at was madeira it was a fine place but we stopped there but one day to take in wines and set sail again the purser died on the passage sometimes one died and the burying was always before breakfast at other times a man or boy would fall overboard and bury himself a lieutenant going out passenger to india wanted to do the same but was caught hold of by the legs and stopped from that rash action and taken care of something troubled his mind  the passage is a pleasant life for those that have not much to do to see the men catching the fish and birds with a hook and bait another striking the fish with a gauge another time drawing in a long shark and whoever brings in a fine dolphin to the captain receives a couple of bottles of liquor we had a calm sometimes for a week and could not get on two leagues then a wind would spring up and blow the one ship on and not come near the other for an hour or two  the colonel on his passage was writing the history of indostan and mr wood a cadet whom the colonel took a liking to on the passage he made him copy off what he wrote and he gave me the rules of the army to write from in order to keep my hand in use so we three wrote in the colonels cabin and when we were dry i made grog out of his case and when we were tired we went to walk on deck there was something always to be seen there some of the men frighting or drawing a fish out of the water the porpoises or dolphins playing or the smaller flyingfish flying over the waves from the larger ones in the evening all that could sing a song sat down on the gangway and sung and the gentlemen walked about and heard us and in fine weather the gentlemen visited from one ship to another in their turn it was a pleasant sight to see the commodores boat let down along side and the gentlemen going to dine out at sea and when they came back the commodore would sail about the ship like people walking in a garden and we all looking out over the ship to see the gentlemen more than a thousand miles from land the commodore called for the great iron pot they had for the purpose and bound a rope to the two ears of it and let it down twenty fathoms and then held the rope fast to see which way the boat went back or on our way where we were bound the tide would carry us backward or forward sometimes six miles frequently without wind when we were going to cross the line just under the sun every one that had not been there before was to pay half a crown toward grog for the ships men to drink but there were three who would not pay a scotchman a welshman and a portuguese soldier it is the custom to let those who refuse to pay down from the yardarm by a rope round their middle four or five fathoms in the sea three times each one after the other it was pastime to the ships company each of the three got two bottles of liquor from the gentlemen to make merry  we made the brazils in south america but commodore smith would not go on shore the wind being foul run us to forty degrees south latitude and then we were obliged to run back to the cape of good hope to get sounding after our departure we had a fresh gale from the cape for joanna but a storm arose which made us loose the duke of cumberland for a fortnight we sailed down between africa to madagascar eight hundred miles by this time a great many of the men had got the scurvy by living on salt provisions and two duels were to be fought at joanna by the cadets  we lost sight of madagascar and got sight of joanna a fine island and a beautiful view in the month of august every thing green the very hills and mountains covered with shrubs we were greatly surprised when we came near the town and anchoringplace of joanna to see the duke of cumberland safe at anchor we came to and dropped anchor and the ships saluted each other with their guns which made the hills resound  the town stands on a level piece of ground surrounded by many sorts of trees in particular cocoanuts with high mountains and a large brook on each side of the town the black people came on board from their canoes in dozens to sell and buy things the boats were sent on shore for milk fine water and fowl and the prince sent word that he would come in the morning that night we had plenty of milk and cocoa the first thing that was done in the morning was to send the men on shore that had the scurvy to put them into the earth up to the neck and to remain there one day which is the most speedy cure in a hot country their skin will be as black as a coal when put in and in two days they were as well as ever  at breakfast the prince came on board to take orders he was the kings soninlaw a very handsome man in the mohammedan dress he did business for the king and himself he was over the kings cattle he was glad to see the commodore he had known him many years he came into the cuddy with the gentlemen to breakfast he ate bread and butter with a little sugar over it the steward made him sherbet to drink he took orders for bullocks fowls goats and vegetables there are no sheep horses nor ducks on the island although it is thirty miles long each ship had a marquee pitched on shore for the commanders to dine in with their company next day the prince came on board the colonel took him to his cabin and showed him books in the moorish language most richly bound in london and pictures of all the gods in the east the prince was astonished to see such things come from england he spoke the moorish language to the prince and made him a present of some fine books of his own religion the colonel asked him how many wives he had he said four and that one of them was the kings daughter the servant that attended the prince wore a sword by his side the prince invited the colonel to come and see him next day at the house where he did business not where his family lived he promised he would next day after he was dressed and mr wood with him he said john dress yourself and come ashore with me and take a bottle of rum in your hand we went and walked all round the town at last the prince met him and took him home where we all went the prince made lemonade and i put rum to it which made good punch we were all in the same company but i next the door the colonel was a good man and had the spirit of an emperor the princes three sons came to pay their respects to the colonel fine young boys he spoke to them in moorish at last the prince and his sons went away and soon after the prince sent a fine dish of chickens curried and boiled rice broth in wooden platters and three wooden spoons and wooden plates we ate heartily for it was very good and the colonel was very merry he knew their ways but to mr wood and me it seemed strange to see such things the slaveboy stood and wondered at us when we were done he carried every thing away in a moment there was neither table nor chair but fitting on a mat such as you kneel on at churches in england or lean your elbow on the princes came in soon and made more sherbet and i put more rum to complete it he made a little for himself for on account of their religion they cannot eat nor drink with a christian the prince went out and soon after came two fine black girls the princes slaves dressed in the moorish manner they had rings on their fingers ears and toes and bangles on their arms their breasts were covered with various ornaments a large ring of silver hung loose round the small of the leg it was very light and hollow they had neither shift nor stockings but a thin silk gauze for a petticoat and another the reverse from the waist upwards fastened on the left shoulder like the dress of a scotch highlander the petticoat is full and comes down as far as the ring on their leg the finest dressed one entered first put her two hands to her forehead then to her breasts and with her two hands touched the colonels foot this is called a grand salam in like manner the other paid her compliments to mr wood  after the common compliments were over i was going my master said john if i dont come on board tonight i shall in the morning i walked along the shore and went out with the last boat about half a mile by sea to the ship at the bottom of the sea round joanna the coral grows up like short spikes that help the children in england to cut their teeth the prince sent the books to the kings house in two days he and his son came on board the two ships with their attendants and a band of music like two or three old bagpipes such as they take through the streets of london with the dancing bears the king was a stout old man his own son a genteel prince about thirty the music stopped in the boat alongside the king and prince were entertained with biscuit butter sugar and sherbet they went to see the colonels books with which they were much delighted the colonel made the king a present of the alcoran the bible of the mahometans in their own language richly bound in london worth four hundred rupees the king invited the colonel to his country house about ten miles distant he promised to come next day the colonel invited mr mathison the supercargo from on board the duke of cumberland to accompany him he was ready by nine oclock went on shore and met the prince who accompanied us we were in company the colonel mr mathison the prince and i and the princes servant and the colonels black fellow whom he had to attend him while in joanna and to carry the umbrella made of paper over his head i had two bottles of rum with me we walked up the mountains along the footway through the finest shrubberies we were two miles higher than the surface of the sea many times we looked back the ships looked like small boats on the river thames and it is impossible to express the beauty of the scene or the fine smell of the trees fruit and flowers there is not a palanquin or any carriage on the whole island the king walks wherever he goes and his people have word about with him the kings town lies in a valley where no white man had been in the remembrance of any person living and had it not been for the alcoran nor we neither the houses were no more than huts except a few higher ones for the king and the prince that had the kings daughter his wife here and another where we came from and where he has four wives at different places  it would have alarmed the inhabitants to see white people had it not been known that the colonel gave the king a present of the alcoran we arrived at the kings house for business no person can go to the family houses the king and prince of joanna received the company kindly there was plenty of fruit and lemonade and i added rum for we wanted refreshment after walking ten miles over the mountains there was a bench like a taylors workboard covered with a scotch carpet which the king had got in exchange of trade and which did well for sitting on governor rustan came in he had the command of the town when the ships lay at anchor he made a grand salam and they all spoke the moorish language his son had the colonels linen to wash the capital mens sons at joanna when any ships arrive come on board get the passengers linen to wash which is done by their slaves they will show you a recommendation from one of the last ships company they charged a dollar for sixty pieces whether large or small in like manner you give a character from your hand which they show to the next ships company they make the linen as white as snow the king and the princes tasted the rum and then put a little in their sherbet they went away home and sent a fine currie both of fish and chickens and fine rice boiled the colonels servant waited and i had as much as i could eat and there was punch enough it was the best dinner i ever ate after dinner the prince and king of joanna came and sat awhile with the colonel and conversed they spoke english very well and said that englishmen and joanna men were just like brothers as we had more punch the colonel prevailed on the king to drink out of his own cup the king made each of the two gentlemen a present of a turban of fine muslin richly mixed with gold and silver and i had one of an inferior sort and two young bullocks and two milch goats were ordered for the colonel from joanna next morning the colonel thanked the king of joanna for his politeness and attention after conversing they both withdrew in half an hour two fine girls came in with a veil over their heads and bodies when they came in that was thrown off they were very richly dressed i declare they were like a diamond they made my hair stand an end to see them i went directly out along with the black men when i came home i lay down in a little appartment the girls went off at five in the morning i came in at six and got some toddy from the cocoanutters which we mixed with rum and fruit and made a breakfast about eight the prince came to accompany the colonel after drinking some toddy with rum we set off dressed in our turbans the black man carried the gentlemens hats and i carried my own every person looked at us as we went along with the two bullocks and two shegoats behind us i never enjoyed more happiness in my life than at this time the walk was so pleasant and every thing agreeable we walked along where no white man living had been but ourselves all the people were very desirous to see us as we walked along the colonel made a remark on our turbans the colonels was rich blue and gold mr mathisons red rich with silver and my turban green with gold at the ends just the color of the three orders in great britain the garter the bath and the thistle it was a little laughable as the king gave those three colors by chance the gentlemen conversed as they walked along they asked the prince if the king was rich he answered that the king had ten thousand dollars in ready money he told how pleasant it was in the south part of the island and that there he had one of his wives and that in raham island he had another this lay on the east side of joanna where he had cattle  we arrived at joanna town at twelve oclock the colonel sent one bullock and the two milch goats as a present to commodore smith and the other bullock to captain savage of the duke of cumberland as the boat was not ready to carry the two gentlemen on board the lord camden to dine they walked about and to put off time went into the mosque we all put off our shoes which is the custom the two gentlemen were in scarlet which looked very well with the turbans on the passage the colonel gave me an old scarlet coat i cut off the skirts and made it a short coat which with the turban looked better than theirs more like that of a seapoy officer the people came and admired us much at seeing us go into the mosque we got on board to dinner as i spoke so much about the currie twelve of us made a party to dine on shore next day as the kings silversmith was on board we asked him to make some currie to which he agreed the commodores cook and servant ship carpenter ship steward the boatswain and some midshipmen were in our party we all walked a great deal and then had an excellent dinner of currie and rice  next day the colonel and mr mathison went up the valley to see the grand cascade which falls over the rock a quarter of a mile perpendicular height one of the finest in the world before nine they went on shore as they wanted to catch a dish of trout as both the commanders were to dine on shore that day in their marquees under the cocoanut trees the men were all got well with good fresh provisions they had got wood and water on board and all was ready for sailing only waiting for a fair wind i went to the commanders when they were angling under the cascade where they had great success having caught a large dish of trout for their mess i carried brandy and the gentlemen made a boy climb up the trees to throw down some cocoa nuts they mixed brandy with the cocoa nut milk and drank it they arrived at the diningplace at one oclock with their fish the two marquees were facing one another and while they were at dinner the gentlemen drank to one another there were two french horns between the marquees playing at dinner and the evening was spent with pleasure the prince came after dinner and sat awhile and the black people came and danced to the gentlemen it was a dance with cudgelplaying very merry  next day the colonel was to dine on board the duke of cumberland with captain savage and mr mathison they both went to angle as before and i followed them with liquor at one oclock they were on board at dinner they told of their sport and how john always brought them a scotch dinner all drinking but no eating i dined with the captains servant i told them of our journey up to the kings town the wind came round to the southwest and commodore smith made a signal for sailing the company broke up the colonel went into the boat and i after him in half an hour we were under sail with a fine wind  next day when we were sailing with a brisk wind and a rough sea the commodore called me after breakfast to cut his hair and put it in order to go on shore at bombay at that instant a scotch boy fell overboard the alarm was given the commodore called down with the sails throw the hencoop overboard all hands were looking over he was a boy about sixteen and as he was a fine swimmer he put off his clothes and got on the hencoop where he sat and held fast till the ship was stopped and a boat let down he was then a mile behind the men went for him in the boat took him in fixed a rope to the hencoop and brought him on board he lost his clothes but he had enough given him by the gentlemen we went on with a fair wind and when we were on the coast of malabar one morning captain savage sent the commodore twelve hot rolls for breakfast and a fine sallad for dinner the sallad grew in two little gardens on the hind corners on the poop as we were sailing down the coast of malabar we saw a fight at sea between the fleets of hyder ally and the marrattas we saw the firing very well for two hours hyder allys fleet struck to the marrattas our two ships at this time were within three miles of each other we arrived at bombay the middle of september after all the rains were over  general pimble received the colonel at the marine house and took him to his country house at mastegan a mile from bombay town and close to messigan village the house stood on a hill almost surrounded by sea general pimble was then commander in chief at bombay the colonel sent a sepoy for me and the baggage and to show me the way to the commander in chiefs house  next day the colonel went to porrelle in the country to wait on governor hodges and the day following he took the command of all the sepoys on the bombay establishment there were four battalions which amounted to nine thousand men we were three weeks at general pimbles which was of service to me to learn the ways of the place the general kept a great deal of company and had a great number of servants i waited every day at table it is an old saying and a true one go where you will whatever place you will find an acquaintance sooner or later by chance the generals valet was a german adam la plue  when i was at the german spa with mr crauford he was footman to lady spencer but on some account he was obliged to retreat to india as a soldier he put himself down as a hairdresser and the general took him out of the ranks he and i slept and eat together now i was out of livery and he in livery one morning the colonel said john bring my clothes and dress me for the ball i dine with the general in town at his own house and we shall dress after dinner as i was carrying my bundle and adam passing me on horseback i asked the favor of him to carry it before him for it was very hot but he would not i waited dinner and in the evening the two gentlemen dressed in one room  i went that night to see their manner at the ball for the servants in india are excellent and sober when the colonel came home he said john my hair stands up as well as when i went out and all the other gentlemens hair is down i said sir the people here dont know how to use the pomade for i had contrived to stiffen the pomatum with waxen candles he answered if you like you may get a great deal of money here by cutting gentlemens hair and john as i have got the command of the sepoys i shall give a ball to the gentlemen and ladies at the marine house next week and i shall desire the favor of buckthergee the generals steward to buy in all the things for supper as you are a stranger when it comes in you must order the supper and the generals cooks will make it ready and i have hired wanella a persian servant to assist you very well sir i replied i shall do my endeavor to set every thing out to the best purpose i went and looked at the table room and then asked buckthergee who was a mohammedan and had a servant of his own what things he could send me he gave me an idea of different things i begged of him to send four turkeys two cocks and two hens the two cocks roasted set round with sausages and two hens boiled with oystersauce i made out a bill of fare for supper of fifty things on a long piece of paper after the manner of europe i made a circle round a crown a half crown a shilling and round a farthing i wrote the name of every dish as it was to stand on the table and i gave it to silvester the head cook to put up in his cookroom i set the table and the sidetables  i had two silver epargnes full of sweetmeats and three crystal stands with syllabubs and jellies in a row on the middle of the table with three rows of plates with fruits and deserts from top to bottom i was determined to exert myself on the afternoon of the ball i dressed myself in a green silk waistcoat double breasted with sleeves mounted with gold like a jacket when the cook asked a question he came to me to read the bill and an excellent supper he did dress the generals butler and i made negus and punch and served out the wines all the black men seemed very well pleased to assist in any thing they were desired to do and seemed surprised to see an englishman have the command as servants there were only two europeans in the island adam le plue with the general he did nothing but take care of his masters clothes and dress his hair and another with colonel gordon from lisbon he dressed his master and took care of the liquors but to provide for a table he knew nothing colonel keating colonel egerton mr ramsay and mr hornsbys butlers came they were moors the generals butler was an asiatic roman catholic he desired me to ask them i went and desired them to assist me the night as i was a stranger and come to remain amongst them they made a salam and said they were happy to be at my service the whole night so i gave them some tea and cakes but they could not eat with me or drink liquor  when the table was trimmed and all ready before supper the black men admired it and said your table looks like a diamond steward i lost the name of macdonald that night and got the name of steward for a head servant in india is always called steward the company assembled the dancing went on and when my fellowservant wanilla the persian was taking round some negus to the ladies he heard miss de la guarde ask the general what gentleman that was in the green and gold madam that is john macdonald colonel dows servant the broad gold lace though tarnished by day shone among so many lights at twelve the supper was ready and carried up by the servants that came to wait on their masters the upper servants i mentioned before put the supper on the table i held the bill of the supper in my hand to show them to put every thing in its place every thing was done at a word and they were more happy to be directed by me than by one of their own people the company sat down and i put the bill before the colonel the gentlemen said they never saw such a supper in bombay nor things better conducted and the gentlemen were well pleased that the black servants saw a white man could order a supper as well as either of them or better when supper was over the bill of fare was handed about from one lady to another and they said certainly this englishman is a very good servant the company broke up at four in the morning when i was putting the colonel tobed he said john i will be damned but you conducted yourself vastly well at this ball and with judgment and the gentlemen give you a great character and they say you have the best method of any with the black men i answered sir i am very glad i have done right and given satisfaction after this i was very much respected by the black men the colonel gave one thousand rupees for a saddlehorse and bought two horses for his chariot all stallions he hired a first and second coachman and bought two slaves one for the kitchen and the other to help wanilla and me as the colonel had taken a house he went to housekeeping he got captain savages second cook a black man an american the colonel asked the favor of mr mathison the supercargo of the duke of cumberland to be in the house with him as a companion till the ship was to sail for macoa which was about three months the servant mr mathison had from england got to be a writer therefore i dressed him the colonel and mr mathison got four coollies each to carry their palankin the colonel had a massall to carry the umbrella by day and the flambeau by night and a pair to run before the chariot or palankin with swords drawn in their hands so this was our family without a maidservant  as my master made his fortune in bengal and was a single man he did not mind money therefore he kept the best house in bombay the principal people dined with one another in their turn the custom is where they dine they sup and there was nothing to provide at home as the country is very hot my master told me to buy every thing that was wanting in the house he got a list of the prices of every thing for the house and for the use of the horses from buckthergee the steward i paid every servant their wages the first day of the month always if any did not fill their place i turned him away and hired another in his place without acquainting the colonel our house was called the first in bombay for hospitality the colonel invited the commander in chief and his lady and the first gentlemen and ladies in town to dinner and supper the dinner was admired much and the ladies said it is very odd we cannot have such a dinner at our own houses yet there is not one woman in this house and the general said after dinner good god how handy this young man is turned out when i was putting the colonel to bed he told me so and gave me great applause and next day he gave me three suits of clothes trimmed with gold  in december commodore sir john lindsay arrived at bombay with the kings ships of war under his command he sent his steward and the stewards of the captains under his command to know the price of things in the island the same as i learned from buckthergee  according to custom at christmas the governor gave a dinner to all the gentlemen in the island about two hundred and fifty and the same on the first day of the new year and all we english servants waited for there was a great many in sir john lindsays fleet we all dined together and each had two bottles of wine allowed him the time of the year that is called winter in europe was spent in a jovial manner in visiting balls and entertainments at this time an evil thought came into the mind of general pimble i believe for himself as well as for others he wanted all the officers to wear boots on duty it was against the cast or religion of the gentoo officers to eat beef or wear their skins even calves or sheep skins some of the principal officers waited on the general to tell him they could not possibly comply with his order to wear boots that were made of the skins of those creatures which was entirely against their cast or religion if they did they would lose their cast and be deprived of the company of their relations the general insisted that they should wear the boots or give up their commissions they got three days to consult with their friends and return an answer they put up prayers to god and hoped that god of his goodness would not impute the sin to them nor their children but to the person who was the cause of their wearing boots of skins of those beasts which was entirely against their religion the prayers were put up in the pagodas at bombay they told him they had determined to wear the boots according to his desire since said they god has sent you from europe to give us disturbance concerning our religious principles and to deprive us of our friends company and the benefits of our religion we will submit to god and your excellency so they took leave and went home in three weeks the general was smitten with the dropsy and never recovered about this time my master gave a dinner to sir john lindsay and his officers the colonel sir john lindsay andrew ramsay esquire and mr patterson secretary to commodore lindsay made an appointment to go to the hotwells at dillanagoga in the marrattas country inland over against bombay they were to go in the month of april commodore watson and other gentlemen were to go in another party to the same place the general was getting very ill his disorder growing worse every week the advice of his physicians tennant bond and richardson was to go to bencoot one of our settlements a fine airy situation as any in india people are sent there just as gentlemen are sent from england to lisbon or the south of france for the benefit of of their health the general went to bencoot and colonel gordon was left in command as being the senior officer commodore watson his family and party were gone to dillinagogue commodore watson belonged to the honorable east india company the colonel and his party were preparing and we set off in a large boat with sails across the sea and entered the great river of tannah with a vessel following us with all the necessaries for an empty house servants two havaldars or sepoy sergeants twelve sepoys with their arms four palankins with eight men for each four saddlehorses with their keepers we had plenty of provisions with us for two days in the boats i was greatly delighted and thought it was a pleasant thing to live under the east india company  we passed salsette carranjaw and the beautiful country and the banks of the river the people came in numbers to see us the country people brought us some of them milk others fruit before we came opposite the city and fortification of tannah which is near the banks of the river the colonel sent his servant rustan on shore with a message to the governor rummagee punt for a passport we waited three hours for it we could not stir nor go near the fort if we had we should have been fired at the gentlemen sent their respects and that they would do themselves the honor to wait on his excellency on their return the passport came when they were at dinner we set sail and passed the towers and walls of the fort in the afternoon thousands of people were looking at us and the sepoys over the walls our sepoys had new clothes and all red and blue turbans the two havaldars were like two officers two likely young men mahometans in the evening when the tide turned we stopped the gentlemen drank punch and sung till they fell asleep in the cabin in the day two of mr ramsays servants used the first and second frenchhorns which were very pleasant on the river i was the only white servant there my fellow servants rustan told me he never heard of a white servant there before sir john lindsays valet a german was left sick at bombay his name was longchamps afterward a great man at newmarket  in the evening we landed at the bundy a town from whence we were to go by land to the hotwells we were all night at a rich moormans house who was often at bombay on business he let mr ramsay have an apartment in his house for himself and the gentlemen at the bundy a pleasant town we left the river to go by land the moorman at whose house we were had a great many wives and one sally percival a black girl who had gone along with us had an opportunity to go in where they were she told them the english gentlemen had a great desire to see them and begged to let her undraw the curtain on the inside the window when the master afdalla was gone out a little they went and had a sight by looking through a window they did not stay a minute for fear of his return one gentleman said they are pretty another said they are richly dressed i wish we had them here said another this sally percival whom i have mentioned lived with a gentleman who had gone home to europe he gave her her freedom and a great deal of money afterward she lived with dr percival by whom she had a son but the doctor died and left a great deal of money to sally and the little boy by this time she was worth between four and five thousand pounds sterling she had a town and country house in the island of bombay dr tennant and mr ramsay were her trustees  in the morning after the gentlemen were dressed i and rustan and bigo two persian men belonging to sir john lindsay set out on horseback up a valley about fifteen miles long the gentlemen were to follow in their palankeens and sally percival along with them at the top of the valley were the hot wells surrounded by the mountains the valley was very pleasant about two miles broad with a small serpentine river on our right hand as we rode along we saw a large fort on the top of the hill that contained a thousand men and there was another on our left hand on the top of a very high mountain near dillinagogue when we came to dahoo a village half way to the wells we stopped to have some milk and cocoanuts my horse picked up a stone in his shoe i knocked it out with another stone which made my hands dirty i went to wash them in the puddle that lay near the well of the village at that time a farmers daughter came for water a pretty girl a gentoo she had her slave girl with her to carry the water home she was sorry to see me washing my hands in the dirty water therefore she poured water on my hands out of the pitcher i washed my hands and dried them with my handkerchief then i made her a low salam and took hold of her hand a freemans daughter at bombay would not have done so for any money they are kept at so great a distance from the english when she went away i told rustan she was a fine girl he said she was very well pleased that you made her a grand salam before her slave girl she thinks we are all your servants by your having that fine goldlaced hat and gold on your coat most people of the village came to see us whilst we were drinking our milk after we left this place as we pursued our journey there were some mares feeding our horses being stallions were like mad things after the mares they ran after them so that we could not stop them and began fighting with one another we were therefore obliged to throw ourselves from off their backs rustan bigo and i never were more happy in our lives than when we got safe off their backs when the three horses keepers came up who were a little way behind they got hold of the horses with great difficulty we got on horseback again and arrived at dillinagogue in the afternoon a while after the gentlemen arrived the houses were made and covered with branches of trees the building of a house would cost eighteen half crowns there was no rent to pay but when the gentlemen went home before the rain should come which is about the end of may the farmers take the house for firewood there is plenty of fish fowl mutton wild boar hares and other provisions cheap the gentlemen drank the waters dressed played at cards and after dinner slept an hour or two then in the afternoon they rode out on horseback and in the evening played at cards again  after we had been here some time the tiger came at night and paid our hen house a visit as it was very easy to break open he killed the fowls and took them away  after this a sepoy was sent up the tree to shoot him when he came but he never killed one as he commonly fell asleep two weeks after we came here a pattamar came with an express of the death of general pimble at bencoot where he was buried next express by a pattamar brought an account that the ship that brought the genelemen that attended the general in their return to bombay with adam la plue the generals servant and the baggage were attacked by the cooleys on their return home in the battle the fire of the cooleys got into the ships powder room and blew the ship up in the air and all was lost and that sir john lindsays head cook went to bed at bombay well at night and was found dead in the morning the gentlemen were very sorry for there were a great many of their friends blown up with the ship  in three weeks commodore watson and his party went home round the hot wells this was the pleasantest place i ever saw fine large old trees in abundance and many rivulets running down from the mountains all round when we walked at night we had a stick with a rattle on the end of it to rattle as we went along to frighten the serpents away for fear we should tread on them i was very much delighted here with one thing at dillinagogue there was a tank where the gentoos bathe themselves and the women in particular at the end of the tank is a piece of rising ground with a cross fixed twelve feet high where a priest sits most days naked as he was born when the women come to enter the bath they make the priest a grand salam they have a shift on when they enter the water when a young girl who has been betrothed for some years is going home to her husband for they marry very young and go to their husbands house from their fathers at twelve or thirteen and on that occasion goes to take the bath with two married women behind her she makes a grand salam to the priest and kisses his private parts hoping he will pray that they may have children i took a great delight in going to see those ceremonies  after being five weeks at this place we returned home toward the end of may  we went down the river to tannah the gentlemen slept in their barge on the river and next day sent a message to the governor to let him know they would wait on him rammagee sent his compliments with a message that he would be glad to see the gentlemen he ordered a troop of horse and a company of foot to attend them into the castle rammagee paid great respect to colonel dow because he was the commandant of the sepoys he was as much honored at tannah as a king in europe because he commanded the black troops and spoke the language of the country  when the gentlemen left the castle the next place they went to see was the portugueze or roman catholic church i followed the gentlemen there i was very well dressed and the two havaldars or sepoy sergeants were with me when we came near the church the horse and foot stood under arms when they saw us and knew that i was the commandants steward they sounded the music and beat the drums to give me two cheers i took off my hat and made a low bow and the havaldars made them a grand salam as we passed the ranks to follow the gentlemen into church when the colonel came out of church he discharged the sepoys and took the horsemen with him the gentlemen were going two miles farther to see some figures of the gentoo gods cut in the rock on the face of a hill i had no desire nor the havaldars to go on so we returned and we met rustan and bigo the two persian men i asked them to go into a roman catholic publichouse where i treated them with some persian brandy each cast had a cocoanut to drink out of for they cannot drink with one another i ordered the landlord to bring some fruit for each of them they were all well pleased and the master his wife and daughter were very happy to see a white christian visitor i drank out of their own cup and the landlord broiled some fish called sparling so we feasted each religion by itself till the gentlemen returned to the barge to dinner the colonel gave the horsemen forty rupees and to the footmen twenty rupees so they were dismissed very well pleased the gentlemen played at cards and drank punch in the evening mr ramsays two servants played on the first and second frenchhorn which very much entertained the inhabitants early the next morning the tide carried us down the river into the salt water and the same day we arrived safe at bombay  in the month of august    0 general wedderburne arrived at bombay from europe with a commission from the honorable east india company to take the command of the troops in bombay and general pimble was to take the command at madrass if he had lived general wedderburne went to parnellhouse in the country to wait on governor hodges with his commission and next day he took the command of the troops in bombay green this year was spent very agreeably between the kings and the companys servants at bombay  in the beginning of      sir air coote arrived at bombay on his way to europe from madrass he stayed some time and was entertained by all the first people of rank in the island there was a grand review of all the troops belonging to bombay and old womans island where the grand encampment was formed by general coote and general wedderburne sir air coote was going to europe over land through the deserts of arabia and my master who did not like bombay asked leave of governor hodges to accompany sir air to england his request was granted when he came home he told me he was to go to england and that he was to have a sale in two days of every thing that he had but you must get my clothes plate books and maps packed up give a grand dinner to the council and all the general officers i had been ill a great while and the fatigue of this dinner made me worse i foolishly had got the disorder of the country and had not applied to a proper person at first i told the colonel i was very ill and he desired me to go to dr richardson when i went to see the doctor he told me if i went with the colonel i should lose my life i went to the colonel and told him  he said i am very sorry then i must take stephen the cook with me i can do no other i went to dr richardson to ask him if he would take me under his care in the hospital for as i did not belong to the company i had no title to the hospital he said that he would when i found he would take me under his care i sent him the same afternoon a fashionable silver mug that cost me five pounds in st jamess street london when the colonel was going he took me by the hand and said that he had recommended me to colonel keating and that if he came back he would take me himself and he paid me like an emperor next day i went into the hospital and mr richardson put me in the first ward and in every respect treated me as the first person there i was there six weeks when i was getting better colonel keating sent a message whenever i could get out to come to his house till i got better i returned for answer that i would and that i was much obliged to him  one day as i was walking out early in the morning on the outside of the gate major pointing who was exercising the sepoys on the green when he saw me called me and asked me how i did  i told him i was getting well  well john will you come and live with me when you get better or come to my house whenever you like i told him i was obliged to him but that colonel keating had spoke to me to come to his house then said he you will repent that you know i have the best right to you as i have taken your masters place and if you serve me you shall order every thing as you like i said very well i shall see and give an answer sir we spent our time in the ward very pleasantly they were gentlemens sons midshipmen or mates we played at cards for tea coffee and sugar and sometimes for our wine that we had in the hospital so every thing was as agreeable as possible next morning when the doctors came round and did their business doctor richardson called me out of the ward and asked me if i intended to take a place or go to england i said i would take a place  very well i shall speak to governor hodges to take you for his steward as he spoke to me some time ago to get him an european steward to take the care of his clothes liquors and plate and if i can get that place for you it will be the making of you and you may sleep in the hospital or out which you like i told him i was much obliged to him next day mr mathison the supercargo of the duke of cumberland came to see me and to ask me to come to colonel keatings house the ship was returned from macoa he slept at colonel keatings as he did at colonel dows before he went to surat and macoa and he was very desirous to have me there on account of having his hair done  another circumstance probably made him desirous that i should come to colonel keatings mr mathison brought the famous horse chillabie from macoa at this time four years old he was chained in colonels keatings stable by the head and legs he had killed one arab at macoa and on the passage he had almost killed another therefore the black man would not go near him mr mathison knew i understood horses i helped mahomed the coachman to break in two mules he sent to colonel dow when he went first to juddah i went to the colonels house and by that step i lost the best opportunity ever offered to me after i was there and my things with me i had not fortitude to come away again all that i did was to dress their hair and to give orders to the black horsekeepers about the mad horse as they called him for i had very little strength after coming out of the hospital this horse was called after a very rich merchant at surat who had eighteen or nineteen ships of his own and a great many english gentlemen in his service he lived a great while at bombay for his pleasure he was a jovial hearty fellow and broke through the rules of his religion to have company with the english gentlemen and to drink wine he was a great companion of general wedderburnes and of the first rate men he was a mohammedan and his name was chillabie in a few days mr richardson sent for me he said he had spoke to the governor about me and i have given you a great character so that you may go to parrella as soon as you please i said very well sir and i am very much obliged to you i shall go when i have cut and dressed colonel keatings hair when the colonel was gone to a ball i told mr mathison that the governor wanted me to live with him he answered if you go to parrella you will be confined in the country amongst a parcel of persians besides the governor is very changeable in his mind and puts his whole confidence in gentoo bramins he went and told colonel keating and next morning after breakfast mr mathison asked me if i went to the governor or would hire myself to the colonel i said gentlemen whatever you think best the colonel said john your master recommended you to me and i will give you as much as mr hodges and every one in my house knows you i will give you forty guineas a year my old clothes and bed board and washing  you will have the charge of every thing in my house bapu buys every thing for the house but he is not always here and he likes you very much i agreed to stay and the governor was a little displeased next time the governor had the colonel to dine with him at parella and in conversation after dinner with the company he said colonel keating i do not like you because you are so partial to the scots i cannot help that governor hodges for i think when i meet scotchmen that are good they are the best of men colonel keating was commandant of artillery and principal engineer he had as many attendants about him as a royal or a noble prince in england bapu was his head servant he had a plantation of his own and a large family as he was above taking wages the colonel made him a present now and then next to him were two tindalls petty officers and five lascars as servants excused from duty two would come in the morning and two to dinner and two to supper just as they liked there was always enough of them and the colonel did not mind which three cooks and three slaveboys always in the house a tindalls command of twelve lascars on guard night and day at the gate and an english coachman and three black helpers in the stables when there was a large company at dinner there was bapu and baba and shelk and five lascars all in turbans besides our slaveboys and strange servants all waiting at dinner bapu was over us all when he attended when he did not then i was headman in regard of dressing the colonel and taking care of his clothes that was to myself i took care of the sidetable and bapu took notice and sent me wine he never waited at table but would sit down in the fenander come in to see what the colonel wanted put down the dinner and take it off the colonels perquisites amounted to as much as the pay of the commander in chief he had as many men at work under him at cutting down rocks and building new fortifications as cost one hundred thousand rupees per month and when he came in his palankin after breakfast to see some hundreds of men at work he was taken more notice of than the king of england at st jamess on a court day there was one captain macneal an engineer an argyleshire gentleman who assisted the colonel in his works when i came i took a little trouble off his hand in regard of receiving all the colonels money as i was always in the way i had a drawer that ran on wheels to keep the money in a paper was brought to me to receive so much money i took care of the paper and gave an account of the money when a bill was to be paid the colonel put his name to the bottom i received the bill and paid the contents which lessened captain macneals trouble at home when bapu was to have a sum of money he brought the order and i paid the money to him i took care of the papers and what i paid i marked in my book  in two months after i was there the colonel was taken with a putrid fever he was so extremely ill that for twelve nights i never went to bed nor pulled off my clothes he had no nurse but me the doctors were all called for on the tenth day he was given over his friends were called and his will was made and read to him in my hearing at twelve oclock he said now my friends leave me to rest after the gentlemen had supped they went home and all the black men were asleep for they are naturally very sleepy and i lay on the bed with the colonel wetting his lips with a feather while he was motionless at throe i took a lookingglass to put over his mouth to see if there was any life by the glass i found there was life i knew there would be a change at four in the morning because at four the morning before he changed from better to worse as i expected so it pleased god that from four he received strength more and more as you would see the sea flow the gentlemen sent in the morning to know if the colonel was dead or not but to their great surprise and comfort they saw him sitting up in the bed to breakfast at nine oclock his friends were very happy for they never expected to see him in life again the doctors said i had done great things and they recommended me to go to bed which i did the colonel got out of danger but his disorder was not gone he changed his bed from one room to another and i slept in the room wherever he went  by this time governor hodges was taken ill and his illness increased and the colonel was so happy that he was better that he told me one morning with much satisfaction that he dreamed in the night he was playing at cards with death and beat death i answered then sir you will certainly get the better of your illness his disorder turned to an ague he went to his country house at randal lodge it stood on the side of malabar hill he was there two months from thence he went to mr ramsays at mayan where he remained one month and afterward to mr jarviss house in the woods here we remained three weeks then we went back to mr ramsays again for a change by this time the governor was got so ill that he was desired to go to bencoot by his physician where general pimble died and was buried this made my master afraid governor hodges also was at bencoot till he died his remains were brought to bombay he had a very grand burial he was laid in the church the colonel came to town again for a month but there was so much company to disturb him that he went to randal lodge but the putrid fever stuck about him still after all the doctors could do for him he must go to bencoot for the benefit of the air a vessel was procured and every thing got ready the colonel took me the two tindalls baba and sheek two cooks two peons to run before him one to carry the umbrella and the flambeaux and six haymalls to carry the palankin  we set sail early in the morning and with a fair wind arrived at fort victoria where the east india company had one hundred and twenty as fine sepoys as ever i saw besides their officers and noncommissioned officers the first gunner was born at aberdeen in scotland he had been there sixteen years and was as black with the heat as the sepoys the chief was mr cheap the castle and mr cheaps house stood on a high hill near the sea and a large river it is a beautiful country and a number of different fruit trees grow along the face of the hill these sepoys had nothing to do but to mount guard at the chiefs gate a fine easy life they had we had many sorts of fish chickens mutton lamb and several other sorts of provision we lived very well there were only four gentlemen the colonel mr cheap mr forbes and mr arden they went out in the afternoon the colonel in his palankin and the gentlemen on horseback as for me i walked where i would for my pleasure with my little sepoy called toby the colonel let me have him for what i wanted wherever he went he was called my little sepoy all he had to do for the colonel was to clean a pair of shoes clean the nightpan to do what i wanted and to walk out with me the colonel reviewed the sepoys and had two of them flogged for sleeping on guard it was only to teach them to know their duty the colonel told mr cheap that seedy might come and take the fort without firing a gun seedy was a sovereign prince whose country lay near ours and fort victoria would have been of great service to him  the colonel got a great deal better by the air of bencoot and by taking the bark when the colonel was three weeks at bencoot he had a desire to go up the river forty miles to the hot wells to take the bath the name of the place where the wells are is darygan the colonel went in mr cheaps barge i am going to mention one remark that was made by general pimbles lady at bombay at dinner the day we set sail for bencoot when she was speaking to the ladies about my master she said general pimble went for his health to bencoot with adam la plue his servant and never returned the governor went and he died now we will see what will become of colonel keating and john macdonald i will mention another thing before we go up the river which may not be disagreeable the barge contained the sour gentlemen myself and baba and sheek the two noncommissioned officers as worthy fellows as ever lived their business was to prepare for the table they never cleaned a knife all the dirty work was done by by the coolies that carried the palankins every one had his business and according to their cast they eat together the moormen could not eat with the gentoos nor the gentoos with the moormen baba and sheek were mahometans and mr cheaps man also and the gentoos at dinner by themselves our two cooks and toby and the other two gentlemens servants dined together and i by myself when the gentlemen had done where they dressed their food under a tree they drew a circle round and none of the other could come within that line before the colonels lady went to england for at this time she was in london about business and knew nothing of his illness she asked the favor of bapu baba and sheek to bring their wives to see her and she would treat them with fruits and sweetmeats bapu made answer madam we are much obliged to you for your invitation but we cannot do this to let our wives visit any european nor let them visit us if we did we should lose our cast and be despised by our relations and every one of our religion our ladys maid sylvia who was a malabar girl has been to see them at their houses and she said that bapus wife had as many bangels and jewels as cost four or five hundred pounds for he was very rich but baba and sheek were poorer  we prowed up the beautiful river of mart in the coolie boats sometimes using a sail and at other times oars on each side it was very pleasant mostly very high hills covered with fine trees of different sorts rivulets running down at different places and the mangoes hanging on the trees and other fruits in our view it was a beautiful scene as we sailed along to see the rocks hills and trees and the birds of different kinds we arrived at darygan next morning the place where the wells stood was level and about two miles round almost surrounded by mountains and groves the waters were as hot as at bath in england the colonel went into the bath early in the morning and in the afternoon the gentlemen went out in their palankins and then i took the bath to cure me of my late illness the gentlemen employed their time here in the same manner as colonel dow and his party did at the hot wells at dillinagogue the citron trees grew in plenty before our house and round the valley and the fine large fruit hung on the trees in abundance the country people minded them no more than a frogstool the colonel had a great many preserved in jars and taken to bombay as this was a gentoo country there happened to be some grand holidays not yearly but upon a particular occasion which only happens very seldom monday was the day to draw the people together in the great grove the gentoos meet dance in different postures and throw a holy red powder on one another they are dressed with flowers particularly the women they eat fruits and sweetmeats baba and sheek were glad to see this fete as well as i i asked baba what that stage was for six feet high and as much square at the end of the stage is a large post eighteen feet high with another of an equal length or more fixed on the top of the post properly with an iron bolt so that the one across runs round like a weathercock with ease sheek said mr john you will see the grand ceremony tomorrow next day the fete was grander than the day before with music dancing dress and feasting a great many of the gentlemen gentoos came from the city of mar and amongst them one very rich and a great and good man he had been married years and had no children i was told prayers had been put up by the bramins in the pagodas at last he had an only son in return he publicly goes through a torment in honor of his creator and the pure and undefiled gentoo religion and his name is handed down to posterity amongst the worthy as a saint and his family respected  when the operation was to begin he was seated on a table under one of the ends of the crofs pole an incision is made in each side under his ribs to let in each hole a smooth iron hook like those that let down a butt of beer to a cellar in london with a string from the rope that draws him up round the breast to keep him from pitching forward and to keep him in the same position with the irons in his side he is drawn up in a moment with a pulley when he is up there is one over him who crosses a rope to hold him there his hands and feet are tied that he cannot stir but take notice there are weights on the other end of the cross pole to balance the person who is drawn up and he who fixes him so the music is playing some are crying others praying for him to get through his misery at the other end of the pole a rope is fixed which a man takes hold of and runs him round three times whenever he came to the same place they gave him a cheer so he had three cheers when he had gone round three times he was taken down in a moment a cordial given him his wounds were dressed and he was carried home in triumph with beating of drums and music playing those who remain behind dance in different companies  at the top of the grove were the figures of their gods first was ram a man drawn with ten heads and twenty arms to denote wisdom and strength with a company of men and women dancing round him like the ring in greenwich park next was gunness a man with four arms and an elephants head to denote great wisdom and power next was drougah and his wife and on the left of all masassoor a man there was the globe of the earth the ox which is in all their pagodas the dove and serpent also and the turtle i went home and the first time i saw vistenorgee a gentoo who was the colonels purvoo or head clerk i asked him what the meaning of all the figures i saw might be he said ram was their principal agent between them and god when he was on earth he had conversation with god and whatever he said was a law with god and how he beat and destroyed kings and he gives us this country to live in by what vistenorgee told me i found the gentoos were the descendants of the children of abraham by keturah whom he sent into the east country to push their fortune and to be out of the way of his son isaac whenever you meet a gentoo they will say ram ram that is to say god bless you by what i could understand of what he told me ram is for abraham drougah and his wife for isaac and rebecca and gunness is in remembrance of jacob of his wisdom and power with god the ox they worship as being the custom in the east at that time the dove and the serpent to show you to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove the earth in remembrance of their forefather adam and eve who had the whole world under their command the turtle to show you to be satisfied with plenty and with poverty as the turtle can live in the plentiful sea and out of his element on dry land masassoor they look on as a wicked being so they worship him for fear while they live and when dead deceive the demon by burning the body and throwing the ashes in water that he may not have it the gentoos never indulge unruly lust nor run into any excess of wickedness but keep in every respect to the form of their religion if god approved of the conduct of the reckabites who would not obey jeremiah who was sent from god with a message but their fathers old commands jeremiah xxxv how much more shall he excuse those gentoos who never had the bible to go by or direct them the colonel was getting better every day by drinking the waters and taking the bath so that he was in very good spirits and i was very happy in my own mind that he was recovering and that i should have the pleasure of his returning to bombay in perfect health he eat very hearty and drank moderately and every thing was agreeable  the gentlemen went out four miles in their palankin in the evening they played at cards and were merry and all the attendants were happy with one another the black men would have done any thing to oblige me owing to my humility and good temper though i say it myself i gave them onions and gee and curry stuff to dress their victuals whenever they asked me for any for i had enough and could buy whenever i pleased they liked me so much that they would have done any thing to deliver me out of trouble if i had been in any and they said mr john you are a very good man god is very good to you i paid every man his board wages on monday morning every set by themselves i paid the havaldar and he paid the sepoys one day i took notice of the heat as i was walking by the river side when the gentlemen were asleep the cattle lay down in the water the crows stretched out their wings on the trees to cool themselves and panting for breath i went into the room where the colonel was asleep and looked at the thermometer which was up at ninetyfour i took it and hung it under the mangoe tree to have the natural air of the country i observed in half an hour it got up to one hundred and eighteen degrees of heat i let it stand half an hour longer and it neither stirred up nor down i carried it in again to its place when the gentlemen got up and went to sit under the mangoetree for the air where i put the thermometer where they drank tea i told the colonel i had been making two experiments when he was asleep what were they john i took the thermometer and hung it under this tree on the nail and in half an hour it got up to one hundred and eighteen i let it stand half an hour but it never stirred sir this was half an hour past two and now it is five oclock the gentlemen said good god is it possible they were suprised to hear it and sir i have been making some tea of the citron leaves of the tree we gathered the citrons off to preserve and i have it ready i brought the tea to them and they liked it much and said they never tasted finer tea nor any thing more pleasant to drink by this time we had been here four weeks and i had a great desire to see the city of mar about two miles and a half from darrygan higher up the other side of the river after breakfast i asked the colonel to let me to to mar and see the place certainly john if you like and you may take baba or sheek very well sir i am obliged to you i ordered the dinner and told sheek and baba i was going to see mar and that either of them that liked to go might dress themselves they were both desirous to go so they drew lots who should go and sheek gained and baba to be with the colonel at home as the palankinmen were not wanted till the afternoon i took four of them to carry us through the river and they were very happy to go i took the havaldar also we crossed the water the road was pleasant on both sides were little hills covered with trees  before we came to the first chochee where was a havaldar naigee and some sepoys we saw one of the sepoys running toward mar when we came to the chochee they turned out and made us a salam and we returned it the havaldar asked us some questions we answered and we asked what the sepoys were gone on for the havaldar said it was to give notice there was an european coming to the office of the next chochee and he sent another sepoy to the governor to let him know there was an european coming to mar but of what station he did not know i said to sheek it is very odd they took any notice of us sheek said they think you are a gentleman because you are dressed in scarlet and that fine goldlaced hat they think you are one of the gentlemen at the hotwells mr john because there are six of us attending you in this country they think every one that wears scarlet and gold to be a great man and we are glad they think so when we came to the second chochee we sat down because the havaldar was a moorman of sheeks cast we had toddy to drink and soon after a fine young man a jemmetdar or lieutenant came from the governor to know who i was sheek told the jemmetdar i was steward to one colonel keating that was at the hotwells and that i was desirous to see the town the jemmetdar returned to the governor and at the same time i went to see the roman catholic church and he came to us again and told us the governor desired him to walk with us we went to see the pagodas the tank for bathing all the governors horses and all the elephants and the camels and to walk all round the town which was very pleasant the people followed in hundreds to see us i said to sheek these pretty girls are very fond to see us he said mr john they never saw a white man before one half of those people and you are a very fine picture mr john the girls are very glad to see you we went into a portuguese house i had rice and currie and i had arrack enough for the coolies to drink sheek had some breadfish to eat but he drank nothing but water the romancatholic landlord was very happy he and i drank hearty together and he said i was the very first white man that ever was in his house we were very merry so i paid and came to the end of the town when i gave the jemmetdar two rupees and took our leave we came home about six oclock i told the colonel what usage we had he said the governor behaved very much like a gentleman by sending the officer with you it was extremely respectful by the time we were here five weeks the colonel was got strong and hearty and was thinking of going home again and to go over land and not by water mr cheap sent us forty coolies to carry our baggage it took twenty coolies to carry our provision chest so we set out from darreygan in the morning with seventyfive men and boys four horses ten bullocks two cows and two calves mr cheap came two days journey with us and then took the sepoys home with him we set off early in the morning on account of the coolies we did not travel in the middle of the day for the heat but the morning and afternoon the gentlemen rode in their palankins so altogether we were like a little army the country in comparison was like a large garden so many sorts of fine trees with the fruit hanging on them in plenty as we had every thing with us that was necessary we furnished our places where we stopped in ten minutes we commonly stopped where there were a great many shady trees for we could not go into the peoples houses no christian is admitted and there are no inns on the road but they would sell us fowls eggs fish milk and firewood and the cook would set up a pot or a spit in a few minutes and we could buy provender for the horses and cows and set them a eating the first place we stopped at was a village under large mangoe trees we put our teakettle to boil and set our teatable and chairs and there were a hundred or several hundreds to see them at breakfast every thing about us was so strange to them they have no chairs but sit on the ground my chair was the provision chest where i had the liquors we stopped to breakfast about ten and there was time enough to dress dinner we went on the road again after three and went on till near dark we pitched at lowoos and furnished our house as before we lighted up candles and put the liquor on the table the colonel to bed and the other gentlemen slept in their palankins i slept in my hammock fixed up between two trees  the gentlemen had a hot dinner and supper as if they had been at home when i was marking down the money i laid out mr cheap asked the colonel if i kept a journal the colonel answered i believe john keeps a journal of the rupees this night the gentlemen supped in public there was no danger of any rain coming it was not the rainy season at this time of the year  i called the gentlemen before four in the morning and i called baba and sheek and they called the others for the black men sleep sound in half an hour we were all off the ground and we went by the light of the mosal or flambeau till daylight this day we had a mountain to go over three miles high we got to the bottom or first part of the mountain about nine oclock we could get no water on the road as we were beginning to go up there was a hole where there was a little dirty water i put my handkerchief over the hole and sucked the water through it and the other men took the dirty water up with a spoon and drank it we got up the mountain with hard work on the top was the finest sight i ever saw just like a pleasure garden with so many trees and flowers and the meal was so fine when we were beginning to go down the other side of the mountain i was very happy in my own mind to see the sea  the sun shined very hot upon us but instead of the sea what we saw two miles below us was a white cloud the mountain was called lowoo when we descended from the mountains we came into a pleasant valley where was a plenty of water for man and beast we pitched beside the river of lowoo under some very large oak trees we were all very hungry for we had come a great way that morning we got breakfast as soon as possible and afterward we lay on the grass under the trees and slept and there were plenty of trees to cover the cattle and plenty of grass to eat  there was a gentoo gentleman that dined where we did he made the gentlemen a present sent of some fine mangoes and my master gave him some pens and paper we had plenty of fine fish and some fowls dressed here for dinner the cattle lay down in the river and we saw a great many gentoo women of the village washing their clothes opposite to us there was one thing on our side we never had any thing to pay for our lodgingplace nor for our fruits all was free  we set out after dinner and at night arrived at a mahomedan mosque and burying ground the burying ground was very large and pleasant therefore the gentlemen made it their lodging place as it was shaded with fine trees baba and sheek were very happy as the priest of the mosque was of their own fect we all slept in the churchyard the gentlemen slept in their palankins and i made my hammock on the grave of a mahomedan and slept with pleasure on the grave of a man i never saw the colonel desired me to give the priest twenty rupees he put up a prayer for him and all his attendants we went to sleep and the usual time to call was four in the morning i was the alarm cock called baba and sheek and they alarmed the others  when i was helping the colonel on with his clothes i said sir i have made a mistake what is that john sir it is only three instead of four he said john it is a very good mistake we set off and by daylight mr cheap and the sepoy went home  on that day we passed through a fine level country and passed by three pagodas and some fine villages the colonel called me on the road in the morning and said john i am going to send baba on with a message to raggagee angerry a sovereign prince he lives on our way to bombay and we are now going through his country it is about twentysix miles to cowrie where he lives and i intend to be there all night i want you to give baba mr cheaps horse as he will go quicker on to the place i gave baba the horse and i got on the bullock he had very high horns and they stood straight up so i made a genteel appearance we traveled till eleven oclock then we pitched at the bottom of a mountain where there was a grove and a fine spring running out of the rock we breakfasted there with pleasure and after dinner at three set off for cowrie in the afternoon  raggagee angerry when he had received the message sent three different men on horseback one after another to let the colonel know he was extremely welcome and that every thing should be ready for him and all his attendants the colonel sent one of the horsemen back to let the prince know he was coming and then stop with us each of the horsemen wore a spear in his hand and they rode a fine arabian horse each  toward seven we stopped to water our men horses bullocks cows and calves i said to the colonel sir here is a fine well of water and fine shady trees for i thought we should be late this is as pleasant a place as you have been at yet the colonel told mr forbes and mr orpin john wants to coax me to stay here all night but i will not be prevailed on i shall go on to cowrie  we arrived between eight and nine when we came near the fortification i was surprised to see the great elephant between me and the light of the moon when the colonel came to the house made ready for him there were upwards of twenty noblemen and gentlemen to receive him each of them saluted him doubly so that i was in pain for the colonel till it was over he went in and conversed with them they told him the prince would wait on him in the morning  there was a havaldar and his sepoys ordered to mount guard at the colonels door and there was plenty of provision sent us fish fowl rice curry stuff milk etc for all the attendants and hay and grain for the cattle we had no hot supper that night because the cooks were not come up the gentlemens two servants were walking after us on the road with their french horns on their shoulders and our two cooks along with them they often stopped to eat fruit and being three miles behind the jemmetdar the commanding officer of a garrison as we came along took them prisoners to give them up to us next day but at twelve at night the whole guard fell asleep and they made their escape and came up to us in the morning  this day was certainly the most entertaining and pleasant ever seen the gentlemen breakfasted under the jerrander and before them were all the troughs for washing the elephants and they were cleaned before them the colonel said one of those creatures could devour us all and for all that they stand like lambs to be ruled by their keepers and the stable where six hundred horses stood was before the house the gentlemen went to see the horses and the place where the elephants stood  the elephants were all brought and harnessed before the colonel at the desire of their keepers they lay down to be harnessed and to have the chariot put on their backs and at their desire they got up again  the place where we were at present was close by the sea side each elephant had a petty officer and two men to attend and clean him and two of them were taken into the fortification that was at the end of the town where were three thousand men fine fellows the elephants came back soon with twelve fine girls most rich and finely dressed they stopped for all the elephants and a troop of horse to attend the prince to see the colonel  the prince lived in a strong castle on an island in the sea about half a mile from shore when high water the sea came round the island and when low water a man could walk to the castle and not wet his shoes  the fortification in the island was strongly fortified about ten oclock we saw raggagee angerry with six elephants and a troop of horse and sepoys with a band of music along the sands i told the colonel the prince was coming he turned about to meet him and the two gentlemen attending the colonel the first elephant carried the standard next the colonel of the light horse and after him the prince then some of his lords and gentlemen when they alighted the colonel saluted the prince and his company and went into the house where they conversed for two hours music playing the whole time while they were in the house i was admiring the elephants and the horsemen each man had a sword by his side and a spear in his right hand the prince made presents to the gentlemen and said to sheek i think i saw another european dressed in scarlet  yes your highness there is a very good man steward to the colonel he pays all the money for the colonels attendants and his housekeeping call him in said the prince that i may see him he gave me a turban and a piece of silk worked with gold and he gave the same to baba and sheek i made a grand salam and retired when he was going the elephants were called up and fell down on their bellies till the prince got into his chariot by a ladder and in like manner did all the other gentlemen there was only the body of a chariot set on a thing like a mattrass to save the elephants back fixed on by a flat chain girth crupper and breast plate each elephant had a driver who sat on his neck and two servants on his back behind the chariot when they were all seated on the elephant they went away in the same order as they came then the gentlemen sat down in proper form to a good dinner the people were much entertained by seeing the gentlemen sit on chairs round a table to dinner for they themselves have no tables but sit on a carpet on the floor to eat after dinner the colonel of the light horse went with the gentlemen to show them all the gardens bathing places for the gentoos and the grand pagoda that raggagee angerry had built we looked in at the door and saw the lamp burning but we could not enter being christians they returned to tea and the colonel of the light horse drank two dishes of coffee made by a gentoo servant my master prevailed on him to sit on the chair and they conversed together my master told him of the works that were carrying on under his command at bombay which cost the honorable company one hundred thousand rupees per month after tea the gentlemen played at cards and the gentoo colonel left them at nine oclock raggagee angerry ordered the aiddecamp to go and see the colonel safe to bombay next morning we set off early and we had one of the princes trumpeters on horseback before us to sound his trumpet when we were going through any town  when we came outside the princes parks we servants fell behind to stop at a publickhouse i offered to treat them with some toddy they brought some to each of them in a cocoanut for each cast the landlady did not offer me at first but was prevailed upon at last to bring some arrack in a cocoa nutshell all this days journey was near the seaside in the princes country in the evening we came to abdalla belonging to the prince where we had every thing at the princes expense next morning the vessel arrived to take us over to bombay the trumpeter was sent back to cowrie and we all got on board and arrived safe at bombay that day his friends were glad to see him return and the doctor recommended him to live at his country house randall lodge on malabar hill for the benefit of the air and to use the bark and accordingly he did so his friends came to see him in the country he went to town to do business and when he had a large company he received them in his townhouse so i remained in the country and baba had the command in town i always had one of the cooks and tobie to stay with me when the colonel was in town at the country house there was a tindall that had the care of the house slept there and had a gentoo girl that lived with him and passed for his wife she desired the favor of me to give her an old shirt and i gave two one day all the men were in town and the girl and her niece were asleep in the verandah at the window of my room i gave her a shirt and she made my bed and was afterward very handy and i gave the tindall and her a little arrack now and then  one night the colonel came home late i put him to bed and walked into the verandah where all the servants were asleep in different places the veranda is like a shade in england to keep off the rain and the sun where the gentlemen sit in the daytime and enjoy the air i laid down on the gentoo girls left side and putting my hand on her waked and surprised her much in a moment she put her hand to my head and discovered from my hair being cued who it was i would not intrude but i went to bed next day i told her she should not lie so near the other people so she sent her niece home and laid the matt very near the window of my room i thought it was not so hot where they lay as in the room so i lay sometimes in the verandah and then i put black things on that i might not be discovered rosilla told me if i lay so near her again she would tell the tindall i asked her several times to eat with me when the tindall was present but she would not people of our cast cannot eat any food dressed for a christian nor have any connection with those out of our own cast  i am going to give my readers a small account of the island of bombay it is about fourteen miles long the town of the same name being at one end of the island where all the shipping and all the business is carried on at the other end is the town of mayam where there is a fortification  in the middle of the island is the governors house parella malabar hill where was my masters colonel egertons mr hunters mr jervices and some others it is like shooters hill in kent but rather higher at the one end is a chockee where there is always a european officer having the command on guard when any ships appear in sight a signal is made to the castle at bombay  about a mile from the guardroom is a village of the gentoos where is a pagoda and a grove the hill is mostly covered with large trees and is hardly known by the europeans except a few that live in the island here the gentoos go through all the forms of their religion without interruption and their gods are to be seen in proper form as i mentioned of darrygan and all the gentoos when they die are burned on the island of bombay next day by the sea side and the ashes of the body are cast into the sea when a husband dies his wife is sometimes burned by her own consent and choice with the dead husband if he has two wives the first has a right to burn and if she does not like it the second acquires it sometimes if the first wife has no children and the second has children by her husband the first wife gives the right of being burned up to the second if the mother does not burn with her husband her children live in disgrace they are as glad to burn as two women in england would be to get an estate for they think that they go to heaven directly when they burn with their husbands but these observations are confined to people of the first rank  when a woman has been married for years and has had no children and the husband is desirous to have an heir the priests ask her husband if he will let her come and live in the holy place amongst their pagods for one month or six weeks to try whether by her own fasting and their prayers they can prevail with their creator that she may have a child if he lets her come she is taken good care of by the priests and as her husband who never sees her all the while waits an answer at the end of the time mentioned if she tells the priests that she is with child he is desired to come into an apartment in the pagoda where is one of their gods cut out of stone the back toward the wall and the head of pumice stone hollow with a pipe to convey water from the priests room he is to put a fine handkerchief on the head of the idol and continue there one hour and then to take off his handkerchief if he finds it wet it is an answer that he is to have a child a gentoo is only allowed two wives but as many women as he can maintain when a wife dies he does not burn but marries another the manner of the women burning themselves with their dead husbands is as follows a large pile of dry wood is made and an arbor round it the woman is dressed in her best clothes and jewels her relations and friends walk about the place conversing and numbers come to see the ceremony at last she lays aside her jewels and gives them her family she takes leave of her children and of all her friends and is seated on the pile having the body of her husband laid on her lap she speaks to him for some time in a low voice she then drinks a strong narcotic potion lights the wood and the door is fixed the music sounds and the drums make a great noise and drown her cries after all is reduced to ashes the spectators depart like people in england from a funeral i said to myself why should i think this woman has done wrong she has done this to obtain heaven and gods favor and have not the great and most learned men in england and other christian countries done the same to gain heaven and gods favor who had the bible to direct them the hindoos or gentoos have no sundays but many holidays nor any people in the world but christians and jews i shall say very little of the mahomedans they are directed by their alcoran as we are by our bible and they bury in the same manner  i shall now give a little account of the persian worship of fire in bombay about half a mile from the gentoos pagoda on the highest part of malabar hill stands the persian burying place a large round tower built of stone and lime with an iron door dogs are kept to give the alarm no person but the priests is allowed admittance the fire burns in their church night and day and if their house were on fire they would not extinguish it but run for the english the persians address the fire when they cook their victuals they will not even breathe on the fire but put a cloth over their mouths and you cannot disoblige them more than by throwing water on the fire they will not blow out a candle with their breath but they will with the wind of their hands when i lived with colonel dow the persian servant when he went to bed at the hotwells brought the candle for me to put out when we walked together i have stopped till they prayed to the sun in the east when their women are in labor a person in the next room could not hear them nor suspect their situation they bring forth their children on the bedstead with nothing else under them their manner of burying is this they follow the corpse to malabar hill four miles distant all fastened one to another and dressed in white if one of them breaks wind and the others smell the stink the man is obliged to sit down on that place of the road and never stir till the company return from the buryingplace nor must he pray till they return when they come to the buryingplace the dead is taken in naked at the iron door after they have gone through their prayers they call in a dog to smell the corpse if the dog wag his tail and seem pleased the company lay the dead person on his back with his face toward the sun for they think he was a good man but if the dog drop his tail and turn away afraid they think he has been a wicked man and so they throw him down amongst the bones headlong and return home the birds of prey which are always lurking near a persian buryingplace hover and prey upon the carcass  now i return to my master when he was at the hotwells he had some enemies in the council who taking advantage of his absence examined his work at bombay and made a wrong report to the governor the colonel was displeased and the dispute ran very high and he insisted on returning to london and laying his complaint before the directors of the honorable east india company this in a great measure hurt his temper and he was preparing to go with the first ship for england one morning when i was dressing him at the countryhouse he said john whether would you rather go to england with me or remain in bombay i freely answered sir i will go to any part of the world with you very well then you must come to the house in town and take care of my things for when the black servants hear i am going they will begin to steal from me sir i will come and take great care so i took my leave of rosilla and randal lodge and came to town next morning general wedderburne the commander in chief sent for our coachman thomas smith to live with him he was an englishman and the only white coachman in the island he was a drummajor so the general had a right to command him which made the colonel very angry soon after this my master desired to see his clothes and he put them in different lots when he had put them properly together he called me and said john pack up these clothes for me to to wear in europe and those others i shall give to such and such persons and a few things that lie on the floor of very little value you may take them sir replied i if i remember right you said i should have your old clothes i did not think you would use me like a boy so you dont choose to take those things yes sir i will i see john you and i will not agree together so provide yourself sir i replied i thought i might speak what i have said i see we cannot john so provide yourself with a master and you shall go this day i said very well sir he desired me to make out my bill and he discharged me before dinner the black men were extremely sorry to see me turned off bapu said is it possible mr john you are going away captain macneal said john where are you going sir i am going to seek a place for myself so i left the colonel in      after living with him fifteen months as well as a king and during that time i had as much pleasure as ever a man had  so i went to lodge in the house of a sergeant who had married a black woman in one week i was sent for by mr shaw a gentleman of the council and a great enemy of the colonels i was hired at the townhouse and went to the country house at omercurry a mile from town here was a great show but i had my liquor served me out by a gentoo purvow then i thought of the dream i had the night before i left the colonel i dreamed i fell out of my bed over a high rock and could not get up till i went round a large mountain here was a large family of servants in the kitchen two portugueze cooks and five slave boys but none of the servants had any liquor but myself and that was very little i drank nothing but arrack and what i wanted i bought for myself mr shaw had a public night every week with a supper and very often on that night a ball besides dinners to his friends who came on business i was confined at omercurry with the fever and ague every three days i went to dr tennant for the bark he told me i had got the colonels disorder and the best i could do would be to go to europe i waited to see if i could get better but rather grew worse and i had a great desire to go to england there was only one captain a mr rice to sail i went one morning to call for him to know if he would give me my passage to england the colonel came out of the dining room first into the verandah and said well john are you tired of your new place already no sir but i am taken with the fever and ague and i want to go home i took no further notice of the colonel when captain rice saw that he came out and i made a bow to him with my hat in my hand sir i am come to desire the favor that you would let me have my passage to england as i am taken with the ague and i will pay what you desire he told me he had not room if i were to give him an hundred guineas you must wait till the first ship that sails after me when i came down stairs sheek and baba said master john you have done wrong if you had paid the compliment to the colonel and desired him to have spoke to captain rice for you he would have got your passage but they find you bear anger i said i am sorry i have neither craft nor cunning to dissemble i went home and remained till another opportunity i had no work to do but to order in the house was one rustam a persian who had been steward many years and was very rich he was above waiting at table he bought every thing and when i wanted any thing i told him and he sent his servant for he kept one for himself and paid his wages mr shaw would sooner lay out a guinea for any thing than he would five shillings for liquor so rustam bought for the table and i made the bill of fare the moormen said mr john we like you because god has given you a temper like a girl and we can do every thing that we see you do except to order a dinner or large supper we see in bombay that every thing is formed in your head before it is dressed and where to put every man to his place about two fields from omercurry was sally percivalls country house she took a walk sometimes to see me when she wanted a letter wrote to any distance she employed me she was very fond of walking to our house with her son in her hand omercurry was very pleasant there were a great many large trees about the house and fine gardens my master was generally in town all day except when he had company when i went to write a letter for sally percival i always dined with her and the time was somewhat pleasant except when the fit of the ague and fever came on i was pretty well when she called for me if i was not at home she desired them to let mr shaws writer know she wanted to speak to him she was a goodnatured and a goodtempered woman as ever lived and had not the least pride though she was worth upwards of four thousand pounds sterling sometimes she conversed with me about girls who had been in keeping by gentlemen she said mr john there are two roads a good and an evil one if i should step into the good one i should like to remain there i said what you say is right mrs percival and upon my word madam i believe if you were married you would make as good a wife as any in asia and if i was good enough for you i would propose myself for your husband o do not say it mr john you are very good if i like a man if he had not one rupee i would sooner have him than one with two thousand rupees with a deceitful heart all the gentlemen here speak very well of you mr john  before the colonel sailed my master had said some words disrespectful of him and the colonel sent him a challenge as my master was one of the council he made a report thereof to the governor and the colonel was put under an arrest and confined sor some weeks captain rice wanted to sail as he had got his dispatches one night after my master was going to mount where governor hornby lived mr shaw called me and gave me a loaded pistol and a hanger and he took the other pistol and his sword and said john come along with me when we came before the gate my master said john stop there till i go in and speak to governor hornby when my master was in the house one of the aid de camps captain stuart just alighted from his horse when captain stuart saw me it being darkish he said is this you john yes sir good god what are you doing here in this warlike manner sir i am here with mr shaw my master is he with governor hornby yes sir so it soon got wing and went through the whole island that mr shaw took john for fear of meetingwith colonel keating and it afforded a laugh at many a table be ready john that is the colonel sir i am ready it is only a bush sir but i declare i thought the colonel was before us are you sure john your pistols are primed and flints good yes sir  captain rice sailed and colonel keating with him i remained till captain thomas tailor of the hampshire indiaman arrived as he visited at my masters house i asked him if he would give me a passage to england he said by all means get yourself ready and when i sail for europe you shall go along with me  at this time i had the third day ague when the hampshire laid at bombay seedy a sovereign prince whom i mentioned before came to negociate business with the governor and council he had a house made ready for him and plenty of provision for himself and all his train when he had transacted his business he visited all the principal men in bombay and wherever he came he drank some coffee made by one of his own cast  soon after seedy the prince went away the nabob of broach came on business with the governor and council he had four hundred and fifty men in his train the house allotted for the nabob was joining my masters townhouse and his tents were pitched before our house and governor hornby allowed the nabobs standard to be set up at the head of his little camp he continued at bombay for three weeks his attendants were very richly dressed he had two bands of music which played all the night when he was asleep the one relieved the other  when his affairs were settled the nabob visited the governor and all the council at their houses and general wedderburne at his country house where he went on a visit he had two hundred men to attend him mostly in arms with colors flying  when he came to see my master at omercurry he entered our parlour sat down with our master and conversed all his principal servants entered and stood round the whole time and i behind my masters chair  it is thought a grand thing in asia to have an european servant as the nabob was a mahomedan our two servants of his cast served him with coffee and the rose water sprinkled on the parlour this was all the entertainment he had where he visited he ate at home and his victuals were dressed by his own cook  the hampshire only waited for a fair wind the passengers were all ordered on board i took my leave of bombay and went on board and then the ague and fever left me i waited at the captains table as there were a good many passengers and i messed with the captains servants i got better every day  the first place we stopped at was tillicherry mr boddam was chief at that time we stopped ten days to take in pepper and other goods the captain took me on shore with his own servant james clerk who was a fine singer and we enjoyed ourselves every night at an englishmans who kept a public house in tillicherry it is one of the pleasantest places i ever saw we next stopped at cuchiline which belongs to the dutch we stopped here two nights to buy provisions which were in plenty and cheap  when we were a month out from bombay we stopped at anjengoe a place of our own to complete our loading we were here a week fowls sold here at the rate of eight for a rupee and pine apples at one penny each and every thing else in proportion when an english soldier goes on guard he takes two bottles of arrack to drink in the night  when the honorable companys goods were all on board and the ship ready to sail the wind blew very strong the sea was very rough and the captain was afraid of a leeshore the captain desired his servant and me to go on board and take the other gentlemens servants with us we carried the captains and the other passengers linens anjengoe was the last port we were to touch at in india the hampshire was two miles from shore at anchor the captain came to the beach to see us go over the highest surf the highest in asia except madrass we got over the first and second but the third was about twelve feet high it blew so strong that it threw our boat and all of us into the sea and with a great struggle we saved our lives and the articles we had  after dinner we were sent back mr reinek the chief came down to the beach to see the coolies do their duty in taking us off at this time all the things were wet and of course more heavy we got over the first and second as before but the third overthrew us all together the linens being wet went to the bottom the next surf knocked the coolie boat upon james clerk the captains servant and broke his thigh  we had a hard struggle for our lives we came back to mr reineks house and stopped till next morning it being calmer we got easy off the things were all lost james clerk was left behind and when we got on board i took his place we had a good passage for england till we came between the latitude of the south part of madagascar and the cape of good hope there we had tempestuous weather for three weeks with a foul wind so that the captain furled the sails and lashed up the helm and let the ship drive where she would  captain tailor and his officers were in great trouble of mind we got so near the cape with a lee shore that we could see the table land and the lyons rump and had the wind continued we should have dashed against the rocks but it pleased god the wind changed and carried us further on the sea we had very bad weather going round the cape of good hope insomuch that the whole ships company expected every day to be lost sometimes the officers on watch were knocked down on deck by a sea coming overboard and the men were washed overboard and never seen again one time two men were washed over and the next sea threw them in again one of our best seamen was easing himself on the head and a sea washed him away he called out a rope a rope captain but he disappeared and was never seen afterward  the weather was so stormy that the sailors said they saw the flying dutchman the common story is that this dutchman came to the cape in distress of weather and wanted to get into harbor but could not get a pilot to conduct her and was lost and that ever since in very bad weather her vision appears the sailors fancy that if you would hail her she would answer like another vessel at length we got into the trade winds and had fine weather so that we hardly shifted a sail for two weeks when the ships company had ease after hard work we came down with pleasure to st helena and stopped ten days on shore i was actingsteward and captain taylors servant as they dine early at st helena we walked every day after dinner up the country amongst the white farmers as the country is very high we could see a great way at sea and up the country we saw a great many white girls farmers daughters  st helena is a wholesome pleasant place and a fine keen searching air if noblemen and gentlemen of great britain and ireland would go to madeira and st helena for their health instead of going to france and portugal they would be sure to reestablish their health  when captain tailor had stopped as long as he wished for and had got provisions and water on board he set sail for the island of ascension sixteen degrees north from st helena the captain stopped two days to get fish and turtle for the ships company which are got there in plenty no person lives on the island because there is neither water rain nor spring the island has no grass all the year round it is thirty miles round and has very high mountains but where the ships come to anchor it is level and the sand on the beach is as white as snow when an officer and his men go on shore to catch turtle the men run and turn them on their back while they are asleep at night on the beach while they last the whole ships company have turtle to eat and sometimes one ship will catch forty or fifty large ones from ascension we set sail and the first place we stopped at was portsmouth where we were a few days and again we set sail and arrived at blackwall after a passage of above six months and i had been gone from england four years i stopped with capt tailor one month till the ship was unloaded  i was out of place three months i hired myself to james nowland esquire in newmanstreet oxfordstreet this gentleman gave mr shaw my character in the island of bombay when i left colonel keating i lived with him six months one sunday in particular when he had company after dinner he called for a pack of cards and there happened to be none in the house and i could get none to buy he rung the bell in anger and because i could not get him cards to play he turned me away next master i had was mr lecall a dutchman who lodged in pall mall court his dutch servant had returned and as i was acquainted at the house i called there by chance the mistress went up stairs and spoke about me and as the people of the house knew me he took me without a character i lived with him three months every monday morning he gave me fifteen shillings per week and i had plenty of every thing beside that i wanted he had his dinners from the star and garter he was as good a master as ever i met with if he did not come home by twelve at night i was to go to bed and he came home to breakfast he said john i am under the necessity of going to paris before i return to amsterdam you had better go with me and i shall not have to hire a servant in paris as you know the city of paris  sir i will go round cape horn with you if you please so he allowed me one shilling per day more for traveling we set out for dover in a postchaise and crossed over to calais and in the same manner set off post for paris we put up at monsieur semunnilies hotel de park royal rue fauxbourg st german at the apartments mr crauford had when i was with him in paris he found he must have a carriage as there are not chairs as in london i went to the same livery stables that furnished mr crauford with a chaise and horses and i desired a carriage to attend my master when he said john if you do not like to go out with the chariot get a lackeys place i told him i would go out with the carriage with all my heart and save him that expense and by going out with the chariot i had one livre per day from the master of the chariot and horses as is the custom in paris  we were three months in paris which made ninety livres for my master jaunted about paris and went to versailles louis the xv was there at that time it is a fine place much like windsor and the gardens are very large i went to the kings fine chapel on sunday the king the dauphin and dauphiness were in the gallery at the one end of the chapel we stopped here one week  i can hardly express the pleasure i had with mr lecall when his business was done we went post to lisle in flanders and we were there two days from thence we went to ypres a city belonging to the dutch at this place his coachman came with his chariot and horses and stopped here one day to rest the horses the coachman could not speak french nor english and i could speak no dutch but we spent the evening agreeably together the landlord was interpreter between us my master paid me and went home and next day i set off and in two days arrived at calais and crossed over to dover after my arrival in london i soon got another master to go abroad with mr dawson from dublin we set off for the german spa through flanders my master had a great liking for this country the people were just after his own heart for he had a great desire for gambling and that is the delight of foreigners my master was gone from england one year and in that he gained one thousand pounds what he lost and gained he marked down in a book one night at listle coming home he told me john i have just gained one thousand pounds sir i am very glad for that will clear your expenses very nearly said he my master and a mr stuart from holland a scotch gentleman kept house together at spa while he stopped at spa in six weeks mr stuart went home my master then got colonel ofagan in the emperors service to be in the house with him he had a german valet and footman my master went very often to aix la chapelle at the hotel of madam buchie there were always a great many ladies and gentlemen she had a daughter married to a gentleman in liege and a pretty girl at home unmarried madam buchie had her coachman and footman in livery and so had her soninlaw which made her house more respected by the ladies and gentlemen  my master was in this country five months in aix la chapelle spa liege and brussels then in the winter at paris where we put up at the hotel de saxe rue fauxbourg st german my master got a carriage coachman and footman and he gave a rich livery and made as genteel appearance as any in paris he went to versailles and as far as bourdeaux where he had relations in the wine trade and there we were six weeks and then came to london by sea  after being in london a few weeks we went to holyhead in wales and to dublin in the packet mr dawsons house was in the mall he had a large family of servants i stopped two weeks at his house then he got me a master one mr brown who was going to london on business i hired myself with him two months he lodged in the haymarket at the seven stars a milliners he left london mr brown and another gentleman took a postchaise for parkgate i was then out of place soon after i heard of a gentleman wanting a servant to go into wales mr bate at his hotel in the adelphi told me to go to mr freeman in the temple when i saw him he said did mr bate send you to me yes sir i want a servant to go with me as it is the vacation and the company is out of town to dress me and go round the west of england and i want to see wales my servant is of no use to travel as he cannot dress hair so we set out in two days for oxford cheltenham worcester and gloucester and malvern wells he was well pleased with the journey and liked the prospect and situation of the house at the wells much  when we left gloucestershire going over malvern hills my master as being before saw a long bundle on the road he said john take up that bundle and see what is in it i got off my horse and opened the bundle and found two new shifts a gown two pair of sheets and two pair of stockings it is your property sir as you saw it first my master said john lay the bundle on the stone or hang it on that tree and whoever has lost it will find it when they come to look for it i said sir i beg your pardon but i had rather not but take it along with me for another person may take it whose property it is not sir i beg you will let me take it so we went on and by and by a boy came running along and said gentlemen did you see a bundle we dropped it from the wagon as we came from gloucester city my master said who does the bundle belong to please your honor it belongs to my young mistress she went with the wagon to buy the things that are in the bundle she is going to be married next week what is her name sir her name is molly williams she is farmer williams daughter she is to be married to young bob giles the cooper my master said my servant has got the bundle and when we overtake the wagon she shall have it when we came alongside of the wagon my master said my dear i have found your bundle i hear you are to be married yes sir take care of your bundle otherwise it may not fall into so good hands again sir i am very much obliged to you i have one thing to tell you my dear take great care of your maidenhead and if you should lose it if you do not cry o you will never get it again  we went to ross hereford monmouth chepstow abergaveny and back to chepstow again my master admired this place much he said it was as sweet a rural place as ever he saw he stopped two days at the three cranes he desired me to have what punch i liked to drink in the evening with the farmers which was the cause of a good deal of money being spent and the landlord was sorry when we came away we crossed the old ferry and came to bristol and next day we came to bath and stopped and at the end of eight weeks from london he returned after a pleasant journey i left him and as i was coming along coventrystreet i met one of mr mainess clerks the banker in jermynstreet he asked if i was in place i said sir i

servant or as a companion i am a servant sir and not a proud one i do assure you very well give me your address and if i want you i will send for you as i was coming out i met a german going up i went into the next public house and soon after this man came in i asked him if he had success he said he had and was to go to france with him he spoke to me about you and said you were more like a gentleman than a servant now i am plain dressed and i have got the place three days after i went after sir francis hobburns place i was dressed plain without lace i went up stairs to him he was going on his travels when he saw me he said he had got one when i came down stairs he rung the bell and said to his footman how came you to send that fellow to me is he dressed like a person for my place or

well dressed sir william not being at home lady abdy told me she did not want a servant three days after i saw the servant that sent me after the place who said i am sorry you went dressed in a gold laced waistcoat against the candle light it made a more rich appearance she said you were too grand for a family servant i said to myself a man does not know what to do for the best in this world the next master i had i got in an odd manner in brewerstreet goldensquare i met an acquaintance of my own who told me he had been after a place a young gentleman at mr gordons an undertakers house was come to london for his health and the advice of the doctors i asked a guinea per week and he would not give it if you like you may go and see what he will give you i told him i would and bid him go into the public house till i came back i knew that a young gentleman from the country not accustomed to keep a servant would not give that money i called for mr lowrie at mr gordons and i was sent up to his room sir i believe you want a servant i do after asking some questions and he was pleased with the answers he said what shall i give you per week fifteen shillings sir if you please i will give

pleased with my attention to my master i was his nurse and cook and made all his drinks it was a good place for me as ever a man could wish to enjoy i had several presents for my attention  my master got well and went into scotland then i was out of place some months and lived on the fruits of my labor that was my custom when in place i was careful and out of place i went genteel and was sober and was ready in three hours to go any where in the world next place i had was to live with george spencer esquire norfolkstreet in the strand i hired myself to him for forty guineas per year he was a madeira merchant and had his partners in madeira he commonly lived in norfolkstreet but he went into the country through the west of england and he stopped in bath and bristol weeks at a time he was mostly on the move he delighted in traveling when on the road he never had a bottle of wine but i had part of it he went to see his friends in dublin the madeira merchants and it was the only place in the world i liked to go to i saw my old acquaintance i gave a ball to all my friends at a public house in capelstreet to upwards of forty people that it might be no trouble to the landlord i had one ham baked and three turkies cold put into a sideroom to eat when they liked i gave punch wine and negus and whatever the house afforded the company were all gone by two in the morning being mostly gentlemens servants men and maids when they were gone i drank a bottle of wine with the landlord i had liberty the whole night i paid my bill four pound ten shillings the music fifteen shillings and five shillings to the two servants for their trouble in all five pounds ten shillings there was neither glass nor plate broke the company behaved so well at this time i was called the handsome macdonald if i called for any person if they were out the maid would tell when her fellow servants came home mr macdonald called which mr macdonald for in dublin there are a great many of that name the maids would say it was the handsome macdonald that gave the ball in london i was called beau macdonald by the men and the scotch frenchman  we had great pleasure in this jaunt to ireland my master went first to the city of cork to settle his bills with the wine merchants and then returned to dublin and afterward to belfast in the north of ireland we traveled in a noddy from dublin and back again that is a one horse chaise and the driver sits behind the horse so the horse draws three people on the north road i could give my master a description of the country as i had been there before we returned to dublin and then through wales to london i lived with my master one year one day in particular my master dined out and i waited on him and at night we both came home merry when i put his hair in papers and undressed him i took up his shoes in my left hand and put his coat over the same arm and seeing me do so he said you take up my clothes as if you had never seen any clothes before  sir i have handled better than yours many times he turned me out of the room and next morning he discharged me so i lost a good place for speaking one foolish word and i was very sorry for it  in two weeks after i was walking through st jamess park and i met james macpherson esquire of manchester buildings he asked me if i was in place i told him i had left george spencer esquire about two weeks ago and got no master at present he said he was going to france and would take me along with him come in the morning i shall go to dover tomorrow night my black man will pack up my clothes i went in the morning and we set out in a postchaise to dover that night and next day crossed over to calais and slept there that night next day we set off for paris and put up at the hotel d angleterre rue rukelow and there my master was two months he had a carriage coachman and footman my master and some other gentlemen in company went to versailles for one day the palace is handsome the gardens extensive and the stables the handsomest i ever saw in my life at this time louis xv was ill of the smallpox and died while we were in france when my master left paris he went post to lisle afterward to ypres we stopped in this city one week the three scotch regiments lay here called the scotch hollanders they were commanded by colonels stuart gordon and johnstone i thought myself in scotland seeing so many of my own countrymen  when we left ypres we went to dunkirk and through graveline to calais we were here two days and then crossed over to dover then home to london as i was only with my master for the journey i was paid next day and again i was out of place the next master i had was james couts esquire banker in the strand who was going to make the tour of england for his health he waited one month in london before he could get a servant to dress him he wore a wig over his hair he had twenty servants that came but they could not dress him it required a person that understood the business of wigmaking when he was dressed no person could tell there was any thing but his own hair and he had the handsomest head and face i ever saw in my life he hired me and next day we set out for his country house at hampton village then for cheltenham with our coach and four horses and two saddle horses my master was accompanied by his daughter miss couts and her cousin miss stuart of allan bank in scotland there were the coachman and postilion the footboy and i when on the road the first thing i did in the morning was to knock at the ladies door to call them at other times they got up when they pleased at this time there was at cheltenham a great deal of company my master lodged at a quakers house the proprietor of the wells we went out every day airing it is the custom at the wells to go out after breakfast and after dinner we went to morvin wells and to the city of gloucester a night at one place and a night at the other place and back to cheltenham again we stopped at cheltenham two months and jaunting about in this manner then we set off for worcester birmingham manchester preston matlockwells and called at all the noblemen and gentlemens houses on the road and so on in this manner to carlisle city we traveled to every part worth seeing in the north of england we crossed the tweed from cornhill to coldstream and remained in that beautiful country the south part of scotland two months visiting from one family to another but we were chiefly in the merse at the house of sir john stuart of allan bank my masters cousin we went to kelso berwick dunse and went over to the holy island a few days and we partook of several kettles of fish on the banks of the tweed which merry feasts are always accompanied with dancing when we left this place we we went to harrowgate from thence we went to london and afterward to my masters house at hampton after he had been at home some time my master found he must go some where else and his physicians advised him to go to italy for the air of that country and he consented therefore i had warning given me as he was obliged to have an italian servant to take my place mr rosi was hired but did not come home till my master was ready to go  mr couts was so well pleased with my service for seven months as i never was once out of the way made of all sorts of drinks that was ordered for him and whatever he wanted that he made me several presents of clothes and when he paid me my wages he gave me two guineas over and told mr brown the winemerchant in cravenstreet to recommend me  i went to dover with mr couts and returned when he and the ladies went on board of ship i came back to london and in two weeks sir john stuart of allan bank came to london on his way to portugal for the benefit of his health i suppose i had been recommended for his servant when he should come to london by mr couts he called for me at two or three places i heard of it i went to him at mrs elliots in brewerstreet where he lodged he told me he was going to lisbon for his health that he did not think that he should live till he reached there and if i was not engaged he would take me with him i told him i should be very happy to embrace the offer he had a carriage and stopped a few weeks in london and in winter november      we set out for salisbury sir john was then twenty years of age then for dorchester after to exeter there my master was one week waiting for mr march a gentleman going to lisbon of his acquaintance when mr march came we went post to falmouth and we stopped there near a week till a fair wind came round we went on board the expedition packet captain robertson with a great many passengers ladies and gentlemen many who had never been at sea before we set sail with a fair wind the weather was fine for that time of the year but the fine day caused a great confusion at night the ship not being prepared for a storm the tarpawling not being over the hatchways and other places open a great storm arose in the middle of the night when we got in the bay of biscay all at once all hands were called to save the sails and masts the hatchways being uncovered we shipped a sea which made the whole ships company think we were going to the bottom in a moment so much water came in as set the chests a floating in three minutes more we shipped another which knocked me out of my hammock then i believe we all said god have mercy on us i laid in one of the mens hammocks in the galley on the lee side of course on the lower side for the ship was near on her broad side before the sails were lowered the chests and trunks rolled on me i could hardly get out i crawled out with great difficulty and went into the cuddy where the captain and the gentlemen dined my master was there in his hammock when he saw me he said good god john i suppose we shall be all lost what shall i do must i get up  sir do you lie still there is no danger we have got a land wind what is a land wind sir a wind that comes from the land that will drive us out to sea and then there is no danger when we have got searoom i sat and kept hold of the mast just beside my master by this time the ladies and gentlemen were in fits when the sails and masts were saved the hatches were covered over it rained and the wind was wonderfully strong but as god would have it no lives were lost the captain and most of his ships company had their wives and families at falmouth and there was such crying for fear of never seeing them again one of the mariners that had been in the trade for eighteen years was frightened into fits after the greatest danger was over the captain lay down he got up again light headed sir john asked me if i did not think it best for him to get up  no sir you are in the best place you can be for there is not the least danger do not show the least marks of fear and then they cannot laugh at you the ladies have been in fits and some of the gentlemen also for my part i have been in worse storms than this many times and had the ship been prepared we should not have been so ill off as we are we waited with patience till seven in the morning when i got my master up to clear the place for breakfast by this time he was glad that he took my advice to lie still in the night finding things were out of danger my master went on deck where he saw such a scene as he never saw before the sea was very high indeed and the wind continued so my master stood for one hour without stirring to see the raging of the sea and the mariners putting things to rights after the nights fright  mr march and my master were speaking about the storm he said sir john this lets you know what the poor mariners go through in a hurricane and in a battle at sea the rough weather continued so that my master wore one shirt for ten days after this we had fine weather and kept our christmas on sea and the company was very happy but one fine moonlight night we saw a man of war making after us full sail and put up all the sail we could but she gained on us and the captain made the ship ready to fight the mail was brought up to be ready to throw overboard they fired some guns after us to bring us to mr bowen a gentleman of falmouth went on the poop and i stood with him he said we were as safe there as below the man of war was still gaining on us but the captain put off no time to make ready by and by two portuguese gentlemen came up to look how things were going on and that moment a ball came across our ships rigging they both went down directly to the passengers and told this so you may consider our situation we thought they would be all taken soon after another ball came across our foreship and they hailed us and desired our captain to lay too and so he did and after all we found her to be our friend the ship was the earl of dunmore the captain of the dunmore let our captain know he would send one of his officers on board of us to hear the news for he had been a great while from england by and by this officer and boats crew came to us as bold as heroes i said to myself i will be damned but you have a great stock of impudence to put our gentlemen and ladies in such a fear by this time the passengers were come up to the captains diningplace when the captain received the lieutenant of the man of war he entered so bold that the ladies looked at him with fear surprise and gladness the same as the daughters of king darius did at alexander when he took them in their tents he received the news and informed us of what he knew he drank grog and his men had grog to drink alongside so they went away again and the passengers went to bed with easy minds for two days more we had a pleasant passage and got in sight of the rock of lisbon when we came near the entrance of the river a poor fisherman came on board and took the command of the ship to pilot her into the tagus to the anchoringplace on the last night of the year we all went to the english hotel kept by mr and mrs durar from northumberland next morning at breakfast we laughed to think we had been in lisbon part of two years the hotel was large and stood on the highest ground near lisbon nearest the sea there was a great deal of company in the hotel english irish scots welsh gentlemen and servants some had carriages others horses while they remained at lisbon and they made a fine appearance when they went together an airing sir john had a carriage and coachman and two saddlehorses the owner of the saddlehorses was an englishman and he acted as his footman and groom my master made the genteelest appearance of any gentleman in lisbon as my master and i were going into spain at our departure from lisbon we both had a spanish master we did not mind the portuguese language my master made not any improvement in the spanish language he was so much out but i stopped at home and got my lesson when the other servants went out amongst whores and after their own fun and they laughed at me for staying at home but by and by when their doctors bills came in i laughed at them and after eight weeks at lisbon when we were on the road they were obliged to call me to interpret for them when they left lisbon their pleasure there was over and i enjoyed my own satisfaction my master though he could speak french and latin as well as english was obliged to ask me the names of things in spanish because when i was in lisbon i lost no time but learned as much of the spanish language as i could  lisbon is the finest situation of a city in the world for trade and a fine air it is built on seven hills on the side of a fine river you may see fifty miles across a fine country by looking out of the windows in lisbon the river is eight miles broad just against the city if you are a mile on the river in a boat you may see every house in town at one view at this time general maclean a scotchman was commander in chief of the army in portugal i have often thought he had more respect paid to him than the royal family had to them soon after we arrived in lisbon a princess died six weeks old she had a grander burial than a king or queen  people of age go into purgatory to suffer for their sins till they are prayed out of purgatory but as she had committed no sin she was to be received into heaven directly at the funeral there were about fifteen hundred horse in the procession carrying noblemen and gentlemen besides carriages most grandly dressed with caps and feathers in a few days after the king was taken ill and kept his bed a long time till all his physicians gave him over they told the queen they could prescribe no more for him she was the king of spains own sister she desired to call dr wade that attended the english in lisbon he was an irish gentleman he was desired to see the king next morning the queen said to the physicians what shall we do that the king may not be alarmed by seeing a new face they answered the queen they would stand round the kings bed as usual and that dr wade should look through under one of our arms it was agreed to by the queen when the doctor saw the queen after seeing the king he told her he would give the king what would be of service to him so he saw the king every morning in the same manner as i have mentioned he had the king six weeks under his care which was the time he lived dr wade was rewarded for his skill and he was also knighted his name was now sir john wade and he lived very much respected and when he was sent for by the portuguese he had double the fees they gave their own countrymen sir john my master jaunted round the country and was got a great deal better and began to think of going over land to cadiz in spain he hired a chaise and mules and mules for the baggage and he had an interpreter to go as far as the confines of portugal there were two french gentlemen in company with my master going to cadiz they had a chaise and black servant after dinner we sailed across the river tagus where our chaises were ready at the inns at alldea gallega at the sign of the frog there we were shown up to a very long room with nothing in it but in ten minutes i furnished the place henry the interpreter and i put up our camp table stools my masters camp bed and miss kittys curtains i opened up my little case with wine and put it on the table for sir john we had one end of the room and the two frenchmen the other i put out the travellingpye and the gentlemen had another we had plates and dishes made of tin knives spoons glasses pepper our own candles every thing for our use as it was early in the night for supper my master asked me if i could get him a dish of the queen of scots soup i sent henry to enquire if he could get chickens eggs and parsley below i made a fine dish of soup and sir john invited the frenchmen to sup with him they liked the soup and ate nothing else no person belonging to the house came near us and we wanted nothing below but water and a kettle to boil the soup when i was in the kitchen i had an opportunity of seeing the family go to supper the master mistress children and maid sat down as if they feared god he took off his hat put it before his face and said grace we all slept in one room henry and i had only one blanket and our great coats under our heads  from the time i left lisbon till i returned to england i became or traveled as a roman catholic i had seen many different religions and found it was best to pay respect to the people and conform to their religion in the morning we packed up our baggage and paid our bills the two chaises brought to the door two mules for henry and me a man on foot to bring our two mules back and another man with two mules for our baggage each of us wore a sword or hanger we never went faster than a wagon in england except down hill the carriages are strong and heavy laden the roads are bad in the spring  when my master saw that the two gentlemen had only one chaise for them and their black boy he desired one of them to come in with him so we set off for palmella through a fine country one of the frenchmen gave me his gunpowder and shot and net that i might shoot at game as i rode along i put the powder shot and bag for the game round my shoulder and the gun in my hand and was glad of the opportunity as it is an open country and the game plenty i had great luck i rode on a little before and i often shot the game in the view of the gentlemen my mule stopped in a moment and neither of the mules were afraid of the report of the gun what i shot in the day henry and i dressed at night  we got to palmella by noon a fine village we dined there after stopping long enough to refresh we set off for st ubes a large town in the morning we went for molines and on our way crossed the river cadaon after dinner we went through a fine lvel country between two ridges of fine high hills and at night arrived at alcaar where we stopped we were obligated to go and buy any thing we wanted the maid supplied us in the kitchen with wood and water and henry and i were cooks in the morning we left alcaar to go to gandola this day we crossed two branches of the river cadaon and the same day we bought twentyfour full grown sweet oranges for threepence it being a fine country for fruit and trees on our right to the west of gandola was a large ridge of mountains covered with trees and the country well cultivated after dinner we passed through villa and through terreir adaves both on branches of the river guadiana one of the longest rivers in all spain in the morning of this day one of the french gentlemen asked henry to come into the chaise with the black boy and let him ride his mule henry went into the chaise and the gentleman rode along with me we both conversed on different things it was a fine day and i had plenty of sport with the gun at last i came to a cross road where was the virgin mary and christ in her arms i put off my hat lowered it and put it on again and then crossed myself he said dont you belong to the church of england yes sir i thought you never paid any respect in your worship to the holy virgin in our worship we do not but we esteem her  at night we came to a fine large city called bijah with fine houses and well fortified here we had very good inns the gentlemen had a bed and so had henry and i but sir john lay in his own bed we had fish partridges and chickens with vegetables and we had fine wine and every thing agreeable opposite to the inn was a ball of the middling sort of the young people in town after my master was gone to bed henry and i went over and we were let in we sat and saw them dance country dances and dance in the portuguese manner which was very entertaining i paid a quarter dollar for henry and me and came away they were very civil to us but there was nothing at the ball to drink when the young gentlemen handed the girls to their chairs after the dance was done they took their snuff box out of their pocket and gave their partner a pinch of snuff we came home and had some wine to drink and left them to take snuff  in the morning early we set off for mortola on the confines of portugal this day we passed through the most beautiful country for hills woods and waters we crossed several branches of the river guadiana we passed through alvistil a fine town massejena another fine large town and dined at alcarina after dinner we passed through some villages and passed by some convents and in the evening arrived at mortola this town stands very high on the banks of the river guadiana surrounded by a great number of very high hills of bare rocks more barren and wild than ever i saw in the highlands of scotland we put up at the only inn in town a very good one the master and mistress were very good people we had plenty of every thing i made the queen of scots soup and the mistress and i drank a bottle of wine together there was something singular in the man that walked along with us to bring back the two saddle mules he was one of the most obliging and condescending men i ever saw you could not speak to him but off went his hat he was always alongside my mule when i gave him a penny to get a pint of wine he was as happy as a prince  here we discharged our chaises and mules because we were to go by water we were very good customers to the house besides what we had in the house we had provisions from them to serve us on the water  next day after breakfast we all went into a boat to go down the river for agomenta in spain we sailed ten miles on the river in portugal and twenty between portugal and spain portugal on our right hand and spain on our left sometimes we went ashore in spain at other times in portugal at the villages in the evening we came to castromarin a fine new village here we remained till sir john showed the governor of javira his passport and got another to go out of portugal i must say of the country people they are civil innocent and harmless though it is said a mans life is in danger in lisbon if he be late out at night that may be because the desperate in all countries flock to the capital  the portuguese at a distance from lisbon are as much afraid of the lisbonites as any other strangers my master was not ready till the afternoon of the next day then we crossed the river and went into the city of agamonte in spain we left the two french gentlemen behind at castromorin the river at this part is three miles broad sir john was shown to the best inns in town we had good wine and a good supper made ready by the landlady a widow a good sort of a woman when the cloth was laid they put three covers on the table but when i put down the supper i took off all the plates but one and i waited on my master and when he was done henry and i supped very comfortably in the same room for it was both parlour and kitchen  when we crossed the river from portugal to the city of agamonte we entered into the province of andalusia formerly a kingdom in the morning the gentleman that my master was recommended to sent for a man and hired five mules to carry us and the baggage the gentleman mr lepo lent sir john an english saddle to be returned with the mules henry and i rode above the baggage when all was ready we rode through the fine city of agamonte as we were riding along the street a fine woman came to look out of a window but seeing us she in a moment disappeared for fear that any one should see her looking after strangers agamonte is a fine city for trade being near the sea on the banks of the river in a fine cultivated country we went to taron to dinner and at night to lepe through a beautiful level country all this days journey was near the sea taron and lepe are fine large towns but no women to be seen the spaniards like the portuguese are kind and civil and have not the least idea of overcharging like the french next day we dined at cortay and afterward crossed the river sally and in the afternoon crossed the river odier to gibralcon a large town where we had good accommodations when the two spaniards went to buy corn for the mules i went along with them there was a woman of the town who wanted me to pass the night with her i promised but i did not perform but henry went in place of me we were very happy here the whole evening sir john and i and the man belonging to the mules slept in one room and in the closet that had no door slept the master and mistress and the daughter a pretty girl about fifteen i got up in the night to make water but finding no pot i went to the daughters bedside and took her pot i put it beside sir johns campbed and just before day light i put it back again and then i lay down about six oclock henry called us i made some fine chocolate for sir john and after breakfast we set out for st juan a long stage of eighteen miles we stopped at a house on the road six miles from gibralcon to give the mules hay and water and we ate some hardboiled eggs bread and wine which we always had with us soon after when we were on the road it began to rain and continued incessantly the whole day we had not a place to stop at till we came to st juan i was obliged to take part of the oilcloth that covered the baggage to hang on sir johns on the side next the storm we had several winemerchants on the road with us  when we arrived we were put into a house quite empty the stable was part of the house and the master of the house lived next door his name was phillips he kept a shop like a grocers or chandlers shop in london he sent us wood for fire or whatever we wanted we were there three nights on account of the rain having swelled the rivers so high that we could not pass there was no bridge nor ferryboat phillips sent whatever we wanted and was a good hearty rich fellow the third night i was there he dressed me in a spanish dress and took me out with him to some of his friends houses and to a public house where we stopped some time  next day we were informed the rivers were fallen we set off for lucar and in the way we crossed the rivers tinto and moncanilla lucar is a large city remarkable for fine churches which we went to see it is surrounded by promenades at this time there was stationed at this place a regiment of horse and foot the officers and ladies were walking together but the ladies were all veiled here sir john chose to stop all night next day we went across the plains of almonte and at the city of almonte we dined in crossing the plains we saw a drove of two thousand hogs mostly blacks gt from different places of the country for the great city of seville the spaniards are fonder of hogsflesh than even the english at night we went to a village called atalia near the sea here the kitchen and stable were both in one the mules were at one end and all the strangers at the other every one was his own cook and i dressed the queen of scots soup as for the two french gentlemen we left them in agamonte after it was dark at atalia the doors were shut and we were desired not to go out for fear of thieves that lurked in the neighborhood next day we traveled along the seashore to nepuero a little village at the bottom of the great river of guadalquivir as we had not more than sixteen miles to go that day we were in no great haste sir john and i walked about six miles on the sands picking up shells of a very fine kind which were brought to london  as we were coming to nepuero we saw a ship in distress though it was a very fine day the ship was no more than a mile from us and a leeshore they did all in their power to get to sea from land but all in vain she was loaded with fish from newfoundland and was split on a rock near the bottom of the river next day we dined at nepuero and discharged our men and mules we had a boat and crossed the river opposite the customhouse where the river is two miles over our baggage was taken into the customhouse and cleared and afterward we had a cart to put it in we had to walk two miles to the city of st lucar to the inns where we had good accommodations and better beds than we had since we left lisbon we stopped at st lucar a week sir john stopped with his two friends mr hunter and mr carr winemerchants the butler came from edinburgh he and i went next morning to see the vessel that was broke to pieces and we saw the tide drive the fish on shore the people of st lucar had a fine chance to get so many thousand fine cod for nothing  when the gentlemen went out to ride mr hamilton the butler and i went out with the two greyhounds a coursing and we had very good sport st lucar is a very fine city for trade it stands near the sea on one of the finest rivers in the world on the other side are a great many hills and a fortification about a mile from town we went into the fort and there we found english irish scotch and welsh soldiers in the king of spains service and fine easy lives they had never to stir from st lucar and the fort the house where sir john lodged at st lucar was one of the largest winehouses in the town i went into the wine storecellars which resemble a brewers great storecellar in london the morning we left st lucar we sent our baggage away in a cart by four in the morning and we set off by six in the morning we rode fifteen miles across a fine country abounding in vineyards and figs the baggage and we arrived at port st marys by eleven oclock at the three pigeons hotel in a very fine town with a fine promenade at the end of port st marys for gentlemen and ladies we dined at the hotel and as we had but nine miles to cadiz across the sea sir john was very desirous to be there that day although the wind was very high i told sir john that the wind was very high to go in an open boat he said the boatmen knew best as all the boats were gone that took the regular fare of about eightpence each person my master engaged one for about eight dollars when we were making ready to go to the boat bernardo the landlord an italian said mr john the wind is high but the men ventured on account of getting so much money so we went into the large open boat with one mast and one large sail the master and eight of his men sir john three spanish gentlemen and henry and i were on board we had not proceeded a mile when the wind became very high in ten minutes it blew a tempest the men being fresh water sailors had the sail too high which laid the boat very much on one side a sea came and filled the boat half full of water when i saw that i made a motion to lower the sail which they did half way down if not the next sea would have swallowed us up by this time sir john thought all was over in this life for us and henry sat at my feet trembling and speechless the men had two pails and went to work to throw the water out of the boat a wave took away one pail and in a few minutes the other pail was carried away also then more water came in every one in the boat expected every moment to be lost the boatmen were crying for their wives and families i sat on the windward side of the boat with my arms on the rigging encouraging sir john as he had not seen so much distress as i had seen the gentlemen were all on the little deck behind with the baggage beside me sir john called loudly to the people on board an english man of war to the windward of us but they could give us no assistance i gave myself up for lost but i thought within myself i shall fare as my master and no worse i never saw such a scene the men in water up to their middles crying and throwing out the water with their hats and we as wet as them i saw no alteration on the spanish gentlemen but they were speaking about sir john and me being english and thought that god had raised the storm on our account one of the gentlemen asked if we were english i answered we were and then he asked me if we were catholics of england when we were at our wits end it pleased god to calm the wind a great deal at last we got near the harbor and i spoke to henry but he could not answer me a word sir john said he had not got the better of the fright yet when we got near the pier of cadiz we had great difficulty to get on shore as the waves dashed so much against the pier we got into the little boat from the great one to take us on shore and by the assistance of the rope we got up out of the boat there were many hundreds of people glad to see us come safe off the water sir john paid the people his compliments by lifting off his hat and making a bow we went to the white horse hotel all night at night sir john sent a letter to his friend mr duff a great merchant at cadiz mr duff came home late in the morning he came to see sir john and invited him to be at his house while in cadiz we went to the house of mr duff and welsh in company and next day my master discharged henry as he met with an opportunity to go with a gentlemen for lisbon next day as i was dressing sir john stuart he said john i think we escaped wonderfully well with our lives coming from port st marys yes thank god i do assure you sir john though i did not show the least marks of fear i expected every moment to be lost i thought within myself i have escaped many dangers and if i am to die here i shall fare no worse than my master in death and burying  mr duff was son to the sheriff of air in scotland and nephew to mr hamilton of bargeny who brought me up mr hamilton had a brother at the same time in great trade william dalrymple esquire at cadiz in mr duff and welshs house there were no maidservants it not being the custom for the single men in cadiz in the house were the butler and his mate as houseman the head cook and his mate two frenchmen and two italians i cleaned my masters room and my own and made our beds and we were as happy as kings together there is not so much demand for women servants in spain as there are no fine places only in the kitchen and as in scotland the cooks are mostly all men  cadiz is as pleasant as any city in europe it stands on a peninsula mostly encompassed by the sea and fortified all round the gentlemen and ladies mostly walk on the ramparts for the prospect and there are seats there is also a fine promenade under trees and those that are in carriages go round the promenade so they can all see one another every afternoon there are many fine churches in cadiz there is a very good custom in spain  every evening when the sun sets the bell tolls in all the churches the men and women stop in a moment of whatever station on the promenade or street while the priests in church say the lords prayer the men lift off their hats the ladies put their fans before their face to pray that god would preserve them through night as he had done through the day and to thank god for their daily bread when the oration is done in church the bell tolls again then the gentlemen bow to the ladies and they all walk on again all carriages and horsemen stopped in the same manner the priests go about the streets about nine oclock at night with lanterns that give a great light and stop at particular places to pray and praise to caution people from doing wickedness in the night and tell them the folly of wickedness and sufferings that follow the streets are very good in cadiz and the houses are high and make a noble appearance they are white built of stone and lime they are the most convenient in the world for servants when you enter in the streetdoor you are in a square paved with marble it is open to the heavens round the hall are cellars and warehouses the stairs are at one corner when you get up to the first floor all round are rooms and countinghouses there is an iron railing round the gallery the second third and fourth is in the same manner so the house is always open there is a rope fixed to the latch of the streetdoor from the iron railing on each floor opposite the streetdoor so that whatever place of the house a servant is in he comes out of the room and looks over the railing pulls the latch of the streetdoor with the cord the person comes in and walks up stairs then the door falls to again if it is a message the servant takes or gives it when you get on the top of the house it is flat and pleasant to walk on or drink tea in the evening the top of it is finely ornamented with cutstone where you walk it is paved with fine flat tiles in cadiz there is no water but rain collected from the house tops there is indeed water brought from port st marys across the sea for gentlemen and ladies many men support their families by this trade in the afternoon the men carry a large cask upon their backs two glasses and a clean napkin in their hand they go up to gentlemen and ladies and sell the company this water it is pleasing to see so many fine gentlemen and ladies walk on the ramparts and on the promenade from whence they have so extensive a view both by sea and land cadiz is so compact that a man may walk round it in an hour  all the ladies in the south of spain when they walk out are veiled as we came to cadiz before lent i fasted the whole time as they did but our fast would have been a feast to a londoner for we had fine bread and wine tea and fine butter and at dinner salt fish potatoes parsnips plenty of sauce fish stewed in wine fresh fish boiled and other fish broiled eggs fried and eggs and spinach every day the gentlemen in the parlour had what they liked besides for the family was large  sir john had not been at cadiz above three weeks when he was taken ill with an intermitting fever mr macguire the physician of cadiz an irish gentleman attended him sir john had no nurse but myself who attended him i never pulled off my clothes for sixteen nights i had a fire burning all night and a lamp to warm every thing he wanted i laid on the couch in the next room at last he became so weak that he could hardly call me i said sir if you please i will put a thing round my wrist in the night and when you want me pull the cord and i will wake in a moment but sir john rather chose i should lie on the mattrass by his bedside and i did as he desired me before three weeks his fever changed and turned to an ague and fever then he was well some times and then he could walk out and ride in a carriage at this time there was a yearly procession and as it passed by mr duffs house it was very entertaining to my master it began on monday and ended on saturday it begins with judas betraying our lord and through the week taking christ before pilate and his trial and scourging and carrying his cross and simon the cyrenean assisting our lord to carry the cross and his beilng on the cross between the two thieves and then left alone except the virgin mary her sister and the wife of cleophas mary magdalen and john the beloved on saturday judas throws down the money and then hangs himself those scenes are on stages drawn on wheels the procession is every day after breakfast performed by several hundreds of the gentlemen in town dressed with their swords and each having a lighted torch in his hand and accompanied by the priests in grand order  sir john getting a little better dr macguire recommended him to the air of port st marys where he went and put up at bernardos the three pigeons hotel where we were before my master had a room at the end of the great dining hall with two beds at the other end was general oreiley the commander in chief of the army in the south part of spain the general was an irishman and had a grand attendance though not one british or irish servant about him several of the gentlemen came to see sir john and one mr walmsley an english gentleman who had a fine house and gardens in the country two miles from port st marys invited sir john to come and drink milk in the morning or whatever he liked my master got a large jackass that belonged to the hotel he put an english saddle on the ass and rode him we set out at six in the morning i put my coat over my left shoulder because the weather was hot i walked and the ass followed me this lasted ten days during which time we returned every day to breakfast mr duff sent his own mule round by land to port st marys then i rode the ass and we visited every afternoon different places of the country no king in the world could enjoy more pleasure than we did by going from place to place after general oreiley left the hotel the bishop of seville came to the apartments and dined on his way to cadiz  after three weeks at port st marys sir john returned to cadiz a great deal better only the ague and fever every three days and he continued to take the bark at our return to cadiz the bull fights began the manner of which is as follows  the theater is large and round open over head the seats rise from the middle of a grass plat like the seats in the two shillings gallery of a playhouse a post is fixed toward one end of the plat and a baboon chained to it before the company came ten bulls are brought to a stable under the gallery when the company are come and the governor and his family seated a bell rings the large monkey is on the post three men on horseback with good boots on with a large spur in their right hand stand close together abreast one bull is turned out he stamps on the ground looks at the company the monkey and three men on horseback and the three men are ready to receive him the bull runs full drive at one of the horses the rider is sure to pierce the bulls shoulder with his spear he alone must attack the bull and must engage him in front sometimes the bull throws the man and horse on the ground at other times he rips up the horses belly and you will then see the horses guts trailing on the ground when the bull gives the horse the first thrust a person is ready in a light dress with a piece of silk of the length of a midling tablecloath the bull tosses the silk with his horns and the rider escapes to a place for the purpose the second time the horsemen get themselves ready again and the bull having received the wounds is more mad than before sometimes he runs at the monkey and then there is a general laugh when six minutes are over a bell rings for that scene to finish then the horsemen stand to one side and another player turns out with two arrows in his hands each about a yard long the point sharp like the point of a small fishing hook he meets the bull in full gallop runs the arrow through between his horns in his shoulders or neck the bull takes one round in the circus then another man turns out the monkey guards his chain and observes the whole performance the bull engages the second third etc till he has eight or ten arrows dangling in his back and shoulders then he is wound up to a great pitch of madness when the six minutes are over the bell rings and those men withdraw then one of the head performers turns out with an andrea ferara in his hand and meets the bull when he is on full gallop he directs the sword between the horns down through his shoulders into his heart the bull falls and expires in a minute a young man comes with three horses abreast of one another harnessed and finely decorated with feathers he fixes the harness round the horns and drags the carcass full gallop to the slaughterhouse the meat is sold next day for twopence per pound to the public often the swordsmen miss their thrust and sometimes the bull carries away the sword in his shoulders at other times when the swordsman thinks himself sure he makes a bow to some lady and says in honor of such a lady i will kill the bull at one thrust if he succeeds the company throw down a great deal of money to him but if not he is hissed out of the circus  after being at cadiz for some time and sir john not getting quit of his ague he laid aside his intended trip to africa he resolved to accompany some gentlemen home he was at a loss at first whether he should go by sea or land but afterward preferred the latter mr duff applied to general oreiley for an irish or scotch soldier to go behind the coach and be guard and interpreter before we got away we felt an earthquake on the tenth day of may in the forenoon sir john was laid on his bed the cook and i were employed in the kitchen the whole city of cadiz was somewhat raised and rocked and sunk again the cook called on jesus and mary and i cried out jesus christ my master will be killed in bed every face in cadiz was as pale as ashes in ten minutes the people were praying and praising on the streets however some tubs were overset  two days after we went to port st marys and a great many gentlemen in company who stopped all night with my master at bernardos in a few days after my master hired a coach and six mules that was going to madrid he found there were orders for every one to join their regiment as the french were expected to join the americans so that general oreiley would not let sir john have a soldier so we went without an interpreter or guard we left the pleasant place port st marys with our coach and six mules worth sixty or seventy guineas each  about the middle of may we set out for madrid three hundred and fifty miles distant we went very little faster than a wagon in england we only went one short stage the first night to xeres the principal town for cherrywine in spain great respect is paid to goldlace and i was mistaken at the inns for sir john i begged of my master to wear some of his goldlaced clothes which he did all through spain the inns were tolerable and the waiter laid the cloth for sir john and me i supped with sir john for the first time and slept in the same room till we came to st jean de luz in france next morning early we set out for arcos we commonly set out by four to travel in the cool of the morning on the road when we were let into an empty room where we were taken no notice of i was cook the maid would get me water and make a fire i had a case of fine wine for my master and sherry for myself i had spices salt and rice and a little copper pot with a shelf at top for the meat i dressed the dinner for next day i had soup in the bottom of the pot and the fowl at top the cover came half way down the outside so that no dust could get in at dinner time i had only to warm the dinner i hung the pot under the perch of the coach by a rope i could buy partridges fowls chickens eggs and some fish which i stewed in wine we commonly had our luncheon on the road the coachman and his nephew on the box would eat theirs and we in the coach ours we commonly had cold broiled chicken or some partridge as i dressed plenty sir john desired me to give the master of the coach part out of the window so we were all at luncheon together and going slow i made chocolate over night to drink at four in the morning sir john never had a return of the ague on the road which made the journey very pleasing and no man upon earth more happy than me traveling through a fine country where the harvest was all in by the twentieth of may at night we flept at the town of bornos nothing remarkable but merriment our coachman was a fine handsome man and he and his nephew were very fond of dancing a person came with the guittar and he danced with the mistress of the house and another girl it cost me many a shilling to to pay for music traveling along very few days but he and his nephew dined at every stage we stopped at  next morning we dined at espera after passing the mountains of alhoquina we left espera and traveled along a fine country well cultivated finely wooded and watered and at night we came to a fine town called utera and then to marchina from thence we came at night to a fine city called exija leaving the great city of sevillia on our left hand here we crossed a branch of the river guadlaquivir and went to palma to dinner and we crossed another branch of the river and stopped at the town of pasados we were here early in the evening the people of the inns were relations of prosilla the coachman sir john was very glad to see prosilla dance he always put a rattle on each hand which kept time to the music as sir john was very glad to see him he himself danced a fandango i went to the church every place we came at and i passed for a roman catholic they asked me if my master was a roman catholic i said he was it is friday and you are dressing a fowl for him i told them when my master was at st lucar he went to see the high priest and desired to be permitted to eat meat as he was traveling through spain for his health the highpriest gave my master an indulgence to eat any sorts of birds while in spain for which my master gave the poor of st lucar one hundred dollars and my master has it in his pocketbook that night i made an east india pilaw for my master i had a fine fowl stewed with rice and butter well seasoned i had hard boiled eggs and boiled onions to garnish the dish when it was making ready the landlady was taken ill i told sir john he desired me to take her a glass of brandy she drank it when i served in the supper sir john sent her a large plate full of the pilaw and desired her to eat as she was a fellowsufferer with himself and indeed she eat hearty i had fish for my supper prosilla and the others in company laughed hearty to themselves that the landlady was sick and ate and drank heartily if a person be sick he is allowed to eat meat at that time although it is in lent or on friday we left pasados in the morning and dined at the great city of cordova on the river guadalquivir before my master had dinner we went to see a fine church that had seven hundred pillars of marble in the middle after dinner we went to samossa after crossing the mountains of constantina covered with flowers of different colors when i saw a flower or plant that was strange to me i took the seed and dried it by the sun and brought it with me to send to scotland next morning we left samossa and dined at st bennets in the province of new castile in the afternoon we went over the mountains of conovista and stopped at the town of gorgortial a fine town in a beautiful country we stopped at a very good inn and the maid was good tempered i dressed the supper and the maid and i drank a bottle of wine together when she brought in the supper i was setting up my masters tent bed sir john began to eat his supper the maid said why do you begin before your comrade my master said john i see i can by no means begin till you come without disobliging the maid i put on my coat in a minute and sat down to supper as i made the chocolate at night she showed me where she slept that i might call her in the morning when i came to her bedside before i called her i took up her pockets and put in one dollar methinks a goodnatured person should be respected and rewarded i said my dear i beg your pardon but i have called you an hour too soon she said there is no harm done do you lay down till i make the fire and warm the chocolate and when its ready i will let you know we went to dinner to uenta del aleada and at night we slept at a large town called villa major at a good inn that night there was a great deal of rain thunder and lightning but within very agreeable and plenty of music and dancing and the landlady was a great while conversing with my master after she was gone i said sir the gentlemen of cadiz laughed at me because i said we had no kind of need of an interpreter you see sir john i was right there would have been the mans expense and he would have made them charge you double for every thing on the road sir john said in a few months i could speak spanish as well as french it is half latin and i speak latin as well as french when we were going to bed it thundered very much sir john said i believe there is not any one thing bad but i have met with since i left home sir said i if some of the old scotch women were here they would say certainly sir john has forsaken some young lady that he has such bad luck i said this because i was informed he had forsaken one of the finest young ladies in scotland an heiress and took up with another heiress as good as the other whom he married afterward he made me no answer for he knew what i said was right  next day we passed a fine country and crossed a branch of the river guadiana and stopped at the town of luciana after dinner we went over the mountains of luciana and stopped at the town of piedrabuena a fine country near a large ridge of mountains there is no danger of thieves in spain as you stop in towns or villages you may leave five hundred pounds worth in your coach all night without any danger but the banditti on the mountains or in large woods are dangerous next day we dined at mora after passing the mountains of mora and cole on a saturday night we arrived at the large and fine city of toledo we were at a good inn and we had good accommodations here we crossed the river tagus that runs past lisbon we were in no great hurry to go off in the morning as we had only one stage to dinner and to be there all night the place where the king of spain had his court when sir john was dressed and gone down to breakfast i was shaving and dressing myself when the maid came to make the bed and conversing together she asked me to shave her i said my dear suppose it should spoil your pretty face sir you shave and your face is not spoiled very well my dear if you will give me a kiss i will shave you so she gave me a kiss and i shaved her and i told her she was the first maid i had ever shaved she was about sixteen and i was very sorry to leave her behind after breakfast we set out and arrived at aranjuez the most beautiful village i ever saw before we came to aranjuez we were going over the most barren hill in spain and presently we saw before us the most pleasant valley about ten miles long at the bottom of the hill is the town the most complete building of white hewn stone every street answering another like the walks of a garden planned before a house was built the kings palace is at the side of the town a beautiful building on the banks of the river tagus at the end of a fine white stone bridge across the river in the kings delightful pleasure garden open for the public to walk in we stopped at the kings arms when our things were taken up stairs i having nothing to do walked out i saw the people going to the kings chapel where the queen and one of the princesses were in the royal seat as i was very well dressed and had a silk bag on my hair and a fine hanger by my side i entered the chapel when the service was over i came home when sir john was at dinner i told him i had been at the chapel he was attended by two spanish waiters he was well served they knowing him to be an englishman the english bearing the character of being so rich and free my master said john i have been counting how many dishes they will bring to me in all i have had fourteen hot things when my master was speaking to me the two waiters looked at my master and me i said sir i will go and see what i shall have below i went and dined and told sir john i had eleven hot things for my dinner  my master sent a letter to lord grantham the english ambassador to let him know such a person was at the kings arms i went and saw the kings gardens and returned to tell sir john the beauty of them he went to see them and returned expecting the earl of granthams answer but i went along the road and walked out side of the queens gardens between the river and the great road leading to madrid it is near half a mile long and half a quarter of a mile broad open to view from the road by a low wall and fine iron railing but the public are not allowed to enter it produces all sorts of plants and fine flowers to put into the queens apartments and in different places of the palace and there are many fine trees growing between the river and garden the great road by the garden has fine trees on each side like those in st jamess park london where the ladies walk in the afternoon this road is watered twice on each day at the kings expense the royal family come here an airing sometimes and the nobles and gentry come here in the cool of the afternoon i have seen five hundred carriages at once at accustomed places they drive along one side of the road and down the other there are gentlemen and ladies on the footway between the carriages and the queens gardens so they are all together and not the least dust to be seen the roads being so well watered one would not wish to see a finer sight than the company i went to the other side of the garden and i saw one of the gardeners coming from the building for the gardeners and enter a back door of the garden i went and found the door on the latch i entered and walked along the gravel walk when i came near the gardeners it being sunday they were looking at some flowers not at work they looked at me and seeing me to be a foreigner and knowing how i came in they took no farther notice i walked round and saw some fine walks of trees and flowers i put some flowers in my pocket and walked out and came home to sir john and gave him the flowers from the queens gardens he asked me how i got in there i told him i had gone into many places that was not allowed for the public because i was a stranger he answered you had better take care and not get into trouble by so doing late at night sir john had a letter from lord grantham and waited on him next day dined with his lordship and went to court as i never saw a place i liked so well at the same time i went to see the kings stables the horseguards and the kings dairy the finest in europe the king of spain supplies all the ambassadors with butter milk and cream from his dairy while he is in the country if there be a place in the world at this time like the garden of eden it is aranjuez when sir john came home he told me what he had seen at the court and how much the english ambassador was respected by all the other ambassadors sir john said i would like to stay here longer but i have to pay prosilla the coachman one pound per day while i stay here  after four days at aranjuez we set out for madrid we went five miles down the east side of the river then crossed one of the finest bridges i ever saw out of the county of middlesex when we left the valley we went up a high hill to the west and left the delightful valley of aranjuez we went on for madrid twentyone miles but we stopped at leganes to bait the custom of spain when we were on our way to madrid if we met a carriage going to aranjuez we were obliged to give way we crossed another branch of the river tagus and put up at the st sebastian an elegant hotel the master of which was an italian next day my master hired a coach for himself and two english gentlemen the earl of granthams chaplain accompanied them to see the kings palace the armoury and his cabinet of curiosities i went on behind the coach and saw every thing that was worth seeing in madrid when we were looking out of the palace windows in madrid we saw the escurial a palace twentyone miles north from madrid at the same time we saw the distant mountains covered with snow though it was then the beginning of june after viewing every thing worth seeing the gentlemen stopped at lord granthams town house sir john desired me to go home as i had the key of the room where they were to dine and get the table ready for dinner i went but lost my way i was in the greatest perplexity of mind as i had the key of all the things and of the room and i had forgot the name of the hotel i walked up one street and down another at last i remembered the name of the hotel i went up to a spaniard and asked him for the st sebastian he answered i do not understand you because i did not know the name of the street i asked for the hotel but could not give the street at last i went up to a french gentleman who put me right presently and i got home before sir john and his company next day we saw the grand procession such as we saw at cadiz but much grander the street where the procession went through was covered with canvass fixed to the three pair of stairs windows in case of rain but it happened to be fine weather madrid is a fine city in a beautiful country madrid is lighted up with glass lamps like london in madrid the women wear white veils after being four nights in madrid we set out for the escurial on our way we only stopped a few minutes at a watering house and arrived at the escurial by noon there we had time to see the palace and village about two miles before you come to the escurial you ascend as the palace stands on a fine height the most beautiful rural place in the world the palace is one of the longest in europe in figure like a gridiron the handle in a fine garden and the part of the palace like the gridiron is a fine square where carriages drive very much resembling holyroodhouse the royal palace in scotland we went to see the kings chapel and the fine painting one drew my masters attention and that was the conversion of paul the friars were at prayers when we were in the chapel and were surprised to hear me name all the paintings exactly next morning we traveled through a country like a garden till we began to ascend the high mountains we were to cross to get out of the province of new castile into old castile i got out of the coach to make it easier for the mules i was sometimes half a mile before the mules because i went straight forward i had milk from the shepherds out of a large horn and i met sir john at a corner of the road near the top of the mountains we entered into a cloud it was so thick and dark sir john called me to come into the coach to give him the bark when we left the mountains behind we got into a fine country and arrived at a large town called idelfonso in old castile here we stopped all night on account of the beauty of the place it is situated in a fine valley between the high mountains of brides next morning we went to segovia a fine town with fine houses at night we went to st maria de la nieve in a fine well cultivated country with many fine woods and passed by some convents next day we dined at olmedo and arrived at night at valdestillas i took more delight in seeing the north part of spain than the south because it afforded so many hills valleys rivers and woods next morning we set out for valladolid a great city but poor buildings with an old palace of the kings of spain with a cathedral and fine paintings we stopped to dinner then set out for duenas this part of spain is barren and the people poor not having trade next morning we went to torquenado and at night to villadrigo next day to dinner at quintanillaja and at night to the large city of burgos the capital of old castile this city is very rich and grand it stands on the banks of the river alencon and here is a fine cathedral with excellent paintings sir john stopped here two days hecause he met some english gentlemen we were there on the market day which gave us an opportunity of seeing more of the humor of the place the country round is fine and well cultivated we left burgos and traveled over the very high mountains of bribiesca through bad roads we had dinner at bodilles and at night arrived at bribiesca afterward we had a beautiful country to go through but bad roads to pass as we were going along i observed a house like fullartons folly in scotland sir john looked round and said i never saw a finer sight such a fine country and fine river sir said i there is a finer sight in scotland he said where for gods sake sir from the castle of stirling if young noblemen and gentlemen would take notice of great britain and ireland before they went on their travels it would make a good foundation for their remarks  next day we dined at pancorva and pursued our journey through the mountainous country of mirando and through a great many woods we had a guard with us for one stage all this time we were very happy with our coachman and postillion and we had plenty of music and dancing although the harvest was in when we left cadiz they were only weeding their fields of green corn in the north of spain we dined at vittoria whence we set out for mondrogone on this stage we entered the great mountain of the pyrenees which runs from the bay of biscay to the mediterranean sea and upon an average is fifty miles broad and covered constantly with snow on the stage between mirando and victoria we crossed the river ebro and entered the province biscay when we entered first between two rocks there was only room for the coach to pass we were three days in passing the pyrenees the road serpentined so much to get round the mountains we stopped at villafranca next day we dined at tolosa it was very pleasant traveling through the valleys to see the snow on the mountains while the valley was as warm as france or spain we traveled by a river the whole day and there were plenty of trees on the side of the mountains at night we stopped at ogarzin the pleasantest place i ever saw at this town the valley was very narrow and mountains very high the sides covered with chestnut trees in passing the pyrenees we had the best white wine i ever drank in the morning we left ogarzin and went to the river bidassoa which divides spain and france the river is deep but not very broad we crossed over all at once in a ferryboat and we had our things taken to the customhouse to be searched on the one side they spoke french on the other side spanish here we entered gascony and dined at st jean de luz  sir john and i began to separate dining or sleeping in one room together and here i left my kitchen furniture behind not having any more occasion for them at night we stopped at bayonet a large trading city on the great river adour i was surprised to see the people in gascony i thought i was in scotland for the people dress in the same manner with short coats and blue bonnets and there is not the least difference in their behavior as prosilla the coachmaster had fulfilled his engagements for his coach and mules he was paid off i was sorry to part with him and his nephew and he was sorry to part with sir john and me next day sir john bought a french postchaise and they both saw us set off post for bourdeaux we dined at a large town called deux on the river

boat madam reives took a pack of cards out of her pocket to play she desired me for her partner i made many excuses against it but all would not do as she had seen me play before i apologized and in all my life i had never done so before nor never had done any thing on a sunday that gave me so much uneasiness before for i always regarded the sunday but they were all roman catholics dancing or gambling on sunday they think no harm when we came to madam reivess brothers we walked in the vineyards on the banks of the river we ate grapes drank wine had fish of the river stewed in wine and in

the count de provence as he thought he would be obstructed getting out the people thronged so much about the church the emperor went out with one of his lords and as the people knew neither of them both of them went into the noblemans chariot and drove off soon after the earl of provence and the other lords came out and drove away the emperors carriage drove away empty the people asked the coachman who was the emperor he said that he went away in the first carriage so they were disappointed i got out of the crowd came home and called my master at ten oclock and i told him i had been at

praise the great god but when i came to my fathers door with the return chaise when the man told me to be ready by four next morning my mother was like a distracted woman and said if my only child

de naples where i first saw you so when he came my father asked his opinion how his daughter should do concerning going to london if my daughter goes i shall lose my wife and i should be sorry never to see my daughter again now cousin give me your advice i am sorry to see the distress you are in i would have malilia to stop with her mother and i believe her husband is a man of good character by what i have seen of his behavior and by his being here twice with gentlemen of fortune write to him the distress your wife is in to part with her daughter and if he would come to toledo we can do better for him than his living in service and going round the country so my dear husband if you will be condescending to this request we shall be all happy if you do not choose to come let me know your commands and i will fulfill them if it was at the peril of my life let me have an answer as soon as possible i believe when you see me again i shall be the mother of two children your son is a
