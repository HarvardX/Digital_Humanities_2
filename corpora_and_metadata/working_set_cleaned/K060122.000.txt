an essay upon public credit etc  an essay upon public credit  being an enquiry how the public credit comes to depend upon the change of the ministry or the dissolutions of parliaments and whether it does so or no  with an argument proving that the public credit may be upheld and maintained in this nation and perhaps brought to a greater height than it ever yet arrived at though all the changes or dissolutions already made pretended to and now discoursed of should come to pass in the world  london printed and sold by the booksellers mdccx price three pence  an essay upon public credit etc the world being so full of politicians and so many authors having of late turned statesmen it behooves me to lay every thing down exceeding plain as i go on the subject is nice the age abusive the town full of observers and reviewers who write to please and content the notions of men who directed by their interest and parties differ even with themselves reason it is true is dictator in the society of mankind from her there ought to lie no appeal but here we want a pope in our philosophy to be the infallible judge of what is or is not reason  i am to speak of what all people are busy about but not one in forty understands every man has a concern in it few know what it is nor is it easy to define or describe it if a man goes about to explain it by words he rather struggles to lose himself in the wood than bring others out of it it is best described by it self it is like the wind that blows where it lists we hear the sound thereof but hardly know whence it comes or whither it goes  like the soul in the body it acts all substance yet is it self immaterial it gives motion yet it self cannot be said to exist it creates forms yet has it self no form it is neither quantity or quality it has no whereness or whenness site or habit if i should say it is the essential shadow of something that is not should i not puzzle the thing rather than explain it and leave you and my self more the dark than we were before  to come a at direct and clear understanding of the thing the best method will be to describe its operations rather than define its nature to show how it acts rather than how it exists and what it does rather than what it is  trade as the author of the review has told us and who i can better submit to learn of on that subject than some other he talks more about was derived by convenience from the profitable exchanging of goods from nation to nation and from place to place as people increasing found their neighbors possessed of what they wanted and themselves having to spare of what their neighboring countries did not produce this we now call barter and is not so much in use as it was in the infancy of commerce in the world  the britains inhabiting this island were found to exchange their block tin with the phenecian merchants for spices wines and oils even long before julius caesar set his foot upon this island  but as trade increased two accidents fell in as effects being the great mediums of universal commerce the vehicle in which trade is preserved or administered through the world these were money and credit  this thing called commerce flourishing and extending every way into all the corners of the world the nations falling generally into dealing with one another yet trade found it self unsufferably straightened and perplexed for want of a general species of a complete intrinsic worth as the medium to supply the defect of exchanging and to make good the balance where a nation or a market or a merchant demanded of another a greater quantity of goods than either the buyer had goods to answer or the seller had occasion to take back  this nothing could be found in the world of universal and intrinsic worth enough to answer but metals as being neither consuming in quality bulky in carriage or useless in nature of these metals several nations adhered a long time to such as their own country produced but gold and silver by their mere intrinsic worth prevailed and they alone retain the universal character as it may be called in all payments of whatever kind in the world  the course of trade being thus turned from exchanging of goods for goods or delivering and taking to selling and paying all the bargains in the world are now stated upon the foot of a price in money and though it be at any time an exchange of goods for goods yet even those goods are on either side rated at a price in money  though this was a great assistant to trade and gave a liberty to the increase of commerce more than ever it had before yet such was the great increase of trade that it even overrun the money it self and all the specie in the world could not answer the demand or be ready just at time trade called for it this occasioned that when a bought more goods of b than a had money to pay for and b having no need of any goods that a had to sell it behoved that a should leave his goods with b for a certain time in which a was to provide the money for the said goods and this was done both from the occasion b had to sell his goods the occasion a had to buy them and the opinion b had of as integrity and ability for payment  and this is the great thing called credit  credit is a consequence not a cause the effect of a substance not a substance it is the sunshine not the sun the quickening something call it what you will that gives life to trade gives being to the branches and moisture to the root it is the oil of the wheel the marrow in the bones the blood in the veins and the spirits in the heart of all the negoce trade cash and commerce in the world  it is produced and grows insensibly from fair and upright dealing punctual compliance honorable performance of contracts and covenants in short it is the offspring of universal probity  it is apparent even by its nature it is no way dependent upon persons parliaments or any particular men or set of men as such in the world but upon their conduct and just behavior credit never was chained to mens names but to their actions not to families clans or collections of men no not to nations it is the honor the justice the fairdealing and the equal conduct of men bodies of men nations and people that raise the thing called credit among them wheresoever this is found credit will live and thrive grow and increase where this is wanting let all the power and wit of man join together they can neither give her being or preserve her life  arts have been tried on various occasions in the world to raise credit art has been found able with more ease to destroy credit than to raise it the force of art assisted by the punctual fair and just dealing abovesaid may have done much to form a credit upon the face of things but we find still the honor would have done it without the art but never the art without the honor nor will money it self which solomon says answers all things purchase this thing called credit or restore it when lost  it is in vain to talk of credit without this probity honesty will raise credit without money but all the money in the world will not raise credit without the principle d was a prince of high birth a great character for wit gallantry and all the perfections of a duke and peer of one of the politest nations in europe he had besides a noble fortune built great edifices purchased great houses maintained a vast equipage and did every thing with the air of an exquisite and most accomplished gentleman he had a vast fortune great offices at court nor did he ever want money his stewards were never without  0000 pistols in cash if any sum however great was wanting to support any point of honor for his play or to purchase what he had his eye upon he knew how to produce it yet the barber would not trust him for a perriwig the coachmaker would not let his chariot go home with a new set of wheels what was the matter he would pay no body generously or honorably he would be surrounded with duns as he came out of his palace and would go incognito to court to prevent being insulted the sbirri or provosts men at paris would stop his coach in the street he has been forced to call a chair and leave his coach and horses in their possession  the thing was plain he had no credit his great estate his high birth and quality his equipage his vast quantity of gold plate his large cash they would not add one inch to the stature of his credit but he lived as if he was poor and was less esteemed in the shops of the marchands than a private gentleman nay than one of the burgois i had almost said than a shoemaker in the city  on the other hand s  is a gentleman of a moderate fortune compared to the other but is also a man of quality he lives nobly though frugally keeps a good equipage a handsome family does not lay up much his generous nature will not permit it but he pays punctually no man comes twice for his money if a tradesman leaves his bill he buys no more of him till he comes for his money he never dines till his wine is paid for he wears no clothes that the tailor or mercer can reproach him for and call theirs as he goes along the street instead of having his door crowded with duns and his steward bribed to pay he is rather crowded with shopkeepers to petition for his custom his servants are teizd to procure their lord to buy here or there and every one studies to leave his goods for approbation the tradesmen are ready to fight who shall get in his goods and sell often to loss to underrate one another what is the matter credit stands at his door honor lives there and credit is her handmaid the count deals justly pays punctually every mans demands are answered credit courts him he shall have her favor whether he will use her or no  it is needless to enlarge experience tells us the same thing in all cases whether private or public personal or national  credit is the consequence of just and honorable dealing fair proposals punctually performed will bring credit let the person or people be who they will how do we trade among the turks and trust the mahometans one of whose doctrines in the alchor an is not to keep faith with christians they have obtained it by a just punctual and honorable practice in trade and you credit them without scruple nay rather than a christian  upon this foundation i build what i am in hand with and bring it down to the present case i know no persons or parties in my argument this lord treasurer or another lord treasurer or no lord treasurer it is the same thing to me a bank or no bank it is all one i will sell none of my tallies or annuities i will discount no exchequer bills dissolve the parliament or not dissolve the parliament it is all one to me i neither fear desire or am anxious about either nor can i see so much cause for an alarm among our people that have money as if credit was pinned to the girdle of a man or waited at the door of the house of commons the thing is a mistake credit attends the honorable management of your treasurers your exchequers your parliaments whether past present or to come  i do not examine what politic reasons may induce her majesty to change or remove her great men in the ministry i enquire not whether her majesty purposes to dissolve the parliament or to let them sir these things are not concerned in our case the late lord treasurer i allow has done honorably has managed the finances with great and unusual dexterity and has acquired thereby the fame of the best officer that has for many years acted in that post i could be content to spend a whole page in his praise the nation is infinitely obliged to him and his royal mistress no doubt has received infinite satisfaction in his conduct as appears by rejecting all attempts against him and keeping him so long in a post of so great trust  but after this is said credit which has for some years been the nations happy guest by whose aid such mighty things have been done cannot be said to be the sole property of my lord t  r personally it is not singly entailed upon his family or his name this would be to go a length his lordship himself has more modesty than to claim no would his lordship be well pleased with any that could think such course kind of flattery would oblige him  our credit in this case is a public thing it is rightly called by some of our writers national credit the word denominates its original it is produced by the nations probity the honor and exact performing national engagements in this the great officers of the treasury and exchequer are as we may say perfectly passive their business is indeed active so the wheels of a clock their business is to go round but they are subject to the influence of their position the operations of the springs and wheels that guide their motion by which they act passively if that may be said that is of mere necessity and the punctual pointing of the hand to the lines showing the hour the minutes and the seconds are consequences of these motions these indeed tell us that the wheels are good perfectly made exactly placed and move to a truth but the honor redounds to the workman who placed them in that exact order adapted them to their several uses and placed such springs and wheels about them which by their like exactness but all derived from the same original oblige every part punctually to perform the end of the whole movement  credit is not the effect of this or that wheel in the government moving regular and just to its proper work but of the whole movement acting by the force of its true original motion according to the exquisite design of the director of the whole frame  thus the honor the probity the exact punctual management which has raised our credit to the pitch it is now arrived at has not been merely the great wheel in the nations clockwork that turned about the treasure but the great spring that turned about that wheel and this is the queen and parliament the one the spring still keeping to the allegory that gives motion or life to the whole the other the balance or pendulum that regulates that motion keeps it true to and exact in the performance of the general work viz the equal and punctual dividing the smallest measures of time  this nice case requires me a little to descend to particulars and touch matter of fact nearer than was intended what is it has restored and recovered the nations credit from the breaches made in it the answering this necessarily requires that i should also ask what made the former breaches in our credit i shall do this as modestly as i can for it is not the present work to open sores but to heal them to prevent more from breaking out  some of the reasons which sunk our credit and made the breaches in it in the late reign were the settling funds that were in themselves deficient and making no provinsion to supply those deficiencies some would perhaps go farther and say it was settling funds that were not probable and whose deficiencies were visible i shall not go that length the error was in the original it would be unjust to charge the deficiency of these funds upon the commissioners of the treasury for the time being it would be still harder to blame them for the parliament not supplying those deficiencies some may have said they were to blame in the first act because it was their work to provide funds and the parliament only gave what they asked that they took them and went away satisfied as sufficient for the supply of the occasion and that they were judges of the probability i am not of that mind though it is not to my purpose here to debate it but this is certain the not supplying the deficiencies upon the repeated application of the persons whose estates lay in those deficiencies seemed wholly to lie at the door of the parliament and this brought the tallies on those funds to intolerable unheard of discounts to the ruin of all that we called credit  what then has raised this credit i hope i do not detract from the just character of him whom one calls the great guide of the nations treasure if i say it was something else than his lordships management something prior to it in which that national honor and justice resolution of punctual payment and concern for the means of it appeared which put life into the nation and made those people that had money think it as safe as well deposited and the principal in as good hands as in their own so that they were perfectly easy in adventuring their money and the longer this went on the forwarder were the people to bring in their money nay so forward that the faster the government lowered their interest the more eager were the people to bring in their money  let us see where this began and this will tell us whose doing it was after the first session of parliament of her present majesty the queen acquainted the house that the funds had more than answered the sums they were given for there was the capital wound of deficiency healed at once that the overplus should be applied etc there was an assurance that all deficiencies if any happened should be made good this gave the parliament part a brightness that revived the spirits of the people helped open their purses which had been so long closed and caused taxes to be raised without murmuring  the queen acted the next part her majesty gave constant assurances that every thing given should be rightly applied and to encourage her people and show she was willing to bear a part of their burden the queen generously threw in an hundred thousand pownd of her own money appropriated for the civil list to ease the nation of so much in that years burden these were steps no prince ever was known to take before after this you never heard of a complaint of the heavy burden of the taxes though greater far than any raised in the former reign on the contrary the more you raised the easier they were paid the more the nation ran in debt the higher their credit rose every day after this you never had any commissioners of accounts asked for or any question about misapplication no man need go far for a reason for this the credit centred all in the queen whose concern was so visible for her peoples good that she would suffer no misapplications that she would employ none but in whom she could place entire confidence whose probity and exactness her majesty could answer for to her self and was well assured she might be safe in  it is no way lessening the honor of the servants her majesty chose to say that the nations credit depends not on the reputation of their conduct but on her majestys care in chosing such men whose conduct would perform all the nation could expect and that if they should fail her majesty would not fail to remove them and put in others this is putting the thing right the sum and substance of the argument is this in short  public credit is the consequence of honorable just and punctual management in the matter of funds and taxes or loans upon them where this goes before credit always follows  this management depends not upon the wellexecuting their offices by the great officers of the treasury and the exchequer but on the care conduct and vigilance of her majesty and the parliament the latter in establishing sufficient funds and the former in placing able officers and obliging them to an honorable management  the public credit therefore depends upon the queen and parliament entirely and not at all upon the well or ill management of the officers of what kind soever  another thing confirms this viz that while the parliament concerns it self to prevent the deficiency of funds and the queen to place men of probity and honor in the government of her treasury there is no question to be made but both would concern themselves upon any complaints of the subject to enquire into any mismanagement or abuse of the people in the greatest officers and not only punish the offender but prevent the offense by removing such officer and supplying his place with others who should better discharge so weighty a trust this resolves the point that credit centers where the government centers for if the sovereign displaces those that misapply the wound to credit heals of it self and while the sovereign carefully prefers men of honor and probity in the nations trust credit rises by a natural consequence  but still it is the nations credit that is it is built on the honor of the queen and parliament as above and this has been the case of the late lord treasurer the credit of whose management must return to the queen as to the center otherwise this must be called my lord ts credit not the nations and to our great loss must dye with his lordship which would be very unhappy for us and would imply that we ought to be more concerned for his lordships long life than the queens a thing would very ill please even his lordship to suggest  having laid down this as a foundation i build this short fabric upon it viz that as the public credit is national not personal so it depends upon no thing or person no man or body of men but upon the government that is the queen and parliament displacing or removing any minister of state or great officer whose management under the sovereign affects our treasure can no way influence our national credit while the just honorable and punctual conduct of the sovereign and parliament remains the same neither does our credit depend upon the person of the queen as queen or the individual house of commons identically as if no queen but her present majesty and no parliament but the present parliament could support and uphold the credit of the nation but it will remain a truth that every queen or every king and every parliament succeeding the present that shall discover the same justice in government the same care in giving sufficient funds the same honesty in supplying the deficiencies if they happen the same concern for the burden of the subject and the same care to put the treasure into the hands of faithful and experienced officers shall keep up the same character have the same credit and restore all these declinings to the same vigor and magnitude as ever  from hence it appears that our present loss of credit does not arise from any doubt whether the like conduct can produce this effect or no but from a strange suggestion that a new parliament or a new ministry shall either not design or not pursue the same vigorous and wise resolutions or manage with the same integrity as the last have done if her majesty saw room sor this suggestion i make no doubt her concern for the public good is such that no such change had been made or would lodge an hour longer among her thoughts but if her majesty is of the opinion that such a change will not lessen the concern for or just measures in the public service then the difficulty ends her majesty has now put new officers into her treasury no doubt her majesty is satisfied it shall be in their power to preserve the public credit and restore it to as great a height as ever it was before and i will presume to add that if her majesty should find it otherwise it wouldbe an effectual motive to farther changes till such hands should be found in whose conduct the national credit could not miscarry  it seems that the present discontents are grounded upon a supposition that a new ministry shall be less zealous for the public interest than the present or at least the objectors argue that her majesty has sufficient experience of the zeal of the present ministry for her service and for the public good and therefore it cannot seem rational to run that risque and the like of a new parliament  to this may be answered why should it be suggested that a new parliament shall not be equally zealous for the liberties of britain with the present they are to be chosen by the freeholders they are to be englishmen they are to be protestants they are to abjure the pretender they are to be joined with the same house of lords to be blessed with the same queen and the queen i doubt not filled with the same principles as before the same by which her majesty for i must place it there restored the nations credit before and raised it to what we have now seen it  shall we say the parliament will not raise money to carry on the war this would be to say we shall choose such a parliament as will declare the pretender forsake the confederacy join with the common enemy and depose the queen these are fears no thinking man can suppose to be rational and are spread about by none but those that desire it should be so and who crying out loudest of the fall of public credit procure the thing they complain of and indeed we have no breach of our credit but what rises from these men  to back their fears and make others think them reasonable they give long accounts of the progress of dr sacheverell as if the folly and impolitick vanity of that gentleman could influence the people of england to send up men as mad and foolish as himself i must profess to think if dr sacheverell thinks he serves the interest he pretends to appear for by his mobbing and riotous progress he is as much mistaken as they were who made him popular by a hasty prosecution instead of committing his sermon to the hangman and kicking him from the bar for a lunatic which if they had done the nation had been more in debt to their prudence than i think they are now for their justice  i am against furies on both sides nor do i see any such coming in if her majesty does let in any such i dare presume to say it must be for want of having their due character and the term of their services may probably end when they discover themselves  but if men of moderation and men of integrity come in i see no room to fear but our credit shall revive as well under a new ministry as an old  i know that some talk of a stagnation of the fountain that there is a famine of funds that the nation is exhausted and we are at a full stop this i take to be an amusement that comes over from france and is calculated very much for the service of the enemy but there are ways to get over the difficulty and the best way is demonstration and experience i believe the french king does not raise half so much hopes from our not being able to find any funds at all as from our being at a loss for credit to borrow upon those funds when they are raised and he may live to be deceived in both  but to obviate these things i take the liberty to say and that not withoutbook when the parliament meets be it the present parliament or a new parliament be it the present ministry or a new ministry as i hope there will not want zeal in the members to supply her majestys occasions for the war so were this war to hold seven years longer it is easy to propose sufficient funds for the carrying it on without that horrid proposal of mortgaging our land tax or without any such taxes as shall either be burthensom to the poor or scandalous to the nation  as to credit while the parliament and the queen continue to preserve those funds from deficiencies to make good such as happen and to support the vigor and honor of the public management i see no room to doubt but credit shall revive and as we have not yet found any fund the parliament has raised unsupplyd with loans and advances upon it even faster than could be desired so i can see no room to fear the contrary yet if such a thing should happen a mean head may find out some expedient that may not be ineffectual for a supply of which if there should be occasion a proposal shall not be wanting  finis
