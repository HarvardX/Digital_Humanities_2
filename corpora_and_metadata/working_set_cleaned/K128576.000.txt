to the noblemen gentlemen and proprietors of lands in scotland and inhabitants at large scotland as a part of the united kingdoms although having a right to the same protection from government with its sister kingdom england yet labors under some hardships and even imposed by act of parliament which the people of england know nothing about and these are burrow duties known by the name of imposts on malt liquors which have of late years spread themselves as a plague over the face of this country they began first in the capital of the kingdom in the year      an era when few classes of men in this country knew their rights and privileges as subjects or if they had been as well understood as at present were unacquainted with the mode of application to parliament all of which circumstances contributed to the bill in favors of the town of edinburgh passing without opposition imposing a duty of two pennies scots on the pint of all malt liquors brewed tapd or vended within the privileges of said city from which not only the burrows and towns of consequence but every petty town have taken the hint and have successively applied to parliament for similar acts and is now become almost an universal tax on this country viz the towns of edinburgh glasgow dundee dunbar kelso arbroath dalkeith prestonpans boness paisley portglasgow greenock etc and there is great reason to believe that private gentlemen who have the smallest villages situated on navigable rivers and who are not yet arrived at such a degree of consequence as to have a magistrate of any kind allured by the surprising revenue which this tax raises intend applying to parliament for grants of the same nature and parliament by no opposition having ever been made have overlooked them as unconnected either with the revenue the landed interest or the welfare of the people in general but which are connected with all these three to a degree of more consequence than is in general understood or attended to  it is the universal complaint that the malt liquors of scotland particularly porter and pale malt liquors are not equal in quality to that brewed in london and the other towns in england but it ceases to be a matter of any wonder when the public are informed that the malt liquors of scotland is loaded with  0 per cent of the kings excise in impost payable to royal borrows and other smaller towns  the trifling opinion which the country entertains of two pennies scots and mankind in general of the fractions of a penny has made this oppressive tax pass unnoticed not only by parliament but by the landed interest of this country both of whom ought to have set themselves in opposition to so partial and oppressive a burden on this part of the kingdom trifling as two pennies scots may appear when taken by the pint it is no less than   s sterling on every   gallons which is    of the whole value of malt liquor at   s per gallon but burdensome and oppressive as this must appear to every considerate person it is enormous when considered as a tax added to the excise which is so heavy already that when lord north in the year      laid   per cent on the amount of the customs and excise out of compassion to the laborious part of the nation who are the consumers of malt liquors he exempted the brewery in both kingdoms and in his subsequent taxes he has still paid such an attention to the brewery no doubt from a consciousness of its not being able to bear more that he has all along exempted it and even in the additional taxes on the malt he provided a drawback of  0 d per barrel on all malt liquor above the denomination of small beer and   d per barrel on this last species in lieu of the additional duty on the malt and although this drawback is not an exact equivalent for the additional duty on the malt yet it is plain he meant it to be so according to the best of his judgment and the information he had for every  0 gallons scots of all strong ale which is equal to a barrel of    gallons winchester measure the neat excise l0        for every  0 gallons scots of small beer do 0         l0      for the above two barrels of malt liquor which is    gallons the brewer in scotland pays   s   d of impost which every body will find that will take the trouble of calculating is upon   s   d the amount of the excise on a barrel of porter and a barrel of small beer no less than within the meerest trifle of  0 per cent upon the amount of the duty taken complexly and on small beer is no less than the exact double duty what would the noblemen and gentlemen and inhabitants of scotland say were government to lay a double tax or even  0 per cent on the malt liquor of scotland more than in england the very mention of it must strike every person of any consideration with astonishment how any species of manufacture could support such a load of taxes especially when it is considered that the price of no kind of malt liquor has been raised in scotland notwithstanding of this enormous local tax the fact is that at the time the impost was imposed the brewers found themselves in possession of a pretty good trade from the very low price of materials at that time and having no denomination of money equivolent to two pennies scots the amount of the tax and not being allowed by the law to add it to the price of the pint or gallon without exposing themselves to be charged the next highest duty viz strong ale were under the necessity in order to indemnify themselves of taking the value of the tax which is one ninth out of the quality of the liquor  every body will see what a debasement of the liquor would ensue by taking the ninth part of malt out of the quality to this debasement of the liquor must be attributed the decrease of the brewing business in scotland which is evidently demonstrated by the decrease of the malt tax as any body may be informed of by appyling to the excise office at edinburgh this debasement of the liquor does not operate in a common and ordinary proportion on the interest of the country but in a threefold proportion it is not only the loss of    part of the consumption of the barley to the landed interest and to the farmer but also    part of the revenue of the malt tax to government besides this debasement of the malt liquor makes at the most moderate calculation    less consumption of the liquor that is brewed and    decrease of quantity of malt is    nearly being only     part less so that it is plain this tax does not operate to the prejudice of the revenue as    but as decrease on the revenue of malt likewise not as    but as decrease of barley to the prejudice of the landed interest  this tax in proportion as it decreases the revenue of the malt tax    it decreases the revenue of the excise on the ale in the proportion of one ninth less consumed than would have been if this tax had not taken place so that it affects government in no less a proportion than    or loss on the revenue of excise in scotland  the author might have availed himself of mr arnots is history of edinburgh page     for the incontestible evidence of the above facts who had full access to the records of the city wherein he shows that in the year      at or after the time that the town obtained an act extending the impost to the parishes of st cuthberts canongate south and north leiths that the revenue of the impost paid to the town of edinburgh was no less a sum annually in the year       l         0        0   0      0                   0 00 0           00 0 during the period betwixt      first act the town of edinburgh procured for levying an impost which was confined to the city alone the impost did not exceed l  000 annually because as soon as the act took place the greatest part of the brewers either removed out of the town or settled in the invirons of the city which included the above parishes the amount of this noble income of l         s shows in the most forcible manner the great extent and flourishing state of the brewing business at said period for at    d every    gallons equal to an english barrel of    winchester gallons it is     0   barrels and in the year      a period not seven years ago the number of barrels brewed and consequently that paid revenue to government for the town of edinburgh takes the charge of the impost from the gaugers return was no more than        barrels so that there is an annual decrease comparing these two periods together of        barrels and suppposing them all two penny ale and at the old duty of   s per barrel is no less a sum than an annual loss to government of l         s on the excise only for the presumption is that the revenue on the brewery would not have fallen short of the above quantity had the impost act not taken place as the nation instead of a retrograde motion toward ension has been advancing since that period  viz the year      in a rapid progress to wealth and opulence and therefore no other good cause can be assigned for the decrease of the revenue on this article but the debasement of the liquor which took place in consequence thereof on the same principle the malt duty has likewise fallen short in proportion for     0   barrels the amount of the quantity brewed in the year      in the city of edinburgh allowing six bushels winchester measure to every   barrels or    gallons of two penny will take         bushels which at   per bushel the duty exigible till the year      amounts to l         s in that year the impost revenue of the town of edinburgh had fallen to        barrels only which at the above calculation viz six bushels to every   barrels produces      0 bushels at   is bushels l         0 malt made in edinburgh in              at           0 ditto           0 ditto         0           0    0 by the above calculation there is lost annually on the ale duty l         0 on the malt duty annually as above   0    0 lost to the country on the reve        0 this enormous sum is not all the loss that the country has sustained by this absurd tax for the landed interest has lost the consumption of        bolls of barley at  0 s per boll a very moderate medium price is the immense sum annually of l       0 0 lost annually l   0      0 if the principle of these calculations is founded on right reason and common sense this country has lost betwixt      and the present period    years the enormous sum of l            few instances perhaps have occurred that shows in a more forcible light the dangerous tendency of admitting the most trifling tax to be levied on a common necessary of life this estimation the author hopes will be thought very moderate when it is considered that additional duties have been laid on both malt and ale and the price of materials have been annually advancing during the above period all of which shows that the authors supposition of    less consumption of ale in consequence of the impost tax taking place in this country from which all these calculations  taken are too too well founded more especially when it is considered that the above enormous sum has been lost to the country on the consumption of edinburgh alone exclusive of all the other parts of scotland  the author hopes what he has said will meet the attention of the noblemen and gentlemen lords of council and session barons of exchequer and commissioners of customs and excise as likewise the worthy manufacturers and useful mechanic and labourer who are also interested that this oppressive tax should be abolished in scotland to put them on a footing with their brethren manufacturers and laborers in england as also householders of all denominations whose interest it is to have as in england a nourishing sound and wholesome malt liquor  the impost acts have the effect of a monoply against the inhabitants of every town where it is established in loading with an additional tax one of the commodities of life and prevents people at a distance from relieving them by serving them better and cheaper than their own brewers either can or choose to do it being the interest of every community to open the most free communication for all sorts of provisions and therefore it is their interest to oppose all such acts  in short it is the interest of the community at large and of the inhabitants of towns in particular to guard against magistrates introducing by act of parliament and without their own consent any species of taxation and carefully watching over any bill in its progress through the house of commons and the author of this address takes the liberty to advise the inhabitants of corporated towns in all cases where magistrates propose getting new acts of parliament to choose a committee of the most worthy and respectful of their number unconnected with the council to watch over the steps the magistrates and council take in such a piece of business and that they would always employ a council at law to take care of their interest in the house of commons the expense of which would be a mere trifle but of all the ranks of men in the community he would advise the brewers in scotland at large to be upon their guard when any revenue laws are applied for more especially those whose avowed purpose is to subject them alone to a tax exclusive of the rest of the inhabitants as all impost taxes on malt liquor are  taxes to the prejudice of the revenue the landed interest and the ruin of a respectable rank of citizens who are subjected  partial local and unequal tax which their brethren the brewers of england know nothing about  it has been said and is still averred by the abettors of this tax that it is the inhabitants that pay the tax and not the brewers and as this doctrine is industriously propagated among the inhabitants of the different towns the author begs the readers indulgence until he explodes this magisterial doctrine calculated to mislead the well meaning citizen who would spurn the idea of contributing by his consent to load his neighbor and fellowcitizen with a burdensome and oppressive tax of which he himself bears no part it is well known that twopenny ale at the union of the two kingdoms was sold at twopence the scots pint the brewer had then the malt  0 per cent cheaper than at present and yet every body knows that the twopenny ale all over scotland is sold at the same price at this very moment if this is the fact the author begs the favor that the advocates for this impost tax will say where the impost which is of a penny is added to the price but however trifling it appears on the pint it is   of a penny on the gallon and on a barrel of     chester measure or twelve scots gallons is    d which is the exact duty of excise on small beer and consequently small beer in scotland pays exactly double duty of what it is charged with in england it is in this way say the trifling denomination of the tax that the iniquity and oppression of it has escaped the notice of the legislature and all good citizens and unless the inhabitants at large pay the tax where is the equity of charging a few individuals as much as all the inhabitants besides for the ornamenting of any town whatever and what is more extraordinary perhaps those very people who pay this oppressive tax do not reside within the precincts of the town as is the case in many places having an impost in short every view you take of this tax it is fraught with absurdity  it is much to the honor of this country at the present period that a spirit of patriotism prevails among the noblemen and gentlemen to promote the manufactures of their own country which if followed out with steadiness and perseverance will raise this country to a degree of opulence unknown to former ages it is therefore from them we are to expect  pport in opposition to all our oppressions and as there never was at any period a prime minister who seemed to be more the friend of the manufacturer or lower class of the people we have every reason to expect that he will oppose attempts that are prejudicial to them in any shape provided the representatives in parliament from scotland show a truly spirited zeal for the public welfare it is to them we have to look for redress and as they are mostly men of patriotic principles we cannot entertain a doubt but they will be the guardians of our interest the author in the firm persuasion that the legislature and public at large will unite in redressing the evil complained of  remains their most obedient humble servant john cunningham senr brewer greenock
