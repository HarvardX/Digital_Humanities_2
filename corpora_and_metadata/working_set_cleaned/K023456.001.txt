map of south america an accurate map of south america drawn from the best modern maps and charts and regulated by astronl observatns by eman  bowen geogr to his majesty        an account of the european settlements in america  in six parts i a short history of the discovery of that part of the world ii the manners and customs of the original inhabitants iii of the spanish settlements iv of the portuguese v of the french dutch and danish vi of the english each part contains an accurate description of the settlements in it their extent climate productions trade genius and disposition of their inhabitants the interests of the several powers of europe with respect to those settlements and their political and commercial views with regard to each other  in two volumes  vol i  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclvii  the preface the affairs of america have lately engaged a great deal of the public attention before the present war there were but a very few who made the history of that quarter of the world any part of their study though the matter is certainly very curious in itself and extremely interesting to us as a trading people  the history of a country which though vast in extent is the property of only four nations and which though peopled probably for a series of ages is only known to the rest of the world for about two centuries does not naturally afford matter for many volumes yet it is certain that to acquire a proper knowledge of the history of the events in america an idea of it is present state and a competent judgment of it is trade a great deal of reading has been found requisite and i may add that the reading on many parts of this subject is dry and disgusting that authors have treated on it some without a sufficient knowledge of the subject and others in such a manner as no knowledge of the subject in the author could induce any body to become readers that some are loaded with a lumber of matter that can interest very few and that others obscure the truth in many particulars to gratify the low prejudices of parties and i may say of nations whatever is written by the english settled in our colonies is to be read with great caution because very few of them write without a bias to the interest of the particular province to which they belong or perhaps to a particular faction in that province it is only by comparing the printed accounts with one another and those with the best private informations and correcting all by authentic matter of record that one can discover the truth and this has been a matter of some difficulty  with regard to the foreign settlements recourse was had to the best printed accounts of travelers and others and in some points to private information from intelligent traders the materials for the foreign settlements are far from being as perfect or as much to be depended upon as we could wish it was very seldom that i could venture to transcribe any thing directly from them without some addition or some corrective  in the historical part of this work i fixed my eye principally on some capital matters which might the most fully engage and best reward the attention of the reader and in treating of those i dwelt only upon such events as seemed to me to afford some political instruction or to open the characters of the principal actors in those great scenes the affairs which seemed most worthy of an account of any length are those splendid and remarkable events of the discovery of america and the conquest of the only two civilized kingdoms it contained  in treating of other parts i have given so much of the history of each country as may serve to show when and upon what principles it was planted to enable the reader the better to judge of it is present condition these accounts are very short and considering of what sort of matter their histories are composed i believe i shall deserve as much for what i have omitted as for what i have inserted if i could not write well upon any subject i have endeavored always to write concisely  my principal view in treating of the several settlements was to draw every thing toward their trade which is the point that concerns us the most materially for which reason i have but little considered their civil and yet less their natural history further than as they tended to throw some light upon the commerce of these countries except where the matters were very curious and served to diversify the work  it is not to be expected that a performance of this kind can be written equally throughout in some places the subject refuses all ornament and the matter dry in itself is by no art to be made otherwise in some a contagion communicated from the dullness of materials which yet were necessary to the work may probably appear in many and perhaps the most blameable parts the author alone must be answerable however there are some errors of the press especially toward the beginning which are owing to the authors absence from it  having spoken perhaps a little too hardly of my materials i must except the assistance i have had from the judicious collection called harriss voyages there are not many finer pieces than the history of brazil in that collection the light in which the author sets the events in that history is fine and instructive an uncommon spirit prevails through it and his remarks are every where striking and deep the little sketch i have given in the part of portuguese america if it has any merit it is entirely due to that original however the accounts given of many things in that part of his work which relates to the english and french settlements may be defective and suited rather to the ancient than to the present state of affairs in that part of the world his remarks have rarely this fault and where i differ from him in any respect it is with deference to the judgment of a writer to whom this nation is much obliged for endeavoring every where with so much good sense and eloquence to rouse that spirit of generous enterprise that can alone make any nation powerful or glorious  errata p l vol i  0    for numberless read a number      for it in future read a fortune

european settlements in america part i the discovery of america and the reduction of mexico and peru chap i there was an extraordinary coincidence of events at the time that the discovery of america made one of the principal the invention of printing the making of gunpowder the improvement of navigation the revival of ancient learning and the reformation all of these conspired to change the face of europe entirely at this time the principal monarchies began to knit and to acquire the strength and take the form they have at this day before this period the manners of europe were wholly barbarous even in italy where the natural mildness of the climate and the dawning of literature had a little softened the minds of the people and introduced something approaching toward politeness the history preceding this era and indeed for some time after it is nothing but one series of treasons usurpations murders and massacres nothing of a manly courage nothing of a solid and rational policy scarce any state had then very extensive views or looked much further than to the present advantage they did not well comprehend the complicated system of interests that europe formed even long before this lewis the eleventh who was looked upon as one of the wisest princes in his time and one who sacrificed every thing to his ambition sacrificed one of the fairest objects of that ambition to a pique which since his time could have little influence on the counsels of any prince his son charles the eighth as he won italy without either courage or conduct so he lost it by a chain of false measures such as we may venture to say has no parallel in later times a wild romantic courage in the northern and western parts of europe and a wicked policy in the italian states was the character of that age if we look into the manners of the courts there appear but very faint marks of cultivation and politeness the interview between our edward the fourth and his brother of france wherein they were both caged up like wild beasts shows dispositions very remote from a true sense of honor from the dignity of their station or any just ideas of politeness and humanity all the anecdotes which remain of these and other courts are in the same spirit  if the courts had made such poor advances in policy and in politeness which might seem the natural growth of courts at any time both the courts and the people were yet less advanced in useful knowledge the little learning which then subsisted was only the dotage of the scholastic philosophy of words together with the infancy of politer learning which only concerned words too though in another way the elegance and purity of the latin tongue was then the highest and almost the only point of a scholars ambition mathematical learning was little valued or cultivated the true system of the heavens was not dreamed of there was no knowledge at all of the real form of the earth and in general the ideas of mankind were not extended beyond their sensible horizon  in this state of affairs christopher columbus a native of genoa undertook to extend the boundaries which ignorance had given to the world this mans design arose from the just idea he had formed of the figure of the earth though the maps more erroneous than his conjectures made him mistake the object his design was to find a passage to china and india by the western ocean it is not improbable that besides the glory attending such a discovery and the private advantages of fortune he might propose to derive from it columbus had a further incentive from national jealousy and resentment venice and genoa were then almost the only trading powers in europe and they had no other support of their power but their commerce this bred a rivalship a jealousy and frequent wars between them but in traffic venice was much superior she had drawn to herself almost the whole commerce of india always one of the most valuable in the world and then carried on only by the way of egypt and the red sea an emulation of this kind might probably have put columbus on finding another and more direct passage to the east indies and by that means transferring this profitable trade to his own country but neither that which he sought nor that which he found was destined for his country however he performed the duty of a good citizen and made his first proposal at home at home it was rejected discharged of this obligation he applied to the court of france and meeting no better success there he offered next his services to our henry the seventh this prince was rather a prudent steward and manager of a kingdom than a great king and one of those defensive geniuses who are the last in the world to relish a great but problematical design it is therefore no wonder that his brother whom columbus had employed to solicit in england after several years spent here had little success in his negotiation but in portugal where he applied himself after his failure here his offers were not only rejected but he was insulted and ridiculed he found however in these insults and this ridicule a new incitement to pursue his scheme urged forward by the stings of anger and resentment  last of all he exercised his interest and his patience for eight years together at the court of ferdinand and isabella there is a sort of enthusiasm in all projectors absolutely necessary for their affairs which makes them proof against the most fatiguing delays the most mortifying disappointments the most shocking insults and what is severer than all the presumptuous judgments of the ignorant upon their designs columbus had a sufficient share of this quality he had every day during this long space to combat with every objection that want of knowledge or that a false knowledge could propose some held that the known world which they thought was all that could be known floated like a vast scum upon the ocean that the ocean itself was infinite others who entertained more just notions and believed that the whole of the earth and waters composed one vast globe drew a consequence from it as absurd as the former opinion for they argued that if columbus should sail beyond a certain point the convexity of this globe would prevent his return as is usual in such cafes every one abounded with objections his whole time was spent in fruitless endeavors to enlighten ignorance to remove prejudice and to vanquish that obstinate incredulity which is of all others the greatest enemy to improvement rejecting every thing as false and absurd which is ever so little out of the track of common experience and it is of the more dangerous consequence as it carries a delusive air of coolness of temper and wisdom with all this he had yet greater difficulties from the interests of mankind than from their malignity and ignorance the expense of the undertaking inconsiderable as this expense was was at the bottom the chief support of the other objections and had more weight than all the rest together however with an assiduity and firmness of mind never enough to be admired and applauded he at length overcame all difficulties and to his inexpressible joy with a fleets of three ships and the title and command of an admiral set sail on the third of august      on a voyage the most daring and grand in the design and in the event of which the world was the most concerned of any that ever yet was undertaken  it must not be omitted here in honor to the sex and in justice to isabella that this scheme was first countenanced and the equipment made by the queen only the king had no share in it she even raised the money necessary for the design upon her own jewels  i do not propose to relate all the particulars of columbuss voyage in a track now so well known and so much frequented but then there was no chart to direct him no lights from former navigators no experience of the winds and currents peculiar to those seas he had no guide but his own genius nor any thing to comfort and appease his companions discouraged and mutinous with the length and hopelessness of the voyage but some indications which he drew from the casual appearances of land birds and floating seaweeds most of them little to be depended upon but which this wise commander well acquainted with the human heart always knew how to turn to the best advantage it was in this expedition that the variation of the compass was first observed an appearance which has ever since puzzled all philosophers and which at this time made a great impression upon columbuss pilots when in an unknown and boundless ocean far from the road of all former navigation nature itself seemed altered and the only guide they had left appeared to be upon the point of forsaking them but columbus with a wonderful quickness and sagacity pretended to discover a physical cause for this appearance which though it did not satisfy himself was plausible enough to remove something of the terror of his mariners expedients of this kind were daily wanting and the fertile genius of this discoverer invented them daily at last by use they began to lose their effect the crew insisted on his returning and grew loud and insolent in their demand they even talked of throwing him overboard even his own invention and almost his hopes were near exhausted when the only thing which could appease them happened the clear discovery of land after a voyage of thirtythree days the longest ever any man was known to be from sight of shore before that time  they landed on one of the islands now called lucayos or bahamas which is remarkable for nothing but this event and here it was that the two worlds if i may use the expression were first introduced to one another a meeting of an extraordinary nature and which produced great changes in both the first thing columbus did after thanking god for the success of his important voyage was to take possession of the island in the name of their catholic majestys by setting up a cross upon the shore great multitudes of the inhabitants looking on ignorant and unconcerned at a ceremony which was to deprive them of natural liberty the stay of the spaniards in this island was but short they found from the extreme poverty of the people that this was by no means the indies which they sought for  columbus at his departure very prudently took with him some of the natives that they might learn the spanish tongue and be his guides and interpreters in this new scene of affairs nor were they unwilling to accompany him he touched on several of the islands in the same cluster enquiring every where for gold which was the only object of commerce he thought worth his care because the only thing that could give the court of spain an high opinion of his discoveries all directed him to a great island called bohio of which they spoke extraordinary things and principally that it abounded in gold they told him it lay to the southward to the southward he steered his course and found the island which he called hispaniola no ways inferior to the reports commodious harbors an agreeable climate a good soil and what was of most consequence a country that promised from some samples a great abundance of gold inhahited by an humane and hospitable people in a state of simplicity fit to be worked upon these circumstances determined columbus to make this island the center of his designs to plant a colony there and to establish things in some permanent order before he proceeded to further discoveries but to carry his designs of a settlement here and his schemes of future discoveries into execution it was necessary that he should return to spain and equip himself with a proper force he had now collected a sufficient quantity of gold to give credit to his voyage at court and such a number of curiosities of all kinds as might strike the imaginations and engage the attention of the people before he parted he took care to secure the friendship of the principal king of the island by caresses and presents and under pretense of leaving him a force sufficient to assist him against his enemies he laid the groundwork of a colony he built a fort and put a small garrison of spaniards into it with such directions for their conduct as might ensure their safety and the good offices of the inhabitants if the men had not been of that kind who are incapable of acting prudently either from their own or other peoples wisdom he did every thing to gain the esteem of the natives by the justice and even generosity of his dealings and the politeness and humanity with which he behaved upon every occasion he showed them too that though it was not in his will it was not the less in his power to do them mischief if they acted so as to force him upon harsher measures the surprising effects of his cannon and the sharpness of the spanish swords of which he made an innocent ostentation convinced them of this  when the spaniards first arrived in that country they were taken for men come from heaven and it was no wonder considering the extreme novelty of their appearance and the prodigious superiority they had in every respect over a people in all the nakedness of mere nature whatever therefore the indians got from them they valued in an high degree not only as curious and useful but even as things sacred and the persons of the spaniards were respected in the same light columbus who knew the value of opinion did all he could to keep them in their error and indeed no action of his either of weakness or cruelty could furnish matter to undeceive them for which reason on his departure he left the people with the best inclinations imaginable to nurse his infant colony and when he desired some of the inhabitants to carry into spain he was more at a loss whom he should accept than how he should prevail upon them to go  chap ii on his return homewards still attentive to his design he aimed at such discoveries as could be prosecuted without deviating considerably from his course he touched upon several islands to the southward and discovered the caribbees of the barbarity of whose inhabitants he had heard terrible accounts in hispaniola he had before landed upon cuba in his passage from the bahamas so that in this his first voyage he gained a general knowledge of all the islands which lie in such an astonishing number in that great sea which divides north and south america but hitherto he neither knew nor suspected any continent between him and china  he returned to europe after an absence of above six months and was driven by a great storm into the harbor of lisbon this he did not look upon as a misfortune since here he had the satisfaction of convincing the portuguese demonstratively of what an error they were guilty in rejecting his proposals it was now his turn to triumph those who want sagacity to discern the advantages of an offer when it is made to themselves and treat it with the greatest scorn are always most stung with envy when they actually see these advantages in the hands of another the portuguese had some time before this begun to make a figure their ships had coasted africa for a greater length than any had done before them which opened to them a profitable trade to guinea this gave them a reputation they considered discovery as their proper province and they were enraged to see that the castilians were now let into the same path in consequence of an offer which they had rejected some proposed to murder the admiral but all were agreed to treat him in the most unworthy manner however their design of insulting him gave columbus an opportunity at once of gratifying his resentment maintaining his own dignity and asserting the honor of the flag of castile he sent to the king at his first entering the harbor to desire a liberty to come up to lisbon and refresh as he had his masters orders not to avoid his ports adding that he was not from guinea but the indies an officer of the king of portugal came aboard him with an armed force and ordered him to come ashore and give an account of himself to the kings officers columbus told him he had the honor of serving the king of castile and would own himself accountable to no other the portuguese then desired him to send the master of his ship this he likewise refused saying that the admirals of castile always chose rather to die than deliver up themselves or even the meanest of their men and if violence was intended he was prepared to meet force with force a spirited behavior in almost any circumstance of strength is the most politic as well as the most honorable course we preserve a respect at least by it and with that we generally preserve every thing but when we lose respect every thing is lost we invite rather than suffer insults and the first is the only one we can resist with prudence columbus found this the officer did not pursue his demands the admiral had all the refreshments he wanted and was even received at court with particular marks of distinction  from lisbon he proceeded to seville the court was then at barcelona but before he went to give an account of his voyage he took all the care he could to provide for another he wrote an abstract of his proceedings and sent with it a memorial of all such things as were necessary for the establishment of a colony and for further discoveries soon after he began his journey to barcelona every where followed by the admiration and applauses of the people who crowded to see him from all parts he entered the city in a sort of triumph there never was a more innocent triumph nor one that formed a more new and pleasing spectacle he had not destroyed but discovered nations the americans he had brought with him appeared in all the uncouth finery of their own country wondered at by every body and themselves admiring every thing they saw the several animals many highly beautiful and all strangers to this part of the world were so disposed as to be seen without difficulty the other curiosities of the new world were displayed in the most advantageous manner the utensils the arms and the ornaments of a people so remote from us in situation and manners some valuable for the materials even the rudeness of the workmanship in many made them the more curious when it was considered by whom and with what instruments they were wrought the gold was not forgot the admiral himself closed the procession he was received by the king and queen with all imaginable marks of esteem and regard and they ordered a magnificent throne to be erected in public to do him the greater honor a chair was prepared for him in which he sat and gave in presence of the whole court a full and circumstantial account of all his discoveries with that composedness and gravity which is so extremely agreeable to the spanish humor and with the modesty of a man who knows he has done things which do not need to be proclaimed by himself the successful merit of columbus was now understood by every body and when the king and queen led the way all the grandees and nobility of the court vied with each other in their civilities and caresses  these honors did not satisfy columbus he prepared with all expedition for a second voyage the difficulties attending the first were all vanished the importance of the object appeared every day more clearly and the court was willing to second the vivacity of his desires to the full but before his departure there was one thing which they judged wanting to give them a clear and unquestionable right to the countries which should be discovered this was a grant of them from the pope the portuguese some time before had a grant of such lands as they should discover within certain latitudes and this grant made a similar one to the spaniards more necessary the pope accordingly gave a very ample bull in their favor very liberally conceding countries of which he was so far from having any possession that he had no knowledge of them the limits of this grant was a line drawn from pole to pole an hundred leagues to the westward of the azores on the other side no bounds at all were set this was afterward a subject of much controversy between the crowns of spain and portugal the latter having got a grant of all that should be discovered to the east as the former had of all to the westward those who drew the bulls not having known enough of the figure of the earth to see that these grants must necessarily clash with one another and the powers which desired them were perhaps not sorry to find their pretensions such as they might extend or contract at pleasure  whatever the validity of this ample grant might be columbus was made governor with the highest authority over all that it contained but he had somewhat with him more material for his possession than any charters this was a fleet of seventeen sail of ships with all manner of necessaries for settlement or conquest and fifteen hundred men on board some of them of the best families in spain with this fleet he set sail on his second voyage the   th of september      he gave each of the captains instructions for their course sealed with orders not to open them unless in distress and separated from the fleet that he might create such an absolute dependence of all upon himself as should preserve an uniformity in their designs on the second of november they made land which is the island now called dominica but his design was first to settle his colony before he attempted any new discovery therefore he made no stay here nor at several other islands at which he touched before he could make hispaniola  on his arrival he found the fort he had built utterly demolished and all his men killed they had first fallen out amongst themselves upon the usual subjects of strife women and gold and afterward preserving as little harmony with the natives and observing no decency in their behavior or justice in their dealings they quickly lost their esteem and were every man murdered after having been dispersed into different parts of the island the prince whom they were left to defend was himself wounded in their defense and bore this mark of his affection and good faith when columbus returned to the island the admiral very wisely forbore to make any nice enquiry into the affair or to commence hostilities in revenge for the loss of his soldiers but he took the most effectual measures to prevent such an evil for the future he chose a more commodious station for his colony on the northeast part of the island which had a good port great convenience of water and a good soil and lay near that part where he was informed the richest mines of the country were found in gratitude to his royal patroness he called it isabella he engaged in the settlement with great warmth and never allowed himself a moments repose from superintending the fortifications the private houses and the works of agriculture in all which the fatigue was infinite for he had not only the natural difficulties attending all such undertakings but he had the insuperable laziness of the spaniards to contend with so that spent with the fatigues of so long a voyage and the greater fatigues he had endured since he came on shore he fell into a dangerous illness of this accident numberless of his men took the advantage to begin a rebellion to undo all he had done and to throw every thing into the most terrible confusion these people on their leaving spain had fancied to themselves that gold was to be found every where in this country and that there required nothing further to make ample estates than to be transported into it but finding their mistake and that instead of receiving these golden showers without any pains they fared ill labored hard and that their prospects of it in future if any at all were emote and uncertain their discontent was general and the mutinous disposition increased so fast and was carried to such extremities that if the admiral had not recovered at a very critical time and on his recovery had not acted in the most resolute and effectual manner all his hopes of a settlement in hispaniola had been at an end he was satisfied with imprisoning some of the chiefs this was neither a time or place for very extensive or rigorous justice he quelled this sedition but he saw at the same time that his work was not yet done he saw another danger against which he was to provide with equal diligence he had good reasons to apprehend that the americans were not well affected to their new guests and might probably meditate to cut them off whilst they saw them divided amongst themselves to prevent this as well as to banish idleness from amongst his men and to revive military discipline he marched into the heart of the country through the most frequented parts of it in order of battle colors flying and trumpets sounding with the flower of his troops to the mountains of cibao where lay the richest mines then discovered in the island here he built a fort to secure this advantageous post and overawe the country and then he returned in the same pomp and order to the inexpressible terror of the inhabitants who had now no prospect of withstanding a force which to them seemed more than human  in this expedition columbus made great ostentation of his cavalry this was the first time the indians of america had ever seen horses their dread of these animals and their riders were extreme they thought both formed but one animal and the impetuosity of their charge appeared irresistible to these naked and illarmed people wherever they appeared those indians who intended any hostility immediately fled nor did they think the intervention of the deepest and most rapid rivers any security they believed that the horses could fly and that nothing was impossible to creatures so extraordinary but columbus did not rely upon those prejudices though he made all imaginable use of them knowing that those things which appear most terrible at first become every day less affecting by use and that they even grow contemptible when their real power is once well known for which reason he neglected none of his former methods of cultivating the affections of the natives he still showed them all manner of respect and when he had taken two persons of their nation who had committed some acts of hostility and was at the point of putting them to death he pardoned and set them free at the intercession of a prince of the country with whom he was in alliance on the other hand he saw how necessary it was to preserve a strict discipline amongst the spaniards to keep them from that idleness to which they had such a propensity and which naturally retarded the growth of the colony at the same time that it nourished discontent and sedition he employed them in cutting roads through the country a work which the natives never attempted themselves nor now endeavored to oppose though it be one of the best instruments of enslaving any barbarous people this wise governor observed besides that the spaniards conformed with great difficulty to the indian manner of living to which however they were necessitated but from which for want of use they suffered great hardships to remedy this evil he daily sent out small parties upon expeditions into the country from which he derived two material advantages first he enured by degrees all his people to the manner of living in the country and secondly he taught them to know it perfectly lest a war should find them unprovided in the only point in which the indians were their superiors and a point which in a woody and mountainous country is certainly of the greatest importance all this he did without any material hazard to the sum of his affairs at home he endeavored to withdraw the spaniards from their romantic hopes of miraculous treasures and to fix them to a rational and industrious course of life he represented to them that there was no real wealth but what arose from labor and that a garden a corn ground and a mill were riches more to their present purpose than all the gold they were in expectation of meeting in the indies in short he labored for the establishment of this colony with as much assiduity as though his views had extended no further at the same time that he meditated the greatest discoveries and considered those things which had astonished the world only as the earnest of his future performances  i have before mentioned his having put in at cuba he had reason to believe this a place no way contemptible in point of wealth and with regard to its extent he was not certain whether it was an island or a part of some great continent but now that he had got his colony to take firm root in the indies he prepared with all expedition to ascertain this and to push his discoveries to the utmost in which he had succeeded hitherto so happily  chap iii this voyage was more remarkable for the hardships which the admiral and his men suffered than for any considerable discovery it produced as he endeavored to coast along the southern shore of cuba he was entangled in a labyrinth of an innumerable multitude of islands amongst which he reckoned   0 in one day they were most of them pleasant and well inhabited affording our navigator an agreeable meditation on this fertility of nature where the world looked for nothing but a barren ocean these islands perhaps the most numerous in the world columbus who had a grateful mind in which the memory of his benefactress was always uppermost called jardin de la reyna or the queens garden in honor of queen isabella but their number and fertility made little amends for the obstruction they gave columbus in the course of his navigation the coast absolutely unknown among so many rocks sands and shelves the sudden and violent storms the tornadoes and the terrible thunder and lightning so constant between the tropicks obliged him to keep a continual watch and held his mind upon a constant stretch the voyage was extended to an unprofitable length by these difficulties and being driven out to sea the worst disaster of all befell them their provisions fell short in this extremity they were obliged to come to a very narrow and bad allowance in the distribution of which the admiral fared nothing better than the rest in this extremity of fatigue of body and of mind in famine and in danger his usual firmness began nearly to forsake him but it could go no further than to oblige him to remark in his journal that no interest of his own should ever oblige him to engage again in such an enterprise they were at last relieved by the appearance of jamaica where they were hospitably received and supplied with cassava bread and water from thence they proceeded mortified and disappointed to hispaniola not being able to come to any certainty concerning cuba other than that they understood from some of the inhabitants that it was an island this disappointment and the infinite fatigue and difficulty of the voyage threw columbus into a lethargy which was near being fatal to him and of which he was scarcely recovered when they arrived at the harbor of isabella  here they found all things in confusion and the colony in the utmost danger of being a second time utterly destroyed as if its prosperity or destruction depended upon the presence or absence of columbus for no sooner was he sailed than the spaniards who were very difficultly retained in their duty by all his steadiness and wisdom broke through all regulations laughed at government and discipline and spread themselves over the island committing a thousand disorders and living at free quarter upon the inhabitants whose hatred to them was worked up to such a point that they wanted only the word from their princes to fall on and massacre the whole colony a thing by no means impractiable in it is present disorder four of the principal sovereigns of the island took advantage of this disposition and united to drive out those imperious intruders none adhered to them but one called gunacagarry the same prince whom columbus from the first had taken so much pleasure to oblige in his dominions some of the spaniards found protection the other princes had already commenced hostilities and one of them killed sixteen of the spaniards who were taking no uniform measures to oppose them nor in their present anarchy could it be well expected  in this condition was the island on the arrival of columbus whose first business was to collect the scattered fragments of the colony and to form them into a body this he was the better able to accomplish because the present danger added a weight to his authority but it was necessary that he should lose no time he was resolved to act with what force he had rather than wait until the union of the islanders might be better cemented against him and they might find some lesser matters in their favor to raise their courage and abate their terror of the spanish arms he therefore marched against the king who had killed the    spaniards as having a greater appearance of justice and because he happened to be worse prepared to receive him than the others he was easily subdued and several of his subjects sent prisoners into spain the second whom he designed to attack being better prepared against force he was resolved to circumvent him by fraud and got him into his power by a stratagem which did no honor to his sincerity and rather showed great weakness in this unfortunate barbarian than any extraordinary contrivance in those who deceived him  the other princes were not terrified at these examples their hatred to the spaniards increased and perceiving that all depended upon a sudden and vigorous exertion of their strength they brought an immense army it is said of one hundred thousand men into the field which was arrayed in the largest plain in that country columbus though he had but a small force did not scruple to go out to meet them his army consisted but of two hundred foot twenty horse and twenty wolf dogs the latter part of this army has a ludicrous appearance but it was a very serious matter amongst a people no better provided with arms offensive or defensive than the indians neither was it rash in columbus to venture an engagement with forces so vastly superior in numbers for when such numbers are no better skilled or armed than these were their multitude is in fact no just cause of dread but to themselves the event was answerable the victory was decisive for the spaniards in which their horses and dogs had a considerable share the loss on the side of the indians was very great and from that day forward they despaired and relinquished all thoughts of dislodging the spaniards by force columbus had but little difficulty in reducing the whole island which now became a province of spain had a tribute imposed and forts built in several parts to enforce the levying of it and to take away from this unhappy people all prospect of liberty  in this affecting situation they often asked the spaniards when they intended to return to their own country small as the number of these strangers was the inhabitants were extremely burdened to subsist them one spaniard consumed more than ten indians a circumstance which shows how little this people had advanced in the art of cultivating the earth or how lazy they were in doing it since their indigence reduced them to such an extreme frugality that they found the spaniniards who are the most abstemious people upon earth excessively voracious in the comparison their observation of this joined to their despair put the indians upon a project of starving out their invaders in pursuance of this scheme they entirely abandoned the little agriculture which they practiced and unanimously retired into the most barren and impracticable parts of the island this illadvised stratagem completed their ruin a number of people crowded into the worst parts of the country subsisting only upon it is spontaneous productions were soon reduced to the most terrible famine it is sure attendant epidemical sickness pursued at it is heels and this miserable people half famished and lessened a third of their numbers were obliged to relinquish their scheme to come down into the open country and to submit once more to bread and fetters  this conquest and the subsequent ones made by the several european nations with as little color of right as consciousness of doing any thing wrong gives one just reason to reflect on the notions entertained by mankind in all times concerning the right of dominion at this period few doubted of the power of the pope to convey a full right to any country he was pleased to chalk out amongst the faithful because they were subject to the church and amongst infidels because it was meritorious to make them subject to it this notion began to lose ground at the reformation but another arose of as bad a tendency the idea of the dominion of grace which prevailed with several and the effects of which we have felt amongst ourselves the mohammedan great merit is to spread the empire and the faith and none among them doubt the legality of subduing any nation for these good purposes the greeks held that the barbarians were naturally designed to be their slaves and this was so general a notion that aristotle himself with all his penetration gave into it very seriously in truth it has it is principle in human nature for the generality of mankind very readily slide from what they conceive a fitness for government to a right of governing and they do not so readily agree that those who are superior in endowments should only be equal in condition these things partly palliate the guilt and horror of a conquest undertaken with so little color over a people whose chief offense was their credulity and their confidence in men who did not deserve it but the circumstances columbus was in the measures he was obliged to preserve with his court and his humane and gentle treatment of this people by which he mitigated the rigor of this conquest take off much of the blame from him as the necessity of taking up arms at all never arose from his conduct or from his orders on the contrary his whole behavior both to the spaniards and indians the care he took to establish the one without injury to the other and the constant bent of his policy to work every thing by gentle methods may well be an example to all persons in the same situation  since i have digressed so far it will be the more excusable to mention a circumstance recorded in the history of this settlement america was then at least these parts of it without almost any of those animals by which we profit so greatly it had neither horses nor oxen nor sheep nor swine columbus brought eight sows into america and a small number of horned cattle this was the stock which supplied about two hundred years ago a country now the most abounding in these animals of any part of the known world in which too it has been a business for this century past to hunt oxen merely for their hides an example which shows how small a number might originally have served to produce all the animals upon earth who commonly procreate very fast to a certain point and there seem very much at a stand  chap iv whilst columbus was reducing this wealthy island to the obedience of the crown of castile and laying the foundations of the spanish grandeur in america his enemies were endeavoring with pains as indefatigable to ruin him in spain some of the persons principally concerned in the late disorders fled to spain before his return and there to justify their own conduct and gratify their malice accused him of neglecting the colony and of having deceived their majestys and the adventurers with false hopes of gold from a country which produced very little either of that or any thing else that was valuable these complaints were not without effect and an officer fitter by his character for a spy and informer than a redresser of grievances was sent to inspect into his conduct in which manner of proceeding there was certainly a policy as erroneous as it was unjust and ungrateful at that distance from the fountain of authority with an enemy at the door and a mutinous household a commander ought always to be trusted or removed this man behaved in a brutish and insolent manner like all such persons who unconscious of any merit of their own are puffed up with any little portion of delegated power columbus found that he staid here to no purpose under such disgraceful terms and that his presence at court was absolutely necessary to his support he determined to return once more to spain convinced that a long absence is mortal to ones interest at court and that importunity and attendance often plead better than the most solid services however before he departed he exerted the little remains of authority he had left to settle every thing in such a manner as to prevent those disorders which hitherto he had always found the certain consequence of his absence he built forts in all the material parts of the island to retain the inhabitants in their subjection he established the civil government upon a better footing and redoubled his diligence for the discovery of mines which were to be the great agents in his affairs nor did he altogether fail of success  it was the fate of this great man to have his virtue continually exercised with troubles and distresses he continued his course to spain in the latitude of    not having at that time discovered the advantageous method of running into the northern latitudes to meet the southwest winds they therefore made very little way a scarcity ensued in which they were reduced to six ounces of provision a day for each person on these occasions the admiral fared no better than the common sailor yet in this distress his hunger did not get the better of the tenderness and humanity which distinguished his character he refused to listen to the pressing instances of his crew who were very earnest in this distress to have the indian prisoners thrown overboard to lessen the consumption of provisions in this voyage his skill was as remarkable as his magnanimity he had nine experienced pilots in his fleet yet not one of them could tell where they were after having been a full month from the sight of the last land this length of time persuaded them they must be very near europe and they were therefore for crowding sail to make land as soon as possible but columbus upon sure observations maintained they were but a little to the westward of the azores and therefore ordered his sails to be slackened for fear of land his prediction was fulfilled and the azores relieved them next morning this added to a series of predictions and noble discoveries made his skill seem something prophetic and to exalt his character in this respect above all the seamen before his time and considering his opportunities of improvement and what he did himself to improve his art he will perhaps appear inferior to none who have been since  all the accusations and prejudices against the admiral vanished almost as soon as he appeared he brought such testimonies of his fidelity and good behavior as silenced all calumnies which arose on that head and the large specimens of gold and pearl he produced refuted all that was said on the poverty of the indies the court was fully convinced of the importance of the new colony the merit of its governor and the necessity of a speedy supply but the admirals enemies were not idle though they were silenced they continued to throw all manner of obstructions in his way which was not difficult in a country where every thing is executed with much phlegm and languor and where those forms and mechanical methods of business necessary perhaps in the common course of affairs but ruinous in great designs are more exactly observed even than any where else it was therefore with great difficulty that he was able to procure any relief to be sent to hispaniola but with much greater and after a thousand delays and disappointments that he was himself enabled to set out on a discovery of more importance than any of the former  he designed to stand to the southward from the canaries until he should come under the equinoctial line and then to proceed directly westward until hispaniola should bear to the northwest from him to try what opening that might afford to india or what new islands or continent might reward his trouble he therefore stood away to the cape de verd island and then southwest in this navigation a thick fog which intercepted the light of the sun and stars envelloped them for several days and when this cleared off the heats were grown so excessive that the men could not venture between decks the sun being at this time nearly vertical the heavy rains which fall at this season between the tropicks without abating the heat added much to their distress at last a smart gale sprang up and they went before it seventeen days to the westward the admiral who could have no second to supply his place scarce allowed himself a moments sleep but in this as in all his voyages had the whole burden of every thing upon himself this threw him now into a fit of the gout but neither the fatigue nor the disorder could remove him from the deck or make him abate of his usual vigilance his provisions however being damaged by the heat the wine casks many of them burst and the wine being soured in those that held obliged him to alter the course he intended to keep southward and to decline some points to the northwest happening to fall in with some of the caribbees where he intended to refit and take in provisions to enable him to continue his discoveries but he had not sailed long when from the roundtop a seaman saw land which was an island on the coast of guiana now called trinidad having passed this island and two others which lie in the mouth of the great river oronoquo he was surprised and endangered by a phenomenon he had never seen before the river oronoquo at all times very great at this time augmented tenfold by the rains we have just mentioned rushing into the ocean with an immense and rapid flood meets the tides which rise here to a great height and come in with much strength and both being pent up between the islands and reverberated from one to another caused a conflict extremely terrifying to those who have not been accustomed to it and ignorant of the cause as columbus was at this time but sailing further he found plainly that he was in fresh water and judging rightly that it was probable no island could supply so vast a river he began to suspect he had discovered the continent but when he left the river and found that the land continued on to the westward for a great way he was convinced of it satisfied in some measure with this discovery he yielded to the uneasiness and distresses of his crew and bore away for hispaniola favored by a fair wind and those currents which set strongly to the westward all along the northern coast of south america  in the course of this discovery the admiral landed in several places and traded with the inhabitants amongst whom he found gold and pearl in tolerable plenty contrary to the custom of many navigators who behave wherever they go as if they never intended to come there again he every where used the natives with great civility and gave them what they judged the full value of their commodities little bells bits of glass and of tin with some trifling apparel being exchanged for golddust and pearls and much to the satisfaction of both parties who thought they had each overreached the other and indeed with equal reason  chap v he arrived at hispaniola the   th of august      quite worn down with sickness and continual watching the necessity of which was rather increased than diminished as he came nearer home amongst such a multitude of islands and shoals as filled those seas at this time little known besides this a current which setting strongly westward toward the continent threatened every moment without the greatest attention to carry him out of his course so wasted was he with the fatigue that his brother whom he had left in his place scarce knew him at his return but he found that he was likely to have as little repose upon land as at sea  the admirals authority had suffered some diminution from the illjudged step of sending a check upon his motions before he left hispaniola and the encouragement this gave to all sorts of murmurings and complaints against government laid the seeds of a rebellion which sprung up in the colony soon after he left it but this rebellion was more dangerously formed than either of the former for in the first place the rebels had regularly appointed themselves a chief called francis roldan a man whom the admiral had left in a considerable post this gave it an uniformity and credit and secondly they gained the indians to their party by pretending to be their patrons and assertors of their liberty then to establish themselves the more securely they made a secession from the uncorrupted part of the colony and settled in another part of the island which formed an asylum for all idle and seditious persons by whom they were reinforced daily  in this threatening state of things the admiral having found his forces in no condition to act offensively against the rebels did what he could to break their force and dissolve that union which made them formidable he began by publishing a free pardon for all that chose to conceal their crimes by a timely submission observing besides that many were very desirous of returning to spain he gave them to understand they might go with the ships which brought the last succors he did not intend to perform this latter part immediately but he knew that his offers would stagger some and that in affairs of this nature it is every thing to gain time he wrote to court a full account of his late discoveries and sent samples of the wealth they yielded and took the same opportunity of describing the distracted state of the colony desiring that  0 or  0 men might be sent by every ship which he would replace by as many of the rebels lest the spanish power should be weakened in those parts by diminishing their men or kept in as dangerous a state by harboring such as were ill disposed to the public good he added very judiciously to this request that some religious men and able lawyers might be sent him as the most effectual methods of introducing and preserving obedience and order he then entered into negociations with the chiefs of the rebels he granted them all they demanded and even invidiously placed their principal commander roldan in such an office as flattered his pride though without augmenting his power thus things were brought into something of regularity and without any struggling or violence and roldan himself though in his former office of chief judge of the island contributed most of all toward bringing those who stood out to obedience there arose a difference between them and on their first motion roldan by virtue of his authority condemned and executed several by this the rest were awed all connection broke off irretrievably between the head and body of the rebels and all done without having any part of the offense that might be given by this severity charged to the admiral  he now began just to breathe in a little tranquillity acquired by the severest labors whilst a new storm was gathering against him from the court of spain his old implacable enemies uniting with some of the rebels who had lately transported themselves into spain renewed the clamor against him they heaped upon him all manner of calumnies they accused him of a design of setting up for himself and as they charged him in hispaniola with cruelty and tyranny to the indians here they reversed the charge and accused him of a popularity amongst that people dangerous to his and to their allegiance they added to these what could not fail to work on national prejudices that he was a stranger and had not a proper respect for the spanish nobility they complained that great debts were due to them that all ways of recovering them were shut up in short the king and queen never went abroad without being pursued and persecuted by the clamours of these pretended suitors of justice wearied out with such complaints they sent a judge with power to enquire into the admirals conduct and authorized if he should find the accusations proved to send him into spain and remain himself governor in his room they made it the judges interest to condemn him  this judge who was extremely poor and had no other call but his indigence to undertake the office no sooner landed in hispaniola than he took up his lodging in the admirals house for he was then absent he next proceeded to seize upon all his effects and at last summoned him and his brothers to appear in the mean time he encouraged all manner of accusations without regarding the character of the accusers or the probability or consistency of their accusations in consequence of those he apprehended the admiral and his brothers and with the last marks of insult and indignity loaded them with irons and embarked them to be transported prisoners into spain  the captain of the vessel touched with respect for the years and great merit of columbus offered to take off the irons but he did not permit it since the king has commanded that i should obey his governor he shall find me as obedient to this as i have been to all his other orders nothing but his commands shall release me if twelve years hardship and fatigue if continual dangers and frequent famine if the ocean first opened and five times passed and repassed to add a new world abounding with wealth to the spanish monarchy and if an infirm and premature old age brought on by those services deserve these chains as a reward it is very fit i should wear them to spain and keep them by me as memorials to the end of my life  great minds though more apt to forgive injuries perhaps than common souls do not easily lose the memory of the wrongs that are done them columbus afterward carried these irons with him wherever he went they hung constantly in his chamber and he ordered them to be buried with him  the new governor that succeeded him made a more effectual provision for the reward of his services for besides confiscating the greatest part of the admirals effects which he converted to his own use to flatter the people he permitted an unbounded liberty by which he ruined the royal revenue and was near ruining the colony too past all reparation if the court had not recalled him in time and sent a person to succeed him  greater judgment and firmness though of little more real virtue  chap vi about this time the spirit of discovery began to spread it self largely and private adventurers both in spain and portugal stimulated by the gold which from time to time was remitted to europe by columbus made equipments at their own expenses in one of these the famous americus vesputius commanded he had got into his hands the charts of columbus in his last voyage and he sailed the same course but as he was a man of address and great confidence and was besides an able seaman and good geographer he found a way of arrogating to himself the first discovery of the continent of america and called it by his own name which it has ever since retained though nobody has any doubt concerning the real discoverer for this i believe no other reason can be given than that america is perhaps a better sounding word than columbia and is more easily pronounced with the others in enumerating the several divisions of the earth a trifling matter and influenced by trifling causes but the glory of columbus stands upon foundations of another sort  pinzon one who attended the admiral in his first voyage equipped a squadron at his own expense and was the first who crossed the line at the side of america and entered the great river maranon or the river of amazons  the portuguese notwithstanding the popes exclusive grant turned their thoughts to america and discovered the brazils which make the most valuable part of their present possessions when they have lost what was considered as their original right and which never was so advantageous to them  what animated these adventurers at the same time that it fixes a stain upon all their characters and designs is that insatiable thirst of gold which ever appeared uppermost in all their actions this disposition had been a thousand times extremely prejudicial to their affairs it was particularly the cause of all the confusion and rebellions in hispaniola yet it is certain that if it were not for this incentive which kindled the spirit of discovery and colonization first in spain and portugal and afterward in all parts of europe america had never been in the state it now is nor would those nations ever have had the beneficial colonies which are now established in every part of that country it was necessary there should be something of an immediate and uncommon gain fitted to strike the imaginations of men forcibly to tempt them to such hazardous designs a remote prospect of commerce and the improvement of manufactures by extending of colonies would never have answered the purpose those advantages come to be known only by reason and deduction and are not consequently of so striking a nature but to go out with a few baubles and to return with a cargo of gold is an object readily comprehended by any body and was consequently pursued with vigor by all the speculative knowledge of trade made no part of the study of the elevated or thinking part of mankind at that time now it may be justly reckoned amongst the liberal sciences and it makes one of the most considerable branches of political knowledge commerce was then in the hands of a few great in it is profits but confined in it is nature what we call the balance of trade was far from being well understood all the laws relative to commerce were every where but so many clogs upon it the imposts and duties charged on goods were laid on without distinction or judgment even amongst ourselves the most trading and reasoning people in europe right notions of these matters began late and advanced slowly our colonies were settled without any view to those great advantages which we draw from them virginia was constructed out of the wrecks of an armament destined on a golden adventure which first tempted us to america and those who settled new england and maryland meant them only as asylums from religious persecutions so that if america had not promised such an inundation of treasure it could only have supplied a languid commerce which would have habituated the natives by degrees to our european manners and supplied them with equal arms then it would have been next to impossible to have made those extensive settlements in that new world so certain it is that we often reap differently from what we have sown and that there must be some strong active principle to give life and energy to all designs or they will languish let them be ever so wisely concerted  chap vii no sooner was columbus arrived in spain in this disgraceful manner than the court disavowed and highly blamed the behavior of their governor and now according to the giddy custom of men who act without plan or principle they acquainted him of all the charges against him with as little enquiry into their validity as they before used when upon the same charges they unjustly condemned him restitution and reward were promised him and he wanted very few incentives to engage once more in discoveries his ambition was to arrive at the east indies and so to surround the globe this had really an influence upon his own mind and he knew nothing could so much influence those of the king and queen on this prospect he was again fitted out with a fleet promising to reduce both east and west indies under the dominion of their catholic majestys  he embarked upon his fourth voyage in may   0  his design was to stand directly for the coast of southamerica and keep along the northern shore until he came to the place where he heard an obscure account of some narrow straight whether a straight or isthmus was not so clear from the accounts he had and by this if a straight he hoped to pass into the great south sea after so very long a voyage as his had been to america and the discovery of a continent which was not that of india nor that of china he saw clearly that the maps were no longer in the least to be relied on he therefore depended solely upon his own ideas he reviewed the bearings of all the countries which his former experience or his late discoveries had opened to him he considered the figure of the earth in general he reasoned upon the balance and distribution of the land and water and comparing all these he concluded that beyond the continent he had discovered was another ocean probably as great or greater than that he had formerly passed if this were so then it was probable too that these oceans had some communication he judged it to be near those places since called veragua and nombre de dios but not thinking his ships so fit for that voyage he proposed to put into hispaniola to change there and make some new dispositions before he came into the harbor he judged it necessary to give the new governor obando notice of his arrival and the reasons which determined him to put in here columbus whilst he navigated and resided in the west indies was extremely diligent in his observations upon the nature of the air the seasons the meteors rains and winds and how each of these seemed to affect the others nor was he less sagacious in drawing prognostics from the remarkable appearances in all of these and now he judged from observations that a great hurricane was approaching and this was an additional motive to him to desire to come into harbor he heard too that a considerable fleet was on the point of setting sail for europe therefore he desired that the departure of this fleet might be deferred for some days but it was his destiny that ingratitude should pursue him every where and persecute him in every shape for the governor without any cause not only refused to hearken to his advice about the sailing of the ships but absolutely denied him permission to enter into harbor to save his life in that island which he himself had discovered and subdued he had nothing to do but to draw up as close to the shore as he could the storm came on the next night but providence favoring his innocence and assisting his capacity brought him safe through it though as terrible a storm as had ever happened in those seas the fleet of twenty sail which against his advice had put to sea suffered the punishment due to their termerity only four escaped the storm sixteen perished amongst those which were lost was the ship which carried back that governor to spain who had sent columbus thither in so oppressive and scandalous a manner amongst the four that were saved was one that had on board some treasure all that could be rescued from the pillage of the admirals fortune so that whilst he was mortified at this shameful instance of human ingratitude heaven seemed to declare in his favor and to condemn and punish it his character was highly raised by the prediction of the storm and by his behavior in it for to his and his brothers good conduct the safety of his little fleet was justly attributed his brother was a navigator and philosopher second only to the admiral very useful to his affairs and a comfort and assistance in all his misfortunes by his capacity and the goodness of his heart  after he had weathered the storm he left this island in which he had so surprising an instance of ingratitude in pursuit of more matters to employ it in this voyage he discovered all the coast of terra firma to the isthmus of darien where he hoped to have found a passage to the south sea in this he was disappointed but he was not disappointed in the other part of his project for every where as he advanced he became more sensible of the value of his discoveries on the continent he found a people more civilized and more abounding in gold than the islanders he had met with had been he entered a harbor which from it is excellence he called porto bello well known since as one of the greatest openings by which the spanish commerce is carried on between the two worlds here the admiral desined to establish a colony under the command of his brother proposing to return to europe himself to obtain the requisites for a complete settlement but the avarice and insolence of his men raised the country upon him and obliged him to relinquish his design without having an opportunity of doing any thing more than showing his judgment in the choice of the situation and his own and brothers bravery in extricating their men from the calamities in which their folly had involved them  driven from hence and finding his vessels in so bad a condition that it was by no means advisable to proceed upon further discoveries he quitted the continent after having discovered the eastern side of the isthmus of darien and the whole more as far as gracios o dios in the gulf of honduras he then stood over to hispaniola his voyage was made under a thousand difficulties of the severest kind their vessels so leaky that the crew had not a moments respite from the pump and scarce any provision remaining to refresh them after their labors to complete the sum of their calamities a violent storm arose in which the ships fell foul of one another but though he providentially weathered this storm it was now scarcely possible to keep his ship above water and he was glad to make jamaica where he was a second time relieved from the greatest dangers and distresses  but a distress of almost as bad a nature exercised his invention here his ships were absolutely unfit for service beyond all possibility of being repaired no means of getting new the inhabitants suspicious and the ill behavior of his men gave daily occasion to increase those suspicions in this distress he prevailed upon some of the hardiest and most faithful of them to pass over in a canoo to hispaniola to represent his calamitous situation to the governor and to beg vessels to carry them off  eight months did the admiral remain in this island without the least intelligence from his messengers or assistance from the governor the natives grew exasperated at the delay of the spaniards and the weight of subsisting them which was a heavy burden on the poverty of the indians provisions therefore came in very sparingly things even threatened to grow much worse for the seamen who are at best unruly but think that all discipline ceases the moment they set foot on land mutinied in great numbers by this mutiny the admirals authority and strength was considerably weakened whilst the natives were exasperated by the disorders of the mutineers but he found means to recover his authority at least among the indians knowing there would shortly be a visible eclipse of the moon he summoned the principal persons in the island and by one who understood their language told them that the god whom he served and who created and preserves all things in heaven and earth provoked at their refusing to support his servants intended a speedy and severe judgment upon them of which they should shortly see manifest tokens in the heavens for that the moon would on the night he marked appear of a bloody hue an emblem of the destruction that was preparing for them his prediction which was ridiculed for the time when it came to be accomplished struck the barbarians with great terror they brought him plenty of provisions they fell at his feet and besought him in the most supplicating style to deprecate the evils which threatened them he took their provisions comforted them and charged them to atone for their past sin by their future generosity  he had a temporary relief by this stratagem but he saw no prospect of getting out of the island and pursuing those great purposes to which he had devoted his life the mutiny of his men was in danger of growing general when every thing seemed to be settled by the sight of a ship in the harbor sent by obando the governor of hispaniola but as if it was calculated not only to abandon but to insult this great man in his misfortunes the captain of the vessel was a mortal enemy to the admiral and one of the persons principally concerned in those rebellions which had formerly given him so much trouble but his design was only to be a witness of the distress of his affairs for he came ashore forbidding his crew all manner of communication with the admiral or his men and after delivering to columbus an empty letter of compliment embarked without even flattering him with the least hope of relief  thus abandoned his firmness and presence of mind alone did not forsake him the arrival of this ship for a moment reconciled his men to obedience but when they saw it depart they were almost unanimously on the point of shaking off all authority and abandoning themselves to the most desperate courses but the admiral without betraying the least sign of disappointment or grief told them in a cheerful manner that he had a promise of an immediate supply and that the reason of his not going off in this ship was that she was too small to carry off all the spaniards who were with him and that he was resolved not to depart until every man of them might enjoy the same convenience the easy and composed air of the admiral himself and the care he manifested for his people superior to his own preservation reconciled their minds and made them attend their fate with patience but he knew his delay might be very tedious in this island and that as long as there remained a receptacle to which every ill humor amongst his men might gather his affairs would grow worse every day now that he found those that adhered to him firmly attached to his cause he came to a resolution of taking vigorous measures with the rest he sent his brother a sensible and resolute man with a proper force and well armed to treat with them and in case of obstinacy to compel them to obedience they met and the captain of the mutineers grown insolent with a long course of licentiousness and rapine not only rejected the proposal but offered violence to the admirals brother who using this as a signal to his men who were prepared they fell upon the rebels with such resolution that ten lay dead in a moment with their chief disordered by the unexpected attack the rest fled and soon after were obliged to submit  thus the admiral pacified every thing with equal spirit and address sometimes giving way to the storm and temporizing when he doubted his strength but when he was assured of it always employing it with resolution and effect turning every incident even the most unfavourable to his advantage and watching every change of nature and every motion of the human mind to employ them in his purposes it is the principal thing which forms the character of a great man to be rich in expedients the use columbus made of the eclipse was truly ingenious it may be said that such a thing cannot be imitated amongst a civilized people i grant it but the way to imitate great men is not to tread in their steps but to walk in their manner there is no people who have not some points of ignorance weakness or prejudice which a penetrating mind may not discover and use as the most powerful instruments in the execution of his designs such a knowledge as this is the only thing which gives one man a real superiority over another and he who understands the passions of men and can entirely command his own has the principal means of subduing them in his own hands  the admiral might have spent his whole life in this miserable exile if a private man moved with esteem for his merit and compassion to his misfortunes had not fitted out a ship for his relief this brought him to hispaniola the governor who refused to contribute any thing to his coming when he came received him with that overacted complaisance and show of friendship which so often succeeds the greatest insolence in base minds and which they practice with so little shame and remorse to the persons they have before loaded with the greatest injuries the admiral bore this like every thing else and convinced that a dispute with a governor in his own jurisdiction would bring him little advantage and honor he hastened every thing for his departure to spain where he arrived after a voyage in which he was tossed by most terrible storms and sailed seven hundred leagues after he had lost his mainmast  he was now grown old and severely afflicted with the gout the queen his patroness was dead and the king of a close and dissembling disposition and a narrow mind was the only person he had to sooth his misfortunes or pay the reward which was due to his labors but he received neither comfort nor reward the performance of his contract was deferred upon frivolous pretenses and he employed the close of his life as he had done the active part of it in a court solicitation the most grievous of all employments to any man the most hopeless to an old man vanquished at last by years fatigues and disappointments he died with those sentiments of piety which supported him through the misfortunes of his life and added a finishing which nothing else could give to his greatness of mind and all his other virtues  chap viii henceforward in treating of the progress of the spanish discoveries and arms instead of designs laid in science and pursued with a benevolent heart and gentle measures we are but too often to show an enthusiastic avarice urging men forward to every act of cruelty and horror the character of this first discoverer was extremely different from that of all with whom he dealt and from that of most of those who pursued his discoveries and conquests some with a vigor and conduct equal but all with virtues very much inferior in his character hardly is any one of the components of a truly great man wanting for to the ideas of the most penetrating philosopher and a scheme built upon them worthy of a great king he joined a constancy and patience which alone could carry it into execution with the fortune of a private man continual storms at sea continual rebellions of a turbulent people on shore vexations disappointments and cabals at court were his lot all his life and these were the only reward of services which no favors could have rewarded sufficiently his magnanimity was proof against all of these and his genius surmounted all the difficulties they threw in his way except that of his payment the point in which such men ever meet with the worst success and urge with the least ability that surprising art possessed by so few of making every accident an instrument in his designs his nice adjustment of his behavior to his circumstances temporizing or acting vigorously as the occasion required and never letting the occasion itself pass by him the happy talent of concealing and governing his own passions and managing those of others all these conspire to give us the highest idea of his capacity and as for his virtues his disinterested behavior his unmovable fidelity to the ungrateful crown he served the just policy of his dealing with the indians his caution to give them any offense and his tender behavior to them when conquered which merited him the glorious title of their father together with his zeal to have them instructed in the truths of religion raise him to the elevated rank of those few men whom we ought to consider as examples to mankind and ornaments to human nature  i hope it will be forgiven me if i add a remark upon the conduct of the court of spain with regard to this great man though as we saw all along this conduct was equally unjust and impolitick sorry i am that no lesson of instruction can be drawn from the event which was in all respects as fortunate as the measures pursued were ungrateful and imprudent but there was a coincidence of events at that time which does not always happen so opportunely to justify an ungrateful and narrow policy it is certain that some men are so possessed with their designs that when once engaged nothing can discourage them in the pursuit but great and frequent discouragements are examples to others which will at least certainly have an effect and will terrify men from forming such designs at all then the spirit of invention and enterprise dies away then things begin to stagnate and to corrupt for it is a rule as invariable in politics as it is in nature that a want of proper motion does not breed rest and stability but motion of another kind a motion unseen and intestine which does not preserve but destroy the best form and settlement of a state and every regulation within it obeys the same universal law and the only way to prevent all things from going to decay is by continually aiming to better them in some respect or other since if they are not better they will surely be worse and to afford an attentive ear to every project for this purpose i am sensible that it must frequently happen that many of these projects will be chimerical in themselves and offered by a people of an appearance and manner not very prejudicing in their favor but then i am satisfied too that these men must in the nature of things have something odd and singular in their character who expose themselves and desert the common and certain roads of gain in pursuit of advantages not certain to the public and extremely doubtful to themselves  it is equally true that if such people are encouraged a number of visionary schemes will be offered but it is the character of pride and laziness to reject all offers because some are idle as it is of weakness and credulity to listen to all without distinction but surely if judgment is to have any share in our conduct it is the province of judgment to sift to examine to distinguish the useful from the foolish the feasible from the impracticable and even in the midst of the visions of a fruitful and disordered brain to pick out matter which a wise man will know how to qualify and turn to use though the inventor did not cromwell partly from his circumstances but more from his genius and disposition received daily a number of proposals of this kind which always approached him in a fanatical dress and were mixed frequently with matters the most remote from probability and good sense and we know that he made a signal use of many things of this kind  colbert spent much of his time in hearing every scheme for the extending of commerce the improvement of manufactures and the advancement of arts spared no pains or expense to put them in execution and bountifully rewarded and encouraged the authors of them by these means france advanced during the reign of lewis the fourteenth and under this minister more than it had done in many reigns before and by these means in the midst of wars which brought that kingdom and all europe to the brink of destruction amidst many defaults in the royal character and many errors in his government a seed of industry and enterprise was sown which on the first respite of the public calamities and even whilst they oppressed that nation rose to produce that flourishing internal and external commerce and power that distinguishes france and forms it is strength at this day though a less active reign and ministers of a different character have succeeded on the contrary it was always the character of the court of spain to proceed very slowly if at all in any improvement and to receive schemes for that purpose with coldness and disdain the effects upon the power of that monarchy were answerable with regard to america the conquest as well as the discovery was owing wholly to private men the court contributed nothing but pretensions and patents  chap ix an ancient painter drew a satirical picture of cimon the athenian he represented this commander asleep and fortune drawing a net over cities to put them into his possession there never were princes to whom this representation could be applied with more justice than to king ferdinand and his successor the emperor charles without forming any plan in the cabinet without issuing a penny out of their treasury without sending a regiment from their troops private adventurers amongst their subjects put them into possession of a greater and a more wealthy territory than ever the most celebrated conquerors had acquired by their valor or their wisdom nor was this conquest more extraordinary for the trivial means by which it was accomplished than for the shortnefs of the time in which it was effected for from the departure of columbus which was in the year      to the entire reduction of chili which was in      seven great kingdoms inhabited by a vast number of warlike and wealthy nations were made to bow under the spanish yoke for after the discoveries of columbus had enlarged the sphere of industry to active minds such a spirit of enterprise went abroad that not only those persons whose indigence might have driven them from their native country but persons of the first rank went over to settle in america gold was the spur to all those adventurers of whatever rank and this with a romantic spirit of chivalry made the greatest hazards appear but common matters in their eyes and indeed in a country wholly uncivilized under the burning zone and in many places extremely unhealthy the temperance of the spaniards their hardiness under fatigue and the patience and perseverance which make the most shining part of their character enabled them to engage in enterprises and to surmount difficulties to which any other people had certainly been unequal  vasco nunez de balboa was a man of a graceful presence a liberal education an hardy constitution and had that kind of popular bravery which recommends a man who engages in desperate expeditions where he must have more authority from his person than his place this man first surrounded cuba conquered and left it he did not there find the treasures which he expected he therefore relinquished the gleanings of this field to those who had a more moderate ambition and a more saving industry he sought new ground he followed the tracks of columbus to darien gained the friendship of some of the caziques and conquered others he was the first who discovered the south sea and being as ready to discern the advantages of a country as to discover the country itself he established a colony upon that coast and built the city of panama but according to the fate of all the first adventurers in this new world indeed according to the fate of most who engage in new undertakings he never lived to reap the fruit of his labors he found himself suspended by one who had only discernment enough of his merit to raise his jealousy and envy and who could make no other use of the discoveries of this great man than to increase his own private fortune this man was a politician and a courtier and having in several instances basely injured balboa he was too wise to stop there but under a pretended form of justice cut off his head and confiscated his estate  some time after the settlement of cuba don james velasquez obtained the government a man of good sense in common affairs but so much mistaken as to imagine he could act a great part by deputy and that too in circumstances wherein a man who had but little capacity could do him but little service and he that could do much would certainly do it for himself the continent of america was now very well known and the fame of the greatness and wealth of the mexican empire spread every where this inspired velasquez with a scheme of reducing some part of this opulent country under his obedience he pitched upon hernando cortes to command in this expedition in which he certainly made a very right judgment there was no man amongst the spaniards who to an adventurous disposition then common to them all knew so well to join a cool and steady conduct to gain love whilst he preserved respect not to shift his schemes according to occasions but persisting uniformly in a welljudged design to make every inferior action and event subservient to it to urge still forward to extricate himself out of difficulties into which he was brought by bold actions not by mean subterfuges but by actions yet bolder this was the character of the man already in high reputation whom velasquez chose to conquer for him  the embarkment was made at st jago de cuba and cortes was to take in some reinforcements at the havanna but he was hardly departed for this purpose when velasquez grew jealous of him and without considering that cortes was of that heroic disposition in which a blind obedience is rarely a principal ingredient he took the illjudged step of removing him from the command of an army which in some sort might be considered as his own since he had much influence on the soldiers and that a considerable part of the expense of the armament had been supplied by himself when this order which was to deprive him of his command arrived to cortes he was not long before he came to a resolution he explained the whole matter to his soldiers he showed them how uncertain the intentions of velasquez were and how much all their hopes were like to be frustrated by the inconstancy of his disposition the event was prepared the soldiers declared to a man that they were subjects only to the king of spain and knew no commander but cortes the army and the general thus bound to one another by their mutual disobedience sailed for mexico  the empire of mexico was at that time governed by a prince called montezuma the eleventh who reigned from the first monarch who had conquered the country the empire was elective and the merit of montezuma had procured him the election a prince of capacity and courage but artful hypocritical and cruel this empire founded on conquest was increased by his victories by himself or by his generals he had absolutely subdued several kingdoms and provinces several were made tributary and others which were not absolutely subdued were influenced by his power to an entire obedience to his will his armies were the best in that part of the world and prodigiously numerous in this situation and so headed was the empire of the mexicans when cortes came to prove it is strength with an army of no more than five hundred foot and not quite sixty horse he did not come a stranger into the country to encounter a force which he dared to engage only because he was ignorant of it he had long made every possible enquiry from the spaniards and indians into every circumstance of its internal weakness or power it is allies it is enemies and the interests which determined them to be allies or enemies weighing all these and knowing that along with great hopes great dangers likewise lay before him he made his retreat yet more dangerous by his disobedience to the governor of cuba and when he landed on the continent he made it impossible for he burned his ships but though he had made a retreat impossible he had something else to encourage him to go forward than the impossibility of retiring he had great hopes that many of these states who were kept in a forced subjection or a slavish dread of montezuma would gladly turn this new and alarming appearance from themselves against him and under the banner of these formidable strangers arm themselves to shake off the ancient tyranny which always appears the worst without foreseeing consequences to which more civilized nations have frequently been as blind as they it happened according to his expectations  the zempoallans a nation tributary to montezuma as soon as they had sufficient proofs of the power of the spaniards at the expense of several of their neighbors who attempted to oppose their progress threw off the mexican yoke gladly put themselves under the protection of cortes and earned it by the large reinforcements which they added to his army montezuma was soon made acquainted with these measures for according to the custom of that wellregulated kingdom he had posts so stationed that in a little time he had notice of whatever happened in the remote parts of his empire the dispatches which were sent him were painted clothes exactly representing every circumstance of the business of which he was to be informed the figures were interspersed with characters to explain what must necessarily be wanting in the picture so far but no farther had this people advanced in the art of writing as well informed as the emperor was of every particular of this invasion and of the defection of his tributaries he acted not at all conformably to the greatness of his former exploits he took the worst method which a great prince ever did upon such an occasion which was to temporize he let the spaniards see by some trifling arts which he used to oppose them that he did not look upon them as his friends and at the same time neglected to act against them as so formidable an enemy required by which means they made daily advances in the country his enemies were encouraged his tributaries made insolent and his subjects and allies utterly dispirited whilst the spaniards in a variety of engagements which they had with the petty princes of the country raised their reputation by a train of victories and began to be considered as invincible cortes like the great commander he was took advantage of this irresolute disposition in montezuma and used every possible means to cherish it he always sent back what prisoners of montezumas subjects his new allies had taken with presents and every profession of esteem and regard to their master and with the strongest assurances of a desire of preserving peace requesting to see montezuma and to confer with him upon some matters he said he had in charge to declare to him from his master the emperor of the romans  there was at that time a celebrated republic on the coast of mexico toward the gulf called tlascala this people were said to be so powerful as to be able to arm four hundred thousand men powerful as they were though not subdued they were yet awed by the greatness of the mexicans this awe or perhaps a better policy induced them to give a check to the spaniards but in the manner of montezumas proceedings they would not oppose them publicly and therefore could not oppose them effectually some nations on whom they had prevailed to fall upon the spaniards were over and over again defeated together with those troops the tlascalans had sent clandestinely to their assistance at last by degrees declaring themselves more openly as the danger pressed them they drew a large army into the field which was routed by the troops of cortes few indeed in number but infinitely superior in arms and now grown familiar with victory the consequence of this battle was the alliance of the tlascalans with their conqueror which they entered into with the less difficulty as they were to serve against the mexicans and might now hope to serve with success cortes however did not choose to trust this untried and forced alliance too far nor at the same time to deprive himself entirely of the succor it produced he therefore took a middle course and accepting three thousand of their men he held on his rout to mexico  chap x before cortes began his expedition to mexico he had built a strong fortress at the principal port on the coast to open a passage for succors when his success should make interest enough to procure them this he called la vera cruz and it has since become a city remarkable for the great traffic since carried on between these opulent countries and old spain during the tlascalan war in which the spaniards suffered something and had every thing to apprehend montezuma took no steps but lay by watching the event in hopes that the tlascalans might defeat the troops of cortes at their own expense or if the spaniards proved victorious he might then have the merit of not having used hostilities against them he lost both parties by this double conduct such an insidious neutrality betrays nothing but the weak policy of him who uses it however as a fair correspondence still subsisted between them he used every means he could to dissuade cortes from his proposed journey to mexico at last he took a step worse judged than all the bad ones he had hitherto taken he sent to the spaniards a very large and magnificent present of every thing his dominions afforded valuable but principally a vast quantity of gold and precious stones offering at the same time yet more and persuading them to return to their own country if any person in the army was unwilling before this to proceed he now changed his mind all were convinced that they ought to advance with speed to possess the fountain of that wealth of which this rich donation was but an inconsiderable rivulet  montezuma baffled in all his schemes to keep the spaniards at a distance having used himself to shifting measures until they were in a degree grown habitual found cortes at the gates of mexico before he was resolved how he should receive him he was now almost too late for force he therefore dissembled his concern with the best grace he could and received him with all the honors a monarch can bestow when he would display his own magnificence and show his sense of extraordinary merit cortes was lodged in a palace spacious and grand after the manner of the country all his spaniards were lodged with him but he took care to place a train of artillery at his gate  thus ported without a blow in the heart of this great city the capital of the new world he was for a while at a loss what measures to pursue for securing himself in a conquest of this importance having received more than he could reasonably have asked there was no cause of complaint and consequently no advantage to be colourably taken he had only to wait for some of those critical incidents upon whose use all great matters depend and without which the greatest genius must be at a stand it was not long before one of these occurred  two tlascalans arrived in disguise at mexico who brought him an account that a general of montezuma had attacked some of his confederate indians that the garrison of vera cruz had gone out to their defense and that though the mexicans were repulsed with loss the spaniards were greatly endangered many wounded and one killed whose head by the order of montezuma was carried through all the cities and villages of their country to destroy the reverence in which they held the spaniards and undeceive them in a notion they had conceived that these strangers were immortal this intelligence alarmed cortes he knew that opinion was one of the strongest supporters of his little force that things of this kind never stop at their beginnings that montezuma while he caressed him in his city was disjoining his allies and distressing his garrison abroad and that no time was to be lost in dilatory counsels and that he must keep alive the memory of his former exploits he therefore took a resolution worthy of a brave man in a difficulty made for his capacity he armed himself in the best manner and with five of the most faithful and best resolved of his officers went directly to the palace of montezuma thirty of his men attended at some distance guards of spaniards were placed at the principal avenues to the palace  it was usual for montezumas guards to withdraw out of respect when he had any conference with cortes on this occasion as soon as he was admitted to audience he charged the emperor with the outrages committed by his orders in terms of great resentment the emperor disowns it but cortes after having paid him the compliment of not supposing him capable of so mean a dissimulation assured him that he was himself entirely satisfied of his innocence but that others had fears which were not so easily removed but to satisfy the spaniards he must give some solid proof of his confidence in them which he could effectually do no otherwise than by his removing without delay to their quarters a request of this nature startled montezuma who never was used to any voice but that of the humblest submission however he saw plainly that cortes did not make so extraordinary a request but with a resolution of making it be complied with he saw the necessity and he yielded to it  thus was the capital of a vast and powerful empire inhabited by an innumerable multitude of warlike people entered without resistance by an handful of men who came to overturn it is liberty and thus was one of the greatest princes on earth renowned for his wisdom and valor seized in his palace in the midst of this city at noonday and carried prisoner without noise or violence by six persons to be disposed of at their pleasure  the people confounded and enraged to find one whom they always used to reverence as a god treated in this unworthy manner surrounded the quarters of the spaniards to punish this sacrilege and rescue their captive prince but cortes who well understood the consequence of the steps he had taken was not alarmed he knew that he had now in his hands an engine which was capable of doing any thing montezuma went out to appease the people assured them that he was there of choice and which was true that the spaniards were wanting in no instance of respect due to his character and dignity  this appeased and dispersed the people but montezuma whose unfortunate circumstances obliged him to act as an instrument to his own captivity could enjoy no rest though allowed the attendance of the principal officers of his court and indulged by the spaniards in every thing but his liberty long revolving he at last contrived a scheme which he judged without his appearing to concur with them might alarm his subjects with a sense of their danger or oblige the spaniards to depart by the reasonableness of his proposals he had always liberty of going abroad with a guard of spaniards under pretense of doing him honor he now desired to hold a council of the states of his empire that in concurrence they might satisfy cortes and his associates in the amplest manner this council was convened in which montezema in a premeditated speech set forth the origin of his nation the prophecies extant among them that a people of the same race should arrive to whom this empire should be subject that the people were now arrived who were the object of those prophecies and sprung from this origin to whom the gods had destined universal empire and who by their great accomplishments and surprising bravery merited their high destination then he solemnly declared himself tributary to the emperor of the romans he exhorted them on their part to a due obedience and ended by telling them that as he had himself prepared a present from his treasures worthy of this great emperor he expected that every one of them in proportion to his ability would testify his loyalty to this new master and his regard to the merit of his general and those brave men that attended him that they might be enabled to depart speedily to their own country with that opinion of their brethren the mexicans which their affection to them and their obedience to their common master deserved  at first an entire silence succeeded this harangue the whole assembly confounded and struck dumb with grief indignation and surprise then followed a mixed cry as each person was affected by some particular part of the general calamity the luster of their empire tarnished their religion to be profaned their freedom surrendered their emperor degraded what was worse degraded by himself could they believe their ears was it montezuma who had spoken in such a manner the design of montezuma was until this moment a secret to cortes he was surprised and something chagrined at an artifice the invention of which he now penetrated very clearly but his surprise did not confound or perplex him in the part he saw it was proper for him to act without any embarrassment he seconded the harangue of montezuma by a speech which was well interpreted wherein he strongly urged the propriety and insinuated the necessity of an entire obedience to their prince and an imitation of his conduct disordered as the assembly was yet still held by a sacred reverence to their emperor influenced by the hope of the sudden departure of the spaniards and reserving themselves for a better occasion they followed montezumas example and paid homage to cortes in that dumb and sullen submission with which fierce spirits yield to necessity he received it and thanked them as a man thanks his debtor for a ready payment  cortes saw that this empty homage secured him nothing but he knew that the gold which was to accompany it would be of real service in cancelling the ill impressions made by his disobedience in spain in mexico he might look upon himself as secure he had the person of the emperor in his hands he had his forces in the capital and he had lately struck a terror into all by seizing the general who had committed hostilities against the spaniards he got the emperor to disavow his conduct and condemn him as a traitor by their joint authority this unhappy man guilty of nothing but obedience to his lawful master and zeal for his country was burned alive in the public square of mexico but neither this horrid example nor the imprisonment of their emperor nor the late acknowledgment of the emperor charles was sufficient to make the mexicans insensible to the disgrace they suffered nor of the danger which hung over them they began to consult how they might deliver themselves some proposed to cut off the communication with the continent and hold the spaniards besieged in their quarters for the city of mexico is an island in a great lake and communicates with the continent by four great causeways extremely curious for contrivance and solidity whilst they were ripening their schemes a report came to cortes that some words had dropped from a mexican concerning the practicability of destroying one of these causeways from this word for he heard no more this watchful and sagacious commander judged of the whole contrivance without however taking notice of it publicly he immediately orders two brigantines to be built to secure his retreat if a retreat should prove the wisest measure in the mean time he kept a strict discipline in his army and to preserve reverence from the indians he prohibited their approaching his quarters when his men were asleep and severely punished those of his soldiers who slept out of the times and places appointed for that purpose all this while no preparations for his departure  chap xi montezuma sick with impatience of his confinement and seeing that he daily lost his authority amongst the people by the pusillanimous appearance of his conduct as soon as he perceived that any spirited action on his side would be seconded with equal spirit by his subjects he roused his dormant magnanimity and in spite of the condition he was in he sent for cortes and addressed him in this manner cortes the desires of my subjects my own dignity and the commands of my gods require that you should depart my empire you are sensible how much i have valued your friendship and how effectually i have shown that i valued it but after so many professions of good will upon your side and so many proofs of it upon mine after every pretense of business is over wherefore do you delay your return i have yielded homage to your master i am ready to obey him i have sent him presents or shall i call it a tribute worthy of myself and of him your whole army is loaded even to an inconvenience with their darling gold would they have more shall more be delivered them but then when they shall have spoken their largest wishes and satisfied their most eager desires i insist upon it that they depart immediately or they may find in spite of the condition i am in of which condition for your sake and for my own i shall speak but little that montezuma has yet courage enough to vindicate his own honor and friends in mexico who will not fail to revenge the wrongs he shall suffer  cortes perceived something of an unusual resolution and sternness in the emperors countenance whilst he spoke he therefore sent orders before the interpreter began to explain his speech that the spaniards should stand to their arms and wait his commands his answer was resolute but not such as to drive the emperor to despair he lamented the jealousy which their common enemies had occasioned that for his part he was secured from all fear by his own courage and the bravery of his troops but since he was so unfortunate as to find he could not longer enjoy the honor of a conversation he had such reason to esteem consistently with the emperors repose he would depart as soon as ships could be built for on landing he had been obliged to burn his own this answer soothed montezuma he resumed his good humor he promised to load his army with gold at his departure and gave immediate orders that every thing should be prepared for fitting out the ships in the speediest and amplest manner but cortes gave orders which were full as well obeyed to the person he appointed for the equipment to delay it upon every possible pretense he expected daily the return of the messengers he had sent into spain to solicit his pardon and succors with the continuance of the command  whilst he was entertained with these expectations and with finding out pretenses to defer his departure an express arrived from sandoval his governor at la vera cruz informing him of the arrival of eighteen ships in which was an army of eight hundred foot and two hundred horse under the command of one narvaez who was sent by his old enemy velasquez the governor of cuba to supersede him in the command to treat him as a rebel and send him in chains to cuba the governor seized the messengers who were sent by narvaez to require him to surrender and sent them prisoners with this account to cortes there never was a time wherein the firmness and capacity of this commander were put so strongly to the proof on one hand here was an army in weapons and courage equal to his own in numbers vastly superior and above all strengthened with the name of the royal authority the mexicans illaffected before would rejoice in this opportunity to fall upon him on the other hand must he resign the conquests he had made with such infinite toils and hazards into the hands of his mortal enemy and in return to bear the name and receive the punishment of a traitor there was little room to hope for an accommodation the thoughts of a surrender were intolerable one way only remained to conquer narvaez his own courage and conduct his soldiers habituated to victory and endeared to him by common dangers and triumphs his reputation and the signal providence which always attended him would combat upon his side above all no time was to be lost in fruitless counsels he sent an express to sandoval his governor in la vera cruz to evacuate that place and join him in his rout with what men he had he assembled his forces and found them to a man attached to his interests and ready to hazard every thing in support of them he left eighty men in mexico picked from his troops recommending them to montezuma and him to them with this small garrison he dared to entrust mexico and all his vast hopes there but the imprisoned emperor was himself a garrison from the reverence his subjects bore him before he set out he released the prisoners which sandoval had sent him using the severity of his officer to display his own clemency he caressed them extremely loaded them with presents for themselves and the principal officers of narvaezs army and did every thing to create himself a party there by his generosity he sent at the same time very advantageous terms of accommodation to the general himself but took care to follow and second his ambassadors with all the power he could raise this with sandovals reinforcement did not amount to three hundred men but with these and some confederate indians he marched with all imaginable diligence to narvaezs quarters  narvaez elated with the superiory of his army would hearken to no terms though he was much pressed to it by his principal officers who discovered plainly that this quarrel could only end in the ruin of their party or that of the spanish interest in mexico mean time cortes little incumbered with baggage and less with a dilatory genius advanced by forced marches he was but a small distance from the enemys quarters when the rains came on and as usual in that country fell very heavily cortes knowing that the ill dispositions of the sky were circumstances favorable to a surprise inviting to desperate enterprises and that they are always least prejudicial to those in motion having perfect intelligence of the disposition of narvaezs army and having disposed his troops in such a manner as not to fall upon one another and to act in concert he ordered them when they should enter the town where the enemy was posted to keep in close to the houses that they might not suffer by the artillery which was so placed as to play upon the middle of the street having made this disposition he marched to attack the camp on one of those gloomy and tempestuous nights though he directed every thing with the utmost secrecy narvaez had intelligence of his approach but he laughed at it and not understanding the nature of a prudent rashness could not believe that cortes would make such an attempt in such a season went to sleep without taking sufficient care that it should not be disturbed security in the general is easily followed by that of every one else cortes assaulted the town in three bodies and whilst every one in the adverse party ran in confusion to his arms and opposed without command or uniformity as each man was attacked the whole army was routed the quarters of narvaez were attacked by cortess division and the men routed there as elsewhere narvaez himself shamefully taken in bed fell into his hands value yourself said he my lord cortes on your fortune in making me your prisoner but cortes with a smile of indignation answered that he thought this by far the least action he had performed since he came into the new world  when the morning came on the dispersed army of narvaez began to form into bodies and to discover the inconsiderable force which the night before had defeated them their first motion distracted with shame and anger was to fall upon the conquerors and recover the honor they had lost but when they found that their general was a prisoner their artillery seized and the advantageous post they had occupied in the enemys possession and numbers amongst themselves wellaffected to cortes they listened at last to his proposals recommended as they were by the polite and insinuating behavior of which he was master and that open and unbounded generosity he showed to every one they all enlisted under his banner and agreed to share his fortune thus did this accident which seemed to threaten inevitable destruction to the affairs of cortes prove the most effectual method of restoring them to an excellent condition wholly by means of the wisdom of his measures and of that vigor and activity with which he pursued them his army now consisted of above a thousand men after replacing his garrison at la vera cruz in which fortress he left narvaez a prisoner  this victory and the reinforcement it procured came at a most critical time for hardly had he begun to adjust matters for his return to mexico when an express arrived that his affairs there were in a most dangerous condition alvarado whom he had left to command at his departure though a brave and able man had too great a contempt for the indians and too little discernment for the nice circumstances he was in to manage with that just mixture of firmness and yielding by which cortes had hitherto so balanced the hopes and fears of the mexicans that he never gave them an entire opportunity of knowing their own strength this man either discovering or pretending at least to discover that some of the chief men in the city who were met in the great temple were assembled to consult how to expel the spaniards suddenly surrounded the place and murdered all the persons of rank who were met in the temple this cruel and precipitate action at once raifed the whole people enraged at what they had already suffered and what they saw plainly they were yet to expect from the tyranny of these intruders their own ignominous patience the fear of the spanish arms their inbred respect for montezuma were all lost in their fury should they stay until on various pretenses they were all butchered montezuma either forgetful of his office and dignity or unable to exert it could protect them no longer gods and men allowed them to defend themselves and arms were in their hands the flame so furious in the capital spread itself with equal swiftness and rage over all the country and all were vowed and hearty for the destruction of the spaniards in this extremity alvarado showed as much bravery as he had done imprudence in bringing it on he redoubled his watch on the emperor he obliged him to exert the remains of his authority in his favor and fortifying his quarters in the best manner the time would admit he stood out the storm and repulsed the mexicans in several attacks but their fury far from relenting at the frequent and bloody repulses they met redoubled by their losses they exercised the besieged day and night with the most vigorous assaults at the beginning to cut off their retreat and burned the brigantines which cortes had built  cortes who was obliged to make so rapid a march from mexico to defend himself against narvaez was compelled by an equal necessity to march from zempoallo to mexico to relieve his forces and preserve his most essential interests there the mexicans like all people who have not reduced the art of war to some rule suffered their eagerness in pursuing one advantage to let other material ones lie neglected for whilst they pushed on the siege of the spanish quarters with great vigor and diligence they took no effectual care of the avenues to the city or to cut off all succors from the besieged cortes entered the city without resistance he soon routed those who invested the post of the spaniards and brought them a relief of which they stood in the greatest need this arrival of so formidable a body of troops held the mexicans some time in suspense but in spite of the fatal error of admitting them into their city which had now inexcusably been a second time committed and in spite of the success every where attending the spanish arms they came to a resolution of continuing hostilities but things wore another face since the arrival of cortes no longer satisfied with defending his quarters he sallied out and defeated them several times with great slaughter however as he found that he suffered more by the least losses than the mexicans by the greatest he kept close for some time suffering the enemy to approach in hopes of making one last effort to appease them by the authority of montezuma this unhappy prince reduced to the sad necessity of becoming the instrument of his own disgrace and of the slavery of his people appeared on the battlements and addressed his subjects with every argument he could use to prevail with them to disperse but this expedient was not attended with the usual success the mexicans by an habit of living without rule had many of them lost much of that respect which even to adoration every one of them used to pay their prince they answered him with reproaches and a stone from an uncertain hand struck montezuma with great violence in the temple the spaniards carried him to his apartment here he refused to suffer any dressings to be applied to his wound but wrapping his head in his garment gave himself up a prey to shame and grief and in a few days died less of his wound which was but inconsiderable than of sorrow and indignation on feeling that he had so far lost the esteem and love of his subjects there are other accounts of the death of montezuma but this appears the most probable  thus died this great prince more remarkable for the great virtues by which he ascended the throne and those qualities by which he held it in so much luster for many years than for his steadiness and wisdom in defending it when attacked by a formidable enemy it has happened thus to many great men when lucullus and pompey attacked tigranes king of armenia we do not see any thing in him of the conqueror of so many kings even his conqueror pompey was not himself after having enjoyed in glory for a long time a power acquired by the greatest exploits se esse magnum oblitus est it is natural whilst we are raising ourselves and contending against difficulties to have our minds as it were strung and our faculties intent and constantly awake the necessity of our affairs obliges us to a continual exercise of whatever talents we possess and we have hope to animate and urge us onward but when we are come to the summit of our desires the mind suffers itself to relax it is grievous to contend anew for things of which we have long looked upon ourselves as secure when we have no longer any thing to hope we have then every thing to fear thus enervated by this prosperity and discomposed with this fear we become stiff and irresolute to action we are willing to use any temporizing measures rather than hazard on any adventure so much power and reputation if montezuma had made an early use of his strength he had strength enough after many losses to have kept cortes far enough from his capital but having once entered upon shifting and dilatory courses this brave and active enemy gave his affairs a mortal blow by seizing upon his capital and by this means some time after by seizing upon his person too the rest was all a consequence which no prudence could prevent of a plan of conduct imprudent and ill laid originally  chap xii as soon as the mexicans were apprized of the death of their emperor they set about the election of a successor they immediately cast their eyes upon guatimozin nephew and soninlaw of montezuma a man fit to command at such a time of a person graceful a body strong and robust and of a soul full of the most undaunted courage though no more than twentyfour years old the reputation of his early exploits procured him the authority of age and a penetrating genius served him for experience he was no sooner called to this unsteady throne than he took measures to prevent the mexicans from their disorderly and casual attacks and to make them act with design and uniformity he examined thoroughly into the cause of their former miscarriages and considering every thing he found that the indians in their present condition could never hope for any success in open fight he resolved therefore to spare his men as much as possible until his own invention and time might teach them better methods of fighting on these ideas he caused all assaults to cease then he cut off the causeways which joined the city to the continent and at the same time strongly barricaded the streets resolving to starve an enemy which seemed unconquerable by any other means a measure which though it has with us no extraordinary appearance showed no small sagacity in guatimozin because it was what had never been before practiced amongst the military stratagems of this people and invention is the characteristic of genius  from henceforward the whole method of the war was changed the spaniards grew every day more and more streightened for provisions and whenever they sallied out though they slew great numbers of their opponents the many canals of the city and barricado behind barricado after some successful progress obliged them vanquished by mere weariness to return without effect to their quarters the spaniards invincible by the indian arms were not proof against famine cortes saw that nothing was left for his security but as speedy a retreat as possible and though this must necessarily lose them the most considerable part of the treasure they had amassed it was what least afflicted him he encouraged his troops by cheerfully relinquishing his own part not to attempt burthening themselves with a treasure which they might consider as lying at an advantageous interest until they should as they certainly would be enabled to return with a sufficient force to reclaim it the resolution of retreating being now taken and all things disposed for it a question arose whether it were better made by day or in the night on this the council of war was divided and their reasons seeming pretty equal a person amongst them a sort of astrologer who passed for a prophet and as such was much respected by the greater part of the army promised them certain success if they retreated by night certain it is that when measures are dubious superstitious determinations have great use for as reason cannot easily determine the right way that method which superstition fixes upon is by the weight it has from thence pursued with the greater cheerfulness and effect  the general was guided by the prophet and he disposed every thing for his retreat with great judgment he caused the usual fires to be lighted in every part of his quarters some of his boldest and most active men led the van the prisoners artillery and heavy baggage were in the center he himself with one hundred of his choicest troops formed the rear with wonderful order and silence and without any interruption did the spaniards march until they came to the first breach in the causeway here a portable woodenbridge which cortes had prepared was laid over but when the artillery and horses had passed it was wedged so closely into the stones that bordered the causeway that it could not be removed and there was yet another breach but they were soon called from attending to this by a more pressing danger for as nothing could elude the vigilance of the new emperor he found out their intention of retreating and disposed all along the sides of the causeway an infinite multitude of canoes with orders to preserve the greatest silence and not to attempt any thing until a signal was given the darkness of the night favored the scheme and now perceiving that the spaniards were under some embarrassment they took this advantage and all at once with great order poured in their arrows raising at the same time a most tremendous shout swelled with the barbarous sound of all their martial instruments of music the spaniards were not wanting to themselves but behaved with signal bravery it were needless and almost impossible to relate all the destruction of that horrid night the indians at first attacked in good order but the first ranks being repulsed and the distant canoes pressing on to action the whole attack was thrown into confusion the indians drowned or slaughtered one another however they still pressed on with untameable fury thousands impatient of the delay their remote situation caused them leapt from their canoes and climbing up the causeway in front where it was interrupted broke in upon the spaniards in this quarter with a torrent hardly resistible in vain this naked multitude was hacked to pieces by the spanish swords in vain were they tumbled upon one another by hundreds into the lake new warriors succeeded those that were killed and the spaniards actually wearied out were in danger of being wholly cut off when making one vigorous effort in the front they happily cleared that post and by a beam which they casually met they passed over one by one or as some say filling the intervals with the dead bodies of their enemies they gained the main land cortes came over with the first for in the confusion of the night their former order was in a good measure lost and took care as fast as his men got over to form them to secure the passage for the rest then returning to those who were behind by his presence and example he animated them to renew the fight and drawing up a part of his men on both sides of the causeway he ordered the rest to file off from the center in this manner the first light saw the spaniards clear out of the city cortes halted at a small distance that those whom the confusion and the night had dispersed might have an opportunity of rejoining the rest of the army  happily they were not pursued for as soon as the dawning light unveiled the field of battle to the mexicans the possession of which they bought by such a profusion of their own blood they perceived among the slain two sons of montezuma who were with the prisoners and pierced through by the arrows of the mexicans in the promiscuous and undistinguished carnage of the preceding night for some time they were confounded and struck dumb with horror at this sight their sentiments of loyalty returned their monarch almost their god lately profaned by their own violence now their hands imbrued in the blood of his children a general deadness and consternation ensued they must not add to their impiety by neglecting the obsequies due to the deceased in the mean time the spaniard pursued their retreat without molestation bu this breathing lasted but a short time all the allies of the mexicans already in arms an divided into several flying parties hung over the army of cortes and harrassed it without intermission they attacked him in front in rear in flank by open force by ambuscade by surprise provision grew extremely scarce on his march and now it was that cortes showed a firmness under his losses a vigilance against incessant attacks so various in time and manner and a courage which enabled him to repulse them which have been exceeded by nothing in history  the principal army of the mexicans whilst he contended with such difficulties from the flying parties took another rout and pouring in three columns into a plain where their number should be of most avail they covered the whole of an extended valley which lay directly in his road to tlascala and this was called the valley of otumba they concealed their purposes with all imaginable care to blind the spaniards they ordered several villages to give them a friendly reception but cortes did not suffer this to relax his vigilance not allowing himself to be deceived by any appearances of friendship shown by men whose interest it was not to be his friends convinced as he was that a surprise of all things was indeed very destructive to the affairs of a general but that it was mortal to his reputation he drew indications of their sentiments toward him from the manners the gestures and the countenances of those he treated with in his march and perceiving that many showed unusual signs of content and exultation he judged not without reason that it could not be favorable to him he therefore disposed every thing in such a manner as that his troops were neither disordered nor his courage abated when from an eminence they discovered the extended plains of otumba darkened as far as the eye could reach with the myriads of their enemies the spaniards animated by their superiority in arms and their former victories and the tlascalans by the presence of such allies and their hatred of the mexican name behaved with great bravery and success neither were the mexicans inferior in animosity and courage but it was cortes himself who determined the fortune of the day nothing he ever heard was either forgot or suffered to be an useless burden upon his memory he remembered to have heard from the mexicans that the fortune of the field with them ever followed that of the royal standard this was a net o gold elevated on a gilded staff and splendid with plumes of a thousand colors great exigencies alone brought it into the field and it was entrusted to none but the care of the general who sat on a chair sumptuousl adorned and supported on mens shoulders i the center of the armies to view the whol battle to be a witness of the behavior of all his troops and to give orders as the occasion required cortes pretending to make his principal effort in a quarter remote from the standard employed all his foot in that service but heading the horse himself with some of his bravest officers informing them of his design and animating them with the hopes of a speedy decision he flung himself with fury against the part that seemed least distant from the center after dispersing and overturning whole battalions they penetrated to the chosen body of nobles who guarded the general and standard here the resistance was greater but it was soon overcome and cortess own lance met the general who was overthrown and the standard taken all the other standards were struck directly and the mexicans fled every way which their fear and confusion hurried them they lost twenty thousand men in this battle and a spoil infinite this victory gave cortes an undisturbed passage to tlascala and a welcome reception amongst his allies there  chap xiii let us now turn our eyes to mexico no sooner were the spaniards departed than guatimozin ordered the city to be fortified in such a manner as to secure himself against their entrance a third time he found that a thousand tlascalans were killed in this retreat upwards of two hundred spaniards the greatest loss they had yet in america and a great number of horses he cut off the heads of the spaniards and of their horses no less dreaded and sent them to all the neighboring nations as an infallible token of his victory as a sure proof that he was resolved to keep no measures with the enemy and to stir them up to their utter destruction and he succeeded so well that numberless petty nations well inclined to the spaniards fell off and many that were wavering were confirmed in the mexican interest by this means several adventurers that from the fame of cortes had landed to join him were cut to pieces before they gained his army but the negotiation to which guatimozin bent all his force was that with tlascala because this was cortess chief strength he sent large presents and ambassadors of ability and excellent instructions to detach them from the spanish interest who acted so well that they caused a great division in their favor in the councils of that republic but cortes making his military exploits subservient to his negotiations and his skill in negotiation assistant to his exploits baffled them at length with great address but not without great difficulty and the tlascalans were confirmed in his friendship  whilst a general has an obedient and well united army he has an engine in proper order to work in his designs and he can then execute them with ease but the greatest trial of his capacity is to defend himself against a foreign enemy and wrestle with a domestic sedition at the same time the soldiers of narvaez since cortess return from mexico where they were obliged to leave so considerable a part of their booty now hopeless of the expedition began to mutiny and demanded to be sent home directly to cuba nor were his other troops free from some part of the infection whatever could be done by preserving them in action without too great a fatigue whatever a seasonable yielding without forfeiting authority in short whatever an able commander could do in such circumstances was done by cortes without any other effect than that of palliating the disease the indisposition still continued  whilst he struggled with these difficulties which nearly overpowered him his old enemy james velasquez looking on the success of narvaezs expedition as a thing certain sent a ship to get intelligence of his proceedings and about thirty men to reinforce him the person who commanded at the port for cortes no sooner saw the ship in the offing than he went on board her and upon the captains enquiry after narvaez he assured him he was well and as successful as he could wish not doubting this the captain and his men landed and were immediately made prisoners finding how affairs were really circumstanced they admired the conqueror commended the stratagem and cheerfully joined the army  much about the same time the governor of jamaica and he too a determined enemy of cortes sent three ships with a small body of troops in hopes of tearing from him some part of his conquests these ships were dispersed in a storm and were involved in many difficulties but what is singular they all though separated came to one and the same resolution which was to revolt from the commander and join cortes the moment they came on shore so that the enemies of cortes now no less than three times relieved him by the very methods which they took to distress his affairs these advantages though improved to the utmost by cortes were certainly not at all the result of his contrivance there is a species of a splendid good fortune necessary to form an hero to give a luster to his wisdom and courage and to create that confidence and superiority in him that nothing else can give but which always makes a principal part of an heroic character without this it is impossible for any man however qualified to emerge cortes was not only fortunate by being freed from the most terrible embarrassment by the arrival of these succors which were never intended as such but much about the same time ships arrived from spain bringing on the account of some private persons a reinforcement of men and military stores and from the court an authentic approbration of his conduct and a confirmation of his command  fortified with these he yielded to the mutinous importunities of such of his soldiers as were earnest to depart and though he diminished his numbers considerably by this step he judged it better to have a welldisciplined army than a great one and knew that little could be expected from men who were dragged unwillingly to action at the same time that their cowardice or sedition would infect the rest after the departure of the mutineers he found he had still above nine hundred spanish foot and eightysix horse and eighteen pieces of cannon with these and with the assistance of a vast body of tlascalans and allies of various nations whom admiration and fear of cortes or hatred to the mexicans had brought under his banner he once more prepared to attack mexico which was the grand object of his undertakings the city was so advantageously situated and he knew at this time so well fortified that nothing could be done without a force on the lake to cut off their supplies he ordered the materials of twelve brigantines to be got ready in such a manner as only to need being put together when they should arrive at mexico these were carried upon the shoulders of his indian allies his rout to mexico cannot be so much considered in the light of a march as a continued train of ambuscades and battles  some of which were fought with the most numerous armies and with circumstances not suited to the brevity of my purpose to relate in all these he was successful though his enemies may be said with little exaggeration to have disputed with him every foot of ground between tlascala and mexico  at last that city showed itself rising from the midst of a noble lake surrounded with a number of most populous cities as her attendants upon every side and all subject to her power the spaniards now looking on this as their goal revived their courage and forgot the difficulties of their march and the tlascalans in a perfect fury of military delight wanted the steady hand of cortes to restrain a courage which he commended and kept alive by his example and words whilst he moderated it is ardor before he began the attack of mexico he spent some time in reducing all the neighboring cities from which it might derive any succor he cut off the aqueducts which supplied mexico with water that of the lake being brackish and he got ready his brigantines with all imaginable diligence to cut off all relief from the lake  whilst his attention was wholly employed in the prosecution of the war an old spaniard who had long served discovered to him a conspiracy of the most dangerous nature antonio de vilesana a private soldier but a man bold and desperate in any bad purpose and subtle in contriving it had formed a conspiracy with several others to kill cortes and the principal persons upon whom he relied and then to return to vera cruz from whence they might easily pass to cuba and secure their pardon by the merit they should make of this action with james velasquez they were urged to this resolution by the fatigue of those innumerable dangers and difficulties they had passed and by the despair of overcoming those which yet lay before them without considering that by this wicked action they should rather produce new difficulties than overcome the old others of more consequence were drawn in and the conspiracy had been so far formed that the time and manner of killing him was settled and the person fixed upon whom they intended to devolve the command when cortes was apprised of this conspiracy without any hurry that might give notice that he had discovered it yet without losing a moment to take advantage of the discovery with four or five of his principal captains he went directly to the quarters of vilesana who astonished at seeing him made half his confession by the fear he discovered cortes had him thrown immediately into irons and then ordering every body to retire he examined himself into all the particulars of the affair and the names of the persons concerned vilesana made a full confession and ended it by producing a paper in vindication of their proceeding which had been signed with the names of all the conspirators cortes was not a little surprised to see amongst them the names of persons upon whom he had great reliance however he dissembled his concern and ordered vilesana to be immediately executed he was shown to all the army hanging at his tent door cortes informed none of the friends he most trusted with the paper he had received but summoning the army he gave them an account of the horrid conspiracy that had been formed against his life that he had punished the person principally concerned but that it was with satisfaction he was left ignorant of his accomplices by the care the criminal took in destroying a paper which he believed might have made great discoveries for his part as he had punished and was resolved severely to punish any flagitious attempt against his life or authority so he was determined to order both in such a manner as to give just cause of complaint to no man and if by any accident he had done so he was ready to give him all reasonable satisfaction proceeding thus cortes had the advantage of knowing who they were that wished him ill at the same time that they remained unapprised of the discovery he had made and endeavored to prevent it by a more diligent performance of their duty he now appointed a guard upon his person  hardly had cortes suppressed this conspiracy and made the proper use of a baffled attempt against his authority which was to strengthen and increase it than a difficulty of something of a similar nature engaged him and from which he extricated himself with the same courage and prudence the general of the tlascalans envying his glory and perhaps fearful of the consequence of the entire destruction of the mexicans though enemies to his own country persuaded a considerable body of the people to quit the spanish camp cortes immediately ordered him to be pursued this general had formerly been an enemy to cortes and opposed him in the councils of his nation but when he saw the general current in his favor he made a timely change and came entirely into his interests he had now relapsed and was therefore not to be trusted any more cortes gave orders to those who pursued him to put him to death the tlascalans who revolted were easily prevailed upon to return and so dexterously did cortes represent this affair that neither the tlascalans in his army nor the republic nor even the father himself of the general condemned him for what he had done  chap xiv these internal disorders being composed he turned his fortitude and wisdom against his open enemies three principal causeways led to the city which three towns or suburbs defended upon the side of the continent within were trenches and barricadoes one behind another the whole length of the way cortes ordered three attacks upon these towns and the causeways which they defended the brigantines acted upon the water through the whole length of this siege the bravery of the mexicans in defense of every thing which was dear to them was not more remarkable than the ingenuity by which they baffled the attacks of the spaniards and attacked them in their turn on land on water by open force by stratagem by every method they plied each other incessantly day and night but the spaniards invincible under the command of cortes had the advantage so far that with infinite slaughter they gained these posts which secured the causeways upon the side of the country at the same time that they cleared the lake so that a canoe of the enemy did not dare to appear upon it  cortes gained these advantages but he saw how dearly he had bought them he reflected how it would tarnish his glory to destroy so beautiful a city and drench it in the blood of it is unfortunate inhabitants and considering what supernatural exertions of strength had been frequently shown by a despairing people in the last convulsive struggle for their religion life and property he made use of the advantages he had gained to recommend the terms of accommodation which he resolved to send unto the besieged he required no more than the acknowledgment of the emperor of the romans and the confirmation of his right of succeeding ceded to him by montezuma and long acknowledged by the most authentic prophecies of the nation and such a security as might settle the performance of this  guatimozin who had done all that bravery and military skill could perform to save his country finding the means most suited to his years and inclinations unsuccessful though full of that noble pride which becomes and supports the royal character was now as willing to save it by the milder and surer way of accommodation but the priests who had much influence in the council either fearful of losing their power or through an honest though blind zeal denounced vengeance from their gods upon all who could think of submission and promised a certain success to those who stood up in defense of their religion they had great weight and the whole council contrary to the opinion of the emperor became unanimous in refusing all terms guatimozin who yielded to the general sentiment with regret and saw the unhappy consequence but too clearly resolved to fall with the same spirit that he had lived then said he since you are determined to hazard every thing prepare to act in a manner worthy of that resolution me you shall never find wanting to you or to myself these are the last good terms you are to expect whatever henceforward you demand through necessity will be answered with pride and cruelty therefore henceforward let no man presume to speak of peace be our exigencies what they will the first that dares to do it shall certainly die even the priests themselves they are most concerned to support the oracles of their gods  when he had said this with a stern and determined countenance he went out of the assembly and ordered the whole city under arms cortes on the other side as soon as he found that his proposals were rejected laid aside all thoughts but those of violence and commanded a general assault to be made at the three causeways all at once and to carry fire and sword into the heart of the city he commanded himself in the principal attack the causeway was broke down before him and the breach formed a ditch of sixty feet wide on the other side appeared a fortification of earth and planks he ordered the brigantines to the side of the causeway to favor the attack and directing his cannon against the fortification made so furious a fire that it was soon demolished and the defenders galled by the incessant shot which made a most terrible havoc could maintain the post no longer cortes under the fire of his cannon and with the help of his brigantines passed over the ditch and lost no time to possess himself of the other side leaving one of his captains with a detachment to fill it up and secure a retreat in case it should be found necessary then he advanced to attack the remaining barricadoes of the mexicans who made a brave defense the battle raged furiously and as the spaniards gained ground their dangers and losses grew every moment greater they had now advanced amongst the buildings from whence they were oppressed with a mixed storm of darts arrows stones and boiling water before them stood a chosen body of the mexican soldiers who made a resolute stand during this conflict the captain who had been posted to fill up the ditch thinking it an inglorious employment to be employed as a pioneer whilst his companions were in such an hot action advanced with all his men and deserted the necessary work he was employed in  no sooner had guatimozin whose eyes were every where perceived this motion than he took advantage of it he ordered those who were in the front of the spaniards to slacken their efforts for as night came on fast he thought it better to allow the enemy to gain some ground that he might fall on them with more advantage in their retreat cortes as quickly perceived this slackness and the cause which produced it he found that the breach of the causeway was abandoned that nigh approached and that there was little hope o a lodgment in the city at that time he therefore began to retreat in the best order he could setting fire to the houses that he might not be incommoded by them in his next attack bu scarcely was the retreat begun when their ears were alarmed by the dreary sound of the sacred trumpet so called because it was permitted to the priests alone to sound it and that only when they animated the people on the part of their gods the sound was doleful continued and strong inspiring a contempt of death and a dark religious fury immediately ensued a horrid cry which resounded from all parts and this was followed by an attack of more than common rage upon the rear of the spaniards which was broke entirely after a gallant and bloody stand all order was now lost the generals commands were drowned in the cry and tumult of the fight the tlascalans who were in the front threw themselves precipitately into the trench some made a fruitless opposition others attempted to gain the brigantines whilst the mexicans on shore in canoes wading or swimming upon every side assaulted and slaughtered them with the most horrid cries and rage almost inconceiveable with difficulty cortes and some of his troops escaped on board the brigantines wounded and deserted a thousand tlascalans lay dead upon the causeway many spaniards and scarce any escaped without a wound what was the saddest circumstance of all forty were taken prisoners of whose destiny there was no doubt the other attacks had no better success though in them the loss was not so considerable the officer whose imprudence had occasioned this misfortune came to cortes with tears acknowledging his crime and desiring to wash it out with his blood but cortes though rigid in his discipline saw that this was no time to dispirit the army with examples of severity  night came on but it brought no rest to the afflicted spaniards since it is darkness could no conceal from them the triumph of the mexicans and the fate of their friends they saw the whole city shining with lights and heard i resounding with the dissonance of barbarous music and all the marks of an horrid joy so great were the fires and illuminations that they could see distinctly the men in motion and all things preparing for the death of the prisoners attended with the mortifying circumstance that they were to be sacrificed to their false gods cortes in the midst of all these calamitous cirumstances which lay heavy about his heart assumed an air of tranquillity endeavoring to comfort his soldiers with the hope of a timely revenge and taking all necessary care that they should not be attacked unawares this care was necessary for before morning appeared the mexicans elated with their late victory and under the auspices of those gods whom they believed they had rendered propitious by the human blood which washed their altars and animated by the sound of the consecrated trumpet sallied out to attack the spaniards in their quarters the attack was violent but repelled at length with an incredible slaughter of the mexicans  guatimozin was not disheartened he prepared for new assaults and had his ruined works repaired to endure those assaults which should be made against himself not relying solely on force he spread a report amongst all the neighboring nations that cortes was killed to them he sent the heads of the spaniards who had been sacrificed informing them that the god of war appeased by a sacrifice so agreeable to him had audibly declared in favor of the mexicans threatened vengeance on those who resisted them and declared that in eight days time the spaniards should be all destroyed the credit of this oracle amongst all the indians and the determinate time ascertained for it is completion gave it the air of truth for falsehood delights in general terms and equivocations whereas the precise manner of speaking truth is one of the marks by which we guess at it in fact this stratagem had it is effect many tribes of indians who were upon the point of joining cortes embraced the mexican interest the more prudent suspended their resolution but guatimozin did not want emissaries even in the spanish camp who terrified the indian allies with this prophecy even the tlascalans were upon the point of deserting them when cortes counteracted this stratagem in the wisest manner possible he resolved to suspend all manner of operations against the city for these eight days to demonstrate the falsity of this oracle and to hinder it from being ever again used as an instrument to work upon the credulity of his confederates he prevailed upon the tlascalans to wait the determination in the mean time he strongly fortified his camp  guatimozin was sensible that the effect of his policy must be weakened every day and with that idea employed every hour of the day or night to assault cortess camp but always with ill success this great commander was always on his guard and his troops advantageously posted bid defiance to every thing of an indian attack at last the eight day expired and with them the terror of the confederate indians the stratagem now operated as powerfully against those who contrived it insomuch that cortes in a little time found himself at the head of two hundred thousand men this was the last hope of the mexicans all that followed was only the departing agony of that state the city was assaulted with redoubled vigor and now reduced by slaughters fatigue and famine the mexicans saw the superior star of cortes gain the ascendant the town was penetrated upon all sides yet the besieged defended ever street and their incessant showers of da and stones from the tops of the houses made the progress of the besiegers slow and bloody in this extremity guatimozin did every thing that could justify the hopes of the mexicans when they called him to the throne every thing that was worthy of one resolved to die a king but when he found that all hopes of dislodging the enemy was utterly at an end his troops half famished exhausted in numbers and in strength and no part tenable he determined to leave the city to obtain the best terms it could from the conquerors and to seek himself a more prosperous opportunity at a distance for this purpose he renewed the treaty with the spaniards and took the opportunity of this cessation of arms to put himself and his family with some of the bravest and most faithful of his nobility on board some periaguas attempting to escape to the continent but cortes apprehending this very thing stationed his fleet in such a manner that he was intercepted and soon out of a condition of making any defense he went on board the spanish commander with an air of dignity and composure betraying neither fear nor surprise and desired no favor but that the honor of his wife and her attendants might be spared the spanish captain attended but little to him endeavoring to prevent the escape of the nobility but guatimozin desired him not to be anxious about them not one of these men will fly says he do not fear it they are come to die at the feet of their sovereign the captain admiring the constancy of the man and the fidelity of his subjects conducted him to cortes the ruins of the city of mexico were now delivered up to the spaniards with it fell that empire and the liberty of all the indian nations which filled that vast country now called new spain who either slid gradually from alliances to subjection or defending themselves without success were made and treated as slaves  the curiosity of the reader will doubtless be interested to know the fates of the captains of the conquering and conquered parties in this war for some time the treatment of guatimozin was such as fitted an unfortunate brave man in the hands of those who could estimate virtue by other standards than it is fortune and such was his treatment whilst the authority of guatimozin was sufficent to protect him but the internal avarice of his troops which at once excited and disgraced their courage not satisfied with the plunder of this opulent city believed that there were some latent treasures within the knowledge of the emperor which far exceeded all the rest that they had yet possessed they often solicited the captive emperor with promises and threats to make a discovery to no purpose at last a number of villains juan de alderete at their head a name deserving to be remembered to it is everlasting infamy seized upon him and proceeding to the most abominable cruelty laid him upon burning coals to extort a discovery of his wealth but their wickedness could neither extort a discovery of his wealth nor the satisfaction even of a declaration that he had none to discover his countenance did not betray the least yielding or weakness under the torture some of his principal counselors suffered along with him and almost with equal constancy one of those unhappy men overcome by the force of torments almost superior to human strength turned his eyes fainting with anguish upon his prince and uttered a doleful cry but guatimozin answered him only by saying do you think i lie upon roses the sufferer struck dumb with these words and stifling every murmur that might dishearten the others or disturb guatimozin expired in an act of obedience to his prince this wickedness was committed without the knowledge of cortes he was no sooner apprised of what was doing than he rushed in upon the villains and rescued their prey mangled as it was from their farther fury however this was but a short respite this prince conscious of his own dignity and sensible of the base usage he received either endeavored to stir up commotions or was suspected of such a design and cortes being obliged to submit the humanity of his nature to the cruel necessity of politics ordered him to be executed  as for cortes himself neither his great success nor the vast treasures which he sent into spain could secure him from his enemies by whose unwearied zeal for his ruin he saw himself superseded in the government of a country conquered by himself with so much toil and danger and which in any other hands had never been effected he died in spain having received a title and some other rewards from charles the vth for whom he had acquired an empire but by his own desire he was carried to mexico and buried there it was the policy of spain at that time to give great encouragement and extensive grants to all adventurers but when any great discovery was made or conquest achieved they always sent another to reap the benefit of the first adventurers labors this was a policy undoubtedly good with regard to one object the security of the conquered country but like al unjust policy it had altogether as ill an effect another way the new governors hungry and rapacious and scarce considering the indians a human creatures murdered vast numbers o them and exhausting them by an intolerabl slavery in hopes of a sudden gain they depopulated the country in such a manner as t abate very much the advantages which spai might have derived from so extensive a conquest cortes himself was not free from the imputation of cruelty the bishop of chiapa a good man who was sent purposely to make an enquiry into complaints of this kind gives a very unfavourable representation of his conduct he accuses him of having destroyed four millions of people in new spain it is certain whether by his connivance or not but partly by the necessity of war and partly by the avarice and insolence of the conquerors vast numbers of the indians perished but on the other hand it appears that the bishop of chiapa was an enemy to cortes which though a good man otherwise must detract from his credit not a little especially as other historians differ from him in this point besides i am well satisfied that great allowance must be made for exaggerations in the number of inhabitants these countries are said to have contained more populous i believe they were than the entirely uncivilized parts of north or south america but it can hardly be thought they were so full of people as they are represented to have been if we can trust to any of the rules by which we usually judge in this matter nor consequently could they have suffered such losses in so short a time without being utterly depopulated which certainly they were not  since i am on the subject of these cruelties and since they are things so frequently mentioned i cannot help observing that the accounts are by no means founded upon any tolerable methods of calculation but thrown down at random in a declamatory way with a design yet further to blacken the spanish adventurer men certainly wicked enough though represented without any heightening colors the truth is that great numbers perhaps almost as great as are charged have really perished but then it was in a series of years by being reduced to slavery in the mines and other laborious occupations to which the americans are of all people by their constitutions the most unequal and by being disheartened by a state of unpolitical and desperate slavery the greatest enemy in the world to increase  there is a notion likewise pretty common that these cruelties were committed partly if not wholly upon a religious account and at the instigation of the priests but in reality it was quite otherwise this unfortunate people found their only refuge in the humanity which yet remained in the clergy and the influence they had on the spaniards though the clergy who went on these adventures were generally not the most zealous for religion and were as the spanish clergy commonly are ignorant enough and so little principled in the spirit of the religion they professed or indeed in the nature of the human mind that they could boast as a very glorious thing that one of them had baptized several thousands of indians in one day without the help of any miracle for their conversion and with a degree of good life which to say the best was nothing more than common but of any murders committed by them or at their instigation i find little or no proof at all  chap xv besides mexico there was but one country in america which in any sort deserved the name of a civilized kingdom and that was peru during the latter part of the mexican war the spaniards became acquainted with the fame and wealth of this country after pedraria was appointed governor over the conquests of balboa his lieutenants reduced all that large tract which is now called terrafirma committing barbarities worthy the man under whose authority they acted amongst all the adventurers who acted under his commission none have made themselves so famous as those of whom we are going to speak  as if it were destined that every thing in this new world should be carried on in a new and extraordinary manner three citizens of panama private men and advanced in years undertook the conquest of peru a country known to them only by report but by the same report said to be rich extensive populous and powerful the names of these adventurers were francis pizarro almagro and ferdinand lucques a priest and a man of considerable fortune they entered into this engagement in the most solemn manner lucques said mass an oath of mutual fidelity was plighted the sacrament was divided into three parts lucques took one and delivered the other two to his confederates the first expedition in consequence of this confederacy was made under extraordinary difficulties and with very little success pizarro who commanded spent two years in the short navigation between panama and the northern extremity of peru a voyage now made frequently in two weeks since the winds and currents are known he landed and found that the wealth of the country was as great as he imagined and that the resistance he was like to meet in endeavoring to possess himself of it would be full as considerable this he put to the proof very early by taking the rash step of attacking the inhabitants at his first landing and thus letting them see all at once the worst of his intentions the difficulties he met with and the resistance his ill conduct occasioned in the country obliged him to return without effecting any thing considerable but neither he nor his associates after such a length of time or such greatness of expense were deterred from the prosecution of their scheme it was agreed that pizarro should go into spain to obtain an exemption from the government of pedraria and to get for themselves the grant of whatever they should conquer pizarro who though not the monied man was the soul of the enterprise was to be chief governor with the property of two hundred leagues along the seacoast almagro they agreed should be adelantado or kings lieutenant and lucques who was a priest was to be first bishop and protector of the indians the other profits of the enterprise were to be equally divided but as this was an enterprise of ambitious avarice there was little faith observed pizarro solicited only his own suit in spain and obtained for himself alone the property of the land the government the lieutenancy every thing which he was capable as a layman of taking almagro was forgot and lucquez was left his eventual bishopric  on his return this too early discovery of breach of faith was like to ruin all but pizarro who knew how to retreat as well as to advance yielded up to almagro every thing he could reasonably desire and nothing now obstructed the embarkation which after all did not exceed one hundred and eighty men  before we proceed it may not be unnecessary to say something of the persons who had the conduct of this great undertaking francis pizarro was the bastard son of a gentleman of good family his education was as irregular as his birth he could not even read but then he had a great deal of that capacity and fitness for the world which is obtained by much struggling in it and by being early made dependant on a mans own industry hardened to life dexterous in affairs never setting his heart upon a part of his designs whilst the total was at stake of a penetrating sagacity into the nature of man artful bold dissembling and cruel almagro had likewise enough of that desperate bravery and toughness of body and mind so necessary in a design of this sort in their birth there was no considerable difference pizarro was a bastard almagro a foundling pizarro owed nothing to education almagro depended wholly upon his natural parts but almagro bred from his infancy in the camp had all the soldierly qualities patient laborious and temperate far from the craft and dissimulation of pizarro he was all openness and generosity knew not what avarice was and his cruelty the common distemper of all the adventurers in this part of the world was much mitigated by the intercourse he had with an indian woman who by degrees softened the rigor of a veteran seasoned to blood into some compassion to her unhappy countrymen  the empire of peru was governed by a race of kings which they called yncas the twelfth in succession was then upon the throne the first of this race who was named mango capac was a prince of great genius with that mixture of enthusiasm which fits a man to make great changes and to be the legislator of a forming nation he observed that the people of peru were naturally superstitious and had principally a veneration for the sun he therefore pretended that he was descended from that luminary whose authority he was designed to bear and whose worship he was by that authority to enforce by this persuasion easily received by a credulous people he brought a large territory under his jurisdiction a larger was subdued by his arms but he made use both of the deceit and the force for the most laudable purposes he united and civilized the dispersed and barbarous people he bent them to laws and arts he softened them by the institutions of a benevolent religion in short there was no part of america in which agriculture and the arts were so much and so well cultivated nor where the people were of a milder nature and more ingenuous manners the yncas descended as they imagined from so sacred an original were themselves respected as divinities in none even of the asiatic countries was there so entire an obedience to the royal authority but here it was rather filial than slavish as to the character of the peruvians themselves they seem to have had a strong resemblance to the ancient egyptians like them under a sky constantly serene they were a people industrious and ingenious cultivating the arts but without bringing them to perfection inclined to superstition and of a soft unwarlike temper  the ynca guaiana capac having conquered the province of quito which now makes a part of spanish peru to secure himself in the possession married the daughter of the natural prince of the country by her he had a son called atahualpa or atabalipa by a former marriage he had a son named huescar heir of his other dominions on his death huescar his eldest son claims his whole dominions both hereditary and acquired atabalipa the youngest without pretending to the rest would keep quito as his right by the double title of son to the conqueror and to her whose inheritance that kingdom was forfeited besides by the will the dying ynca had made in his favor this dispute kindled a civil war which after various turns of fortune ended at last in favor of atabalipa and he not only routed his brothers armies and overrun his dominions but actually held him a prisoner in the castle of cusco such was the face of affairs when the spaniards arrived in peru whose remarkable appearance and surprising feats of arms were every where spread about the country and caused a general alarm as usual in frightful rumors new superstitions begin or old ones are revived to increase the confusion there subsisted a tradition amongst the peruvians that one of their ancient princes had a dream which he ordered carefully to be recorded he imagined that he saw a man clothed all over even to his feet with a long beard and leading in his hand an animal such as he had never seen before and that at the same time he was clearly informed of the will of the gods that such a man should rule that country a spaniard whom pizarro had sent upon an embassy to atabalipa as soon as he was discovered leading his horse upon some occasion that made him dismount agreed so well with this dream that it is incredible how soon it spread into the remotest parts of the country and with how great a terror it struck the whole nation  atabalipa newly seated upon a precarious throne was not the least alarmed at this event for a new erected power has every thing to fear from whatever sets the peoples minds still unsettled upon new motions he resolved if possible that his enemies should take no advantage of the arrival of those strangers by engaging them by all means to his own interest he therefore received the ambassadors which pizarro had sent with the greatest marks of honor though their discourse consisting itself of very impertinent matter was very ill interpreted to him as was his to them he even went out to meet pizarro with a vast number of attendants to whom he gave the strictest charge upon no account to offer the least injury to the strangers as they were those of whom his predecessor had foretold and of the same divine original children of the sun but pizarro who advanced with other notions to the interview soon convinced him that a contrary caution was more necessary they met near a celebrated temple the spaniards drawn up in order of battle and a party in ambuscade this circumstance leaves us in no doubt as to the design of pizarro the first person who addressed himself to the ynca was father vincent a friar who was not ashamed to make his character the instrument of so base a crime he advanced with a cross in his hand and began a most unseasonable discourse upon the birth and miracles of christ exhorting him to become a christian on the pain of eternal punishment then he spoke with equal eloquence of the emperor of the romans pressing him with the same good argument to become a subject to that emperor threatening him in case of obstinacy that god would harden his heart as he did pharaohs and then punish him with the plagues of egypt with other miserable stuff worse interpreted the ynca though utterly astonished at matter so unaccountable behaved with decency and gravity telling him that he believed that he and his companions were children of the sun recommended himself and his subjects to their protection and made no doubt but they would behave to them in a manner worthy the offspring of so beneficent a deity  whilst these discourses continued the spanish soldiers whose least business to peru was to listen to sermons observing a considerable quantity of gold in the neighboring temple had their zeal immediately stirred up and a party of them began to pillage it the priests made some opposition a disturbance ensued and a great noise which so alarmed our adventuring apostle that he let fall his cross and breviary in his fright and turned his back upon his intended proselyte the spaniards who were not concerned in the pillage seeing him fly either that they judged the heathens had offered their priest some violence or that pizarro made use of this signal to them to fall on immediately drew their swords attacked the guards and attendants of the ynca defenseless through a religious obedience to their sovereigns command and with every circumstance of the most deliberate and shocking barbarity slaughtered five thousand which was near the whole number of the indians who fell without any anxiety for their own lives pressing forward with all the zeal and officiousness of a most heroic loyalty to the chair of their prince to expire at his feet and as fast as one set of his supporters were slain the others succeeded with eagerness to supply their places and share their fate the ynca at last was dragged down and made a prisoner by an act of the most unparallelled treachery executed with a cruelty that has hardly an example and can admit of no excuse the plunder of his camp rich beyond the idea of any european of that time was their reward  the unfortunate prince was not wanting to himself in his captivity seeing that his liberty had fallen a sacrifice to their avarice he hoped to relieve himself by working upon the same disposition he began to treat of his ransom and promised such sums as astonished the spaniards into an agreement nor was the performance unequal on this occasion not only the ancient ornaments and valuable furniture amassed by a long line of magnificent kings were brought out but the hallowed treasures of the most venerated temples were given without scruple to save him who was the support of the kingdom and the religion whilst these were preparing three spaniards who were sent to cusco to superintend in the work had means of conferring with huescar who quickly finding their foible and the use his brother had made of it made bitter complaints of the injuries he had suffered begging the spaniards as the patrons of the oppressed to embrace his cause promising threefold the treasure for their assistance which atabalipa was to pay for his ransom he received a very favorable answer mean time the spaniards treated the ynca with all manner of civility admitted his attendants to him but no talk of his liberty as soon as he had been apprised of huescars negotiation with the spaniards and almagros arrival with an additional force he began to be under great apprehensions to ease himself upon one side he sent immediate orders to have huescar put to death  the arrival of almagro on the other hand caused some embarrassment in pizarros affairs this commander finding that pizarro had seized the ynca with immense treasures and having already experienced his ill faith consulted with his principal officers about leaving his part to himself and seeking their fortune elsewhere whilst this was in agitation his secretary who was averse to him gave pizarro notice of the design in an instant pizarro saw how disadvantageous such a step must prove to him with so small a force all resources at a distance and the country exasperated by the detestable action he had lately committed he saw that all depended upon removing every suspicion of him from the breast of almagro for this purpose and as something of an ill mind appeared in his most masterly actions he began by sacrificing the secretary he informed almagro of his treachery next though gold was the great object of his undertakings yet he knew how to relinquish some part to secure the rest he agreed to divide the spoil equally between almagro and himself and to make no distinction between the soldiers of either in the distribution this made an entire and hearty reconciliation which was no sooner concluded than the yncas ransom came in but this vast treasure the capital object of all their labors and villainies no sooner came into their possession but in it is consequences it was very near being the utter ruin of their affairs it is said and not improbably that the whole exceeded the sum of one million five hundred thousand pounds sterling a sum vast at the present time then it was a prodigy on the dividend after deducting a fifth for the emperor and the shares of the chief commanders and officers each private soldier had above two thousand pounds english money they had now made a fortune even beyond their imaginations but the soldiery was ruined the greatest part of the army insisted upon being discharged that they might enjoy their fortunes in quiet this proposal ill suited with the ambitious views of the commanders almagro was for proceeding in the usual way to enforce obedience by the severity of military discipline but pizarro opposed him let them go says he they cannot do us better service here we shall have them mutinous and cowardly soldiers at home they will act for us as recruiting officers with great success for when it shall be seen that common soldiers of so little merit as they have made such large fortunes we shall not long want better men to supply their places the desire of the soldiers was complied with and as many as chose to go who were no inconsiderable number departed in due time the sagacious prophecy of pizarro was accomplished and their army never wanted reinforcements  chap xvi in the mean time the unfortunate atabalipa the greatness of whose ransom only convinced the spaniards of the necessity of never releasing him endeavored to take advantage of his captivity to know the genius and manners of this people amongst all their accomplishments there was nothing he so much admired as the art of reading and writing this appeared almost incomprehensible to him though he saw clearly the use of it he was at a loss to know whether he should consider it as a natural endowment or as an acquisition of art to discover this he one day desired a soldier to write the name of god upon his nail he carried this about the army desiring several to explain it which they all did to his wonder and satisfaction at last he showed it to pizarro but pizarro blushed and could make nothing of it the ynca then perceived it was no natural gift but owing to education the want of which he thus discovered in pizarro and slighted him for it this mortified the general and his disgust joined to his natural cruelty and a policy he thought he saw in the proceeding made him hasten the fate he had some time before determined for his unhappy prisoner that nothing might be wanting to the boldness and atrociousness of their barbarity they proceeded against him by way of trial and by the forms of law  a charge was exhibited digested under several heads  st for being an idolater  dly for having many concubines  dly for wasting the treasures of the kingdom and raising taxes since the coming in of the spaniards and lastly for the murder of his brother huescar an attorney general was appointed to manage the accusation and an advocate appointed from amongst themselves assigned for his defense in vain did the more numerous and better part of the army protest against this proceeding and lodge an appeal to spain in vain did they allege their want of power to judge a foreign prince for any crimes and the absurdity of the crimes with which this prince was charged before such judges and with such an advocate to defend him the ynca was condemned to be buried alive to complete this violation and mockery of all laws human and divine the same father vincent who had so signalized himself upon a former occasion was sent to comfort and instruct him in his last moments the chief argument which he used to convert him to christianity was that on his embracing the faith instead of being burned his sentence should be mitigated to strangling this prince submitted to baptism and was immediately strangled in prison pizarro gave the final stroke to his hardened and shameless villainy by giving him a magnificent funeral and going into mourning  the death of the ynca was no sooner spread abroad than the principal nobility at cusco set up the brother of huescar pizarro set up a son of atabalipa and two generals of the peruvians set up for themselves thus was this wretched country torn to pieces at once by foreigners and by a domestic war amongst themselves yet such is the preference of any sort of spirit roused within a nation to a lethargic inactivity that the peruvians gained some considerable advantages over the spaniards even in this distracted condition and took several prisoners amongst whom was the attorney general whom they put to the death he deserved without any great formality the rest of the prisoners as soon as they were informed of their having protested against the emperors death they generously relieved these advantages gained by the peruvians made the spaniards listen to a treaty for pizarro was equally ready at all times to make a peace or to break it as his affairs required he made use of this interval to settle the spaniards in the country it was now that he laid the foundations of the famous city of lima but as soon as he judged himself in a condition to prosecute it he renewed the war with the indians and after many difficulties made himself master of cusco then the capital of the empire  but whilst he was thus by force and fraud establishing himself every where the whole fabric of his designs was shaken by a fresh dispute between him and his colleague almagro these commanders had little mutual affection and less confidence in each others honor and integrity for similarity of manners is no ground of friendship but where the manners are good in themselves their common necessities it is true obliged them for a time to keep a fair appearance but each satisfied of the others ill intentions watched an opportunity of being beforehand in some sinister advantage new grants and supplies had lately arrived from spain pizarro obtained two hundred leagues along the seacoast to the southward of his former government almagro had a grant of two hundred more to the southward of pizarros judging or pretending he judged that the wealthy and important city of cusco was not included within pizarros grant he immediately ceased to act in subordination to him and claimed this city as his property pizarros brother who commanded for him there absolutely refused to deliver up the place almagro insisted on it with equal obstinacy and they were on the point of deciding the dispute by the sword when pizarro the moment he had notice of the quarrel came from lima where he was at that time indisposed notwithstanding his infirmity with incredible expedition to cusco he told his colleague that he was not unable nor afraid to support the justice of his claim by arms but he chose rather to convince him by reason that the ties which subsisted between them and their common necessities would always touch him with concern to be compelled to violent courses which however they might end in favor of one of them rather than the other would certainly be much more in favor of the common enemy he demonstrated to him that cusco was indubitably within his pizarros government and ended in assuring him that as he would defend his own right with all his force so he was equally willing to employ all that force with all his treasure and all his council and whatever assistance he could give to put almagro into possession of whatever was really his right that this lay yet more to the southward than cusco and was a country no way inferior in it is riches and the easiness of the conquest  this timely appearance of pizarro his dexterous management and judicious mixture of firmness and flexibility made such an impression upon almagro that he was once more reconciled and adding as many of pizarros troops to his own as he judged necessary he penetrated with great danger and difficulty into chili losing many of his men whilst he passed over mountains of an immense height and always covered with snow he succeeded notwithstanding in a good measure in his designs for he reduced a valuable and considerable part of that country  there was undoubtedly in the four hundred leagues which pizarro had solicited for himself enough of land to satisfy any reasonable ambition and something to spare to secure the quiet possession of the rest but his eagerness after a large territory made him blind to the folly of dividing his troops and sending almagro upon a wild distant expedition and yet he considered this as a masterpiece of policy a little time however convinced him to the contrary no sooner did the ynca perceive this division of the spanish troops than he desired leave from pizarros brother who managed affairs for him at cusco to assist at a solemn festival of this nation which was to be held at some distance this feast was in reality a sort of an assembly of the states of the kingdom the ynca having obtained permission to assist at it made use of this opportunity to represent to his subjects in the most pathetic manner the misery to which the nation was reduced the settlement of the spaniards the cities they had built the garrison they kept at cusco and the guard they had on his own person that for their sakes he was now resolved to hazard that person and every thing that was dear to him that now was the time to make an effort with success when their enemies divided amongst themselves had separated in search of other kingdoms to satisfy an ambition that nothing could satiate the whole assembly united in these sentiments they roused the country every where and the spaniards who remained in peru were not able to prevent the ynca from laying siege to cusco with an army of two hundred thousand men the garrison under ferdinand pizarro though consisting of no more than seventy men yet with their artillery the sallies made with their horse and assisted by the ignorance of the peruvians in carrying on a siege their defense was as successful as it was brave  news was brought to almagro of the dangers to which cusco was exposed and the universal insurrection of the peruvians relinquishing his new conquests he hasted back to preserve his old with great expedition though on his return he suffered as much from drought and heat as in his progress he had endured from cold at his approach the indians raised the siege and he was joyfully received into cusco by ferdinand pizarro and the garrison almost exhausted by the length of the defense  after all these long and laborious marches almagro was extremely fatigued and though it hard that now in the wane of his life he should be driven with infinite toil upon new conquests while pizarro sat down at eas to enjoy alone the fruits of their common labors he resolved to renew his claim t cusco he had now a sort of right to it by having raised the siege and he had a strength sufficient to support that right ferdinand and gonzalo the two brothers of pizarro making some opposition were thrown into prison and their little army either joined him or shared the same fate  pizarro unacquainted with the arrival of almagro or the step he had taken had got together an army for the relief of cusco who were near the town before they found they had an enemy of any other sort than the indians to contend with almagro after having tried in vain to seduce their fidelity engaged and routed them on this advantage his friends represented to him that now was the happy hour of his fortune and that he ought to employ it to establish himself beyond all possibility of being moved that he ought to put the pizarros his prisoners to death and march directly to lima to seize upon his rival who never could be heartily reconciled to him and whilst he remained in possession of the seacoast could never want means of making his enmity terrible almagro had humanity enough to reject the first part of this counsel and weakness enough not to hearken to the last if he marched into anothers government he trembled at the name of a rebel and for fear of the name exposed himself to suffer the punishment of the thing not considering that having once embrued his hands in civil blood he ought never to stop till his end was gained that conquest alone could decide the question of their right and that he who had the greater force would have the best means of protection if he was in the wrong whilst he deliberated what course to take gonzalo pizarro made his escape with an hundred of those who were affected to his cause  it was the interest of pizarro who found himself in no condition to carry on the war yet possessed all the means of being reinforced to keep matters from coming to an extremity as it was almagros to bring them to a speedy issue and in this knowledge of the management of time when to lie by to gain it and when to use the present moment the great skill in business so little understood depends almost entirely pizarro had recourse to the old way of treaty he promised largely he offered a seaport and agreed to submit the decision of all their disputes to the royal audience but as a preliminary he insisted on the release of his brother ferdinand experienced as almagro was in pizarros faith he gave up the only pledge that could secure it the moment gonzalo was released he was put at the head of the reinforcements pizarro had long expected and now received and as he was a man of capacity he prepared to act with vigor the treaty was forgot  the country which held for almagro was separated from that which pizarro possessed by vast mountains passable only in some steep and dangerous defiles almagros counselors advised him by all means to post his troops in such a manner as to oppose his enemies in those passes but so infatuated was he with a false security that he refused to send any troops to occupy those important posts which were seized by the enemy without the least opposition he had however one resource left and that a good one the town of cusco was well fortified had a good garrison and the enemy was ill provided for carrying on the siege but as he had prejudiced his affairs before by dilatory measures he now completely ruined them by precipitation and temerity he turned his back upon the advantages of his situation and resolved contrary to the opinion of all his officers to hazard his fortune in the field confident of his own superiority and full of contempt of the enemy whom he believed to be raw troops but he found too late that they were veterans of great bravery and exact discipline the engagement was warm in which almagro and his troops behaved in such a manner as not to disgrace their former exploits but after a gallant struggle they were in the end entirely defeated almagro himself was taken prisoner and fell at the age of seventythree years a victim to a rashness scarce excuseable in a young soldier but to the last degree blameable in an experienced commander who being supposed to have long established his reputation for courage beyond all doubt ought to model his conduct only by hie own experience and the circumstances of the affair in which he is engaged  pizarro having got the rival who had caused him so many apprehensions into his hands resolved to show him no mercy in spite of almagros age which as it might remove his fears ought to have given room for pity in spite of their common warfare their dangers and triumphs in spite of every sentiment of gratitude for what this unfortunate man had contributed to his greatness and in spite of his late mercy to his brother all which were pathetically and strongly urged by almagro to suffer an old man and a prisoner too after so many fruitless toils to die quietly in his bed pizarro was deaf to every thing but a barbarous policy which made him submit every virtue to the securing the meanest part of his designs almagro was formally tried sentenced and then strangled in prison his body was afterward beheaded publicly on a scaffold and for a long time denied burial a negro slave interred it by stealth amidst the pity which this barbarous execution caused people could not forbear recollecting the unhappy fate of atahualpa and the share which almagro had in it  chap xvi whilst this civil war raged the ynca took a very extraordinary resolution he disbanded his troops and retired to the mountains because says he whilst we are in arms their fear of us will be a means of uniting the spaniards but if we disperse they will certainly destroy each other a resolution this which at first view has something masterly but it is only when viewed in one light when their natural prince is fled the people who must be governed may give the reins of government into the hands of the enemy an army once dispersed is got together again with great difficulty and on the other hand a civil war is by no means a certain destruction to those who are engaged in it and indeed by the reason of the thing and by the event it was an illjudged step the scheme of a barbarous prince who was far from being a consummate politician  it was very ruinous to the peruvians that happening to be divided amongst themselves when the spaniards came in they suffered them to interfere in their parties but it was of yet worse consequence that when the spaniards were afterward divided they interfered themselves in the spanish parties almagro and pizarro had armies of indians by which those people were habituated to obey them and to be interested in their success this joined to the want of any regular plan of defense on the part of their king and commanders subdued that empire to pizarro with small trouble if we consider the greatness of the object but having achieved so great a conquest it only made pizarro acquainted with other great tracts which were rich and might be added to them he followed the tracks of almagro into chili and reduced a considerable part of the country orellana one of his commanders passed the andes and sailed down to the mouth of the river of amazons an immense navigation which discovered a rich and delightful country but as it is mostly flat and therefore not abounding in minerals the spaniards then and ever since neglected it  the death of almagro and the influence it had upon the conduct of pizarro is a striking example how necessary it is for a great man to have an awe upon him from some opposition that may keep his prudence alive and teach him to have a watch upon his passions not content with a territory upwards of eight hundred leagues long and of a prodigious breadth riches such as none of the kings of his country had ever possessed a jurisdiction little less than royal and an absolute security by the extinction of the only person who had any pretensions against him either through a jealousy which often haunts the happiest fortune or through a pride which cannot bear even the appearance of any who had once withstood his power he took a resolution entirely to cut off all that had ever adhered to his rival he did not know when the issue of blood ought to be stopped nor that examples of severity on a few create terror and submission but that threats of general destruction produce nothing but despair and desperate resolutions he was not satisfied with putting many to death but issued a proclamation inhibiting under the same penalty that any person should harbor or even relieve an almagrian with the necessaries of life this party was yet numerous though dispersed and lurking about the country the heads of them finding that pizarro was implacable entered into a conspiracy to murder him they did not want adherents in the city so that they found means of concealing themselves until their plot should be ripe for execution but by some means pizarro discovered their designs and suffered them to know he had discovered them alarmed at this information they saw nothing could happen but death at any side twelve of the chiefs marched into the streets at noonday with their swords drawn crying out long live the king but let the traitor die and crossing the great square of lima made directly to pizarros palace the rest followed in different parties the people being all the while suspended and in that inactive amazement which the execution of a bold and sudden enterprise generally inspires made no opposition the conspirators secured the avenues and pizarro not alarmed until he was surrounded by his enemies fell under their swords after having sold his life dearly  thus died pizarro by an event extremely memorable a great conqueror in the city he had himself built in his own palace  his guards murdered at noon day by  ands of a small number of fugitives the peruvians had the satisfaction to see the second of their conquerors cut off by the same sword that had afflicted themselves  chap xvii when pizarro had fallen in consequence of those cruel and illjudged steps which he took for his security the almagrians elate with their success and growing into a formidable body seized upon the city and proclaimed the natural son of old almagro governor a youth not twenty years of age but of a courage and capacity not absolutely unequal to a charge of such importance undertaken in circumstances so critical but though the almagrians succeeded beyond their hopes by the consternation caused by the suddenness of the attempt and the general dislike to the cruel procedure of pizarro the major part of the spaniards were far from acquiescing in this irregular nomination of a governor a considerable number and those of the best men declared that without interesting themselves in the quarrel of either party they would wait for the emperors determination which they expected hourly and to which alone they were resolved to conform themselves  in this state of things the new governor vaca di castro arrived this man was of a good family and by profession a lawyer but through a more rigid adherence to the strictest ideas of right and justice than is suitable to the coarseness of practice he did not make that figure in his profession to which his great capacity entitled him but what kept him backward at the bar recommended him first to the knowledge and afterward to the esteem of his master the emperor charles the vth who was a man of too much discernment not to be struck with a character so singular as was that of one who was a lawyer without exercising the trade of law and lived at court without being a courtier therefore without any solicitation of his own without any recommendation from a minister or favorite this mans plain unostentatious virtue placed him in an employment of so great a trust when he arrived in the indies he still preserved his character he acted like one who came neither to make friends or a fortune bu solely to do his duty and he showed favor o disapprobation to all in proportion as they performed theirs indian or spaniard was entirely alike to the equality of his justice he flattered nobody he threatened nobody and whilst he lived with all the modesty of a private man he supported all the dignity of a governor  he was hardly landed when young almagro sent him an embassy explaining the reasons of his conduct and proposing terms but castro answered him that he was come under the emperors authority solely to do him and every body justice of which if a good subject he could have no room to complain if a bad one he must prepare to feel it he knew no other terms this was new language to governors in this part of the world who almost forgot they had a superior almagro therefore was resolved to abide the fortune of war rather than submit without such terms as might ensure him the government of his fathers province at least on the other hand castro would hear of no terms between a king and his subjects and therefore set himself at the head of his troops which were composed of those who had refused to obey almagro and gave him battle the victory was on his side but not without a bloody dispute  several of almagros officers in hopes of procuring favor for themselves betrayed his cause in the battle but castro was far from thinking their treachery to their leader could be reckoned a service to the crown and therefore spared none of them in the numerous executions he found it necessary to make on this occasion none of the sufferers was more pitied than almagro who behaved with the utmost gallantry in the engagement as he had done with much humanity and honor upon most occasions he was taken and beheaded  the severity of this procedure whilst it terrified every body drew no odium upon the governor who acted clearly without prejudice or selfinterest they looked on these executions like judgments from heaven which afflict us bitterly but leave no room for murmur or complaint against the hand that inflicts them to the followers of pizarro who valued themselves on their late service and murmured that they were not rewarded better than he thought they deserved he showed little favor he told them he could well distinguish between what was done out of a spirit of party and what proceeded from a principle of loyalty to their sovereign that they might look upon themselves as very happy that he suffered their last action to obliterate the memory of all their others in short he proceeded with such constancy that the spaniards were reduced to an entire subjection and the indians treated by them as fellow subjects and fellow creatures the clergy he made to attend diligently to the duty of their function and to the conversion of the indians rather than to the acquisition of their gold he modelled the administration of justice in the exactest manner he founded several towns and established schools and colleges in them and placed the royal revenues on such a footing that the conquest of peru became immediately a great public advantage which formerly was little more than an object of private plunder but whilst he remained himself poor among some of the richest confiscations that ever were made and whilst he enriched the royal treasury with most prodigious remittances the great men at court received no presents this induced them to get a number of judges appointed whose authority overruled that of castro the end was answered disputes arose the colony was unsettled appeals and complaints innumerable came home and presents from all sides but what answered the present end of the courtiers was near stopping up the spring of bribery for the future in the confusion that arose from such clashing jurisdictions and the schemes of men intent upon their own interests it was not hard for gonzalo the brother of the famous pizarro to avail himself of the general discontent and to set himself at the head of a party  it was now no longer a dispute between governors about the bounds of their jurisdiction gonzalo pizarro only paid a nominal submission to the emperor he strengthened daily and even went so far as to behead a viceroy who was sent to curb him there was a fleet at this time in the southseas and he had address enough to gain the admiral to his interests by which means he was able to overawe the coast of mexico and prevent any force coming against him from that part he even entertained hopes of gaining the spaniards there to join in his revolt the court justly alarmed at this progress having felt the ill effect of sending men who were recommended to their posts by importunity and cabal as they had experienced the beneficial consequences of employing persons whose character only pleaded for them they sent a licentiate in divinity called peter de la gasca a man differing only from castro that he was of a milder and more insinuating behavior but with the same love of justice the same greatness of soul and the same disinterested spirit this mildness of character suited the circumstances of the times as well as the rigid justice of castro did those in which he was appointed for as the revolt was now almost general he could find no friends but such as he should make for though he was invested with the amplest authority from spain he neither carried men to enforce it nor money and the whole success of the expedition rested solely in his own capacity  when he arrived in mexico he declared that his was a peaceable profession that he came not to exercise severities but to heal by gentle measures the effects of those which were formerly exercised he even wrote a very obliging letter to pizarro persuading him to submit and offering him a free pardon for himself and his associates in the mean time he was not wanting in more vigorous measures but by his engaging address and the reputation of his probity raised large sums of money and some hundreds of men pizarro puffed up by his success received the ambassador with great haughtiness and sent his answer which was likewise that of his associates by the admiral which was in effect that neither would he yield up his government nor would they submit to have any other governor the admiral had instructions to try what bribery would do and if that failed to fire the city of panama and bring off the new viceroy prisoner however during their conferences the affair took absolutely another turn and the admiral instead of conveying gasca a prisoner to peru transported him thither with all his forces returning to his allegiance himself and persuading all his adherents to be hearty in the royal cause the viceroy did not at all alter the professions and behavior he had used in mexico but every where proclaiming peace and pardon at the head of a powerful force he drew the cities of lima and cusco from the party of pizarro who finding himself obliged to evacuate the most considerable places of strength with very unequal forces hazarded a battle in which he was made prisoner he was soon after condemned and executed with those who had been the chief instruments of his rebellion  such an ill star governed all those who had a share in the reduction of peru almagro beheaded his son sharing the same fate pizarro murdered in his own palace his brother ferdinand kept a prisoner twentythree years and his other brother gonzalo as we have just seen suffering death as a traitor the new governor having by necessary severities quieted his province took effectual care to heal it is disorders by the arts of peace and to complete what castro had been obliged to leave unfinished he settled the civil government the army and the mines upon such a basis as made the province worth the plunder of future viceroys he carried over two millions to the royal treasury paid all his debts and sat down as poor in spain as he had left it  the reduction of the great empires of peru and mexico makes almost the only thing very much worth insisting upon in the american history a few skirmishes with a savage people and some voyages and discoveries exactly resembling each other changing only the names and situations is the matter which in my opinion unprofitably fills so many volumes and contains very little of either curiosity or instruction however when i come to treat of the several european settlements particularly i shall not omit to mention any thing in their history that contains either the one or the other  end of the first part part ii the manners of the americans chap i the aborigines of america throughout the whole extent of the two vast continents which they inhabit and amongst the infinite number of nations and tribes into which they are divided differ very little from each other in their manners and customs and they all form a very striking picture of the most distant antiquity whoever considers the americans of this day not only studies the manners of a remote present nation but he studies in some measure the antiquities of all nations from which no mean lights may be thrown upon many parts of the ancient authors both sacred and profane the learned lafitau has labored this point with great success in a work which deserves to be read amongst us much more than i find it is  the people of america are tall and strait in their limbs beyond the proportion of most nations their bodies are strong but of a species of strength rather fitted to endure much hardship than to continue long at any servile work by which they are quickly consumed it is the strength of a beast of prey rather than that of a beast of burden their bodies and heads are flattish the effect of art their features are regular but their countenances fierce their hair long black lank and as strong as that of a horse no beards the color of their skin a reddish brown admired amongst them and improved by the constant use of bears fat and paint  when the europeans first came into america they found the people quite naked except those parts which it is common for the most uncultivated people to conceal since that time they have generally a coarse blanket to cover them which they buy from us the whole fashion of their lives is of a piece hardy poor and squalid and their education from their infancy is solely directed to fit their bodies for this mode of life and to form their minds to inflict and to endure the greatest evils their only occupations are hunting and war agriculture is left to the women merchandise they contemn when their hunting season is past which they go through with much patience and in which they exert great ingenuity and their provisions once laid up they pass the rest of their time in an entire indolence they sleep half the day in their huts they loiter and jest among their friends and they observe no bounds or decency in their eating and drinking before we discovered them they wanted spirituous liquors but now the acquirement of these is what gives a spur to their industry and enjoyment to their repose this is the principal end they pursue in their treaties with us and from this they suffer inexpressible calamities for having once begun to drink they can preserve no measure but continue a succession of drunkenness as long as their means of procuring liquor lasts in this condition they lie exposed on the earth to all the inclemency of the seasons which wastes them by a train of the most fatal disorders they perish in rivers and marshes they tumble into the fire they quarrel and very frequently murder each other and in short excess in drinking which with us is rather immoral than very destructive amongst this uncivilized people who have not art enough to guard against the consequence of their vices is a public calamity the few amongst them who live free from this evil enjoy the reward of their temperance in a robust and healthy old age the disorders which a complicated luxury has introduced and supports in europe are strangers here  the character of the indians is striking they are grave even to sadness in their deportment upon any serious occasion observant of those in company respectful to the old of a temper cool and deliberate by which they are never in haste to speak before they have thought well upon the matter and are sure the person who spoke before them has finished all he had to say they have herefore the greatest contempt for the vivacity of the europeans who interrupt each other and frequently speak all together nothing is more edifying than their behavior in their public councils and assemblies every man there is heard in his turn according as his years his wisdom or his services to his country have ranked him not a word not a whisper not a murmur is heard from the rest whilst he speaks no indecent condemnation no illtimed applause the younger sort attend for their instruction here they learn the history of their nation here they are inflamed with the songs of those who celebrate the warlike actions of their ancestors and here they are taught what are the interests of their country and how to pursue them  there is no people amongst whom the laws of hospitality are more sacred or executed with more generosity and good will their houses their provision even their young women are not enough to oblige a guest to those of their own nation they are likewise very humane and beneficent has any one of them succeeded ill in his hunting has his harvest failed or is his house burned he has no other effect of his misfortune than that it gives him an opportunity to experience the benevolence and regard of his fellow citizens who for that purpose have all things almost in common but to the enemies of his country or to those who have privately offended the american is implacable he conceals his sentiments he appears reconciled until by some treachery or surprise he has an opportunity of executing an horrible revenge no length of time is sufficient to allay his resentment no distance of place great enough to protect the object he crosses the steepest mountains he pierces the most impracticable forests and traverses the most hideous bogs and deserts for several hundreds of miles bearing the inclemency of the seasons the fatigue of the expedition the extremes of hunger and thirst with patience and cheerfulness in hopes of surprising his enemy on whom he exercises the most shocking barbarities even to the eating of his flesh to such extremes do the indians push their friendship or their enmity and such indeed in general is the character of all strong and uncultivated minds  notwithstanding this ferocity no people have their anger or at least the show of their anger more under their command from their infancy they are formed with care to endure scoffs taunts blows and every sort of insult patiently or at least with a composed countenance this is one of the principal objects of their education they esteem nothing so unworthy a man of sense and constancy as a peevish temper and a proneness to a sudden and rash anger and this so far has an effect that quarrels happen as rarely amongst them when they are not intoxicated with liquor as does the chief cause of all quarrels hot and abusive language but human nature is such that as virtues may with proper management be engrafted upon almost all sort of vicious passions so vices naturally grow out of the best dispositions and are the consequence of those regulations that produce and strengthen them this is the reason that when the passions of the americans are roused being shut up as it were and converging into a narrow point they become more furious they are dark sullen treacherous and unappeasable  a people who live by hunting who inhabit mean cottages and are given to change the place of their habitation are seldom very religious the americans have scarce any temples we hear indeed of some and those extremely magnificent amongst the ancient mexicans and peruvians but the mexicans and peruvians were comparatively civilized nations those we know at present in any part of america are no way comparable to them some appear to have very little idea of god others entertain better notions they hold the existence of a supreme being eternal and incorruptible who has power over all satisfied with owning this which is traditionary amongst them they give him no sort of worship there are indeed nations in america who seem to pay some religious homage to the sun and moon and as most of them have a notion of some invisible beings who continually intermeddle in their affairs they discourse much of demons nymphs fairies or beings equivalent they have ceremonies too that seem to show they had once a more regular form of religious worship for they make a sort of oblation of their first fruits observe certain ceremonies at the full moon and have in their festivals many things that very probably came from a religious origin though they perform them as things handed down to them from their ancestors without knowing or enquiring about the reason though without religion they abound in superstitions as it is common for those to do whose subsistence depends like theirs upon fortune great observers of omens and dreams and pryers into futurity with great eagerness they abound in diviners augurs and magicians whom they rely much upon in all affairs that concern them whether of health war or hunting their physic which may rather be called magic is entirely in the hands of the priests the sick are naturally prone to superstition and human help in such cases is generally found so weak that it is no wonder that in all countries and ages people have amused themselves in that dismal circumstance of human nature with the hope of supernatural assistance  their physicians generally treat them in whatever disorder in the same way that is they first enclose them in a narrow cabin in the midst of which is a stone red hot on which they throw water until the patient is well soaked with the warm vapor and his own sweat then they hurry him from this bagnio and plunge him suddenly into the next river this is repeated as often as they judge necessary and by this method extraordinary cures are sometimes performed but it frequently happens too that this rude method kills the patient in the very operation especially in the new disorders brought to them from europe and it is partly owing to this manner of proceeding that the small pox has proved so much more fatal to them than to us it must not be denied that they have the use of some specifics of wonderful efficacy the power of which they however attribute to the magical ceremonies with which they are constantly administered  chap ii liberty in it is fullest extent is the darling passion of the americans to this they sacrifice every thing this is what makes a life of uncertainty and want supportable to them and their education is directed in such a manner as to cherish this disposition to the utmost they are indulged in all manner of liberty they are never upon any account chastised with blows they are rarely even chided reason they say will guide their children when they come to the use of it and before that time their faults cannot be very great but blows might abate the free and martial spirit which makes the glory of their people and might render the sense of honor duller by the habit of a slavish motive to action when they are grown up they experience nothing like command dependence or subordination even strong persuasion is industriously forborne by those who have influence amongst them as what may look too like command and appear a sort of violence offered to their will  on the same principle they know no punishment but death they lay no fines because they have no way of exacting them from free men and the death which they sometimes inflict is rather a consequence of a sort of war declared against a public enemy than an act of judicial power executed on a citizen or subject this free disposition is general and though some tribes are found in america with an head whom we call a king his power is rather persuasive than coercive and he is reverenced as a father more than feared as a monarch he has no guards no prisons no officers of justice the other forms which may be considered as a sort of aristocracies have no more power this latter is the more common in north america in some tribes there are a kind of nobility who when they come to years of discretion are entitled to a place and vote in the councils of their nation the rest are excluded but amongst the five nations or iroquois the most celebrated commonwealth of north america and in some other nations there is no other qualification absolutely necessary for their head men but age with experience and ability in their affairs however there is generally in every tribe some particular stocks which they respect and who are considered in some sort as their chiefs unless they show themselves unworthy of that rank as among the tribes themselves there are some who on account of their number or bravery have a preeminence over the rest which as it is not exacted with pride and insolence nor maintained by tyranny on one hand so it is never disputed on the other when it is due  their great council is composed of these heads of tribes and families with such whose capacity has elevated them to the same degree of consideration they meet in a house which they have in each of their towns for the purpose upon every solemn occasion to receive ambassadors to deliver them an answer to sing their traditionary war songs or to commemorate their dead these councils are public here they propose all such matters as concern the state which have already been digested in the secret councils at which none but the head men assist here it is that their orators are employed and display those talents which distinguish them for eloquence and knowledge of public business in both of which some of them are admirable none else speak in their public councils these are their ambassadors and these are the commissioners who are appointed to treat of peace or alliance with other nations the chief skill of these orators consists in giving an artful turn to affairs and in expressing their thoughts in a bold figurative manner much stronger than we could bear in this part of the world and with gestures equally violent but often extremely natural and expressive  when any business of consequence is transacted they appoint a feast upon the occasion of which almost the whole nation partakes there are lesser feasts upon matters of less general concern to which none are invited but they who are engaged in that particular business at these feasts it is against all rule to leave any thing so that if they cannot consume all what remains is thrown into the fire for they look upon fire as a thing sacred and in all probability these feasts were anciently sacrifices before the entertainment is ready the principal person begins a song the subject of which is the fabulous or real history of their nation the remarkable events which have happened and whatever matters may make for their honor or instruction the others sing in their turn they have dances too with which they accompany their songs chiefly of a martial kind and no solemnity or public business is carried on without such songs and dances every thing is transacted amongst them with much ceremony which in a barbarous people is necessary for nothing else could hinder all their affairs from going to confusion besides that the ceremonies contribute to fix all transactions the better in their memory  to help their memory they have bits of small shells or beads of different colors which have all a different meaning according to their color or arrangement at the end of every matter they discourse upon when they treat with a foreign state they deliver one of these belts if they should omit this ceremony what they say passes for nothing these belts are carefully treasured up in each town and they serve for the public records of the nation and to these they occasionally have recourse when any contests happen between them and their neighbors of late as the matter of which these belts is made is grown scarce they often give some skins in the place of the wampum for so they call these beads in their language and receive in return presents of a more valuable nature for neither will they consider what our commissioners say to be of any weight unless some present accompanies each proposal  the same council of their elders which regulates whatever regards the external policy of the state has the charge likewise of it is internal peace and order their suits are few and quickly decided having neither property nor art enough to render them perplexed or tedious criminal matters come before the same jurisdiction when they are so flagrant as to become a national concern in ordinary cases the crime is either revenged or compromised by the parties concerned if a murder is committed the family which has lost a relation prepares to retaliate on that of the offender they often kill the murderer and when this happens the kindred of the last person slain look upon themselves to be as much injured and think themselves as much justified in taking vengeance as if the violence had not begun amongst themselves but in general things are determined in a more amicable manner the offender absents himself his friends send a compliment of condolance to those of the party murdered presents are offered which are rarely refused the head of the family appears who in a formal speech delivers the presents which consist often of above sixty articles every one of which is given to cancel some part of the offense and to assuage the grief of the suffering party with the first he says by this i remove the hatchet from the wound and make it fall out of the hands of him who is prepared to revenge the injury with the second i dry up the blood of that wound and so on in apt figures taking away one by one all the ill consequences of the murder as usual the whole ends in mutual feasting songs and dances if the murder is committed by one of the same family or cabin that cabin has the full right of judgment without appeal within itself either to punish the guilty with death or to pardon him or to force him to give some recompense to the wife or children of the slain all this while the supreme authority of the nation looks on unconcerned and never rouses its strength nor exerts the fullness of a power more revered than felt but upon some signal occasion then the power seems equal to the occasion every one hastens to execute the orders of their senate nor ever was any instance of disloyalty or rebellion known amongst this people governed as they are by manners not by laws example education and the constant practice of their ceremonies gives them the most tender affection for their country and inspires them with most religious regard for their constitution and the customs of their ancestors the want of laws and of an uniform strong coercive power is not perceived in a narrow society where every man has his eye upon his neighbor and where the whole bent of every thing they do is to strengthen those natural ties by which society is principally cemented family love rare amongst us is a national virtue amongst them of which all partake friendships there are amongst them fit to vie with those of fabulous antiquity and where such friendships are seen to grow the families concerned congratulate themselves as upon an acquisition that promises to them a mutual strength and to their nation the greatest honor and advantage  chap iii the loss of any one of their people whether by a natural death or by war is lamented by the whole town he belongs to the towns are small and except the affairs of war or state they have no business to employ them for the greatest part of the year after the hunting season is over  in such circumstances no business is taken in hand however important nor any rejoicing permitted however interesting the occasion until all the pious ceremonies due to the dead are performed these are always performed with the greatest solemnity the dead body is washed anointed and painted so as in some measure to abate the horrors of death then the women lament the loss with the most bitter cries and the most hideous howlings intermixed with songs which celebrate the great actions of the deceased and those of his ancestors the men mourn in a less extravagant manner the whole village attends the body to the grave which is interred habited in their most sumptuous ornaments with the body of the deceased are placed his bow and arrows with what he valued most in his life and provisions for the long journey he is to take for they hold the immortality of the soul universally but their idea is gross feasting attends this as it does every solemnity after the funeral they who are nearly allied to the deceased conceal themselves in their huts for a considerable time to indulge their grief the complimens of condolance are never omitted nor are presents wanting upon this occasion after some time they revisit the grave they renew their sorrow they new cloth the remains of the body and act over again the solemnities of the first funeral  of all their instances of regard to their deceased friends none is so striking as what they call the feast of the dead or the feast of souls the day for this ceremony is appointed in the council of their chiefs who give orders for every thing which may enable them to celebrate it with pomp and magnificence the riches of the nation is exhausted on this occasion and all their ingenuity displayed the neighboring people are invited to partake of the feast and to be witnesses of the solemnity at this time all who have died since the last solemn feast of that kind are taken out of their graves those who have been interred at the greatest distance from the villages are diligently sought for and brought to this great rendevous of carcasses it is not difficult to conceive the horror of this general disinterment i cannot paint it in a more lively manner than it is done by lafitau  without question says he the opening of these tombs display one of the most striking scenes that can be conceived this humbling pourtrait of human misery in so many images of death wherein she seems to take a pleasure to paint herself in a thousand various shapes of horror in the several carcasses according to the degree in which corruption has prevailed over them or the manner in which it has attacked them some appear dry and withered others have a sort of parchment upon their bones some look as if they were baked and smoaked without any appearance of rottenness some are just turning toward the point of putrefaction whilst others are all swarming with worms and drowned in corruption i know not which ought to strike us most the horror of so shocking a sight or the tender piety and affection of these poor people toward their departed friends for nothing deserves our admiration more than that eager diligence and attention with which they discharge this melancholy duty of their tenderness gathering up carefully even the smallest bones handling the carcasses disgustful as they are with every thing loathsome cleansing them from the worms and carrying them upon their shoulders through tiresome journeys of several days without being discouraged by their insupportable stench and without suffering any other emotions to arise than those of regret for having lost persons who were so dear to them in their lives and so lamented in their death  this strange festival is the most magnificent and solemn which they have not only on account of the great concourse of natives and strangers and of the pompous reinterment they give to their dead whom they dress in the finest skins they can get after having exposed them some time in this pomp but for the games of all kinds which they celebrate upon the occasion in the spirit of those which the ancient greeks and romans celebrated upon similar occasions  in this manner do they endeavor to sooth the calamities of life by the honors they pay their dead honors which are the more cheerfully paid because in his turn each man expects to receive them himself though amongst these savage nations this custom is impressed with strong marks of the ferocity of their nature an honor for the dead a tender feeling of their absence and a revival of their memory are some of the most excellent instruments for smoothing our rugged nature into humanity in civilized nations such ceremonies are less practiced because other instruments for the same purposes are less wanted but it is certain a regard for the dead is ancient and universal  though the women in america have generally the laborious part of the economy upon themselves yet they are far from being the slaves they appear and are not at all subject to the great subordination in which they are placed in countries where they seem to be more respected on the contrary all the honors of the nation are on the side of the women they even hold their councils and have their share in all deliberations which concern the state nor are they found inferior to the part they act polygamy is practiced by some nations but it is not general in most they content themselves with one wife but a divorce is admitted and for the same causes that it was allowed amongst the jews greeks and romans no nation of the americans is without a regular marriage in which there are many ceremonies the principal of which is the brides presenting the bridegroom with a plate of their corn  incontinent before wedlock after marriage the chastity of their women is remarkable the punishment of the adulteress as well as that of the adulterer is in the hands of the husband himself and it is often severe as inflicted by one who is at once the party and the judge their marriages are not fruitful seldom producing above two or three children but they are brought forth with less pain than our women suffer upon such occasions and with little consequent weakness probably that severe life which both sexes lead is not favorable to procreation and the habit unmarried women have of procuring abortions in which they rarely fail makes them the more unfit for bearing children afterward this is one of the reasons of the depopulation of america for whatever losses they suffer either by epidemical diseases or by war are repaired slowly  chap iv almost the sole occupation of the american is war or such an exercises as qualies him for it his whole glory consists in this and no man is at all considered until he has increased the strength of his country with a captive or adorned his house with the scalp of one of it is enemies when the ancients resolve upon war they do not always declare what nation it is they are determined to attack that the enemy upon whom they really intend to fall may be off his guard nay they even sometimes let years pass over without committing any act of hostility that the vigilance of all may be unbent by the long continuance of the watch and the uncertainty of the danger in the mean time they are not idle at home the principal captain summons the youth of the town to which he belongs the war kettle is set on the fire the war songs and dances commence the hatchet is sent to all the villages of the same nation and to all its allies the fire catches the war songs are heard in all parts and the most hideous howlings continue without intermission day and night over that whole tract of country the women add their cries to those of the men lamenting those whom they have either lost in war or by a natural death and demanding their places to be supplied from their enemies stimulating the young men by a sense of shame which women know to excite in the strongest manner and can take the best advantage of when excited  when by these and every other means the fury of the nation is raised to the greatest height and all long to embrew their hands in blood the war captain prepares the feast which consists of dogs flesh all that partake of this feast receive little billets which are so many engagements which they take to be faithful to each other and obedient to their commander none are forced to the w but when they have accepted this billet they are looked upon as listed and it is then death to recede all the warriors in this assembly have their faces blackened with charcoal intermixed with dashes and streaks of vermillion which give them a most horrid appearance their hair is dressed up in an odd manner with feathers of various kinds in this assembly which is preparatory to their military expedition the chief begins the war song which having continued for some time he raises his voice to the highest pitch and turning off suddenly to a sort of prayer he addresses himself to the god of war whom they call areskoui i invoke thee says he to be favorable to my enterprise i invoke thy care upon me and my family i invoke ye likewise all ye spirits and demons good and evil all ye that are in the skies or on the earth or under the earth to pour destruction upon our enemies and to return me and my companions safely to our country all the warriors join him in this prayer with shouts and acclamations the captain renews his song strikes his club against the stakes of his cottage and begins the war dance accompanied with the shouts of all his companions which continue as long as he dances  the day appointed for their departure being arrived they take leave of their friends they change their clothes or whatever movables they have in token of mutual friendship their wives and female relations go out before them and attend at some distance from the town the warriors march out all dressed in their finest apparel and most showy ornaments regularly one after another for they never march in rank the chief walks slowly on before them singing the death song whilst the rest observe the most profound silence when they come up to their women they deliver up to them all their finery put on their worst clothes and then proceed as their commander thinks fit  their motives for engaging in a war are rarely those views which excite us to it they have no other end but the glory of the victory or the benefit of the slaves which it enables them to add to their nation or sacrifice to their brutal fury and it is rare that they take any pains to give their wars even a color of justice it is no way uncommon among them for the young men to make feasts of dogs flesh and war dances in small parties in the midst of the most profound peace they fall sometimes on one nation sometimes on another and surprise some of their hunters whom they scalp or bring home as prisoners their senators wink at this or rather encourage it as it tends to keep up the martial spirit of their people inures them to watchfulness and hardship and gives them an early taste for blood  the qualities in an indian war are vigilance and attention to give and to avoid a surprise and patience and strength to endure the intolerable fatigues and hardships which always attend it the nations of america are at an immense distance from each other with a vast desert frontier and hid in the bosom of hideous and almost boundless forests these must be traversed before they meet an enemy who is often at such a distance as might be supposed to prevent either quarrel or danger but notwithstanding the secrecy of the destination of the party that first moves the enemy has frequently notice of it is prepared for the attack and ready to take advantage in the same manner of the least want of vigilance in the aggressors their whole art of war consists in this they never fight in the open field but upon some very extraordinary occasions not from cowardice for they are brave but they despise this method as unworthy an able warrior and as an affair in which fortune governs more than prudence the principal things which help them to find out their enemies are the smoke of their fires which they smell at a distance almost incredible and their tracks in the discovery and distinguishing of which they are possessed of a sagacity equally astonishing for they will tell in the footsteps which to us would seem most confused the number of men that have passed and the length of time since they have passed they even go so far as to distinguish the several nations by the different marks of their feet and to perceive footsteps where we could distinguish nothing less a mind diligently intent upon one thing and exercised by long experience will go lengths at first view scarcely credible  but as they who are attacked have the same knowledge and know how to draw the same advantages from it their great address is to baffle each other in these points on the expedition they light no fire to warm themselves or prepare their victuals but subsist merely on the miserable pittance of some of their meal mixed with water they lie close to the ground all day and march only in the night as they march in their usual order in files he that closes the rear diligently covers his own tracks and those of all who preceded him with leaves if any stream occurs in their rout they march in it for a considerable way to foil their pursuers when they halt to rest and refresh themselves scouts are sent out on every side to reconnoitre the country and beat up every place where they suspect an enemy may lie perdue in this manner they often enter a village whilst the strength of the nation is employed in hunting and massacre all the helpless old men women and children or make prisoners as many as they judge they can manage or have strength enough to be useful to their nation  they often cut off small parties of men in their huntings but when they discover an army of their enemies their way is to throw themselves flat on their faces amongst the withered leaves the color of which their bodies are painted to resemble exactly they generally let a part pass unmolested and then rising a little they take aim for they are excellent marksmen and setting up a most tremendous shout which they call the war cry they pour a storm of musket bullets upon the enemy for they have long since laid aside the use of arrows the party attacked returns the same cry every man in haste covers himself with a tree and returns the fire of the adverse party as soon they raise themselves from the ground to give the second fire  after fighting some time in this manner the party which thinks it has the advantage rushes out of it is cover with small axes in their hands which they dart with great address and dexterity they redouble their cries intimidating their enemies with menaces and encouraging each other with a boastful display of their own brave actions thus being come hand to hand the contest is soon decided and the conquerors satiate their savage fury with the most shocking insults and barbarities to the dead biting their flesh tearing the scalp from their heads and wallowing in their blood like wild beasts  the fate of their prisoners is the most severe of all during the greatest part of their journey homewards they suffer no injury but when they arrive at the territories of the conquering state or at those of their allies the people from every village meet them and think they show their attachment to their friends by their barbarous treatment of the unhappy prisoners so that when they come to their station they are wounded and bruised in a terrible manner the conquerors enter the town in triumph the war captain waits upon the head men and in a low voice gives them a circumstantial account of every particular of the expedition of the damage the enemy has suffered and his own losses in it this done the public orator relates the whole to the people before they yield to the joy which the victory occasions they lament the friends which they have lost in the pursuit of it the parties most nearly concerned are afflicted apparently with a deep and real sorrow but by one of those strange turns of the human mind fashioned to any thing by custom as if they were disciplined in their grief upon the signal for rejoicing in a moment all tears are wiped from their eyes and they rush into an extravagance and phrenzy of joy for their victory  in the mean time the fate of the prisoners remains undecided until the old men meet and determine concerning the distribution it is usual to offer a slave to each house that has lost a friend giving the preference according to the greatness of the loss the person who has taken the captive attends him to the door of the cottage to which he is delivered and with him gives a belt of wampum to show that he has fulfilled the purpose of the expedition in supplying the loss of a citizen they view the present which is made them for some time and according as they think him or her for it is the same proper or improper for the business of the family or as they take a capricious liking or displeasure to the countenance of the victim or in proportion to their natural barbarity or their resentment for their losses they destine concerning him to receive him into the family or sentence him to death if the latter they throw away the belt with indignation then it is no longer in the power of any one to save him the nation is assembled as upon some great solemnity a scaffold is raised and the prisoner tied to the stake instantly he opens his death song and prepares for the ensuing scene of cruelty with the most undaunted courage on the other side they prepare to put it to the utmost proof with every torment which the mind of man ingenious in mischief can invent they begin at the extremities of his body and gradually approach the trunk one plucks out his nails by the roots one by one another takes a finger into his mouth and tears off the flesh with his teeth a third thrusts the finger mangled as it is into the bole of a pipe made red hot which he smoaks like tobacco then they pound his toes and fingers to pieces between two stones they cut circles about his joints and gashes in the fleshy parts of his limbs which they fear immediately with redhot irons cutting and searing alternately they pull off this flesh thus mangled and roasted bit by bit devouring it with greediness and smearing their faces with the blood in an enthusiasm of horror and fury when they have thus torn off the flesh they twist the bare nerves and tenders about an iron tearing and snapping them whilst others are employed in pulling and extending the limbs themselves in every way that can increase the torment this continues often five or six hours together then they frequently unbind him to give a breathing to their fury to think what new torments they shall inflict and to refresh the strength of the sufferer who wearied out with such a variety of unheard of torments often falls immediately into so profound a sleep that they are obliged to apply the fire to awaken him and renew his sufferings  he is again fastened to the stake and again they renew their cruelty they stick him all all over with small matches of a wood that easily takes fire but burns slowly they continually run sharp reeds into every part of his body they drag out his teeth with pincers and thrust out his eyes and lastly after having burned his flesh from the bones with slow fires after having so mangled the body that it is all but one wound after having mutilated his face in such a manner as to carry nothing of human in it after having peeled the skin from the head and poured a heap of redhot coals or boiling water on the naked skull they once more unbind the wretch who blind and staggering with pain and weakness assaulted and pelted upon every side with clubs and stones now up now down falling into their fires at every step runs hither and thither until some of the chiefs whether out of compassion or weary of cruelty puts an end to his life with a club or a dagger the body is then put into the kettle and this barbarous employment is succeeded by a feast as barbarous  the women forgetting the human as well as the female nature and transformed into something worse than furies act their parts and even outdo the men in this scene of horror the principal persons of the country sit round the stake smoking and looking on without the least emotion what is most extraordinary the sufferer himself in the little intervals of his torments smoaks too appears unconcerned and converses with his torturers about indifferent matters indeed during the whole time of his execution there seems a contest between him and them which shall exceed they in inflicting the most horrid pains or he in enduring them with a firmness and constancy almost above human not a groan not a sigh not a distortion of countenance escapes him he possesses his mind entirely in the midst of his torments he recounts his own exploits he informs them what cruelties he has inflicted upon their countrymen and threatens them with the revenge that will attend his death and though his reproaches exasperate them to a perfect madness of rage and fury he continues his reproaches even of their ignorance in the art of tormenting pointing out himself more exquisite methods and more sensible parts of the body to be afflicted the women have this part of courage as well as the men and it is as rare for any indian to behave otherwise as it would be for an european to suffer as an indian  i do not dwell upon these circumstances of cruelty which so degrade human nature out of choice but as all who mention the customs of this people have insisted upon their behavior in this respect very particularly and as it seems necessary to give a true idea of their character i did not choose to omit it it serves to show too in the strongest light to what an inconceiveable degree of barbarity the passions of men let loose will carry them it will point out to us the advantages of a religion that teaches a compassion to our enemies which is neither known nor practiced in other religions and it will make us more sensible than some appear to be of the value of commerce the arts of a civilized life and the lights of literature which if they have abated the force of some of the natural virtues by the luxury which attends them have taken out likewise the sting of our natural vices and softened the ferocity of the human race without enervating their courage  on the other hand the constancy of the sufferers in this terrible scene shows the wonderful power of an early institution and a ferocious thirst of glory which makes men imitate and exceed what philosophy or even religion can effect  the prisoners who have the happiness to please those to whom they are offered have a fortune altogether opposite to that of those who are condemned they are adopted into the family they are accepted in the place of the father son or husband that is lost and they have no other mark of their captivity but that they are not suffered to return to their own nation to attempt this would be certain death the principal purpose of the war is to recruit in this manner for which reason a general who loses many of his men though he should conquer is little better than disgraced at home because the end of the war was not answered they are therefore extremely careful of their men and never choose to attack but with a very undoubted superiority either in number or situation  the scalps which they value so much are the trophies of their bravery with these they adorn their houses which are esteemed in proportion as this sort of spoils is more numerous they have solemn days appointed upon which the young men gain a new name or title of honor from their headmen and these titles are given according to the qualities of the person and his performances of which these scalps are the evidence this is all the reward they receive for the dangers of the war and the fatigues of many campaigns severe almost beyond credit they think it abundantly sufficient to have a name given by their governors men of merit themselves and judges of it a name respected by their countrymen and terrible to their enemies there are many other things fit to engage the curiosity and even afford matter of instructive reflection in the manners of this barbarous people but these seem to be the most striking and fittest to be insisted on in a work which is to give a general idea of america the present settlements their commerce and productions ought to be allowed their proper room in which i propose to treat first of the spanish colonies as the first discovered and largest object and that in which the rest of europe though excluded is the most concerned the portuguese as nearest in place and rank shall be second the french shall next be considered the english shall be reserved to the last as the most important to ourselves  part iii spanish america chap i having described with as much conciseness as the subject would bear the manners of the original inhabitants of america as we had before that related the most remarkable adventures of it is discoverers and conquerors it will be necessary to view more minutely what and how advantageous a country these conquests and discoveries have added to the world and what are the views interests and characters of those who at present possess the greatest part of that extensive region  america extends from the north pole to the fiftyseventh degree of south latitude it is upwards of eight thousand miles in length it sees both hemispheres it has two summers and a double winter it enjoys all the variety of climates which the earth affords it is washed by the two greatest oceans to the eastward it has the atlantic ocean which divides it from europe and africa to the west it has another ocean the great south sea by which it is disjoined from asia by these seas it may and does carry on a direct commerce with the other three parts of world it is composed of two vast continents one on the north the other upon the south which are joined by the great kingdom of mexico which forms a sort of isthmus fifteen hundred miles long and in one part at darien so extremely narrow as to make the communication between the two oceans by no means difficult in the great gulf which is formed between this isthmus and the northern and southern continents lie an infinite multitude of islands many of them large and most of them fertile and capable of being cultivated to very great advantage  america in general is not a mountainous country yet it has the greatest mountains in the world the andes or cordilleras run from north to south along the coast of the pacific ocean though for the most part within the torrid zone they are perpetually covered with snow and in their bowels contain inexhaustible treasures in the province of st martha in south america are likewise very great mountains which communicate with the former in north america we know of none considerable but that long ridge which lies to the back of our settlements which we call the apalachian or allegeney mountains if that may be at all considered as a mountain which upon one side indeed has a very great declivity but upon the other is nearly on a level with the rest of the country for the greater part  without comparison america is that part of the world which is the best watered and that not only for the support of life but for the convenience of trade and the intercourse of each part with the others in north america the great river missisippi rising from unknown sources runs an immense course from north to south and receives the vast tribute of the ohio the ouabache and other immense rivers not to be postponed to the rhine or the danube navigable almost to their very sources and laying open the inmost recesses of this continent near the heads of these are five great lakes or rather seas of fresh water communicating with each other and all communicating with the ocean by the river st laurence which passes through them these afford such an inlet for commerce as must produce the greatest advantages whenever the country adjacent shall come to be fully inhabited and by an industrious and civilized people the eastern side of north america which is our portion besides the noble rivers hudson delaware susquehanna patowmack supplies several others of great depth length and commodious navigation many parts of our settlements are so intersected with navigable rivers and creeks that the planters may be said without exaggeration to have each a harbor at his own door  south america is if possible in this respect even more fortunate it supplies much the two largest rivers in the world the river of amazons and the rio de la plata the first rising in peru not far from the south sea passes from west to east almost quite through the continent of south america navigable for some sort or other of vessels all the way and receiving into it is bosom a prodigious number of rivers all navigable in the same manner and so great that monsieur condamine found it often almost impossible to determine which was the main channel the rio de la plata rising in the heart of the country shapes it is course to the southeast and pours such an immense flood into the sea that it makes it taste fresh a great many leagues from the shore to say nothing of the oronoquo which might rank the foremost amongst any but the american rivers the soil and products in such a variety of climates cannot satisfactorily be treated of in a general description we shall in their places consider them particularly  all america is in the hands of four nations the spaniards who as they first discovered it have the largest and richest share all that part of north america which composes the isthmus of mexico and what lies beyond that toward the river missisippi on the east the pacific ocean to the west and northwest and they possess all south america excepting brasil which lies between the mouth of the river of amazons and that of plata along the atlantic ocean this belongs to portugal that part of north america which the spaniards have not is divided between the english and french the english have all the countries which incircle hudsons bay and thence in a line all along the eastern shore to the thirtieth degree of north latitude france claims the country which lies between this and the spanish settlements to the west and secures an intercourse with them by the mouths of the missisippi the mobile and of the river st laurence which are the only avenues of navigation to this very extensive country the multitude of islands which lie between the two continents are divided amongst the spaniards french and english the dutch possess three or four small islands which in any other hands would be of no consequence the danes have one or two but they hardly deserve to be named amongst the proprietors of america  chap ii the order which i intend to observe in treating of the spanish colonies is after having set forth their situation their climate and the nature of their soil to describe those commodities in which they trade to give a clear and concise account of their method of manufacturing them and then to lay open the manner of their dealing in them as well as that by which they carry on their foreign commerce last of all i shall say something of the genius and temper of the inhabitants of such customs of theirs as are remarkable and of their civil policy and of their military so far as they are come to my knowledge or as they are worthy the attention of the reader the exact division of the provinces the courses of the rivers the distances of places the exact dimensions of harbors and their soundings all these as they are infinitely better known from maps and charts so it would be impertinent and tedious to fill up this short work with them which proposes to give even short as it is a description of every thing that may tend to a just notion of america and therefore cannot sacrifice matters of more moment to the description of things of which a far better idea may be acquired by other means to those whom they concern and to those whom they do not interest who are by far the majority must be tedious and uninstructive  the first country which the spaniards settled upon the continent of america was mexico and it still continues their principal settlement whether we consider it is number of inhabitants it is natural wealth or it is extended traffic as it lies for the most part within the torrid zone it is excessively hot and on the eastern coast where the land is low marshy and constantly flooded in the rainy seasons it is likewise extremely unwholesome neither is that coast pleasant in any respect encumbered for the most part with almost impenetrable woods of mangrove trees of a bare and disagreeable aspect and which extend into the water for a considerable way the inland country assumes a more agreeable aspect and the air is of a better temperament here the tropical fruits grow in great abundance the land is of a good variety and would not refuse any sort of grain if the number or industry of the inhabitants were any way proportioned to the goodness of the soil but on the western side the land is not so low as on the eastern much better in quality and full of plantations  it is probable the spaniards choose to leave the eastern coast in it is present state of rudeness and desolation judging that a rugged and unwholesome frontier is a better defense against an european enemy than fortifications and armies to be maintained at a vast expense or than the strength of the inhabitants made by the climate effeminate and pusillanimous and kept so by policy and indeed it would be next to impossible to make any considerable establishment on that coast that could effectually answer the purposes of any power in europe without struggling with the greatest difficulties and as for a sudden invasion the nature of the country itself is a good fortification in general few countries under the same aspect of the heavens enjoy more of the benefits of nature and the necessaries of life but like all the tropical countries it rather is more abundant in fruits than in grain pine apples pomegranates oranges lemons citrons figs and cocoa nuts are here in the greatest plenty and perfection vines and apples require temperate climates  the number of their horned cattle is in a manner infinite some private persons are said to have possessed forty thousand head many are wild and a very considerable trade is driven in their hides and tallow but the extreme heat prevents their turning the flesh to any account in commerce swine are equally numerous and their lard is much in request all over this country where it is used instead of butter sheep are numerous in mexico but i do not find that wool is an article of any great consideration in their trade nor is it probable that it is of a good kind as it is scarce ever found useful between the tropicks where it is hairy and short except only in peru and that is the produce of sheep of a species very different from that in the rest of america as peru is itself remarkably different in climate from all other countries under the torrid zone but cotton is here very good and in great plenty it is manufactured largely for as it is a light wear suitable to the climate and all other clothing being extravagantly dear it is the general wear of the inhabitants the woollens and linens of europe being rather luxuries and worn only by persons of some condition some provinces produce silk but not in that abundance or perfection to make a remarkable part of their export not but that the country is very fit for that and many other things valuable which are but little cultivated for the gold and silver which makes the glory of this country and in the abundant treasures of which it exceeds all the world engages almost the whole attention of the inhabitants as it is almost the only thing for which the spaniards value their colonies and what alone receives the encouragement of the court therefore i shall insist most largely upon these articles after that i shall speak of those commodities which are produced here of most importance in foreign commerce and rest upon them in proportion to their importance these are cochineal indigo and cacao of which chocolate is made as for sugar and tobacco and indigo though no part of the world produces better than mexico and as for logwood though it be in a manner peculiar to this country yet as the first is largely raised and manufactured elsewhere and as our own commerce in the two last is what chiefly interests an english reader i shall reserve them to be treated of in the division i allot to the english colonies  chap iii it is not known with certainty whether all or some provinces only of new spain produce mines of gold and silver it is however allowed that the chief mines of gold are in veragua and new granada confining upon darien and terra firma those of silver which are much more rich as well as numerous are found in several parts but in none so much as in the province of mexico but all the mines whether of gold or silver are always found in the mountainous and barren parts nature often making amends one way for her failures in another  gold is found either in the sand of rivers native and in small grains or it is dug out of the earth in the same condition in small bits almost wholly metallic and of a tolerable purity or it is found like the ore of other metals in an aggregate opaque mass in a mixture of earth stone sulphur and other metals in this state it is of all colors red white blackish and making little or no ostentation of the riches it contains sometimes it forms part of the ornament of some beautiful stones which are of various lively colors intersected with filaments of this metal quite native lapis lazuli is one of these which has always some small portions of gold but this golden streaking is often extremely fallacious and has betrayed many into ruinous expenses for in several stones these fine veins have been nothing more than marcasite but such marcasites or firestones are found in mines which contain real gold but gold howsoever found whether native or in what is called the ore is seldom or never without a mixture of other metals generally silver or copper  the gold mines though they contain the richest of all metals it is remarkable most frequently disappoint the hopes and ruin the fortunes of those who engage in them though neither the laboring of the mine nor the purifying the metal is attended with such an expense as what those are obliged to who work mines of the inferior metals for the vein is of all others the most unequal sometimes very large full and rich then it often decays by a quick gradation and is sometimes suddenly lost but the ends of the veins are on the other hand often extremely rich they are called the purse of the vein and when the miner is so happy as to light on one of these purses his fortune is made immediately  when the ore is dug out the most usual method is to break it to pieces in a mill exactly resembling those large ones we use for grinding apples wherein a millstone set on end is made to turn in a circular channel of stone when the ore is thus broke and the gold somewhat separated from the impure mass they add to the whole a quantity of quicksilver quicksilver has of all other bodies the greatest attraction with gold which therefore immediately breaks the links which held it to the former earth and clings close to this congenial substance then a rapid stream of water is let into the channel which scouring away through a hole made for the purpose the lighter earth by the briskness of it is current leaves the gold and mercury precipitated by it is weight at the bottom this amalgama or paste is put into a linen cloth and squeezed so as to make the quicksilver separate and run out to complete this separation it is necessary to fuse the metal and then all the mercury flies off in fumes  but in many parts of spanish america another way of getting and purifying gold is practiced when by sure tokens they know that gold lies in the bed of a rivulet they turn the current into the inward angles which time and the stream have formed whilst this runs they dig and turn up the earth to make it the more easily dissolved and carried off when the surface is thus completely washed away and they are come to a sort of stiff earth which is the receptacle of gold they return the stream into it is former channel and dig up the earth as they find it which they carry to a little basin somewhat in the form of a smiths bellows into this they turn a small but lively stream to carry off the foreign matter whilst they facilitate the operation by stirring the mass with an iron hook which dissolves the earth and gathers up the stones which are carefully thrown out that they may not interrupt the passages that carry off the earth by this means the gold loosened from the gross matter which adhered to it falls to the bottom but mixed so intimately with a black heavy sand that none of the gold can be perceived unless it happens to be a pretty large grain to separate it from this sand it is put into a sort of wooden platter with a little hollow of about the depth of half an inch at bottom this platter they fill with water and turning the mass about briskly with their hands for some time the sand passes over the edges and leaves the gold in small grains pure and of it is genuine color in the hollow at the bottom thus is gold refined without fire or mercury merely by washing the places where this is performed are called therefore lavaderos by the spaniards there are many more methods of extracting and purifying this precious metal but these are the most common ways used by spaniards in their indies  silver is the metal next in rank but first in consequence in the spanish traffic as their mines yield a much greater quantity of the latter than of the former it is found in the earth under different forms as indeed the ore of all metals is such is the diversity of ores in this respect that nothing but a long experience in this particular branch can exactly ascertain the species of the metal which almost any ore contains at first view i have seen specimens wherein the silver almost pure twined itself about a white stone penetrating into the interstices in the same manner that the roots of trees enter into the rocks and twist themselves about them some are of an ashcolored appearance others spotted of a red and blue some of changeable colors and many almost black affecting somewhat of a pointed regular form like crystals i cannot find that it is ever found in grains or sand native as gold is  the manner of refining silver does not differ essentially from the process which is employed for gold they are both purified upon the same principle by clearing away as much of the earth as can be with water by uniting or amalgamating it with mercury and afterward by clearing off the mercury itself by straining and evaporation but the management of silver in this respect is much more difficult than that of gold because this metal is much more intimately united with the foreign matters with which it is found in the mine and it is attraction with mercury is much weaker therefore there is great care taken in the amalgamation and it is a long time before they are perfectly mixed a quantity of sea salt is likewise added no silver is had by mere washing  the chemists have talked very freely of the production of these and other metals in the earth of the salt sulphur and mercury that compose them and the manner in which these substances are united and changed so as to form metals and minerals of every species some have recourse to the sun as the great agent in this process especially in gold and silver as the most worthy such an operator others call in the aid of subterraneous fires and central heat but in reality they have advanced very little that is satisfactory upon this subject they have never by any method of joining the matters which they have assigned as the constituent parts of metals in any proportions whatsoever nor by any degrees of their great agent fire been able to make metal of that which was not metal before neither have they found what they allot as the component parts of all metals in such a manner in all as to enable them to fix any common principle for their generation some they cannot analyze by any art as gold they indeed define it a composition of a very subtle mercury and a sulphur as subtle  but how this comes to be known when no process hitherto discovered has been able to extract either of these from gold they who have advanced such things ought to tell it is reasonable to believe that there is some plastic principle in nature perhaps something analagous to the seminal principle in plants and animals whatever that is which does not as we know resemble any known body nor is composed of any combination of known bodies but powerful of itself to combine and vary such a part of the common stock of matter as it is fitted to operate upon which it draws to itself and causes to form an animal or a plant or a mineral or metal of this or that nature according to the original nature of the seed suppose a plant subjected to all the torture of the chemical question you find it contains various matters an earth water oil salt spirit and in the three last perhaps something specific and differing from other plants but neither the same quantities of similar matter nor these very matters themselves can ever come to form a plant like the original or any thing like a plant at all because the seminal virtue is wanting nor is it perhaps discoverable and as for the other matters they are the inert parts of the plant without power themselves they are the materials with which and on which the seminal virtue acts to organize the mass to spread the branches to shoot out the gems to mature the fruit and in short to perform all the functions of a complete plant the same may be said of animals and why not of minerals though of a less nice organization why should they not have the seminal principle too which operating by it is own power and in a way of it is own upon the elements of air earth water oil and salt is capable of producing iron copper gold silver and other metals the want of this will always hinder us from being able to produce any metal from other than metalline ingredients though we should take such things as resemble the ingredients they yield upon an analysis and in the same quantities in which we find them this i do not say as favoring the notion that stones and metals vegetate exactly like plants that these are often found where they had formerly been exhausted and that they are known to extend their dimensions is pretty certain but that they assimilate the heterogeneous matter which increases their bulk in a manner analagous to plants i cannot venture to propose it must be allowed that silver has been found and i have so seen it extending itself among the interstices of stones not unlike ivy and other parasite plants yet as a metal no way differing from it or at all inferior is extracted from ores which have an appearance altogether different and which too is the usual way it is probable the manner in which they grow is not the same  what i had to say of gold and silver as both are had and the latter in vast quantities in mexico i thought it proper for the sake of avoiding repetitions to bring them under that head though all the rest of the spanish territories produce largely of both  of the plenty of gold and silver which the mines of mexico afford great things have been said and with justice as this with the other spanish colonies in america in a manner furnish the whole world with silver and bear a great proportion in gold to the whole of what the world produces a late very judicious collector of voyages says that the revenues of mexico can hardly fall short of twentyfour millions of our money he founds this upon a return made by the bishops of their tenths which without doubt were not overrated and that these amounted to one million and a half sterling that these are about a fourth of the revenues of the clergy and that the estates of the clergy are about the fourth part of the whole revenues of the kingdom which at this rate amount to twentyfour millions english he takes another method of computing the wealth of this province which is by the fifth paid to the king of the gold and silver dug out of their mines this he observes in the year    0 amounted to one million of marks in silver each mark equivalent to eight ounces so that if we compute this silver at five shillings per ounce then the inhabitants receive from their mines ten millions in money for my part i neither distrust the candor or good sense of this writer but i can hardly avoid thinking he must be misinformed in the accounts upon which he has built his calculation if new spain draws from her silver and gold mines ten millions annually peru even since the decline of the mines of potosi has scarce ever been thought less rich in silver than mexico and must therefore be rated at the same proportion and allowed to yield ten millions more annually new mexico abounds likewise in very rich silver mines but that we may not exceed we will allow for this province but two millions which allowing for the large produce of new spain is certainly not above the proportion chili has indeed no considerable mines of silver but then those of gold are by far the richest in the world and taking the comparative wealth of this province with the others it cannot be less than two millions if we add to it what is produced in terra firma so that the gold and silver raised in the spanish colonies cannot be estimated at less than twentyfour millions yearly uztariz in his celebrated discourse on the spanish commerce an author who was undoubtedly well informed and in an argument where it answered his purpose to make the most of this importation does not allow that more than fifteen millions of dollars are brought into spain annually in gold and silver this is considerably less than four millions sterling but because we ought to allow for concealments which to be sure are considerable we will state it at four millions the acapulco trade we will admit carries off one million more though this is rather over there is another vent too the contraband trade with the english french and dutch which draws away largely but i suppose two millions will be thought largely allowed now the whole of this does not exceed seven millions annually carried out of the country and there remains a clear sum of seventeen millions after all deductions if this be the case must not the wealth of spanish america in a little time accumulate to a degree far exceeding the bounds of all probability since    0 when this observation was made twentysix years are now passed and we have no reason to believe the mines are at all exhausted in that time and if in any year since      when uztariz wrote more plate has passed into europe than was brought at that time it is reasonable to believe it is because the mines have produced more largely now if we multiply the annual sum remaining coined and uncoined in spanish america which is seventeen millions by twentysix the number of years since the calculation was made it will produce four hundred and fortytwo millions accumulated in twentysix years but looking a little backward at this rate of annual saving see what the produce must have been since the beginning of the last century when the mines yielded as plentifully as they do now in general and some much more plentifully it must be from the year   00 to this day not less than two thousand six hundred and fiftytwo millions english money amassed and hoarded up within the spanish colonies besides the savings of the foregoing century which must be far from inconsiderable make almost any abatements in this allow that the churches are enriched to a degree of profuseness as they are allow that the private houses have the meanest utensils of gold and silver as it is said in some places they have allow for the wear which even in these metals is not little allow all this and yet after all it must very far exceed belief that any riches like these or bearing any proportion to these are to be found in spanish america where the majority of the people are slaves or indians in a state next to slavery and even where the spaniards have comparatively but few rich amongst them most who make their fortunes hastening to europe to enjoy them after all we have i fear no certain way of estimating the immense treasures of which this country is an inexhaustible fountain great they are undoubtedly though by no means so great as is represented  chap iv cochineal the next commodity for value which they export is used in dying all the several kinds of the finest scarlet crimson and purple after much dispute about the nature of this curious drug it seems at last agreed that it is of the animal kind an insect of the species of the gall insects this animal is found adhering to various plants but there is only one which communicates to it the qualities which make it valuable in medicine and manufactures this plant is called opuntia by the botanists it consists wholly of thick succulent oval leaves joined end to end and spreading out on the sides in various ramifications the flower is large and the fruit in shape resembling a fig this is full of a crimson juice and to this juice it is that the cochineal insect owes it is color  when the rainy seasons come on they who cultivate this plant cut off those heads which abound most with such insects as are not yet at their full growth and preserve them very carefully from the weather and all other injuries these branches though separated from their parent stocks preserve their freshness and juices a long time and this enables the insect not only to live out the rains but to grow to its full size and be in readiness to bring forth it is young as soon as the inclemency of the season is over when this time comes on they are brought out and placed upon the proper plants disposed in little nests of some mossy substance as soon as they feel the enlivening influence of the fresh air they bring forth in three or four days from their exposure at farthest the young scarce bigger than a mite runs about with a wonderful celerity and the whole plantation is immediately peopled yet what is somewhat singular this animal so lively in it is infancy quickly loses all it is activity and attaching itself to some of the least exposed and most succulent part of the leaf it clings there for life without ever moving not wounding the leaf for it is sustenance but sucking with a proboscis with which it is furnished for this purpose  what is not less remarkable than the way of life of this animal is the nature of the male which has no appearance of belonging to the same species far from being fixed to a spot he has wings and is like the butterfly continually in motion they are smaller than the cochineal and constantly seen amongst them and walking over them without being suspected by those who take care of the insect of being a creature of the same kind though they believe that the cochineals are impregnated by them but it is the female cochineal only which is gathered for use  they make four gatherings a year which are so many generations of this animal when they are sufficiently careful they brush off the insects one by one with a sort of hair pencils and take them as they fall but they often brush the whole plant in a careless manner so that fragments of it are mixed with the cochineals and themselves mixed the old and young together which carelessness abates much of the value but what chiefly makes the goodness of this commodity is the manner of killing and drying the cochineals which is performed three ways the first is by dipping the basket in which it is gathered into boiling water and afterward drying them in the sun this the spaniards call renegrida the second method is by drying them in ovens made for the purpose this from it is gray color veined with purple is called jaspeade the third manner is when the indians dry them on their cakes of maize which are baked upon flat stones this last is the worst kind as it is generally overbaked and something burned they call it negra  this drug has a very uncommon good quality and the more extraordinary as it belongs to the animal kingdom and to the most perishable of that kind that it never decays without any other care than having been put by in a box some have been known to keep sixty some even upwards of a hundred years and as fit for the purposes of medicine or manufacture as it ever was it is used in medicine as a cordial and sudorific in which intentions few things answer better and indeed as it answers such good purposes in medicine is so essential in trade and produced only in this country it may be considered in all markets as equivalent to gold or silver by the certainty and quickness of the sale it is computed they annually export no less than nine hundred thousand pound weight of this commodity  the cocao or cacao of which chocolate is made is a considerable article in the natural history and commerce of new spain it grows upon a tree of a middling size the wood is spungy and porous the bark smooth and of a cinnamon color the flower grows in bunches between the stalk and the wood of the form of roses but small and without any scent the fruit is a sort of pod which contains the cacao much about the size and shape of a cucumber within there is a pulp of a most refreshing acid taste which fills up the interstices between the nuts before they are ripe but when they fully ripen these nuts are packed up wonderfully close and in a most regular and elegant order they have a pretty tough shell and within is the oily rich substance of which chocolate is made this fruit grows differently from our european fruits which always hang upon the small branches but this grows along the body of the great ones principally at the joints none are found upon the small which though it is a manner of vegetation unknown here prevails in several other plants within the tropicks this cacao is a very tender tree equally impatient of the wind heat or cold and will flourish only in the shade for which reason in the cacao walks they always plant a palm tree for every one of cacao i need say little of the use of this fruit it is general amongst ourselves and it is virtues well known but however great the external call for it may be the internal consumption is much greater so that in mexico and terra firma in some provinces of which latter it is found in the greatest perfection their foreign and domestic commerce in this article is immense and the profits so great that a small garden of the cacaos is said to produce twenty thousand crowns a year though i believe this to be exaggerated it shows however in what a light of profit this comodity is considered at home it makes the principal part of their diet and is found wholesome nutritious and suitable to the climate this fruit is often confounded with the cocoa nut which is a species wholly different  chap v the trade of mexico may be considered as consisting of three great branches by which it communicates with the whole world the trade with europe by la vera cruz the trade with the east indies by acapulco and the commerce of the south sea by the same port the places in new spain which can interest a stranger are therefore three only la vera cruz acapulco and mexico  mexico the capital of the kingdom the residence of the viceroy the seat of the first audience or chamber of justice and an archbishopric is certainly one of the richest and most splendid cities not only in america but in the whole world though no seaport town nor communicating with the sea by any navigable river it has a prodigious commerce and is itself the center of all that is carried on between america and europe on one hand and between america and the east indies on the other for here the principal merchants reside the greatest part of the business is negociated and the goods that pass from acapulco to la vera cruz or from la vera cruz to acapulco for the use of the philippines and in a great measure for the use of peru and lima all pass through this city and employ an incredible number of horses and mules in the carriage hither all the gold and silver comes to be coined here the kings fifth is deposited and here is wrought all that immense quantity of utensils and ornaments in plate which is every year sent into europe every thing here has the greatest air of magnificence and wealth the shops glitter upon all sides with the exposure of gold silver and jewels and surprise yet more by the work of the imagination upon the treasures which fill great chests piled up to the ceilings whilst they wait the time of being sent to old spain it is said that the negro wenches who run by the coaches of the ladies there wear bracelets of gold pearl necklaces and jewels in their ears whilst the black footboys are all over covered with lace and embroidery it cannot exactly be ascertained what number of people are in this city it is certainly very considerable by many not made less than seventy or eighty thousand this city itself is well and regularly built though the houses are not lofty the monasteries are numerous and richly endowed and the churches extravagantly rich in their ornaments though comparatively poor in the taste of their architecture  the port nearest to this city is acapulco upon the south sea upwards of two hundred miles distant from the capital acapulco itself has one of the deepest securest and most commodious harbors in the south sea and indeed almost the only one which is good upon the western coast of new spain the entrance of the harbor is defended by a castle of tolerable strength the town itself is but ill built and makes every way a miserable figure except at the time of the fairs when it entirely changes it is appearance and becomes one of the most considerable marts in the world about the month of december the great galleon which makes the whole communication that is between america and the philippines after a voyage of five months and sailing three thousand leagues without seeing any other land than the little ladrones arrives here loaded with all the rich commodities of the east cloves pepper cinnamon nutmegs mace china japan wares callicoes plain and painted chints muslins of every sort silks precious stones rich drugs and gold dust at the same time the annual ship from lima comes in and is not computed to bring less than two millions of pieces of eight in silver besides quicksilver cacao drugs and other valuable commodities to be laid out in the purchase of the commodities of the east indies several other ships from different parts of chili and peru meet upon the same occasion and besides the traffic for the philippine commodities this causes a very large dealing for every thing those countries have to exchange with one another as well as for the purchase of all sorts of european goods the fair lasts sometimes for thirty days as soon as the goods are disposed of the galleon prepares to set out on her voyage to the philippines with her returns chiefly in silver but with some european goods too and some other commodities of america i speak here as though there were but one vessel on the trade with the philippines and in fact there is only nominally one trading vessel the galleon itself of about twelve hundred tuns but another attends her commonly as a sort of convoy which generally carries such a quantity of goods as pretty much disables her from performing that office the galleon has often above a thousand people on board either interested in the cargo or merely passengers and there is no trade in which so large profits are made the captain of the vessel the pilots their mates and even the common sailors making in one voyage what in their several ranks may be considered as easy fortunes it is said by the writer of lord ansons voyage that the jesuits have the profits of this ship to support their missions and if so their gains must be extremely great and must add much to the consequence of a society which has as great a reputation for it is riches as it is wisdom  this commerce to so vast a value though carried on directly between the king of spains own dominions enriches them in proportion but very little the far greater part of every thing that comes from the philippines being the produce or the fabric of other countries the spaniards add none of the artificial value of labor to any thing the chinese are largely interested in this cargo and it is to them they are indebted for the manufacturing such of their plate as is wrought into any better fashion than rude ingots or inelegant coins when this fair is over the town is comparatively deserted however it remains for the whole year the most considerable port in mexico for the trade with peru and chili which is not very great the east india goods brought here are carried on mules to mexico from whence what exceeds their own consumption is sent by land carriage to la vera cruz to pass over to terra firma to the islands and some even to old spain though in no great quantity  from the port of la vera cruz it is that the great wealth of mexico is poured out upon all the old world and it is from this port alone that they receive the numberless luxuries and necessaries that the old world yields them in return to this port the annual fleet from cadiz called the flota arrives about the latter end of november after a passage of nine weeks this fleet which sails only from cadiz consists of about three men of war as a convoy and fourteen or fifteen large merchant ships from four hundred to one thousand tuns burden they are loaded almost with every sort of goods which europe produces for export all sorts of woollens linens silks velvets laces glass paper cutlery all sorts of wrought iron watches clocks quicksilver horse furniture shoes stockings books pictures military stores wines and fruits so that all the trading parts of europe are highly interested in the cargo of this fleet spain itself sends out little more than the wine and fruit this with the freight and commissions to the merchant and the duty to the king is almost all the advanvantage which that kingdom derives from her commerce with the indies it is strictly prohibited to load any commodities on board this fleet without entering the goods the value and the owners name in the india house at seville and when they return they must bring a certificate from the proper officer there that the goods were duly landed and in the proper port they are not permitted to break bulk upon any account until they arrive at la vera cruz nor are they suffered to take in any other than spanish passengers nor them without a license first obtained at the india house  jealousy is the glaring character of the court of spain in whatever regards their american empire and they often sacrifice the prosperity to an excessive regard to the security of their possessions they attend in this trade principally to two objects the exclusion of all strangers from any share in it and the keeping up the market for such goods as they send and they think both these ends best answered by sending out only one annual fleet and that from one only port in spain and to one port only in mexico these views which would be impolitic in any power in europe besides are judicious enough in spain because the goods they send belonging mostly to strangers and the profits upon the sale in the indies being the only thing that really accrues to themselves it is certainly right to consult primarily how they shall get the greatest returns upon the smallest quantity of goods it would be quite otherwise if all or most of what they send abroad were their own produce or manufacture they are undoubtedly right too in keeping the trade very carefully to themselves though perhaps the means taken to attain this end will not be thought so rational by suffering all the trade to be carried on only between two ports they discourage in the old world all their towns from that emulation which would not only enable them to traffic in foreign commodities but in time to set up fabrics of their own whereas now with regard to the export of their commodities they stand upon the level of strangers they cannot carry their produce directly to the best market and it is very certain that even trifling discouragements operate very powerfully where the commercial spirit is weak and the trade in it is infancy again in the new world this confinement of the trade encourages interlopers and an illicit commerce too gainful for any regulations to prevent and which may afford such bribes as will disarm the most rigid justice and lull the most attentive vigilance so that in reality it may greatly be doubted whether the precautions so systematically pursued and improved from time to time with so much care and foresight are at bottom of most advantage or prejudice to that nation it was probably some consideration of this kind that first gave rise to the custom of register ships it was found that this confined commerce supplied it is extensive object very imperfectly and that those who were at watch to pour in counterband goods would take advantage of this want of a regular supply from spain when therefore a company of merchants of cadiz or seville judge that goods must be wanting at any certain port in the west indies the course is to petition the council of the indies for license to send a ship of three hundred tuns or under to that port they pay for this license forty or fifty thousand dollars besides presents to the officers in proportion to the connivance necessary to their design for though the license runs to three hundred tuns at the utmost the vessel fitted out is seldom really less than six hundred this ship and cargo is registered at the pretended burden it is required too that a certificate be brought from the kings officer at the port to which the register ship is bound that she does not exceed the size at which she is registered all this passes of course these are what they call register ships and by these the trade of spanish america has been carried on principally for some years past some think as much to the prejudice of their trade as contrary to all their former maxims in carrying it on but to return to the flota  when all the goods are landed and disposed of at la vera cruz the fleet takes in the plate precious stones cochineal indigo cacao tobacco sugar and hides which are their returns for old spain sometimes in may but more frequently in august they are ready to depart from la vera cruz they sail to the havanna in the isle of cuba which is the place of rendezvous where they meet the galleons another fleet which carries on all the trade of terra firma by carthagena and of peru by panama and portobello in the same manner that the flota serves for that of new spain when they arrive at this port and join the galleons and the register ships that collect at the same port from all quarters some of the cleanest and best sailing of their vessels are dispatched to spain with advice of the contents of these several fleets as well as with treasure and goods of their own that the court may judge what indulto or duty is proper to be laid on them and what convoy is necessary for their safety these fleets generally make some stay at the havanna before all the ships that compose them are collected and ready to sail as soon as this happens they quit the havanna and beat through the gulf of florida and passing between the bahama islands they hold their course to the northeast until they come to the height of st augustine and then steer away to old spain when the flota has left la vera cruz it has no longer the appearance of a place of consequence it is a town in a very unhealthy situation inhabited scarcely by any but indians meztezes or negroes all the merchants of any consequence reside at some distance at a place called los angelos this town may contain about three thousand inhabitants  chap vi the inhabitants of new spain are composed of people of three different races whites indians and negroes or the several mixtures of those the whites are either born in old spain or they are creoles those who are native spaniards are mostly in offices or in trade and have the same character and manners with the spaniards of europe the same gravity of behavior the same natural sagacity and good sense the same indolence and a yet greater share of pride and stateliness for here they look upon the being natives of old spain as a very honorable distinction and are in return looked upon by the creoles with no small share of hatred and envy the latter have little of that firmness and patience which makes one of the finest parts of the character of the native spaniard they have little courage and are universally weak and effeminate living as they do in a constant enervating heat surfeited with wealth and giving up their whole time to loitering and inactive pleasures they have nothing bold or manly to fit them for making a figure in active life and few or none have any taste for the satisfactions of a learned retirement luxurious without variety or elegance and expensive with great parade and little convenience their general character is no more than a grave and specious insignificance  they are temperate at their tables and in their cups but from idleness and constitution their whole business is amor and intrigue these they carry on in the old spanish taste by doing and saying extravagant things by bad music worse poetry and excessive expenses their ladies are little celebrated for their chastity or domestic virtues but they are still a good deal restrained by the oldfashioned etiquette and they exert a genius whichi is not contemptible in combating the restrants which that lays them under  the clergy are extremely numerous and their wealth and influence cannot be doubted among so rich and superstitious a people it is said that they actually possess a fourth of the revenues of that whole kingdom which after all abatements certainly amounts to several millions and as to their numbers it is not extravagant to say that priests monks and nuns of all orders are upwards of one fifth of all the white people both here and in the other parts of spanish america but the clergy here being too ignorant in general to be able instructors by their preaching and too loose and debauched in their own manners to instruct by their example the people are little the better for their numbers wealth or influence many of them are no other than adventurers from old spain who without regard to their character or their vows study nothing but how to raise a sudden fortune by abusing the ignorance and extreme credulity of the people a great deal of attention is paid to certain mechanical methods of devotion moral duties are little talked of an extreme veneration for saints lucrative to the orders they have founded or are supposed to patronize is strongly inculcated and makes the general subject of their sermons designed rather to raise a stupid admiration of their miracles than an imitation of the sanctity of their lives however having said this it must be considered as all general observations with the reasonable allowances for many of the dignified clergy and others among them understand and practice the duties of their station and some whole orders as that of the jesuits are here as they are elsewhere distinguishable for their learning and the decency of their behavior and certainly with all their faults in one respect their zeal is highly commendable that they are the cause of several charitable foundations and that they bring the indians and blacks into some knowledge of religion and in some measure mitigate their slavery this too has a good political effect for those slaves are more faithful than ours and though indulged with greater liberty are far less dangerous i do not remember that any insurrection has been ever attempted by them and the indians are reduced to more of a civilized life than they are in the colonies of any other european nation  this race of people are now whatever they were formerly humble dejected timorous and docile they are generally treated with great indignity as the state of all people subjected to another people is infinitely worse than what they suffer from the pressure of the worst form or the worst administration of any government of their own  the blacks here as they are imported from africa have the same character as the blacks of our colonies stubborn hardy of an ordinary understanding and fitted for the gross slavery they endure  such are the characters of the people not only of new spain but of all spanish america when any thing materially different occurs i shall not fail to mention it  the civil government is administered by tribunals which here are called audiences consisting of a certain number of judges divided into different chambers more resembling the parliaments in france than our courts at the head of the chief of these chambers the viceroy himself presides when he sees fit his employment is one of the greatest trust and power the king of spain has in his gift and is perhaps the richest government entrusted to any subject in the world all employments here are held only by native spaniards and by them but for a certain limited time most not above three years jealousy in this respect as in all others relative to the indies is the spirit that influences all their regulations and it has this very bad effect that every officer from the highest to the lowest has the avidity which a new and lucrative post inspires ravenous because his time is short he oppresses the people and defrauds the crown another succeeds him with the same dispositions and no man is careful to establish any thing useful in his office knowing that his successor will be sure to trample upon every regulation which is not subservient to his own interests so that this enslaved people has not the power of putting in use the foxs policy of letting the first swarm of bloodsuckers stay on but is obliged to submit to be drained by a constant succession of hungry and impatient harpies  there are some troops kept in new spain and a good revenue appropriated for their maintenance and for the support of the fortifications there but the soldiers are few ill clothed ill paid and worse disciplined the military here keep pace with the civil and ecclesiastical administration and every thing is a jobb  chap vii new mexico new mexico lies to the north and northeast of new spain it is bounds to the north are not ascertained taking in california it has the great south sea to the west and to the east it is bounded by the french pretensions on the missisippi this country lies for the most part within the temperate zone and has a most agreeable climate and a soil in many places productive of every thing for profit or delight it has rich mines of silver and some of gold which are worked more and more every day and it produces precious stones of several kinds but it has no direct intercourse with any part of europe the country is but little known at all to europeans and the spanish settlements there are comparatively weak however they are every day increasing in proportion as they discover mines which are here not inferior to any that have been discovered in the other parts of america the inhabitants are mostly indians but in many places lately reduced by the spanish missionaries to christianity to a civilized life to follow trades and to raise corn and wine which they now export pretty largely to old mexico this useful change was principally effected at the expense of a spanish nobleman the marquis velasco whom the reverend author of lord ansons voyage calls for that reason a munificent bigot  the famous peninsula of california is a part and far from an inconsiderable part of this country it is a place finely situated for trade and has a pearl fishery of great value it was first discovered by the great conqeror of mexico hernando cortes our famous admiral and navigator sir francis drake landed there and took possession of it in      and he not only took possession but obtained the best right in the world to the possession the principal king having formally invested him with his principality however i do not find that we have thought of asserting that right since his time but it may probably employ in some future time the pens of those lawyers who dispute with words what can only be decided by the sword and will afford large matter upon the right of discovery occupancy and settlement  chap viii peru the conquest of peru achieved in so extraordinary a manner brought into the power of spain a country not less wealthy and nearly as extensive as mexico but far beyond it for the convenience of habitation and the agreableness of the climate like mexico it is within the torrid zone yet having on one side the south sea and on the other the great ridge of the andes through it is whole length the joint effects of the ocean and the mountains temper the equinoctial heat in a manner equally agreeable and surprising with a sky for the most part cloudy which shields them from the rays of the vertical sun it never rains in this country but every night a soft benign dew broods upon the earth and refreshes the grass and plants so as to produce in some parts the greatest fertility what the dew wants in perfecting this is wrought by the vast number of streams to which the frequent rains and the daily melting of the snow on those astonishing mountains give rise for those mountains though within the tropics have their tops continually covered with snow which is an appearance unparallelled in the same climate along the sea coast peru is generally a dry barren sand except by the banks of the rivers and streams we have mentioned where it is extremly fertile as are all the valleys in the hilly country  the cause of the want of rain in all the flat country of peru is difficult to be assigned though the agents in it are not improbably the constant southwest wind that prevails there for the greatest part of the year and the immense height of the mountains cold with a constant snow the plain country between refreshed as it is on the one hand by the cool winds that blow from the frigid regions of the south and heated as uniformly by the direct rays of the equinoctial sun preserves such an equal temper that the vapor once elevated can hardly ever descend in rain but in the mountainous part of the country by the alternate contraction and dilatation of the air from the daily heats and the succeeding colds which the snows communicate in the absence of the sun as well as from the unequal temper of the air which prevails in all hilly places the rain falls very plentifully the climate in the mountainous countries is extremely changeable and the changes sudden  all along the coast of peru a current sets strongly to the north further out to sea it passes with equal rapidity to the south this current probably moves eddywise for having run as far as it is moving cause impels it it naturally passes back again where it has least resistance the ignorance of this double current made the navigation in the south seas originally very uncertain and fatiguing but now the course is for those who pass from chili to peru to keep in to the shore in their passage to callao and on their return to stand out a great many leagues to sea and take the southern current homewards the same method but reversed is observed in the voyages between panama and all the other northern countries and the ports of peru  the commodities of peru for export may be reduced to these articles first silver and gold secondly wine oil and brandy thirdly vigonia wool fourthly jesuits bark fifthly guinea or jamaica pepper of the first of these articles we have already treated in our description of mexico the mines of gold in peru are almost all in the northern part not very remote from lima those of silver almost wholly in the southern the voyagers who treat of this country are generally pretty diffuse in their accounts of the principal places where mines are found but it does not therefore give us encouragement to insist much on these particulars because they contain very little instruction in themselves and if they were things in their own nature instructive it would be little to the purpose to dwell upon what is continually changing new mines are daily opened and the old exhausted or deserted the towns shift with the mines a rich mine is always founder of a town in proportion to its produce the town which it subsists when the mine is exhausted disappears indeed the great mines of potosi in the province of los charcas are the inheritance of ages and after having enriched the world for centuries still continue the inexhaustible sources of new treasure they are not however quite so valuable now as formerly not so much from any failure of the vein as from the immense depth to which they have pursued it which by the greater labor necessary lessens the profit on what it yields in proportion as they descend besides new mines are daily opened which are worked at a less expense so that the accounts we have had of the great number which inhabited the city of potosi when mr frezier was in that country must have since suffered some abatement it had then upwards of seventy thousand souls spaniards and indians of which the latter were six to one  the spaniards oblige this unfortunate people to send annually a certain number from the villages of the adjacent country who are compelled to work for a limited time afterward they may return but having lost the sweetness of their former connections they that survive this slavery commonly settle in the city of potosi it is incredible how these mines the most terrible scourge with which god could afflict the inhabitants have contributed to depopulate this country worse they are than sword or pestilence equally fatal to their lives and where those escape they are embittered by the circumstance of an ignominious slavery without any prospect of end or mitigation the effects of this servitude would be yet more fatal if it were not for the use of an herb which the inhabitants call coca to which they ascribe the most extraordinary virtues and which they constantly use it is qualities seem to be of the opiate kind and to have some resemblance to those of tobacco for it produces a kind of stupid composure it is an antidote against poisons and poisonous effluvia and makes those who use it subsist a long time without food though necessary to those only who work in the mines it is used for pleasure by all the indians who chew it constantly though it makes those who use it stink in a most offensive manner this herb is gathered by the indians with many superstitious ceremonies to which they attribute it is virtues for which reason it is in many parts of peru with equal superstition strictly forbidden the spaniards as well as the indians giving the credit of it is effects to magic and allowing to these more than they deserve for they think the indians superiority in strength owing principally to them however notwithstanding the severity of the inquisition which is established in all the spanish dominions with great terror necessity makes them wink at the practice where the mines are worked  they make use of another preservative an infusion of the herb of paraguay something of the nature of tea the consumption of this in peru by all ranks of people is prodigious above   000 hundred weight is annually brought into chili and peru and is worth when the duty is paid not less than  0000 pounds sterling the finest of this species of tea comes from the country of the jesuits  chap ix the southern part of peru which lies without the tropic of capricorn produces wine in great plenty but not in a perfection proportionable the spaniards dislike and leave it to the indians and negroes choosing rather what may seem odd to regale in the brandy of the same wine which is likewise made and exported in large quantities not only to all parts of peru but to panama and the ports of new spain the greatest quantity is made near a place otherwise of no consequence called moquaga here it is said they make annually of wine and brandy one hundred thousand jars which mr frezier reckons at three million two hundred thousand paris pints a vast quantity in a small territory the value of this produce is four hundred thousand pieces of eight other places trade in wine such as pisco but of a goodness not superior oil is likewise had in peru but both the wine and oil are mostly the produce of those places that lie beyond the southern tropic  wool makes one of the most valuable commodities of the growth of this country and it is not more remarkable for it is fine long staple than for the singularity of the animal which carries it it is sheered from a sort of sheep which they call lamas and vicunnas the lamas have small heads resembling in some measure both an horse and sheep the upper lip is cleft like that of the hare through which when they are enraged they spit even to ten paces distance a sort of envenomed juice which when it falls on the skin causes a red spot and great itching the neck is long like that of a camel the body resembles that of a sheep but the legs are much longer in proportion this animal has a disagreeable smell but it is flesh is good and it is extremely useful not only for the wool which is very long and fine but as it is a beast of burden strong patient and kept at a very easy expense it seldom caries above one hundred and fifty pound weight but then it carries that weight a vast way without tiring eats very little and never drinks as soon as night comes the lama lies down and no blows can get him to move one foot after the time he destines for his rest and food  the vicunna is an animal resembling the lama pretty much as the dromedary does the camel he is smaller and swifter with a far finer wool but otherwise exactly like the lama in all respects the wool of these creatures is almost as fine as silk probably the famous sheep of cachemir of whose wool they make the little white cloths so much valued in india is of this species i cannot ascertain what quantity of this wool is exported manufactured or raw out of peru either to new or old spain but i have reason to believe it is not at all inconsirable  the fourth great article of their commerce is jesuits bark so well known in medicine as a specific in intermitting disorders and the many other great purposes which experience daily finds it to answer the tree which produces this valuable bark grows principally in the mountainous parts of peru and that most and best in the province of quito ondamine informs us that it grows on the hither side of the andes no way inferior to the peruvian in quantity and goodness the best is produced on the high and rocky grounds and it is not singular in this for it seems in a good measure to be the case of all plants whose juices are much more strong and effective when elaborated in such situations the tree which bears it is about the size of a cherrytree it is leaves are round and indented it bears a long reddish flower from whence arises a sort of husk which envelopes a flat and white kernel not unlike an almond this bark was first introduced in france by the cardinal lago a jesuit about the year    0 hence it had it is name of jesuits bark it is said to have been discovered by the accident of an indians drinking in a fever of the water of a lake into which some of these trees had fallen and by which he was cured this medicine as usual was held in defiance for a good while by the faculty but after an obstinate defense they have thought proper at last to surrender notwithstanding all the mischiefs at first foreseen in it is use every body knows that it is at this day innocently and efficaciously prescribed in a great variety of cases for which reason it makes a considerable and valuable part of the cargo of the galleons  guinea pepper agi or as it is called by us cayenne pepper is a very great article in the trade of peru as it is used all over spanish america in almost every thing they eat this is produced in the greatest quantity in the vale of arica a district in the southern parts of peru from whence they export to the annual value of six hundred thousand crowns the district which produces this pepper in such abundance is but small and naturally barren it is fertility in pepper as well as in grain and fruits is owing to the advantage of a species of very extraordinary manure brought from an island called iquiqua this is a sort of yellowish earth of a fetid smell it is generally thought to be dung of birds because of the similitude of the scent that feathers have been found very deep in it and that vast numbers of sea fowls appear upon that and all the adjacent coasts but on the other hand whether we look upon this substance as the dung of these sea fowls or a particular species of earth it is almost equally difficult to conceive how the small island of iquiqua not above two miles in cireumference could supply such immense quantities and yet after supplying upwards of twelve ship loads annually for a century together for the distant parts and a vastly larger quantity for the use of the neighborhood it cannot be observed that it is in the least diminished or that the height of the island is at all lessened but these are matters which to handle properly requires a more exact knowledge of all the circumstances relating to them than can be gathered from travelers  quicksilver is a remarkable article in their trade because the purification of their gold and silver depends upon it i do not find that any other part of the spanish america produces it so that mexico and terra firma are supplied from old spain with all they want of that mineral which is brought them on the kings account only except that some arrives from from peru in a counterband manner in peru likewise it is monopolized by the crown the principal mine of this extraordinary substance is at a place called guancavelica where it is found in a whitish mass resembling brick ill burned this they pound and put into a furnace vaulted at the top it is laid upon an iron grate covered with earth through this the fire passes and volatilizing the mineral it is raised in a smoke which finding no passage but through a little hole contrived for that purpose it rushes through it into a succession of little round vessels united to each other by the necks here the smoke circulates and it condenses by means of a little water at the bottom of each vessel into which the quicksilver falls in a pure heavy liquid the men who work in the mines of this mineral are yet mroe subject to diseases than those who toil in the others and they make use of the same preservatives of paraguay tea and coca  chap x the manners of the spaniards and creolians of peru resemble with little difference those of the spaniards and creolians of mexico other than that the natives of peru seem to be of a more liberal turn and of greater ingenuity but they are equally destitute of all cultivation the slavery of the indians is here yet more severe the magistrate and the priest devour their whole substance and every spaniard insults them with impunity the traveller takes as much of their provision as he pleases and decides for himself what he shall pay or whether he shall pay any thing at all complaints are answered with new indignities and with blows which it is a crime to return this cruel irregular bondage contributes to dispeople this country even more than the methodical tyranny of the government to avoid the plunder he is hourly subject to the master of the family often raises no more grain than what just suffices for the sustenance of his family this he buries and he keeps the secret of his hoard to himself only drawing out daily just so much as serves for the use of the day if he chances to die suddenly the family starves if a bad season comes the calculated produce falls short and they are all reduced to beggary yet worse they are even the slaves of slaves for the spaniards encourage their negroes to treat them with the greatest insolence and they politically keep up a rancour now grown inveterate between these two races of people they are forbidden under the severest penalties to marry or to have an unlawful intercourse together division is the great instrument in which the spaniards trust for the preservation of their colonies the native spaniard has alone all the lucrative offices civil ecclesiastical and military he despises the creolian the creolian hates and envies him both contemn and maltreat the indians who on their side are not insensible of the indignities they suffer the blacks are encouraged to trample on the indians and to consider their interests as altogether opposite whilst the indians in their nominal freedom look with an envious disdain upon the slavery of the negroes which makes them their masters  what is extraordinary the spaniards not content with reducing this unhappy nation under so cruel a yoke as if they thought it nothing unless they were thoroughly sensible of it is weight suffer the indians to celebrate an annual festival in which plays are represented commemorating the overthrow of their own state these are acted with all the horrid and aggravating circumstances which attended this event and the people are at this time so enraged that the spaniards find it dangerous to go abroad in the city of lima there is annually celebrated a festival of this kind with a grand procession wherein they carry in a sort of triumph the remaining descendant of the yncas of peru and his wife who at that time receive all imaginable honors in the most melancholy pomp from a race bowed down with the sense of the common bondage of prince and people this throws the most affecting gloom over the festival that renews the image of their former freedom to this remaining ynca the viceroy of peru does homage when he enters upon his government the ynca sits upon a lofty stage and the viceroy makes his obeisance upon an horse who is taught to kneel upon the occasion this manner of proceeding may be thought of the most refined strain of insolent tyranny and to be as unpolitic as it is insulting but it is not impossible that those vents which they suffer the indignation of the people to take may carry off a spirit that might otherwise break out in a much more fatal manner however it is whether by the division they keep up or by these vents or by the management of the clergy or by whatever means the spaniards preserve their conquests with very little force the indians are even armed and make a considerable part of their militia it is true they are interdicted the use of weapons without license but license is procured without much difficulty they have likewise a large number of free blacks and they too are formed into companies in their militia certain it is that both in the spanish and portuguese colonies they find slavery compatible enough with great license in some respects and both with the security of the masters things deserving our consideration as we do not seem to excel in the conciliating arts of government in our colonies nor to think that any thing is to be effected by other instruments than those of terror and rude force  chap xi there are three cities in peru famous for their opulence and trade lima cusco and quito lima lies in the northern part of peru about two leagues from the sea upon a river called rimac small and unnavigable this is the capital of peru and of all south america a beautiful city with the streets laid out with the greatest regularity cutting each other at equal distances and right angles the houses on account of the equality of the climate are only covered with mats as they are built low to avoid the consequences of earthquakes frequent and dreadful in this country they are painted all over both inside and outside with flowers and landskips and other ornamental fancies not altogether unskilfully executed to add to the elegance and convenience of this city most houses have a little garden which is watered by cuts drawn from the river so that each man commands a little running stream for his own use in a hot and dry country as this is no small matter of convenience and delight they have a walk by the river side two hundred fathom long consisting of five rows of fine orange trees here the company resorts at five in the evening drawn in their calashes of which such is the opulence of this city they had no less than four thousand in the year      it has fiftyfour churches taking in the cathedral the parochial and conventual twenty monasteries of men one of which contains seven hundred and another five hundred friars and servants twelve nunneries one of which has not less than three hundred nuns and twelve hospitals besides foundations for the portioning of poor girls with these the whole number of the inhabitants is said not to exceed thirty thousand  they tell a very remarkable fact that may help us to some idea of the vast wealth of this city when their viceroy the duke de la palata made his public entry in      they caused two of the principal streets to be paved with ingots of silver that had paid the fifth to the king of between twelve and fifteen inches long four or five in breadth and two or three in thickness the whole of which could not amount to less than sixteen or seventeen millions sterling the trade of the french to peru during the general war in europe which was caused by the disputes about the spanish succession made this city decay not a little by diffusing the commerce of which before it was the center amongst the other towns which lie along the coast but as that privilege has been since taken away lima began to revive again and continued in great splendour until the year      when a most tremendous earthquake which entirely devoured callao the port belonging to it laid three fourths of this city level with the ground the destruction of callao was the most perfect and terrible that can be conceived no more than one of all the inhabitants escaping and he by a providence the most singular and extraordinary imaginable this man was on the fort that overlooked the harbor going to strike the flag when he perceived the sea to retire to a considerable distance and then swelling mountain high it returned with great violence the inhabitants ran from their houses in the utmost terror and confusion he heard a cry of miserere rise from all parts of the city and immediately all was silent the sea had entirely overwhelmed this city and buried it for ever in it is bosom but the same wave which destroyed the city drove a little boat by the place where the man stood into which he threw himself and was saved what is remarkable too in this affair mr frezier who was in peru in the year      and from whom i have part of my materials on considering the situation of this town and the nature of the country ventured to prophesy for it the destruction which we have seen accomplished in our days whilst this town subsisted it contained about  000 inhabitants of all kinds had five convents and possessed the finest port in all peru here were the rich warehouses furnished with all the goods of europe which being landed by the galleons at portobello were brought over land to panama and thence transported hither by the armadilla or fleet with a convoy of three men of war reserved for this purpose to this port arrived the annual ship from acapulco laden with all the products of the east from chili it received vast quantities of corn dried beef and pork leather tallow plank and several sorts of woollen goods particularly carpets like those of turkey from the ports of peru were brought sugars wine and brandy naval stores cacao and tobacco from mexico it had pitch and tar woods for dying and that balsam which we improperly call of peru since it comes from guatimala as the port of callao is so excellent and as it is that by which the trade of lima wholly and that of all peru in a great measure must be carried on we cannot doubt but that a new city is already built there and that lima is restored to it is former luster especially as this latter is the seat of so great a government for to the viceroy of peru both chili and terra firma are subject his settled salary is  0000 pieces of eight yearly his perquisites are great as often as he goes to callao he is entitled to  000 pieces of eight for that little airing he has  0000 for every progress into more distant parts he has the sole disposal of above a hundred great magistracies and in short the granting of all triennial employments both civil and military throughout the extent of his ample jurisdiction it cannot therefore be doubted that his perquisites even his lawful ones for there are many others at least double the value of his salary and certainly whatever the king of spain may lose by the bad economy in his affairs no prince in the world has such means of rewarding the services of his subjects without any immediate burden upon his own revenues  cusco the capital of the ancient empire is still a very considerable city it is at a good distance from the sea and situated in the mountainous part of the country it has not less than forty thousand inhabitants three parts indians who are very industrious and ingenious though little instructed in the art many show the rudiments of a taste for painting and there are an incredible quantity of pictures painted here which are dispersed all over peru and chili they have here likewise manufactures of bays and cotton and they work largely in leather in most of the ways in which it is used  quito is likewise an inland town it is situated in the most northern part of peru it is a considerable place and drives a great trade with the indians but i can get but little account of the inhabitants or the manufactures which employ them  it is not easy to calculate the number of inhabitants in peru because we have none of those data which are necessary to ground such a calculation there are a good many large and populous towns dispersed through that country but in many places it is little better than a desert partly for want of water but much more generally through the pride of one part of the people the miserable subjection of the other and the sloth of all the mines undoubtedly contribute largely to depopulate the country by turning the inhabitants from agriculture and manufactures employments that prolong life and provide for it to the working of metals extremely pernicious to health and which makes them depend upon others for their necessary sustenance the nations which are poor in respect of gold and industrious from that poverty have not the least reason to envy the wealth of the peruvians who amidst all that extravagant glare that dazzles the eye live penuriously and sordidly and are often in extreme want in a country which in many places is one of the most fertile in the world in fact the countries which employ their men in arts and in agriculture and receive their return in gold and silver from the countries which abound in those metals may be considered as the real proprietors of the mines the immediate possessors only as their stewards to manage or as their slaves to work them whilst they are employed themselves only at an easy labor friendly to life and necessary to their wellbeing  chap xii chili immediately to the southward of peru lies chili extending itself in a long narrow slip along the coast of the south sea in the south temperate zone the air here is remarkably clear aad serene scarce any changes happen for three parts of the year very little rain falls during that period but the benign dews every night and the many rivulets which the neighborhood of the andes supplies them fertilize the plain country and make it produce as much corn wine oil and fruits as the number of the inhabitants which is very small or their industry which is but moderate will suffer them to cultivate if it were under a more favorable government and better peopled there is hardly any part of the world which could enter into competition with this for at the same time that it enjoys a very healthful air and is warmed by an heat no way oppressive it bears many of the tropical fruits that would thrive no where else out of the torrid zone it is luxuriant on the surface with every thing for profit and delight and beneath it is rich to profusion with veins of gold silver copper lead quicksilver and iron those of gold are the most wrought and indeed there is scarce a rivulet in the country in which gold is not found in smaller or greater plenty but want of people which is here more felt than in the other spanish settlements hinders them from working all their mines and what is worse from improving the surface of their country to any thing like the degree of perfection to which it might be brought for in this whole extent of country upwards of twelve hundred miles in length and from three hundred to five hundred miles in breadth it is not reckoned they have much above twenty thousand whites fit to bear arms and about three times that number of indians blacks and mulattoes yet with so few hands and those not the most industrious they export annually from the ports of chili to callao and other ports of peru corn enough to support sixty thousand men great quantities of wine hemp which is raised in no other part on the southseas hides tallow and salted provisions to say nothing of the gold and other minerals which form their principal wealth this country is in general not so fit for pasturage though it has a sufficient number of useful cattle of all sorts those whose flesh they salt and in whose hides they trade to peru come from the other side of the andes from the province of tucuman in paraguay chili has but a very few beasts of prey and those timorous and although toads snakes and scorpions are here as numerous as in other hot countries they are found entirely harmless  there are in chili four towns of some note either on the sea or near it st jago which is the capital la conception coquimbo or la serena and baldivia the three first of these towns are laid out in a manner exactly resembling each other the streets like those of lima cutting one another so as to form squares like those of a draft board they have all gardens between the houses and running waters drawn from the neighboring rivers to fertilize them but the houses are so low and meanly built mud walls and thatch in some that they rather resemble agreeable country villages than cities of business or grandeur however some of the houses are well furnished and it is said that in st jago there are many which have the meanest utensils of the kitchen of gold and silver as for baldivia it is not more remarkable for being the strongest fortress in the southseas than for the manner in which it is peopled for hither the criminals from peru and the other parts of chili are transported either for a time or for life and obliged to labor upon the fortifications and other public works what is singular these criminals are at once the prisoners and the jailors for the garrison of the place the whole corpse soldiers and officers is formed of no other the town contains about two thousand souls and all of them banished people or the descendants of such  the trade of chili is entirely confined to what they carry on with peru one or two ports of new spain and with panama none of their ships ever penetrate the straits of magellan or pass cape horn they send their commodities to these ports in mexico and peru and receive their european goods from panama  chap xiii as in chili they are weak in men and have a large body of independent indians illaffected to them on their borders and know that the dutch once attempted an establishment here and that other people have nourished projects of the same nature they are extremely cautious and watchful on the coast and the country is immediately in arms upon every alarm which is given when any ship appears off the coast that is not of spanish built yet notwithstanding all their caution their security is rather owing to the system of europe of which it is a part to keep the spanish possessions in the hands of the present proprietors and to the difficult and dangerous passage of the straits of magellan or cape horn for any european armament of force than either to their own strength or vigilance  the indian inhabitants of chili are a brave and warlike people who defended their liberties vigorously made several successful insurrections killed peter baldivia the conqueror of the country and maintained a war against the whole spanish power in that part of the world for several years which was only terminated on the part of several of the nations near the mountains by an honorable peace which is preserved to this day none can be more jealously watchful than this people of their freedom they traffic indeed with the spaniards but with so much caution and under limitations so strict that they can take very little advantage of this communication as for those who were obliged to submit it is to a yoke nothing near so heavy as that which oppresses the people who inhabit the other spanish provinces partly from the better terms which were procured and partly from the fear of a nation whom they have experienced to be brave and know to be surrounded with many who are of the same blood and have defended their freedom with better success a good example even in the unfortunate how much a brave defense of liberty may contribute to procure if nothing else yet a more tolerable servitude the indians of this country have more resemblance to those of north america though more humane and civilized in their manners than to the peruvians and mexicans here they have less superstition naturally and far from having that excessive veneration which those nations had for their kings they have no kings at all and very little form of government each family being sovereign within itfelf and independent the business which concerns them all is transacted in the assemblies of all and the plurality of voices decides they are much given to liquor and they practice polygamy which in america is not common however the spanish missionaries have now made a considerable progress amongst these free nations they have a college for the education of the indian youth and their influence is a great means of preserving peace between the spanish settlements and the free indians on their borders which without their assistance would be difficult for though they listen to the spanish priests they preserve a very just terror of falling under their government and no small hatred to the people  chap xiv paraguay the country of paraguay or la plata shuts up the eastern side of a considerable part of chili and peru whence extending over a tract of country above a thousand miles broad it bounds brazil upon the west and upon the south butts upon the atlantic ocean being fifteen hundred miles at least in length from the mouth of the great river plata to it is northern boundary the country of the amazons this vast territory is far from being wholly subdued or planted by the spaniards there are many parts in a great degree unknown to them or to any other people of europe in such a vast country and lying in climates so different for it lies on the northern frontier under the equinoctial line and on the south advances to the thirtyseventh degree of latitude far into the south temperate zone we must expect to meet great diversity of soil and product however in general this great country is fertile the pastures particularly are so rich that they are covered with innumerable herds of black cattle horses and mules in which hardly any body thinks it worth his while to claim a property any person takes and breaks them according to his occasions  this country besides an infinite number of smaller rivers is watered by three principal ones which unite near the sea to form the famous rio de la plata the first is paraguay from whence the country is denominated this forms the main channel it has it is origin from a great lake in the center of south america called the lake of xarayes and runs in a course nearly north and south parana which rises amongst the mountains on the frontiers of brazil runs a sloping course to the southwest until it joins the paraguay at a great distance from the ocean about the twentyseventh degree of south latitude uraguay rises likewise upon the same side and runs almost an equal course before it meets those united rivers at no great distance from the ocean with which it mixes along with them  the principal province which concerns us in this vast tract is that which is called rio de la plata toward the mouth of the abovementioned rivers this province with all the adjacent parts is one continued level interrupted by not the least hill for several hundreds of miles every way extremely fertile in most things but contrary to the general nature of america destitute of woods this want they endeavor to supply by plantations of every kind of fruit trees all which thrive here to admiration the air is remarkably sweet and serene and the waters of the great river are equally pure and wholesome they annually overflow their banks and on their recess leave them enriched with a slime which produces the greatest plenty of whatever is committed to it  the principal town is buenos airs on the south side of the river it was so called upon account of the excellence of the air this town is the only place of traffic to the southward of brazil yet it is trade considering the rich and extensive country to which it is the avenue is very inconsiderable no regular fleet comes here as to the other parts of spanish america two or at most three register ships make the whole of their regular intercourse with europe their returns are very valuable consisting chiefly of gold silver sugar and hides i cannot learn that they have opened any considerable mines in this province but it is probable there are rich ones in the provinces which lie to the eastward of the andes besides it is certain that a good deal of gold is returned from chili for the mules cattle and tea which are sent thither and that silver from the province of los charcas in peru is sent upon the same account for the most part by land carriage there is besides a tolerable water carriage for a large river called pilcomayo rises not far from the mines of potosi which winding amongst the openings of the cordillera discharges itself at last into the paraguay and this river is navigable to the very source allowing for the interruption of some falls which is the case of the river of plate itself by this way it is i judge that a great quantity of silver comes to buenos airs indeed it is in great plenty in that province and those who now and then carry on a counterband trade to this country find it far more advantageous than any other whatsoever  chap xv the trade of paraguay and the manners of the people are so much the same with those of the rest of the spanish colonies in south america that nothing further can be said on those articles but it would be inexcusable to quit the country without saying something of that extraordinary species of commonwealth which the jesuits have erected in the interior parts  about the middle of the last century those fathers represented to the court of madrid that their want of success in their missions was owing to the scandal which the immorality of the spaniards never failed to give and to the hatred which their insolent behavior caused in the indians wherever they came they insinuated that if it were not for that impediment the empire of the gospel might by their labors have been extended into the most unknown parts of america and that all those countries might be subdued to his catholic majestys obedience without expense and without force this remonstrance was listened to with attention the sphere of their labors was marked out an uncontrouled liberty was given to the jesuits within these limits and the governors of the adjacent provinces had orders not to interfere nor to suffer any spaniard to enter into this pale without license from the fathers they on their part agreed to pay a certain capitation tax in proportion to their flock and to send a certain number to the kings works whenever they should be demanded and the missions should become populous enough to supply them  on these terms the jesuits entered upon the scene of action and opened their spiritual campaign they began by gathering together about fifty wandering families whom they persuaded to settle and they united them into a little township this was the slight foundation upon which they have built a superstrusture which has amazed the world and added so much power at the same time that it has brought so much envy and jealousy on their society for when they had made this beginning they labored with such indefatigable pains and with such masterly policy that by degrees they mollified the minds of the most savage nations fixed the most rambling and subdued the most averse to government they prevailed upon thousands of various dispersed tribes of people to embrace their religion and to submit to their government and when they had submitted the jesuits left nothing undone that could conduce to their remaining in this subjection or that could tend to increase their number to the degree requisite for a well ordered and potent society and their labors were attended with success  it is said that from such inconsiderable beginnings several years ago their subjects amounted to three hundred thousand families they lived in towns they were regularly clad they labored in agriculture they exercised manufactures some even aspired to the elegant arts they were instructed in the military with the most exact discipline and could raise sixty thousand men well armed to effect these purposes from time to time they brought over from europe several handicraft men musicians and painters these i am told were principally from germany and italy  we are far from being able to trace with the exactness they deserve all the steps which were taken in the accomplishment of so extraordinary a conquest over the bodies and minds of so many people without arms or violence and differently from the methods of all other conquests not by cutting off a large part of the inhabitants to secure the rest but by multiplying their people whilst they extended their territory their own accounts are not very ample and they are partial to themselves without doubt what others have written is with a glaring prejudice against them the particulars which seem best agreed upon by both sides are the only ones to be mentioned  it is agreed then that in each mission or district the country is divided into fortyseven districts a jesuit presides in chief he is lodged in a large and commodious house called the presbitery adjoining to this house are the church and the public magazines no person under the jurisdiction of the fathers has any thing that can justly be called his own property each mans labor is allotted him in proportion to his strength or to his skill in the profession which he exercises the product is brought faithfully into the public magazines from whence he is again supplied with all things which the managers judge to be expedient for the sustenance of himself or his family all necessaries are distributed regularly twice a week and the magazines always contain such a stock of provisions and goods of every kind as to answer not only the ordinary exigencies but to provide against a time of scarcity or for those whom accidents age or infirmities have disqualified for labor  they provide early for the marriage of their young people as well to prevent disorders as to multiply their subjects here as interest can be no motive to the union there are few difficulties attending it the young man applies to the governing jesuit informs him of his desire of marriage and names the party she is consulted and if there is no objection upon her part they are immediately married they are supplied with all necessaries for their establishment from the public stores and they have at the same time their task allotted them by which they are to make amends for what they have received and to provide for others in their turn  under the jesuit are magistrates or caziques of the indian nation who regulate all these matters decide such differences as are too minute for the attention of the father and give him regularly an exact account of the state of his district and the merit and demerit of the people which it contains they are rewarded or punished according to this report the punishment is by blows from which it is said not even the principal magistrates are exempted these are however received by all not only with patience but acknowledgment the rewards are seldom more than benedictions and some slight marks of the jesuits favor which make those men entirely happy  nothing can equal the obedience of the people of these missions except their contentment under it far from murmuring that they have only the necessaries of life by a labor which might in some degree procure them the conveniences of it they think themselves a distinguished and favored people in wanting them and they believe their obedience a duty that not only secures their order and repose in this world but the very best means of insuring their happiness in the next this is carefully inculcated and indeed besides their attention to the government the jesuits are indefatigable in their instructions in the doctrines of religion the regularity of life and the contempt of this world and by what i can find the indians under their jurisdiction are an innocent people civilized without being corrupted  the jesuits who govern them are said to be extremely strict in preserving their privilege in keeping all strangers from amongst them if any such should by accident or in his journey arrive in the country of the missions he is immediately carried to the presbytery where he is treated for a day or two at most with great hospitality but regarded with no less circumspection the curiosities of the place are showed him in company with the jesuit and he can have no private conversation with any of the natives in a reasonable time he is civilly dismissed with a guard to conduct him to the next district without expense where he is treated in the same manner until he is out of the country of the missions cautions altogether as strict and in the same spirit are observed when the natives are obliged to go out of their own territory to serve in the kings works or when any part of their troops are called out for his service they shun all manner of conversation with strangers upon whom they look with a sort of horror and so return uninformed and untainted into their own country as they left it  i am sensible that many have represented the conduct of the jesuits in this mission in a very bad light but their reflections appear to me not at all supported by the facts upon which they build them to judge perfectly of the service they have done their people we must not consider them in a parallel with the flourishing nations of europe but as compared with their neighbors the savages of south america or with the state of those indians who groan under the spanish yoke considering it in this which is the true light it will appear that human society is infinitely obliged to them for adding to it three hundred thousand families in a well regulated community in the room of a few vagabond untaught savages and indeed it can scarce be conceived that any government has not some extraordinary perfection which has a principle of increase within it which draws others to unite themselves to the old stock and shoots out itself a luxuriance of new branches neither can we by any means blame a system which produces such salutary effects and which has found that difficult but happy way that grand desideratum in politics of uniting a perfect subjection to an entire content and satisfaction of the people matters which it were to be wished were studied with more attention by us who content ourselves with railing at the diligence of an adversary which we should rather praise and imitate and who in our affairs think of using hardly any other instruments than force or money  this commonwealth has lately become a subject of much conversation upon account of the cession which has lately been made of part of that territory to the crown of portugal it is well known that the inhabitants of seven of the missions refused to comply with this division or to suffer themselves to be transferred from one hand to another like cattle without their own consent how the jesuits have acquitted themselves at the courts of madrid and lisbon upon this article i do not know we are informed by the authority of the gazette that the indians actually took up arms but notwithstanding the exactness of their discipline they were easily and with a considerable slaughter defeated by the european troops who were sent to quell them it seems to have been illjudged in this people who had never seen any real service nor were headed by officers who had seen any without which the best discipline is but a sort of play to have hazarded a battle with troops from europe they ought rather to have first habituated themselves to action by attacking small parties by cutting off convoys by little surprises until by use and success in smaller matters they were entitled to hazard the sum of their affairs in the open field however it is not improbable that this opposition will rouse the indolence of the spaniards and make them take the government of the country out of the hands it is in at present if they do it is not difficult to foresee that the same depopulation the same distress and the same discontent which distinguishes the indians in the rest of the spanish provinces will be soon equally visible in this it will not be difficult for them to effect the reduction of this country for the jesuits have too large and valuable an interest in old spain as well as in the new world to dispute it with the court whenever they shall demand in good earnest to have this country surrendered if it be true that the jesuits have really such influence on the inhabitants as is attributed to them  it was not orginally such bad policy as it may seem to have entrusted the jesuits with so great a power since a little time will show that they have given them a territory unknown unpeopled and uncultivated which they have the certain means of repossessing when they please subdued peopled and cultivated as to it is wealth it is hard to say any thing certain the jesuits deny it and truly if they acted with a perfect policy they would never have suffered any mines of gold or silver to be opened in that country of this matter i have no information upon which i can depend  chap xvi the spaniards have not made any settlements in the other divisions of south america which they claim to the southward of buenos airs nor to the northward except in terra firma of which we shall say something the country of the amazons though prodigiously large wonderfully fertile and watered by so noble a river is entirely neglected the country of patagonia is likewise of a vast stretch to the southward of buenos airs all in the temperate zone and extended all along the atlantic ocean a plain country without trees but this is the case of the delightful and fertile country of buenos airs it is said likewise to be barren and desert but what is certain it is unsettled by any european nation and little known though it lies open for any power that can avail itself of a favorable opportunity to establish a colony there  the last province according to the order i have observed though not of the least consequence in the spanish american dominions is terra firma a vast country above  000 miles in length and  00 broad bordering on mexico peru and amazonia it stretches all along the north sea from the pacific ocean to the mouth of the river of amazons upon the atlantic it is divided into twelve large provinces they all contain a vast deal of high and mountainous country particularly the province of st martha where there are said to be hills surpassing teneriffe itself in height these hills communicate with the andes the valleys are deep and narrow and for a great part of the year flooded but they are extremely fertile produce corn enough all kinds of the tropical fruits rich drugs cacao vanilla indigo piemento guaiacum sarsaparilla and balsam of peru no country abounds more in rich and luxuriant pasturage or has a greater stock of excellent black cattle their rivers have rich golden sands their coasts have good pearl fisheries their mines yield great quantities of gold and rubies and emeralds are found in plenty yet with all this fertility terra firma is for the greater part the most unpleasant and most unhealthful country of the torrid zone  this province has a very considerable share of the trade of europe not only on account of it is own produce and demand but because all the intercourse of peru and chili with old spain is carried on through this country it is capital city panama is the great barcadier of the south sea hither is brought all the treasure which the rich mines of peru and chili pay to the king or produce upon a private account  the city of panama is situated upon one of the best harbors in all respects of the southseas ships of burden lie safe at some distance from the town but smaller vessels come up to the walls this town one of the largest in america is said to contain five thousand houses elegantly built of brick and stone disposed in a semicircular form and enlivened with the spires and domes of many splendid churches and rich monasteries it is covered on the land side with fine orchards and gardens and at a greater distance with an agreeable country diversified with hills valleys and woods the town stands upon a dry and healthful ground and has a great and profitable trade with peru chili and the western coast of mexico upon one side and with the terra firma and with europe on the other which is carried on over the isthmus of darien and by the river chagra  the second town of consideration in terra firma is carthagena which stands upon a peninsula that encloses one of the safest and best defended harbors in all the spanish america the town itself is well fortified and built after the elegant fashion of most of the spanish american towns with a square in the middle and streets running every way regularly from it and others cutting these at right angles this town has many rich churches and convents that of the jesuits is particularly magnificent here it is that the galleons on their voyage from spain put in first and dispose of a considerable part of their cargo which from hence is distributed to st martha the caraccas venezuela and most of the other provinces and towns in the terra firma  the fleet which is called the galleons consists of about eight men of war of about fifty guns each designed principally to supply peru with military stores but in reality laden not only with these but with every other kind of merchandise on a private account so as to be in bad condition for defending themselves or protecting others under the convoy of these sail about twelve merchant ships not inferior in burden this fleet of the galleons is regulated in much the same manner with the flotas and it is destined for the exclusive commerce of terra firma and the south sea as the flota is for that of mexico  no sooner is this fleet arrived in the haven of carthagena than expresses are immediately dispatched to portobello and to all the adjacent towns but principally to panama that they may get ready all the treasure which is deposited there to meet the galleons at portobello at which town remarkable for the goodness of it is harbor which brings such a surprising concourse here at the time of the fair and the unwholsomeness of the air which makes it a desert at all other times all the persons concerned in the various branches of this extensive traffic assemble and there is certainly no part of the world where business of such great importance is negotiated in so short a time for in about a fortnight the fair is over during which the display of the gold silver and precious stones on the one hand and of all the curiosity and variety of the ingenious fabrics of europe on the other is astonishing heaps of wedges and ingots of silver are tumbled about on the wharfs like common things at this time an hundred crowns are given for a poor lodging a thousand for a shop and provision of every kind is proportionably dear which may help us to some idea of the profits made in this trade the treasure is brought hither from panama by a very dangerous road upon mules the other goods sugar tobacco and drugs are transported on the river chagra  when the galleons have taken in their returns they steer together to the havanna which is the place of rendezvous of all the ships concerned in the spanish american trade  the havanna is the capital city of the island of cuba it is situated upon an excellent harbor upon the western extremity of the island this city is large containing not less than two thousand houses with a number of churches and convents but then it is the only place of consequence upon the noble island of cuba which lies in the latitude  0 and extends from east to west near seven hundred miles in length though in breadth it is disproportioned being but from one hundred and twenty to seventy miles however it yields to no part of the west indies in the fertility of it is soil or in excellence of every thing which is produced in that climate but the spaniards by a series of the most inhuman and impolitic barbarities having exterminated the original inhabitants and not finding the quantities of gold in the islands which the continent afforded they have left this as well as hispaniola of which the french now possess the greater part and porto rico a large excellent and fertile island comparatively so many deserts the commerce between these islands and the spanish continent is carried on by the barlevento fleet consisting of six ships of good burden and force who annually make the tour of all these islands and the coast of terra firma not only to carry on the commerce between those places but to clear the sea of pirates and illicit traders now and then a register ship from old spain is bound to one or other of these islands hitherto the spaniards seemed rather to keep them to prevent any other nation from growing too powerful in those seas than for any profit they expected to derive from them and it is certain that if other nations should come entirely to possess the whole of the islands the trade of the american continent and perhaps the continent itself would be entirely at their mercy however of late the spaniards have taken some steps toward the better settlement of porto rico they are beginning to open the american trade to some other towns in spain besides cadiz they have made a difference in point of duty between their own manufactures and those of foreigners they are in short opening their eyes to the true interest of their country and moving their hands though slowly to promote it  unto this time the tide of wealth that constantly flowed from america into spain ran through that kingdom like a hasty torrent which far from enriching the country hurried away with it all the wealth which it found in it is passage no country in europe receives such vast treasures as spain in no country in europe is seen so little money the truth is from the time that the indies fell into the hands of spain the affairs of that monarchy have been constantly going backward in america their settlements were carried on conformably to that genius and to those maxims which prevailed in their government in europe no means of retaining their conquests but by extirpating the people no schemes for the advancement of trade no attempts at the reformation of abuses which became venerable in proportion to the mischiefs they had suffered by them in government tyranny in religion bigotry in trade monopoly  when the spaniards found to their ambition which was boundless that they had joined a treasure which was inexhaustible they imagined there was nothing too vast for them to compass they embraced a thousand projects at once many of them noble ones in theory but to be executed with different instruments in different parts of the world and all at a vast expense of blood and treasure the wars which were the result of these schemes and the indies which were to support them were a continual drain which carried off their people and destroyed all industry in those who remained the treasure which flowed in every year from the new world found them in debt to every part of the old for to the rest of their revenues they had forgot to add that which is a great revenue itself and the great support of all the others economy on the contrary an ill order in their finances at home and a devouring usury abroad swallowed up all their treasure whilst they multiplied the occasions for it with the best scheming heads in europe they were every where outwitted with the bravest and best disciplined troops they were almost always defeated with the greatest treasures they were in want and their armies were ill provided and ill paid their friends exhausted them by trade their enemies by plunder they saw new states arise out of the fragments of their dominions and new maritime powers start up from the wrecks of their navy in short they provoked troubled and enriched all europe and at last desisted through mere want of strength they were inactive but not quiet and they were enervated as much by their laziness during this repose as they had been weakened before by their illjudged activity  all this happened in a country which abounded with men of capacity as much as any state in europe and often with men of great capacity at it is head but their talents took a wrong turn their politics were always more abroad than at home more employed in weakening their neighbors than in strengthening themselves they were wise in the concerns of foreign courts they were satisfied with being formal in their own domestic business they relied too much upon their riches and the whble state being molded into a system of corruption from the top to the bottom things grew at last so bad that the evils themselves became a sort of remedies and they felt so severely the consequences of their former conduct that they have for some years past turned their thoughts into a very good channel and they may in time and with perseverance rise again whilst others shall fall by adopting the abuses which brought them to ruin  at present the politics of spain with regard to america seem to be to preserve south america and particularly the navigation of the southseas as much as possible to themselves to destroy effectually the counterband trade and to encourage the export of their own manufactures of us they have long shown a remarkable jealousy a much greater than of the french whom they see quietly settling in the neighborhood of new mexico and who are growing certainly in the west indies in a far greater degree than we are i shall not pretend to account for this distinction  part iv the portuguese settlements chap i it is very rare that any material discovery whether in the arts in philosophy or in navigation has been owing to efforts made dirctly for that partreicular purpose and determined by the force of reasonings a priori the first hints are owing to accident and discoveries in one kind present themselves voluntarily to us whilst we are in search of what flies from us in some other the discovery of america by columbus was owing originally to a just reasoning on the figure of the earth though the particular land he discovered was far enough from that which he sought here was a mixture of wise design and fortunate accident but the portuguese discovery of brazil may be considered as merely accidental for sailing with a considerable armament to india by the way of the cape of good hope but standing out to sea to avoid the calms upon the coast of africa the portuguese fleet fell in upon the continent of south america upon their return they made so favorable a report of the land they had discovered that the court resolved to send a colony thither and accordingly made their first establishment but in a very bad method in which it were to be wished they had never been imitated this was by banishing thither a number of criminals of all kinds this blended an evil disposition with the first principles of the colony and made the settlement infinitely difficult by the disorders inseparable from such people and the offense which they gave the original inhabitants this settlement met some interruption too from the court of spain who considered the country as within their dominions however matters were accommodated by a treaty in which it was agreed that the portuguese should possess all that tract of land that lies between the river maranon or of the amazons and the river plate  when their right was thus confirmed the portuguese pursued the settlement with great vigor large grants were made to those who were inclined to become adventurers and almost all the nobility of portugal proured interests in a country which promised such great advantages the natives were in most parts subdued and the improvement of the colony advanced apace the crown in a little time became attentive to so valuable an acquisition the government was new modelled many of the exorbitant grants recalled and all things settled upon so advantageous a footing that the whole sea coast upwards of two thousand miles was in some measure settled to the honor of the industry and courage of the first planters and infinitely to the benefit of the mother country the portuguese conquests on the coast of africa forwarded this establishment by the number of negroes it afforded them for their works and this was the first introduction of negroes into america of which at present they form a large part of the inhabitants  in the very meridian of their prosperity when the portuguese were in possession of so extensive an empire and so flourishing a trade in africa in arabia in india in the isles of asia and in one of the most valuable parts of america they were struck down by one of those incidents that at one blow in a critical time decides the fate of kingdoms don sebastian one of their greatest princes in an expedition he had undertaken against the moors lost his life and by that accident the portuguese lost their liberty being absorbed into the spanish dominions  soon after this misfortune the same yoke that galled the portuguese grew so intolerable to the inhabitants of the netherlands that they threw it off with great fury and indignation not satisfied with erecting themselves into an independent state and supporting their independency by a successful defensive war flushed with the juvenile ardor of a growing commonwealth they pursued the spaniards into the remotest recesses of their extensive territories and grew rich powerful and terrible by the spoils of their former masters principally they fell upon the possessions of the portuguese they took almost all their fortresses in the east indies not sufficiently defended by the inert policy of the court of spain and then turned their arms upon brazil unprotected from europe and betrayed by the cowardice of the governor of the then principal city and they would have overrun the whole if don michael de texeira the archbishop descended from one of the noblest families in portugal and of a spirit superior to his birth had not believed that in such an emergency the danger of his country superseded the common obligations of his profession he took arms and at the head of his monks and a few scattered forces put a stop to the torrent of the dutch conquest he made a gallant stand until succors arrived and then resigned the commission with which the public necessity and his own virtue had armed him into the hands of a person appointed by authority by this stand he saved seven of the captainships or provinces out of fourteen into which brazil is divided the rest fell into the hands of the dutch who conquered and kept them with a bravery and conduct which would deserve more applause if it had been governed by humanity  the famous captain prince maurice of nassau was the person to whom the dutch owed this conquest the establishment of their colony there and that advantageous peace which secured them in it but as it is the genius of all mercantile people to desire a sudden profit in all their designs and as this colony was not under the immediate inspection of the states but subject to the company called the west india company from principles narrowed up by avarice and mean notions they grudged that the present profits of the colony should be sacrificed to it is future security they found that the prince kept up more troops and erected more fortresses than they thought necessary to their safety and that he lived in a grander manner than they thought became one in their service they imagined that a little official economy was the principal quality necessary to form a great conqueror and politician and therefore they were highly displeased with their governor prince maurice whom they treated in such a manner as obliged him to resign  now their own schemes took place a reduction of the troops the expense of fortications saved the charge of a court retrenched the debts of the company strictly exacted their gains increased cent per cent and every thing flourishing according to their best ideas of a flourishing state but then all this fine system in a short time ended in the total loss of all their capital and the entire ruin of the west india company the hearts of subjects were lost by their penurious way of dealing and the severity of their proceedings the enemy in their neighborhood was encouraged by the defenseless state of their frontiers and both operated in such a manner that brazil was reconquered by the portuguese though after a struggle in which the states exerted themselves vigorously but with that aggravated expense and that ill success which always attends a late wisdom and the patching up a blundering system of conduct a standing lesson to those people who have the folly to imagine they consult the happiness of a nation when by a pretended tenderness for some of it is advantages they neglect the only things that can support it the cultivating the good opinion of the people and the keeping up a proper force  chap ii the name of brazil was given to this country because it was observed to abound with a wood of that name it extends all along a tract of fine sea coast upon the atlantic ocean upwards of two thousand miles between the river of amazons on the north and that of plate on the south to the northward the climate is uncertain hot boisterous and unwholesome the country both there and even in more temperate parts is annually overflowed but to the southward beyond the tropic of capricorn and indeed a good way within it there is no part of the world that enjoys a more serene and wholesome air refreshed with the soft breezes of the ocean on one hand and the cool breath of the mountains on the other hither several aged people from portugal retire for their health and protract their lives to a long and easy age  in general the soil is extremely fruitful and was found very sufficient for the comfortable subsistence of the inhabitants until the mines of gold and diamonds were discovered these with the sugar plantations occupy so many hands that agriculture lies neglected and in consequence brazil depends upon europe for it is daily bread  the chief commodities which this country yields for a foreign market are sugar tobacco hides indigo ipecacuanha balsam of copaibo and brazil wood the last article as it in a more particular manner belongs to this country to which it gives it is name and which produces it in the greatest perfection it is not amiss to allow a very little room to the description of it this tree generally flourishes in rocky and barren grounds in which it grows to a great height and considerable thickness but a man who judges of the quantity of the timber by the thickness of the tree will be much deceived for upon stripping off the bark which makes a very large part of the plant he will find from a tree as thick as his body a log no more in compass than his leg this tree is generally crooked and knotty like the hawthorn with long branches and a smooth green leaf hard dry and brittle thrice a year bunches of small flowers shoot out at the extremities of the branches and between the leaves these flowers are of a bright red and of a strong aromatic and refreshing smell the wood of this tree is of a red color hard and dry it is used chiefly in dying red but not a red of the best kind and it has some place in medicine as a stomachic and restringent  chap iii the trade of brazil is very great and it increases every year nor is this a wonder since they have opportunities of supplying themselves with slaves for their several works at a much easier and cheaper rate than any other european power which has settlements in america for they are the only european nation which has taken the pains to establish colonies in africa those of the portuguese are very considerable both for their extent and the numbers of their inhabitants and of course they have advantages in that trade which no other nation can have for besides their large establishment on the western shore of africa they claim the whole coast of zanguebar on the eastern side which in part they possess besides several other large territories both on the coast and in the country where several numerous nations acknowledge themselves their dependants or subjects this is not only of great advantage to them as it increases their shipping and seamen and strengthens their commercial reputation but as it leaves them a large field for their slave trade without which they could hardly ever supply upon any tolerable terms their settlements in brazil which carry off such numbers by the severity of the works and the unwholsomeness of some part of the climate nor could they otherwise extend their plantations and open so many new mines as they do to a degree which is astonishing  i own i have often been surprised that our african traders should choose so contracted an object for their slave trade which extends to little more than some part of the gold coast to sierra leone and gambia and some other inconsiderable ports by which they have depreciated their own commodities and raised the price of slaves within these few years above thirty per cent nor is it to be wondered as in the tract in which they trade they have many rivals the people are grown too expert by the constant habit of european commerce and the slaves in that part are in a good measure exhausted whereas if some of our vessels passed the cape of good hope and tried what might be done in madagascaror on those coasts which indeed the portuguese claim but do not nor cannot hold there is no doubt but that they would find the greater expense and length of time in passing the cape or the charge of licenses which might be procured from the east india company amply compensated our african trade might then be considerably enlarged our own manufactures extended and our colonies supplied at an easier rate than they are at present or are likely to be for the future whilst we confine ourselves to two or three places which we exhaust and where we shall find the market dearer every day the portuguese from these settlements and this extensive range draw every year into brazil between forty and fifty thousand slaves on this trade all their other depends and therefore they take great care to have it well supplied for which purpose the situation of brazil nearer the coast of africa than any other part of america is very convenient and it cooperates with the great advantages they derive from having colonies in both places  hence it is principally that brazil is the richest most flourishing and most growing establishment in all america their export of sugar within forty years is grown much greater than it was though anciently it made almost the whole of their exportable produce and they were without rivals in the trade it is finer in kind than what any of ours the french or spanish sugar plantations send us their tobacco too is remarkably good though not raised in so large a quantity as in our colonies the northern and southern part of brazil abounds in horned cattle these are hunted for their hides of which no less than twenty thousand are sent annually into europe  the portuguese were a considerable time possessed of their american empire before they discovered the treasures of gold and diamonds which have since made it so considerable after the expulsion of the dutch the colony remained without much attention from the court of portugal until in      a minister of great sagacity advised the then monarch to turn his thoughts to so valuable and considerable a part of his territories he represented to him that the climate in the bay of all saints where the capital stood was of such a nature as to deaden the activity and industry of the people but that the northern and southern extremities of brazil in a more temperate climate invited them to the cultivation of the country the advice was taken but because it was found that the insolence and tyranny of the native portuguese always excited the hatred of the native brazilians and consequently obstructed the settlements they were resolved to people the countries which were now the object of their care with those who are called mestizes that is a race sprung from a mixture of europeans and indians who they judged would behave better and who on account of their connection in blood would be more acceptable to the brazilians on the borders who were not yet reduced to complete this design they vested the government in the hands of priests who acted each as governor in his own parish or district and they had the prudence to choose with great care such men as were proper for the work the consequence of these wise regulations was soon apparent for without noise or force in fifteen years they not only settled the sea coast but drawing in vast numbers of the natives they spread themselves above an hundred miles more to the westward than the portuguese settlements had ever before extended they opened several mines which improved the revenues the planters were easy and several of the priests made no inconsiderable fortunes  the fame of these new mines drew together a number of desperadoes and adventurers of all nations and colors who not agreeing with the moderate and simple manners of the inhabitants of the new settlements nor readily submitting to any order or restraint elsewhere retired into a mountainous part of the country but fertile enough and rich in gold where by the accession of others in their own circumstances they soon became a formidable and independent body and for a long time defended the privileges they had assumed with great courage and policy they were called paulists from the town and district called st paul which was their head quarters but as this odd commonwealth grew up in so unccountable a manner so it perished in a manner altogether unknown in this part of the world it is now heard of no longer the king of portugal is in full possession of the whole country and the mines are worked by his subjects and their slaves paying him a fifth these mines have poured almost as much gold into europe as the spanish america had of silver  not many years after the discovery of the gold mines brazil which for a century had been given up as a place incapable of yielding the metals for which america was chiefly valued was now found to produce diamonds too but at first of so unpromising a nature that the working of the mines was forbidden by the court of portugal lest without making any compensation by their number they might depreciate the trade which was carried on in these stones from goa but in spite of this prohibition a number were from time to time smuggled from brazil and some too of such great weight and high luster and transparency that they yielded very little to the finest brought from india the court now perceived the importance of the trade and accordingly resolved to permit it but under such restrictions as might be sufficiently beneficial to the crown and subject and at the same time preserve the jewels in that scarcity which makes the principal part of their value in    0 the diamond mines were farmed at one hundred and thirtyeight thousand crusadoes or about twentysix thousand pounds sterling annually with a prohibition against employing more than six hundred slave at a time in the works it is probable that this regulation is not very strictly complied with the quantity of diamonds is much increased and their value of course sunk since that time it is true that diamonds of the very first rank are nearly as dear as ever none of the diamonds of brazil have so high a luster as the first rate of golnda and they have generally something of a dusky yellowish cast but they have been found of a prodigious size some years ago we had an account in the news papers of one sent to the king of portugal of a size and weight almost beyond the bounds of credibility for it was said to weigh sixteen hundred carats or six thousand seven hundred and twenty grains and consequently must be worth several millions  chap iv the trade of portugal is carried on upon the same exclusive plan on which the several nations of europe trade with their colonies of america and it more particularly resembles the spanish method by sending out not single ships as the convenience of the several places and the ideas of the european merchants may direct but by annual fleets which sail at stated times from portugal and compose three flotas bound to as many ports in brazil to fernambucca in the northern part rio janeiro at the southern extremity and the bay of all saints in the middle in this last is the capital which is called st salvador where all the fleets rendezvous on their return to portugal this city commands a noble spacious and commodious harbor it is built upon an high and steep rock having the sea upon one side and a lake forming a crescent investing it almost wholly so as nearly to join the sea on the other this situation makes it in a manner impregnable by nature but they have besides added to it very strong fortifications all these make it the strongest place in america it is divided into an upper and lower town the lower consists only of a street or two immediately upon the harbor for the convenience of lading and unlading goods which are drawn up to the higher town by machines the streets in the upper town are laid out as regularly as the ground will admit and are handsomely built they had forty years ago in this city above two thousand houses and inhabitants proportionable a sumptuous cathedral several magnificent churches and many convents well built and endowed the portuguese fleet sets out from lisbon in it is voyage hither in the month of february  i can get no accounts precise enough to be depended upon of the towns of fernambucca or parayba and the capital of the rio de janeiro to enable me to be particular about them let it suffice that the fleet for the former of these sets outs in march and for the latter in the month of january but they all rendezvous in the bay of all saints to the number of an hundred sail of large ships about the month of may or june and carry to europe a cargo little inferior in value to the treasures of the flota and galleons the gold alone amounts to near four millions sterling this is not all extracted from the mines of brazil but as they carry on a large direct trade with africa they bring especially from their settlement at mozambique on the eastern side of that continent besides their slaves vast quantities of gold ebony and ivory which goes into the amount of the cargo of the brazil fleets for europe those parts of brazil which yield gold are the middle and northern parts on the rio janeiro and bay of all saints they coin a great deal of the gold in america that which is coined at rio janeiro bears an r that which is struck at the bay is marked with a b  to judge the better of the riches of this brazil fleet the diamonds it contains must not be forgot for if the mines rented to the crown in the year    0 at twentysix thousand pounds a year it will be a very small allowance to say that at least five times more is made out of them and that there is returned to europe in diamonds to at least the value of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds this with the sugar which is principally the cargo of the fernambucca fleet the tobacco the hides the valuable drugs for medicine and manufactures may give some idea of the importance of this trade not only to portugal but to all the trading powers of europe the returns are not the fiftieth part of the produce of portugal they consist of the woollen goods of all kinds of england france and holland the linens and laces of holland france and germany the silks of france and italy lead tin iron copper and all sorts of utensils wrought in these metals from england as well as saltfish beef flour and cheese oil they have from spain wine with some fruits is nearly all with which they are supplied from portugal  though the profits in this trade are great very few portuguese merchants trade upon their own stocks they are generally credited by the foreign merchants whose commodities they vend especially the english in short though in portugal as in spain all trade with their plantations is strictly interdicted to strangers yet like all regulations that contradict the very nature of the object they regard they are here as little attended to as in spain the portuguese is only the trustee and factor but his fidelity is equal to that of the spanish merchant and that has scarce ever been shaken by any public or private cause whatsoever a thing surprising in the portuguese and a striking instance amongst a people so far from remarkable for their integrity of what a custom originally built upon a few examples and a consequent reputation built upon that will be able to effect in succession of men of very different natural characters and morals and so different is the spirit of commercial honesty from that of justice as it is an independent virtue and influences the heart  the english at present are the most interested both in the trade of portugal for home consumption and of what they want for the use of the brazils and they deserve to be most favored as well from the services they have always done that crown and from the stipulations of treaties as from the consideration that no other people consumes so much of the products of portugal however partly from our own supineness partly from the policy and activity of france and partly from the fault of the portuguese themselves the french have become very dangerous rivals to us in this as in most other branches of our trade it is true that though the french have advanced so prodigiously and that there is a spirit of industry and commerce raised in most countries in europe our exports of manufactures or natural products have by no means lessened within these last forty years which can only be explained by the extending our own and the spanish and portuguese colonies which increases the general demand but though it be true that we have rather advanced than declined in our commerce upon the whole yet we ought to take great care not to be deceived by this appearance for if we have not likewise advanced in as great a proportion to what we were before that period and to our means since then as our neighbors have done in proportion to theirs as i apprehend we have not then i say we have comparatively declined and shall never be able to preserve that great superiority in commerce and that distinguished rank of the first commercial and maritime power in europe time must be essential to preserve us in any degree either of commerce or power for if any other power of a more extensive and populous territory than ours should come to rival us in trade and wealth he must come of necessity to give law to us in whatever relates either to trade or policy notwithstanding that the want of capacity in the ministers of such a power or the indolence of the sovereign may protract the evil for a time it will certainly be felt in the end and will show us demonstratively though too late that we must have a great superiority in trade not only to ourselves formerly but to our neighbors at present to have any at all which is likely to continue with us for a long time  chap v the pourtrait which the most judicious travelers give us of the manners and customs of the portuguese in america is very far from being favorable to that people they are represented as a people at once sunk into the most effeminate luxury and practicing the most desperate crimes of a dissembling hypocritical temper of little honesty in dealing or sincerity in conversation lazy proud and cruel they are poor and penurious in their diet not more through necessity than inclination for like the inhabitants of most southern climates they are much more fond of show state and attendance than of the joys of free society and the satisfactions of a good table yet their feasts seldom made are sumptuous to extravagance  the luxury indolence pride and cruelty of the masters has amongst other causes been very justly attributed to their being bred up amongst slaves having every business entirely done by such and to their being permitted to keep a prodigious number of negroes not for their field work nor for domestic employments but merely to wait upon them and to form their train these become more corrupted than their masters who make them the instruments of their crimes and giving them an unbounded and scandalous license employ them whenever they want to terrify or revenge as bullies and assassins and indeed nothing can be conceived more fit to create the worst disorders than the unnatural junction of slavery to idleness and a licentious way of living they are all suffered to go armed and there are vast numbers who have merited or bought their freedom and this is suffered in a country where the negroes are ten to one  but this picture perhaps too highly colored for those whom it is intended to represent is by no means applicable to all the portuguese of brazil those by the rio janeiro and in the northern captainships are not near so effeminate and corrupted as those of the bay of all saints which being in a climate favorable to indolence and debauchery the capital city and one of the oldest settlements is in all respects worse than any of the others  the government of brazil is in the viceroy who resides at st salvador he has two councils one for criminal the other for civil affairs in both which he presides but to the infinite prejudice of the settlement all the delay chicanery and multiplied expenses incident to the worst part of the law and practiced by the most corrupted lawyers flourish here at the same time that justice is so lax that the greatest crimes often pass with impunity formerly the judges could not legally punish any portuguese with death and it is not difficult to imagine how much such a license in such a country must have contributed to a corruption that it may be the business of successions of good magistrates and ages of good discipline to restore to soundness upon the river of amazons the people who are mostly indians and reduced by the priests sent thither are still under the government of these pastors the several divisions of this country are called missions  as the portuguese have been once dispossessed of this country by the dutch and once endangered by the french their misfortunes and dangers have made them wise enough to take very effectual measures for their future security st salvador is a very strong fortification they have others that are not contemptible besides a good number of european regular troops of which there are two regiments in st salvador the militia too is regimented amongst whom they reckon some bodies of indians and free negroes and indeed at present brazil seems to be in as little danger as the settlements of any power of america not only from their own internal strength their remoteness and the intolerable heat and unhealthiness of a great part of the climate but from the interest that most of the states in europe who are concerned in that trade have to keep it in the hands of the portuguese  end of the first
