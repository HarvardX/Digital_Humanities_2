acknowledgments with which i have the honor to remain  sir your most obliged obedient humble servant sophia lee  a hermits tale i from prime of youth to hoary age in this lone cell i have dwelt here sought by tracing natures page to soothe the pangs i felt ii the mosswove oaks that near my cave in sullen grandeur stand and over its broken summit wave were acorns in my hand iii those timeshook towers which all forsake erect and gay i have seen and half of yon translucent lake a flowrenamelld green iv when shall my penitence and prayers obtain the boon i crave when shall my thorny bed of cares become my peaceful grave v oh worshipped relics holy book detain my mental eye nor let it ever backward look to trace sad memory vi or thou memorial cross of god my whole attention seize and bow my heart upon the sod worn daily by my knees vii alas not piety can heal the soul convulsed with guilt nor all her fountains cleanse the steel which human blood has spilt viii ah let me ease it then and speak the long long treasured tale what bitter griefs first bade me seek the silence of this vale ix near cheviot hills i drew the air on arans pleasant plain my mother was of presence fair her sire an aged swain x to tend the flocks was my employ nor ever heaved my breast when my fond mother blessed her boy at rising and at rest xi yet often with tears and smiles she strove and as i bent my knee she would cry be juster to thy love than mine has been to me xii yet little note of this i took unskilled in worldly harms and more admired my flowrbound crook than her unequalled charms xiii the lowly cot and shepherds life each night each morn she praised and when they spoke of warlike strife with terror on me gazed xiv for now the wars of palestine brave coeur de lion fought while all admired the zeal divine and with his deeds were fraught xv the glorious talk to me was good and as it filled my ear i seemed to cleave the founding flood or grasp a fancied spear xvi when lo the neighboring scots a band rough as their native rocks rushed like a whirlwind over the land and swept away our flocks xvii by many an art my mother tried my vengeance to restrain but anger argument defied and even her tears were vain xviii each swain i bade renounce his crook each swain obeyed my voice the ravagers we soon oertook and left them not a choice xix no parle did either party use

had ran xxi thus we retrieved our fleecy store so late bewailed as lost and seemed i ween to love them more for all the blows they cost xxii not richards self his warriors led more proudly over the deep than i for arans pastures sped surrounded by my sheep xxiii as nigh i drew the clouds did roll a crimson over the night the valley flamed  and my full soul died in me at the fight xxiv another band of those who roam our hamlet had destroyed and while we fought to guard our home had made that home a void xxv a while i wept and duteous sought my parents dear remains at length my heart with vengeance fraught an useless grief disdains xxvi i roused the swains who yet deplored each desolated field i turned my sheephook to a sword my scrip into a shield xxvii the savage scots i swore tannoy with everloud alarms and from a simple shepherdboy became renowned in arms xxviii between both lands strong towers i rear with captive ensigns bright one nation gazed on them with fear the other with delight xxix around i stationd many a band who dubious stragglers sought and ah one day by loves command a matchless beauty brought xxx her mien majestic seemed to speak the unsullied soul within no rose like that on her pure cheek blooms over the face of sin xxxi oh not in grace the mountain pine with her slight form could vye the blue that paints the arch divine was faint to her bright eye xxxii like a rich group of yellow sheaves in ringlets wild her hair played on her breast  so autumn leaves hang on the lily fair xxxiii awestruck my soul imbibed a flame as virtuous as sincere nor dared i boldly ask the name i most desired to hear xxxiv unconscious of her beautys blaze she drew away the shade with dignity endured my gaze and thus to speak essayed xxxv although by force i hither bend the captive of thy sword from brutal hands i seek a friend nor need i own a lord xxxvi of english blood thy servant came not from a hostile line lord ethel is my fathers name and ethelinda mine xxxvii to scotland with my mother sent a grandsires eyes to close her sum of days like his are spent with him she finds repose xxxviii even now on silver severns side my father anxiously forgets the day my mother died to look in vain for me xxxix by knighthoods holy laws oh youth i therefore claim your gage that you yield him with care and truth the darling of his age xl so may the peace to him you give with large increase return so crowned with conquest may you live and glory crown your urn xli be safe i cried thou lovely maid by warlike richards throne never shall she vainly ask my aid

 yet just xlv and soon my warriors over the waste in gay profusion roll the lady in the center placed irradiated the whole xlvi still as we journied on i sought with loves unconscious art to impress myself on every thought till i had won her heart xlvii and now my fears would often hint her sire might prove unkind and wiser twere our trust to stint but duteous was her mind xlviii ah doubt not edmund  she would say thy worth must all engage nor dare i scorn a fathers sway nor dare i grieve his age xlix his silvered head as lilies bow declining now appears alike his frame does tremble now

his decay oh the sad charm to know his pain in blessings melts away lii filled with her love soothed with her hope the present hour i blessed and gave luxuriant fancy scope who more enriched the rest liii when now we reached fair severns side where mid her fairest bowers a mountain swelled with verdant pride crowned with lord ethels towers live as to the height we gaily wound from apprehension free surpised we heard the drums fierce sound proclaim an enemy lv like shining swarms of bees in arms the knights now multiply and pleasures notes and wars alarms our mingling trumpets cry lvi when proud i did the lady show  who bade all discord cease more radiant than the vernal bow heavens own bright pledge of peace lvii her name in various accents cried was borne away within while the vast portals opening wide increased the joyful din lviii forth rushed tumultuous as the wind knights who no longer frowned but marching with their spears declined a mute obedience owned lix at once dividing to each side like waves the train retire and as the swan floats with the tide slow came the reverend sire lx the gift of health an aged bloom his manly cheek confessed and white his locks as erst the plume that quiverd over his crest lxi the maid oppressed with tender pain and than the heart more fleet now graceful shot along the plain and panted at his feet lxii have you not seen the fragile rose droop with the gems of morn so fair the kneeling virgin shows a parents tears adorn lxiii have you not seen the purple vine with autumn hoar embost youth with such loveliness divine glows wrapped in ages frost lxiv oh most beloved her father cried and fast his tears would fall my youths delight my ages pride my little earthly all lxv thy safe return in peace and health does all my

lxvii see baron added he thy bride my child behold the son allotted for thy lord and guide when thy fond fathers gone lxviii ah venerate that hallowed shield upon whose orb the cross declares in many a wellfought field the saracens vast loss lxix with grateful love accept the hand but for whose aid forlorn and fatherless thou now might stand nor i hail thy return lxx my soul as with an ague shook at once both froze and burned when she not deigning him a look all tearful to me turned lxxi behold she faltering said the sword which set thy daughter free approve a heart where i am adored  where i alone would be  lxxii could i from duty have been won his honor to reward i should have called this knight thy son and claimed a like regard lxxiii oh think though fortune freed his will with reverence he wooed oh rise above the thought of ill  remember gratitude  lxxiv that claim i never will disown your power may bid me weep  but tears like falling drops on stone the heartswound wear more deep  lxxv the barons eyes blazed through the snow of age with heclas fire and red his haughty blushes glow while thus he speaks his ire lxxvi and who then art thou nameless youth from whence derived that flood which dies thy cheek with natures truth and vies with ethels blood lxxvii where are the honors of thy line unblazond on thy arms which thou presumst to blend with mine vain of ignoble charms  lxxviii know thou the spoils of many a knight descend to me alone know thou the lands within thy sight this maid will one day own lxxix learn youth to ask some fit reward which with thy rank agrees and fame and wealth and high regard thy anger shall appease lxxx hold lord i cried nor meanly boast degraded ancestry thy honors in thyself are lost while mine begin in me lxxxi but let us prove this vaunted blood this elevated line and see if edmunds humble flood nerve not his arm like thine lxxxii for while firm youth shall brace his hand and love his ardent heart the matchless maid he will demand who forms its dearest part lxxxiii come then ye knights your welltried arms in deadly wrath produce while ours unwrought for such alarms gain strength alone from use lxxxiv alost i waved my sword of power the spiral luster run and like the guard of edens bower flamed to the noonday sun lxxxv while thus we met with equal ire before my sorrowing eyes the proud inexorable sire bore off the beauteous prize lxxxvi oh if ye ever knew to melt in passions tender glow i need not paint the pangs i felt at this extreme of woe lxxxvii oh if ye ever yet have raged oppressed by savage power ye well will guess the war we waged the fierceness of that hour lxxxviii the sun unheeded veiled his head while many a casque was rivn and that last darkness seemed to spread which mingles earth with heaven lxxxix yet still in mortal conflict joined no respite we allow till often by heavens wild fires we find a friend slain for a foe xc humanity at length over pride prevailed and soothed this heat we deemed till daylight should decide twere valor to retreat xci but on the morn at ethels word lordmarcher of the land indignant thousands on us poured nor could we more withstand xcii my knights despoiled of armor peace accepted as a boon my sword alone they dared not seize how useless when alone xciii what then was all my early fame the wealth by valor given what then alas even virtues flame the united gifts of heaven xciv lost to my heart its only joy extinct at once its flights sad images my days employ and sadder still my nights xcv the bridal feast approached the vests to many a fair were shown full was the barons hall of guests myself forbid alone xcvi all hope now lost i wild arose and soon within the bound where piety adores the cross my feet unconscious found xcvii impelled by destiny i past when struck the vesper bell  a dreary eye around i cast and owned it as my knell xcviii when lo approaching fast the tread of warlike steps i heard i turned and as by justice led my rival there appeared xcix with wonder blessing every shrine i drew the wellworn blade one moment yet i cried is mine  deserve or lose the maid c impetuous love each sinew strung as we by turns assailed and long the victory doubtful hung but oh my fate prevailed ci at length between the illjointed mail my sword a passage found fast rushed the stream of life and pale he dropped upon the ground cii while sighs of rage from his proud breast impelled the vital flood a thousand pangs his eye confessed beyond the waste of blood ciii ignoble lord i cried she is mine on holy land you lie  call to your aid the power divine repent before you die civ ah say thou groaned he  holy land it was there my sins began for thither heedless of command in early youth i ran cv broke too the unacknowledgd tie an humble love had made and left the charm of every eye in infamy to fade cvi alas perhaps on arans plain she yet exists forlorn with alberts heir a fancied swain from lineal honors torn cvii to basils daughter my true bride this ring restore again  to basils daughter i replied what emma of the plain cviii he groaned assent  through all my frame did cold convulsions run  you see i falterd void of name that miserable son  cix the murdered emmas only joy  he bent to earth his head oh do not more than kill me boy allagonizd he said cx yet while i have strength the truth to groan to yonder convent run bid here the monks that i may own in you my heir my son cxi already did the unwonted sound the vesper rites restrain and forth the holy fathers wound a venerable train cxii with consecrated lights they star the bosom of the earth and list with hallowed zeal afar the blessing of our birth cxiii before the cross the dying lord with penitential awe in silence first his god adored and mourned his broken law cxiv then raising to the monks his eyes where lifes last luster played suspend these sacred rites he cries till i deserve your aid  cxv if struggling thus with shame and death i dare avow a truth confirmed by my expiring breath oh vindicate this youth cxvi inform my liege that led by pride yet by fond passion won in early youth i chose a bride i ever scorned to own cxvii with impious zeal the band i joined he led to palestine and with false glory fired my mind to elude the wrath divine cxviii with him i every danger dared which marked the proud crusade with him a prisons gloom i shared nor selt my soul upbraid  cxix while in our northern wilds was born this youth whose energy has from its seat that being torn which gave him first to be  cxx since justly then in flower of health i expiate thus my pride oh may he give my heir my wealth my name  alas my bride cxxi unhappy boy if for thy fire these streaming sorrows flow to save his soul from endless fire perennial prayers bestow cxxii he died  nor had i time to think on all i would lost or won  i hovered on creations brink and clung to love alone cxxiii the busy monks removed the corse the arms alone remained when fraud effected what nor force nor supplication gained cxxiv encumbered with lord alberts mail a desperate hope i tried and soon the hostile mountain scale where now the gates flew wide cxxv the higharchd halls i safely past through lucid heraldry where echo to the midnight blast sighed wild and loud as me cxxvi till the lone gallery now appeared enriched with ponderous mail where many a banner timeendeard slow rustled to the gale cxxvii upon its gilded sides portrayed magnificently old each ancestors distinguished shade gave luster to the gold cxxviii the snowy plumes appear to wave and arms and forms divine defend the honors which they gave or deify the line cxxix on me all seem to turn their eyes prophetic with my doom then like the rainbows transient dies they melt into a gloom cxxx beyond  all open  silent  dim  the lengthening rooms extend where tapers shed a quivering gleam each moment strove to end cxxxi with bold despair i thither past my sates extremes to prove till entering with rude step the last i saw my longlost love cxxxii careless she viewed those arms so famed nor once removed her eyes rests ethelinda i exclaimed while ruined edmund dies cxxxiii or tired of having thus withstood resolves she on a crime but hymens torch is quenched in blood and yielded up to time cxxxiv by miracle since thou art come she falterd out to attest with heaven my melancholy doom i trust to that the rest cxxxv unjust and cruel  if you knew  what doubt my passion yet edmund this heart forever true could break but not forget cxxxvi each blush which deepend on my cheek declared my loves excess oh learn to think that passion weak which language can express  cxxxvii and when the last fond crimson flies with my expiring breath then then allow the sacrifice and own my love  in death cxxxviii alas even now that hour is come  for think not i would be while herbs afford a mortal bloom a bride and not to thee cxxxix while yet she spoke the roseate hue which on her soft cheek played and her bright eyes celestial blue began apace to fade cxl over her transparent tender skin an icy polish spread a nerveless torpor crept within as she even then were dead cxli more cold and cold that heart now grew which gave such rich supplies more slow and slow her breath she drew till it was naught but sighs cxlii and now beyond the grief of thought  and now devoid of bloom  she seemed a beauteous statue wrought to grace her own sad tomb cxliii astounded  hopeless  reckless  lost  over the fair form though dead fond fancys wish vain reasons boast my heart in silence bled  cxliv no voice its solitude could break  no object win my eye  not even her sires complaints could wake a keener agony cxlv alas to him who caused the grief relenting fortune gave a sudden and a long relief in ethelindas grave cxlvi the monks lord alberts will assert  the king allowed my claim  when did they know a breaking heart revive upon a name cxlvii impatient of the proud control and thankless for each care to all these comforters my soul sighed only out  despair  cxlviii of every human hope forlorn alldesolate i ran wild as these woods in them to mourn the miseries of man cxlix often on the hill the hunters hear the sadly vocal gale and turn aside with holy fear nor dare the copse assail cl even the wild deer with look profound my sorrows seem to share and every groaning tree around but echoes my despair  cli till sometimes thoughts aerial brood a wan and numerous train fantastic sons of solitude catch life from my wild brain  clii full threescore times the frosts have bound all streams but from these eyes since here my careworn limbs first found a refuge from the skies cliii years upon years thus slowly roll nor comfort bring to me since even in sleep my active soul lives over her misery cliv dim are my days and near the hour when death at length is mine which only can my bliss restore or bid me never repine clv ye generous poor who send me bread when on my rushy couch your little offspring find me dead with pious hearts approach  clvi hide me in earth and consecrate with tears this simple tale so may you ever scape the fate of edmund of the vale the end
