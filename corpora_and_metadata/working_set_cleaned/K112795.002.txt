laid to the printer of the st jamess chronicle thursday may  0      mr baldwin your trueborn englishmen your bold britons who are lions in the field and sea lions on the ocean are with all their courage the most remarkable of any nation in the world for being seized with a panick a battle lost or an island taken brings down their high spirits in an instant and the nation is undone an eclipse or a comet with the help of some profound philosopher in the magazines or two or three terrifying paragraphs in the newspapers shall fill the imagination of all the old women of both sexes with horrible apprehensions of the immediate destruction of the world and groaning proselytes pour in without number to tottenhamcourt and moorfields it is still fresh in our memories that two slight shocks of an earthquake the most violent of which never shook the pewter off the kitchenshelves in grosvenorsquare turned the minds of the bold britons topsyturvy and all london itself seemed going out of town in short the spirits rise and fall in the barometer of english imaginations with most incredible revolutions their hopes unless perpetually buoyed up by prosperous circumstances are sure to sink public opinions are as delicate as public credit and it seems as impossible for englishmen to preserve a manly evenness of temper as to keep the stocks at par  these reflections occurred on observing the terror that has diffused itself through most families on account of the present epidemical distemper for so mr baldwin you and the rest of your brother newsmongers have taught us to call it they into whose hands our journals may fall in foreign countries must suppose that a plague is raging amongst us the bills of mortality say they are considerably swelled in their number ten are buried in one grave four or five in a family are carried off in one day with other particulars which every body believes though nobody knows to be true it is supposed that there must be some noxious quality in the air and pieces of beef are sent up from highgate hill at the tail of schoolboys kites though it is the received doctrine of writers on all plagues that any pestilential quality in the air affects dogs horses and other animals before it reaches men and would consequently show itself on the live ox as well as the dead piece of beef for my part as a true briton i cannot help being most sensibly offended that beef the staple food of old england beef the glory of our country should be prostituted to such purposes in a time of war when provisions of all kinds grow dearer and dearer every day when the price is artfully raised on meat and fish is obliged to be brought to town in the machine of arts and sciences i am alarmed lest this prodigality should be the means or at least serve the butchers as a pretense for raising the price of meat still higher and my apprehensions are redoubled when my maid assures me on coming from market that broth being universally prescribed in the present reigning disorder scraigs of mutton are grown so much in request that the worst end sells for sixpence and sevenpence per pound  in the mean time to keep our terrors alive and to prevent the panick from subsiding in the minds of the people all the doctors who are authors begin to tell us from the press that colds caught at this season are extremely dangerous and all the booksellers who are venders of the medicines recommend their nostrums by fifty different artifices inserted in advertisements letters paragraphs etc  and here mr baldwin i cannot but observe by the bye what you who are a printer must often have observed yourself and know to be true that the connection between author and bookseller is as inseparable as that between whore and bawd a justice and his clerk a counselor and attorney or according to congreve a curate and a tobaccostopper  that this connection i say has of late years begun to display itself in a new light for since the doctors have pretty generally become authors booksellers and printers have acted as a kind of bastard species of apothecaries in the natural course of trade and shopkeeping one would as soon think of sending for a pot of porter to the grocers or a leg of mutton to the tallowchandlers as for a pill drop or an electuary to the printingoffice or for a powder a balsam or an elixir to the booksellers yet so it is medicines and pamphlets are prepared and written by one and the same hand and both published for that i find is the phrase in each case at one and the same shop two such ranks of men in combination who are each of them perpetually addressing the public have opportunities like mountebankpractisers to hawk their own medicines it is their interest in the first place to persuade you that you are sick or that you will be sick and in the next place to persuade you that nothing but their nostrum will insure your recovery or prevent your taking the distemper  now mr baldwin having myself a new discovery in medicine to recommend to the public a preparation that will be of the most infinite service in the present reigning distemper and in all other distempers that ever have affected or ever will or can affect human nature i beg leave to make it known to the world through the channel of your most useful most excellent most entertaining most instructive paper those you know are the phrases which the correspondents of all public journals from your own down to the farthing post when there was one have always made use of i cannot boast a patent for my medicine but as i shall plainly appear to have only the public good at heart by declaring its virtues in your chronicle i will answer for it that the stampoffice shall demand no duty as for an advertisement though you insert it ever so often  to the good people of great britain  venienti occurrite morbo the panacaea or the celebrated drop and pill of temperance and exercise a sovereign remedy for persons of every age sex or condition the first may be taken in two or three glasses of wine after dinner white or red port claret burgundy or tokay  but not so well in champaigne poor folks may take it in smallbeer or porter and though it does not mix well with spirituous liquors yet it may be taken in punch in small quantities it is so far from offending the taste that it gives the highest relish to roast beef or any english dishes and has an admirable effect in plumbpudding faithfully prepared after the receipts of a lady eminent in kitchen physic the second is a finer diaphoretick than jamess powder or any preparation of antimony  to be taken fasting or any hour of the day without loss of time or hindrance of business in the park at ranelagh on foot or on horseback or in quovis vehiculo its virtues its healing qualities etc etc etc etc are infallible thousands have been relieved by it the afflicted may depend on its effects  medical case a gentleman who had long been complaining and complaining and ailing and ailing and who had taken all the medicines in and out of the dispensatory at length applied to the celebrated doctor for radcliffe the doctor soon perceiving the nature of his case told him that he was in possession of a secret which was infallible for his distemper but that unluckily it was at that time in the hands of doctor pitcairne at edinburgh to whom he would write to apply it in favor of the patient if he himself thought it worth while to go so far in quest of it the patient readily undertook the journey and traveled to edinburgh but when he arrived there he had the mortification to find that just before doctor radcliffes letter reached edinburgh doctor pitcairne had sent them edicine to doctor musgrave of exeter the patient however had resolution enough on doctor pitcairnes advice to go across the country to exeter in further pursuit of it but as ill luck would have it doctor musgrave told him that he had but the day before transmitted it back again to doctor radcliffe in london where the patient naturally returned to take the benefit of it at home he could not help laughing with the doctor at the tour he had taken and at his strange disappointments i went after the medicine said the patient to no purpose and yet i cannot tell how it happens but i am much better than i was when i sat out i know it cries the doctor i know it you have got the medicine the journey was the secret and do but live temperately and keep yourself in exercise you will have no occasion for any physic in the world  i am mr baldwin your admirer to be sure your constant reader and sometimes your writer rhapsodista   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle thursday sept  0      and so mr baldwin nothing but politics will go down with you at present your old correspondents the laughers and the jokers and the wits and the critics and the poets are all vanished and in come the patriots and the statesmen the advocates of liberty and the quellers of sedition not a man but writes as if his country was at stake not a pen that is not drawn as it were pro aris and focis not a drop of ink that is not shed in the cause of liberty property and religion party has divided the whole town and pro and con takes up every page of your chronicle  you call yourself impartial that is you give both parties a fair opportunity to abuse each other audi alteram partem is your maxim that is in your free translation hear both sides and indeed they are well worth hearing and what infinite delight must a scotchman receive after reading a certain portion of abuse on his country and countrymen how charmingly must his indignation be soothed and appeased to find his opponents equally bespattered in the next column but as this kind of impartiality abuses all parties the consequence is that all parties abuse you and each in their turn consider you as the tool of their adversaries last week in a coffeehouse near st jamess i saw a scotch colonel who longs for the next regiment that falls throw your paper into the fire provoked by the severity of a letter against lord bute and the very next morning i saw the same paper almost as hardly dealt with in the alley on account of an extract from the auditor which reflected on the brokers and mr pit let me tell you mr baldwin it is very lucky that you are not obliged to follow your paper wherever it goes and that your figure is not as universally known as the face of your paper i knew a country printer that ventured to insert letters on both sides of the question in his journal during the county election and i can assure you mr baldwin that though he was one of the lustiest men in that country and above six feet high he could scarce put his head out of doors in the course of the whole controversy you i am told are a tight built little black man but by no means such an ablebodied printer as my friend in the country if you cannot weild the quarterstaff of party with ease and have not power fairly to cudgel your enemies into good humor believe me sir it is dangerous to hobble along on the unequal and unsteady crutches of two opposite factions your fugitive scribblers are unknown and leave you to stand buff to the public for their labors on the contrary the authors of the several political papers now extant keep the names of their printers as secret as those of their surgeons and as to themselves they are a match for any thing the club of the monitor is i am told more formidable than his pen the briton they say is a rawboned scotsman the auditor a tall irishman and the north briton or the world hugely belies him has a broader pair of shoulders than any author militant in this great metropolis  after all mr baldwin i believe you are a mighty good sort of man and mean no harm if the people of this town will write nothing but politics and read nothing but politics you are reduced of necessity to print nothing but politics because your stationer must be paid your hawkers must be feed nay you must give your very devil his due and have an hot joint every day and a pudding on sunday yet cannot i forbear admiring the public spirit of our authors who while their all is at stake while the very nature of literary property is in question neglecting to refute the strange and unnatural doctrine that an author has no right to his own work are all up in arms on another occasion settling the ministry and agitating the preliminaries of peace for my own part though i have been equally solicited by both parties and though you are ready to insert my arguments on either side of the question yet i am resolved like scrub to say nothing pro nor con till we have a peace  in the mean time as nothing but politics will go down to comply in some measure with the humor of the town suppose i oblige you and your readers with a critical review of our political writers i do not mean to give a weekly detail of their arguments to scrutinize their characters or criticize particular parts of their productions heaven forbid  all i intend is to draw their general characters and perhaps if i happen to be in the right vein for such a whim to give a short sketch of the style and manner of each of them and so master baldwin till you hear from me again i am  your humble servant rhapsodista   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle tuesday oct         mr baldwin going along the streets the other day meditating on the subject i opened to you in my last and considering into what form i should throw my reflections on the present race of polical writers i stumbled by mere accident on the following m s which i must beg you to commit to the press just as i found it under the title of the north briton exrtaordinary june        an extraordinary circumstance is a sufficient apology for a paper extraordinary the date of this essay will immediately denote the subject of it and show that i mean to congratulate the public in general and my countrymen in particular on the occasion of his majestys birthday the northbriton is not one of those low scribblers who like that slave the briton or that prostitute the auditor mean to write themselves into a place or a pension nor will he be restrained from delivering his sentiments by the fear of fire pillory or imprisonment the law shall be his protection and while lord mansfield shall preside as lord chief justice in the court of kings bench the north briton shall dread no oppression  on this occasion as well as on every other i shall study to speak out i have not been used to be a respecter of persons i do not after the manner of the old patriots in the craftsman make use of nicknames the ingenious devices of lord gawkee colonel catiline and colonel squintum lord gothamstow captain iago anniseed and parson bruin and parson brawn i leave to the briton and auditor i use no asterisks the names of dukes and lords and ministers are written at full length for i am above all evasion wherefore without further preface or preamble i gladly seize the opportunity of this great anniversary to congratulate those of our inclining that we have now a prince upon the throne who is an absolute jacobite  however paradoxical such an assertion may appear i have no doubt of being able to demonstrate it as clearly as any proposition in euclid imprimis the groundwork and first principle of jacobitism is to cherish the warmest sentiments for the family of stuart lord bute i dare venture to assert it is of the stuart family he is himself a stuart he cannot deny it it is a circumstance which ministerial advocates may palliate but which like that of his being a true scot they cannot dissemble yet scot and stuart as he is we have seen him secretary of state and we now see him at the head of the treasury i say we see a scotsman the reader may recollect i have written a whole paper on this subject at the head of the treasury there is a passage in archbishop spotswood p   0 by which it appears that during the troubles of that condemned stuart charles i there was at one time in his majestys treasury the immense sum of seven shillings and sixpence  a sum that might almost rival the contents of the bank of edinburgh which sometimes discounts bills to nearly that amount yet lord bute is at the head of a treasury drawing schemes to raise at one time millions of english pounds i might say hundreds of millions did i mean scotch pounds double the number of the above shillings how then can we doubt his majestys attachment to the family of stuart demosthenes said of the pythian oracle that it philipised we do not want an english demosthenes who might say that his majesty stuartiseth that is being interpreted he is a jacobite  to prove this still further let us consider that during the two former reigns of the present family every scotsman was kept at as great a distance from court as edinburgh is from london and all countrygentlemen commonly called tories were doomed to remain for ever in the country never receiving the least encouragement to come to st jamess how is all this reversed at present it is held no crime to be born on the other side of the tweed nay the immense sum of four thousand pounds is allowed by parliament toward building a bridge over that stream to facilitate the communication between the two united kingdoms or rather to pave the way for scotsmen to come over into england and here i would humbly submit to the commissioners appointed by the legislature that the bridge may contain only a footway for alas we too well know that their maxim is vestigia nulla retrorsum and when they have once walked hither not one of them will drive their carriages back again had cain been scot etc the passage is as well known as any in fingal or john humes tragedies add to all this that known tories men who during the several loyal administrations were marked for jacobites whom kings were taught to call so are now daily seen at st jamess the rage of party has entirely subsided places of power and profit are bestowed on gentlemen of oxfordshire and members of the cocoatree the university of oxford itself which was declared in the house of commons to be paved with disaffection and jacobitism begins to receive encouragement their addresses engage attention and we hear of oxford bishops and prebendaries in a word how could all these things be how could it come to pass unless his majesty were a jacobite that tories should be in place that lord bute should have power that knights of the thistle should be created knights of the garter and scotsmen be seen in broadcloth and breeches  the pretender is now said to be at avignon now in case we should send an ambassador extraordinary to paris it may be fairly presumed that his majesty     here mr baldwin here ends imperfect and unfinished this curious manuscript the public will easily recognize the style manner and sentitiments of their old friend and will undoubtedly regret as well as you and i that such a subject so happily begun should be left incomplete the loss of this first part of the copy and the subject being temporary i suppose were the reasons of this essays not making its appearance in due season beautifully printed on a sheet and half of fine writing paper be it your care to preserve this precious portion of it and to make some amends for the loss of the rest i have subjoined the following letter originally designed to be sent to the same paper  to the north briton sir nothing was ever more evident than the present partiality to scotsmen to enumerate all the particulars of it would be endless i shall confine myself to one single instance you were one of the first to cry out against the ministry on the loss of newfoundland give me leave to point out some scandalous instances of partiality that attend the retaking that island imprimis who commanded that expedition  lord colvill  a scotsman  who brought home the french colors  captain campbell  a scotsman  who came home with the news greatly praised for his spirit and activity in the siren  captain douglas  a scotsman  but above all who were the only three officers wounded and consequently placed like the english by prince ferdinand in the post of honor capt mdonnell capt bailie and capt mkenzie  all three scotsmen  i will not dwell on the mean national reflection so injurious to the irish in the first part of his lordships letter where he writes these irishmen said that if i would go into the bay of bulls numbers of their countrymen would resort to me etc  i am sir your humble servannt patrick kelly oct          and now mr baldwin i shall take my leave of you though perhaps i may soon send you some strictures on other political writers in the mean time i am as before yours  rhapsodista   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle saturday oct  0      mr baldwin i have been in much pain on your account since the publication of the north briton extraordinary which i enclosed to you in my last i was at first very glad to find that nobody questioned its authenticity but soon began to tremble for its consequences some said that the messengers had seized you your compositors pressmen devils etc some foretold motions in the kings bench provoking vengeance and letting all the terrors of the law loose upon you others prognosticated your being called up to the bar of both houses while those who were your most sanguine admirers heartily wished that for the convenience of carrying on your paper you had like the gazetteer an house adjoining to newgate at length however i begin to hope that you are quite out of danger and that in this season of the general massacre of characters some license will be allowed to you as well as your brethren i would advise you at all events to give the world fresh proofs of your impartiality and to balance the account fairly between both parties expel one poison by another or to speak more respectfully of our controversial writers let diamond cut diamond publish in your next to make amends the enclosed auditor which to use the words of the auditor the public may depend on as authentic full as authentic as the last paper i sent you  the auditor extraordinary  i will be an auditor an actor too perhaps if i see cause midsum nights dream audire est operae pretium illorum impudentiam ter hear for each hearer must applaud it of their vile impudence my audit  it is a disagreeable circumstance to be stationed on guard like the outposts of an army just on the confines of the enemys camp yet are there some considerable advantages resulting from such a situation for in such a situation the earliest intelligence may be obtained and while the hum of either army stilly sounds anecdotes of the most curious nature may be collected as has already more than once been experienced and manifested by the auditor nor can i think that the performing this kind of duty is in the phrase of bobadil service of danger as it is well known my antagonist fierce and furious as he is can take the field and come even within pistol shot of his adversary without the least ill consequence to one party or the other  for my own part i am possessed of such a sovereign contempt for him or if you please them be he or they of the singular plural or according to the grecians of the dual number that it is not without the utmost disdain that i thus descend into the arena with such paltry opponents the late mr fielding of humourous memory in one of his covent garden journals though i do not know whether that paper be extant in the elegant edition of his works lately published by arthur murphy esquire has i remember comically proved that the most contemptuous animal in the creation is a louse and has described one of those animalcules overflowing with a true qualitycontempt of the mean creature whose head he inhabited  i am i must confess the louse to the north briton i sit weekly in judgment on his head on the produce whereof he perhaps may live but i cannot for the deplorable sterility of that spot feeds nothing but my contempt i run over the barren region more barren than the country he continually reviles with all the avidity of the little human bloodsucker here perhaps i discover an abortive vein of prosaick poetry there branches out many a ramification of political virulence and there in a remote corner of the pia matter is lodged a small portion of bayess spirit of brains which like the spirit of laws would require the pen of a montesquieu to describe its qualities at large but it is in fact no other than the spirit of dullness which serves the lively dunce instead of wit and humor and produces that airy nothingness that vivacious stupidity so evident in all his publications  it has however been discovered by microscopical observers that a louse is a very lousy animal in consequence whereof while i am thus banqueting on the north briton sundry lesser lice are preying upon me the engineers of grubstreet to change the allusion like the garretteers in the ingenious new print of the ingenious mr hogarth are daily squirting upon me to all these as well as to the archenemy i oppose nothing but contempt i indulge myself in a warrantable pride and the virtuous consciousness of my own superiority i exert all my adroitness and dexterity to turn their own arms against them and they have at length instructed me as charles the twelfth did the russians to be their conqueror complaining eternally of the lamentable dullness and scurrility of factious scribblers i stop the tide of political slander and open afterward at pleasure the sources for my own use and benefit i silence with a tone of authority the clamours of the malcontent against a noble lord and his coadjutors in employment and then i immediately raise my voice to its highest pitch and cry out lustily against the grand pensioner and lord gawkee i reprobate the bold practice of licentiously printing names at full length without so much as modestly embowelling or rather emvowelling them or pleasantly holding their owners in greater derision by a contemptuous alteration of them after which doctrine the next paragraph in my aylesbury journal recites the names of wilkes and churchill and several others without the least disguise while poor hodges and beardmore and charles say run glibly into almost every sentence  contempt then sovereign contempt is plainly the best weapon offensive or defensive in the hands of a writer of controversy and what objects can be more worthy to excite that passion than those on which i have exercised my own what is lord gawkee that nounadjective lord joining his false consequence like an idle epithet to that proud substantive the grand pensioner his temple of worthies the collection of worthies of stowetemple is not i am told yet complete let him fill the vacant niches with his friends let him put up his own bust and by way of supporters let him place colonel catiline on one hand and his reverend coadjutor on the other what is the grand pensioner that sold slave for ever bellowing about liberty that hireling who receives his regular wages without doing the service for which he is paid i may perhaps some time or other by the assistance of cockers arithmetic show my knowledge in fractions and strike the balance between him and the nation such a political ledger may perhaps prove that he is indebted to the public for more than three thousand per ann and their gold boxes what are the city of london a mob a foolish crew with furs and chains huzzaing their idol their king in stilts as mr hogarth has pictured him in vain endeavoring to set the world on fire and holding the bellows to blow the dead coal of sedition they say i am an advocate for aristocracy i have turned over sidney and puffendorf and fifty other writers in the course of my little reading and find no form of government so dangerous as a mobocracy the clenched fists are indeed the patriot arms of such a state their only law is club law and their chief logic is the argumentum baculinum which is with them the knock down argument such is the custom of the city of london what are all the political writers of the present times except the briton and myself the scum of grubstreet the dregs of the church and the refuse of the legislature i have convicted the apostate monitor as well as his patron the grand pensioner of political tergiversation i have put to rebuke the petulant flippancy of the north briton and have proved him to be a haberdasher of small literature the publisher of a chronique scandaleuse the conductor of a weekly libel the reverend half of him i have shown to be a mere oldmixon in politics diving among the naiads of fleetditch in the mud of scurrility the other half of him half military and half legislative i have shown to be a downright catiline hatching a conspiracy or assassination plot against the characters of the first persons in the kingdom and like lord shaftesbury in hudibras so politic as if one eye upon the other were a spy that to trapan the one to think the other blind both strove to blink   sometimes i content myself with calling him contemptuously an impudent fellow and sometimes i find that he wrote his paper when exceedingly drunk and therefore i disdain to give him a sober reply contempt is the only tribute proper to be paid by men of veracity and honor to wretches of their character base slanderers who have reviled and still continue to revile all orders of men the commonalty the lords spiritual and temporal the royal family and me  i shall add nothing mr baldwin to this long essay which i am quite fatigued with transcribing though perhaps you may hear from me once more on this subject when i shall send you a catalogue which may serve as a corollary to this short view of the present state of politics in great britain  yours as before rhapsodista   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle  creta an carbone notandi hor crayond in purest chalk or etchd from a rough draught in charcoal sketchd  saturday feb         mr baldwin the following columns contain nothing more than two separate lists of the celebrated personages who have at any time been honored with notice by the auditor or north briton these lists i know must necessarily be imperfect because they are taken down merely upon memory and because such keen satirists cannot so grossly have misspent their time as to have lashed so few people yet i have been the less curious to render these lists complete because i know that the writers in question are such stirring spirits that they will each be continually swelling their several catalogues for which reason i have contented myself with leaving certain vacant spaces for the insertion of such names already distinguished as i must without doubt have omitted or to be filled up as time shall serve and the auditor or north briton shall hereafter please to direct  let us however do justice to the candor as well as acrimony of our political writers they deal in panegyric as well as satire if they throw dirt with the scavengers shovel they also lay on praise with a trowel every modern controversial writer in politics sits down with encomium on the right and obloquy on the left like jupiter between the tubs of good and evil or to lower my simile like brother pamphlet in the upholsterer with whitewash in one hand and blackball in the other all their characters or rather caricatures may be considered as the rough draughts of the masters in the modern school of crayons who sometimes draw in chalk but most commonly in charcoal it was my first intention to have given both the chalk and charcoal portraits of each of the great masters in question but i soon reflected that i might save that trouble by desiring your readers to take it for a general rule that such as are blackened in the north briton are by act of grace whitewashed in the auditor and so vice versa every great character like a post or a wainscot is destined to be painted in different colors at least twice over and in this various light we may at pleasure consider the two following columns either as the two principal pillars of the temple of slander or the two tables in the temple of fame as we are now however at the very opening of lent i would have the noble lords and gentlemen whose names appear in these lists to regard the perusal of them as an act of humiliation and mortification and to remember that they have been told their own by the great writers under whose aweful names they are here arranged  it must however be premised as our fixed opinion that the auditor is by far the most respectable character and the most polite and learned writer of the two the north briton sounded the nether trump of fame at the very first onset and furiously charged the scots and the ministry at once the auditor set out with professions of moderation and impartiality he did not seek for defamation but it lay in his way and he found it mark his candid declarations in his first number the malevolent are not to expect to be gratified with slander the illiberal with scurrility or the inconsiderate with buffoonery ingredients like these can have no admission into a paper which is undertaken upon principles laudable in themselves which is intended to reconcile the minds of men to their own good and to one another to refute or laugh out of countenance all partydistinctions to extinguish national prejudices and to recommend that spirit of concord which alone can make us a successful and preserve us an happy people in short it is intended in the conduct of this plan to try whether it is possible to talk politics with temper to delineate characters with decency to treat of factions with good humor and to love our country without hating individuals here are mild words and yet in the second number he serves up no less than six or seven individuals and some of them no inconsiderable personages neither and yet even this trifling inconsistency may be accounted for if we recollect that the auditor himself begins his ninth number with this reflection it is a curse entailed upon the retainers to despairing faction that they are not only miserable men and wretched writers but they must be liars into the bargain they must forge crimes to affright the people they must scatter abroad the words of prevarication etc etc  auditor north briton duke of cumberland p d of w duke of newcastle duke of bedford duke of devonshire earl temple earl of bute earl of loudon

briton the whigs the tories the minority the majority against war peace  the above lists not only show who have been the butts of satire to each writer but may also with due attention to the turnings and windings in the court calendar serve as unerring guideposts to point out such as seem to be in the high road to abuse from either paper being made acquainted with the color of the heroes of both parties we know that if a great officer of the court should be turned out or to use the more courtly phrase resign the auditor will immediately tear out the white leaf wherein he so lately sang his praises and like another peachum set his name down in his black book and call on him to exercise the full powers of the christian virtue of resignation we know too that if a noble member of one house should call for an able commoner to lead the business of the other the north briton will immediately open his deep mouth on that leader and maul a manager with as great alacrity as mr thady fitzpatrick but as rules and precepts are never clearly enforced unless illustrated by example i will submit a small peep into futurity to your readers and as i have in some places above rather made extraordinary distinctions in favor of the auditor i shall here pay my particular compliments to the north briton we have already seen whom that writer has abused craving his pardon for the grossness of the expression and the auditors list of scandal craving his pardon also is a pretty exact catalogue of those whom the north briton has praised i shall now therefore mr baldwin take upon me to predict with as much sagacity as partridge or even bickerstaff whom he will praise whom he will abuse and whom he may possibly praise or abuse and for the fulfilling these my predictions i refer to time or even appeal to the second sight of the north briton himself some that are turned out i know he will take every opportunity to praise and that class i shall distinguish by chalk some that are put in i know he cannot resist the temptation of dispraising and that class i shall distinguish by charcoal but there are another class of a dubious indeterminate twilight character whose conduct will not suffer us to speak precisely of the color of their intentions a kind of heterogeneous or amphibious animals hermaphrodites or otters in politics neither in nor out pro nor con court nor country whig nor tory scotch nor english who are like sir anthony branville in a state of fluctuation and hang like mahomets coffin in suspense who seem ready to veer and turn like approved weathercocks with every gust of politics who stand between ay and no like the ass of the schoolmen between two bundles of hay or like prince volscius in love hiphop hiphop one boot on and the other boot off these statesmen of the neuter gender we can place in neither list and yet they seem to bid fair for a place in both where then can we station these lovers of the golden mean but in the middle in the middle therefore upon stilts between both one foot on one list the other foot on the other list i have placed one right hon gentleman as the grand archetype of political skepticism far be it from me to arraign such commendable prudence and moderation but as the north briton is not such an admirer of impartiality i have reason to think that he will not long permit this gentleman to remain in a state of indifferency he will not be content to say of him albus an ater homo sit nescio but having once brought himself to imagine that he has discovered the gentlemans biass he will soon be induced to favor us with a portrait of so distinguished a personage either in chalk or in charcoal  a peep into futurity from the north briton chalk charcoal the right honorable charles townshend duke of grafton

gascoyne paul whitehead   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle thursday april         sir i remember to have seen many letters in your chronicle and other of the public papers against the bill for regulating franks which letters i suppose were written by persons whose interest or convenience was in some measure likely to be affected by the proposed regulation i mr baldwin with due reverence to the hon house i declare it am a member of parliament one of those members who most heartily concurred in passing the bill first of all in a patriot view being persuaded it would make a yearly addition of seventy thousand pounds to the revenue of the post office which is now public property and secondly in a private light imagining it would save myself a great deal of trouble in franking letters for relations friends acquaintance constituents etc etc but alas mr baldwin i find the first of these benefits expected to result from the new limitations very uncertain and the last merely ideal and though i have but little of the leaven of opposition in my temper yet i now most sincerely repent of the concessions i have made and wish that many others as well as myself had insisted more steadily on the preservation of our privilege and not have resigned it almost entirely to the clerks of the post office who will perhaps be as great gainers by these new regulations as the members of both houses will be losers as to the advantage resulting to the revenue from these restrictions i shall leave them to be determined by fact and experience and i shall also show by fact and woeful experience that the trouble usually given to members of parliament in the article of franking instead of being the least diminished will be considerably increased  coming home from the house a few days ago i found lying on my writingtable a large packet with the following superscription mr ls compliments to mr m and begs the favor of him to frank and direct the enclosed covers a dozen with the following address  to mrs l at sir hugh llanvillys at llanvilly park near llanvilly merionethshire wales  half a dozen  to mr latitat attorney at law at bewdly near worcester  half a dozen  to g l esquire of trinity college cambridge  a dozen  to mr l himself in sackvillestreet piccadilly to be used by his son when he writes to him from cambridge and one dozen more  to miss trippit at sir william trippits grovepark berkshire a constant correspondent of mr ls eldest daughter  such mr balwin was the substance of this polite card and give me leave to say that considering mr l is but a common acquaintance with whom i sometimes take a turn in the queens walk or whom i now and then join in a mornings ride in hydepark or meet in an evening at the mount coffeehouse i never saw a more consummate piece of assurance the cool impudence of it startled me at first but on recollection i determined to take no farther notice of it than to order it as we do idle papers in the house to lie upon the table  a very short period since has however convinced me that i am to expect many such applications several other equally modest persons have taken occasion to hint to me that they shall expect the like favor some of whom are people whom i by no means choose to offend and others are such whom i am under some kind of necessity to oblige my wife mr baldwin if you are a married man you will easily conceive that i cannot refuse all the fiddlefaddle correspondence of my four daughters my nieces and some other misses of their particular acquaintance must also pass under my franks and direction as to my constituents as i represent the inhabitants of a most respectable city in the west of england where i am brought in for nothing  that is where no bribery prevails and it only costs me about   00l in treating etc  how i say mr baldwin can i forbear to comply with the demands of my constituents  some of my friends to avoid the trouble of writing their names over and over provided themselves formerly with a stamp but if they could not away with the single trouble of franking how will they digest the additional one of directing another inconvenience is that when the frank and address are both in one hand the enclosed letter must also naturally be supposed to come from the same person it is easy to conceive situations wherein this circumstance must be particularly disagreeable especially to grave old gentlemen like myself whereas before all letters however directed passed without the least imputation on the characters of the lords or gentlemen who franked them i have known a letter to grubstreet pass without astonishment under the sanction of the earl of chesterfield and have seen a cover franked by an archbishop filled up without scandalising even the postman with a direction to haddocks bagnio  such and many more are the inconveniences likely to arise on this occasion to members of parliament but we have brought them on ourselves and must take them for our pains for my part my chief concern is the trouble which i shall endeavor to save by all the means i am able to devise or which you mr b or any of the ingenious correspondents in your chronicle are able to suggest my present intention is to send to the fellow whom we committed to newgate for forging franks and who will necessarily be enlarged at the rising of the parliament offering to take him into pay in case he wants employment and promising to recommend him to several lords and gentlemen of my acquaintance  i am sir your humble servant l m doverstreet  to the printer of the st jamess chronicle saturday april         sir i have seen in your paper the preface to poems by a journeyman shoemaker and have also perused several of the poems themselves with a singular pleasure though i must own with much less surprise than the generality of his readers that stephen duck the thresher should leave the barn for the garret or that jones the bricklayer should attempt to build the lofty rhyme were indeed circumstances somewhat extraordinary unless the first had been contented merely to wield the flail of satire and the last to use the trowel of panegyric neither of which were the case but that james woodhouse the journeyman shoemaker should as the preface tells us sit at his work with a pen and ink by him and when he has made a couplet write it down on his knee is not i think altogether so miraculous as the other two instances since there always appeared to me to be a very strict analogy between versemaking and shoemaking almost every crispin sings at his work why may not our crispinus also compose he may surely by no unnatural association of ideas think at one and the same time of the feet of his verses and the feet of his customers or hammer out a line while he is hammering out the sole of a shoe it is easy also for him to adapt his poetical exercises to the various circumstances of his sandalian employments he may turn his mind to familiar comic subjects privatis and prope socco carminibus while he is manually operating on a pair of leathern socks and he may with the same kind of sympathy between head and hand rise to all the heights of the tragic sublime carmina digna cothurno while he is making a pair of buskins which you know mr baldwin are now very much in fashion if our authors ambition inspires him too soon to epick and to sing with homer  the wellbooted grecians he may work on boots he would i doubt not dispatch a book with every pair especially if he throws in a pair or two of shoes now and then as he goes along by way of episode pindarick odes which are often on equestrian subjects may be dispatched with spatterdashes light airy verses with pumps and all easy careless gentlemanlike compositions with slippers  scholars mr baldwin who want to engross all the provinces of literature do not care that any body should write but themselves and though the muses themselves are females yet if a lady makes verses they are arrogant enough to bid her learn to make a pudding versemaking is in the present age generally speaking as mechanical as shoemaking why then should not a poor mechanic show his industry both ways especially a shoemaker whose profession as i have endeavored to show is so consistent with that of a poet and who can write verses without neglecting his other business or rendering himself liable to the censure contained in the old adage of ne suitor ultra crepidam  i am sir your most humble servant crispinus scriblerus   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle saturday july        sir in a note to one of m deons famous letters written from london to the duke of nivernois is the following remarkable passage  after the earthquakes which happened here in    0 a lifeguard man took it into his head to foretell a third which was to overthrow london he called himself inspired and with an enthusiastical air fixed the day the hour and the minute london being already in a consternation at the remembrance of two shocks at the exact distance of a month from each other and still more terrified at the expected approach of a third more terrible earthquake which the enthusiastical soldier had announced for the  th of april the town showed itself susceptible of all kinds of impressions more than  0000 inhabitants on the faith of this oracle had that day betaken themselves to flight the greater part of those whom the arguments or railleries of their friends had detained waited with trembling the critical instant and showed no kind of courage till it was over when the day arrived the prophecy like most other predictions was not accomplished the false samuel was sent somewhat too late to bedlam and the heads of these fierce islanders so wise and so philosophical were not proof against the prophecy of a madman such mr baldwin are the pictures which frenchmen who come among us frequently draw of our nation taking a hearsay story for fact and passing off misrepresentations for truth they pretend to decide from thence on the manners and character of the people commonly founding their opinions on vague reports idle pamphlets and papers rather than on their own observations on real life thus the story of the bottleconjurer first ridiculed in pamphlets at home gave us among foreigners the character of a credulous people and bielfield mentions it in his letters as an instance of our rage for spectacles as if the whole town had been crammed into the little theater in the haymarket and as if every body there present on that occasion really expected to see a man get into a quart bottle this is the opinion that foreigners generally entertain of that affair and in compliment to their own wisdom they conclude that the english are fools  the subject of m deons note gives them also as they imagine another specimen of our characters and m deon himself having i suppose picked up this story among other tabletalk since his arrival in england puts it into french and flourishes away upon it most triumphantly but did m don see the  0000 who ran out of town no was he in london no in england no but he has heard that a lifeguardman foretold a third earthquake and that some weak people were frightened at it these he calls the town and multiplies them into fifty thousand emigrants and lays on the remaining thousands no other restraint than shame and the fear of ridicule it is easy for a lively frenchman to draw the severest conclusions from such false premises but let me ask him where is that wise and philosophical metropolis among which there are no weak persons and are they the proper persons to fit for the true portrait of a nation suppose exactly the same circumstances had happened at paris would not the bois de boulogne have been as full of coaches as hydepark was on that occasion would it be candid in an englishman residing at paris fourteen years after not only to multiply  00 to  0000 but to throw also the same ridicule which they had drawn on themselves on all the rest of the town and yet would it not be very easy for such an englishman to give himself an insolent air and to say the faith of this bigoted nation was pinned on a prophecy perhaps not half so ridiculous as many other articles of their belief and volatile understandings like chaff before the wind were blown to and fro by the breath of a madman  i am sir your humble servant f g   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle tuesday oct  0      mr baldwin we two who have now determined to become your joint correspondents and like the two hands to pull together on this occasion although like them we are always on different sides we sir we say and our ancestors have been members of parliament time out of mind we as well as our respective predecessors have it is true very often changed our sides but then like partners in a country dance we have each of us crossed over and now and then in case of a coalition of parties joined hands for the sake of figuring in we are in general not a very talkative family delighting chiefly in monosyllables and thinking a word from the wise as well as a word to the wise fully sufficient the truth is we are like sheep a gregarious kind of animal and if one leaps over a hedge or into a ditch all the rest follow but though we have little or no cause at least no ostensible one for our conduct yet we think ourselves infinitely obliged to those ingenious gentlemen who after all is over are so kind as to assign a plausible reason for what we have done the principal end of this letter therefore mr baldwin is to return thanks in both our names to all political writers pro and con auditor and north briton defenders of minority or majority for taking the trouble to investigate the motives of our parliamentary behavior and enabling us to defend our several causes with arguments we never heard nor ever thought of before we are both prepared to enter the scene of business again soon after christmas we know our cues and our parts are but short but when we have performed them we shall be obliged to those gentlemen who will again undertake to show that we seemed to follow nature and that they could not perceive that we were moved like puppets or like live actors stood in need of a prompter we are sir and we are not  your humble servants ay and no   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle thursday nov         intelligence extraordinary drury lane last night was performed at this theater for the first time a new comic opera called the capricious lovers written by mr lloyd and founded as the author informs us on a french piece of monsieur favart called les caprices d amor ou ninette a la cour being no great admirers of operas serious or comic we cannot help saying that we think mr robert lloyd deserves much censure on this occasion for these two reasons first for linking his theatrical labors with those of a composer and secondly for entering the field of opera with the arms of sense and poetry there are charms enough in this piece to seduce us into a liking of this species of the drama and mr lloyd is unwarily sacrificing to a castrato apollo instead of that manly vigorous god of poetry for whom he and his lamented friend churchill have always professed so sincere an adoration and yet after all mr lloyd has entirely mistaken the matter in writing elegant words in order to be adapted to music for it is a fact founded on experience that nothing is so harmonious as nonsense as a recent proof of which maxim we will venture to say that mr rushs composition in the serious opera of the royal shepherd in which opera there was scarce one line of sense was infinitely superior to his musical labors in the capricious lovers in which last entertainment we assigned to the author the first place to the performers who were most excellent the second and to the composer but not without an interval betwixt them the third not that we mean to depreciate the talents of mr rush or that we do not readily allow his having exerted them in the composition of several elegant airs in this opera but merely to observe that perhaps for want of use sense is not so pliant under his hands as nonsense and that he lavished much excellent music on many a melodious for or the or and in the royal shepherd last year which would have been better bestowed had he reserved it for the excellent poetry of the airs in this opera  the dialogue also has much merit as well as the airs for which the author is partly indebted to the original french though we cannot but observe that much of the part of lisetta and all the comic scenes between hobbinol and damon together with their lively appearance in the catastrophe with all which circumstances the audience were so highly entertained are entirely new  the performers did great justice to their characters it would be great injustice not to confess the merit and uncommon excellence of mrs clive mr yates and mr vernon indeed the execution of the whole opera afforded us much entertainment and we liked it but too well  in order to give our country readers a specimen of the words we shall subjoin two songs though indeed they may rather be called elegant little poems than mere airs in the opera there are several others of equal merit  air v when the head of poor tummas was broke by roger who played at the wake and kate was alarmed at

oct  0      notes on the preface to mr johnsons edition of shakespeare published this morning johnsons shakespeare published when this morning  what at last  vix tandem egad he has observed horaces rule of nonum in annum keep the piece nine years as pope says  i know a friend of mine that subscribed in fiftysix  etc etc etc  such perhaps is the language of some little witling who thinks his satirical sallies extremely poignant and severe but the appearance of any production of mr johnson cannot fail of being grateful to the literary world and come when they will like an agreeable guest we are sure to give them a hearty welcome though perhaps we may have betrayed some little impatience at their not coming sooner nor have the public in general been deceived none but subscribers have a right to complain and they i suppose in general meant to show their respect for mr johnson rather than to give themselves a title of becoming clamorous creditors  but granting our editor to be naturally indolent  and naturally indolent we believe him to be  we cannot help wondering at the number vastness and excellence of his productions a dictionary of our language a series of admirable essays in the rambler as well as if we are not misinformed several excellent ones in the adventurer an edition of shakespeare besides some less considerable works all in the space of no very great number of years and all these the productions of a mere idler we could wish there were a few more of such indolent men in these kingdoms  of the general merit of this new edition of shakespeare we cannot now be expected to give any account it was published but this morning but as we obtained a sight of the editors valuable preface a few days ago we shall now oblige our readers with a few extracts from it together with some remarks which we have taken the liberty to subjoin for the freedom of which we make no apology as mr johnson need not now be told that notwithstanding the tenderness due to living reputation and veneration to genius and learning he cannot be justly offended at that liberty of which he has himself so frequently given an example  after some introductory matter concerning the degree of merit which we may suppose to be stamped on works by the suffrage of antiquity the writer proceeds thus  shakespeare is above all writers at least above all modern writers the poet of nature the poet that holds up to his readers a faithful mirror of manners and of life his characters are not modified by the customs of particular places unpractised by the rest of the world by the peculiarities of studies or professions which can operate but upon small numbers or by the accidents of transient fashions or temporary opinions they are the genuine progeny of common humanity such as the world will always supply and observation will always find his persons act and speak by the influence of those general passions and principles by which all minds are agitated and the whole system of life is continued in motion in the writings of other poets a character is too often an individual in those of shakespeare it is commonly a species having given some further illustration of this argument the editor proceeds in the following terms  his adherence to general nature has exposed him to the censure of critics who form their judgments upon narrower principles dennis and rhymer think his romans not sufficiently roman and voltaire censures his kings as not completely royal dennis is offended that menenius a senator of rome should play the buffoon and voltaire perhaps thinks decency violated when the danish usurper is represented as a drunkard but shakespeare always makes nature predominant over accident and if he preserves the essential character is not very careful of distinctions superinduced and adventitious his story requires romans or kings but he thinks only on men he knew that rome like every other city had men of all dispositions and wanting a buffoon he went into the senate house for that which the senate house would certainly have afforded him  he was inclined to show an usurper and a murderer not only odious but despicable he therefore added drunkenness to his other qualities knowing that kings love wine like other men and that wine exerts its natural power upon kings these are the petty cavils of petty minds a poet overlooks the casual distinction of country and condition as a painter satisfied with the figure neglects the drapery  has not mr johnson here made too liberal a concession to dennis and on an examination of the play of coriolanus would it not appear that the character of menenius though marked with the peculiarities of an hearty old gentleman is by no means that of a buffoon many have defended polonius who is much less respectable than menenius  the editor then enters into a very sensible and spirited vindication of the mingled drama of shakespeare and the interchange of serious and comic scenes in the same play his reflections on this subject he closes in the following terms  when shakespeares plan is understood most of the criticisms of rhymer and voltaire vanish away the play of hamlet is opened without impropriety by two sentinels iago bellows at brabantios window without injury to the scheme of the play though in terms which a modern audience would not easily endure the character of polonius is seasonable and useful and the grave diggers themselves may be heard with applause  shakespeare engaged in dramatick poetry with the world open before him the rules of the ancients were yet known to few the public judgment was unformed he had no example of such fame as might force him upon imitation nor critics of such authority as might restrain his extravagance he therefore indulged his natural disposition and his disposition as rhymer has remarked led him to comedy in tragedy he often writes with great appearance of toil and study what is written at last with little facility but in his comic scenes he seems to produce without labor what no labor can improve in tragedy he is always struggling after some occasion to be comic but in comedy he seems to repose or to luxuriate as in a mode of thinking congenial to his nature in his tragic scenes there is always something wanting but his comedy often surpasses expectation or desire his comedy pleases by the thoughts and the language and his tragedy for the greater part by incident and action his tragedy seems to be skill his comedy instinct  this opinion in which mr j concurs with the arch zoilus of our author is however very disputable and we cannot help thinking that what is said in this place as well as what is afterward thrown out on this head in speaking of his faults is infinitely too strong a good comment on parts of othello hamlet lear macbeth and other tragic scenes of shakespeare or perhaps a mere perusal of them would be the best method of confuting these assertions   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle saturday oct         notes on the preface to mr johnsons edition of shakespeare continued in his comic scenes he is seldom very successful when he engages his characters in reciprocations of smartness and contests of sarcasm anglice repartee dryden in one of his prefaces calls it a quick chase of wit but so many writers so many styles  but the admirers of this great poet have most reason to complain when he approaches nearest to his highest excellence and seems fully resolved to sink them into dejection and mollify them with tender emotions by the fall of greatness the danger of innocence or the crosses of love does mr j mean to refer his readers to the fall of wolsey the distresses of lear the murders of duncan and desdemona etc etc or was his mind wholly occupied by some quibbling scenes in romeo and juliet and the midsummers nights dream  a quibble was to him the fatal cleopatra for which he lost the world and was content to lose it has not mr j been as culpably fond of writing upon quibble as shakespeare in persuing it and is not his labored paragraph upon quibble as puerile as a remnant of a schoolboys declamation besides was it not a vice common to all the writers of that age  familiar comedy is often more powerful on the theater than in the page imperial tragedy is always less imperial tragedy such at least as is attended with these effects is of all others the coldest and that tragic writer has but very ill effected the purposes of that species of drama whose productions are more powerful in the page than on the theater cato perhaps may possess more dignity and force in the closet but we know that richard lear othello etc have most power on the stage  those whom my arguments cannot persuade to give their approbation to the judgment of shakespeare will easily if they consider the condition of his life make some allowance for his ignorance there is much good sense sound criticism and fine writing in these observations on the unities and it is certain that a strict observation of the unities of time and place have not only given more trouble to the poet than pleasure to the auditor but have perhaps created as many absurdities as they have prevented yet it were to have been wished that mr j had in this as in all other instances rather maintained the character of a reasoner than assumed that of a pleader all liberties may be carried to an excess and the violation of these unities may be so gross as to become unpardonable shakespeare himself seems to have been sensible of this and therefore introduced the chorus into henry the fifth to waft us from shore to shore and for the same reason he brings in the personage of time in the character of chorus in the winters tale to apologize for the lapse of sixteen years the distance between the supposed birth of perdita and her appearance as the nymph beloved by florizel it might have been worth while therefore to have endeavored in some measure to ascertain how far these unities may allowably be transgressed such an investigation by mr j would have still enhanced the value of this excellent preface and must have been agreeable to all readers  there has always prevailed a tradition that shakespeare wanted learning that he had no regular education nor much skill in the dead languages jonson his friend affirms that he had small latin and no greek mr j certainly quotes from memory in this place the affirmation of ben jonson is that shakespeare had small latin and less greek which implies his having some share of both even in our times a man who has some greek has commonly a pretty competent knowledge of latin  such verse we make when we are writing prose we make such verse in common conversation it is remarkable that dennis though perhaps undesignedly has here exemplified his own observation   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle thursday nov        sir i have seen and read the remarks which you were pleased to subjoin to the extracts from mr johnsons preface to his edition of shakespeare and hope that the same remarker having concluded his comments on the preface will proceed to examine the work itself in the mean time if the following observations on some of our new editors notes on the play of henry the fifth appear to be worth your notice you are welcome to publish them in your chronicle i had no particular reason for singling out this play but when my books for which i had long since subscribed came home the fourth volume happened to be the first that i cut open and harry v the first play that i perused hereafter perhaps if some abler critic does not take the task out of my hands i may send you my observations on some others  first for it is your thoughts that now must deck our kings carry them here and there we should says mr j read king for kings the prologue relates only to this play the mistake was made by referring them to kings which belongs to thoughts not to mention the harshness of referring them to thoughts instead of kings to which it naturally and obviously belongs kings is proper in relation only to this play the kings of france and england are those here intended by shakespeare who says in the same spirit but a few lines before suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies   second hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorrain sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to fine his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt etc this is the reading of the old quarto and dr w very properly explains to fine his title to signify to refine or improve it which interpretation the poets pursuing the allusion by the word corrupt in the next line confirms but dr j would read to line his title which he endeavors to support by a passage from macbeth but besides that the word line occurs in the verse immediately preceding and would therefore have been probably rejected by the most hasty writer had it presented itself the metaphor used in the old reading is more easy and natural  third exeter but there is a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weazel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to taint and havoc more than she can eat  ely it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crushed necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves  crushed necessity the reading here retained in this passage is that of the folios the old quarto has it cursed necessity sir t hanmer reads yet that is not ocourse a necessity   dr w contends for scusd necessity meaning excused and mr j says we might read a crude necessity all the critics concur in supplying a word of the same signification supposing that ely would show that there is not an absolute necessity which indeed is the sense that the whole context taken together seems to point out it appears to me that the old quarto with a very slight emendation would give the true reading omit the single letter s and for cursed necessity which is an error of the press read cured necessity and that small alteration produces the meaning that the context requires and the critics have endeavored to strike out a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance proposes to read a curs necessity in allusion to the fable of the dog in the manger but i think it does not fall in with the rest of the passage  not having any other edition by me at present i cannot tell whether the word pretty in the last line be not an error of the press in mr johnsons if not i should suppose that shakespeare wrote and petty traps to catch the petty thieves   fourth on part of the second chorus mr johnson has the following note and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises ere he takes ship for france and in southampton linger your patience on and well digest the abuse of distance while we force a play the sum is paid the traitors are agreed the king is set from london and the scene is now transported gentles to southampton there is the playhouse now   i suppose every one says mr j that reads these lines looks about for a meaning which he cannot find there is no connection of sense nor regularity of transition from one thought to the other it may be suspected that some lines are lost and in that sense the case is irretrievable i rather think the meaning is obscured by an accidental transposition which i would reform thus and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises the sum is paid the traitors are agreed the king is set from london and the scene is now transported gentles to southampton ere he takes ship for france and in southampton linger your patience on and well digest the abuse of distance while we force a play there is the playhouse now   this alteration continues mr johnson restores sense and probably the true sense the lines might be otherwise ranged but this order pleases me best  but the original order pleases me best mr baldwin nor can i conceive how any reader of the lines can look about for a meaning without finding it or indeed how he can miss finding it under his nose without looking about at all where lies the difficulty in the three first lines let us examine them and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises ere he takes ship for france and in southampton the meaning of this is that there was a plot to kill the king in southampton before he could embark on his french expedition this the king himself explains  this man has for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practices of france to kill us here in hampton   surely the words and in southampton did not puzzle mr johnson can an editor of shakespeare be confounded by an elleipsis so frequent in that author and all other poets the king must die ere he take ship for france and must die in southampton what can be clearer besides the arrangement proposed is much more confused and inelegant than that in which the lines stand at present for instance and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises by placing a full stop in this place instead of a comma and by omitting the third line ere he takes ship for france and in southampton   by these injudicious alterations you are only generally informed of a plot without the alarming particulars given in the original reading and only mark how very aukwardly this poor transposed line is squeezed into another corner the sum is paid the traitors are agreed the king is set from london and the scene is now transported gentles to southampton ere he take ship for france and in southampton linger your patience on and well digest the abuse of distance while we force a play there is the playhouse now here i think comes out that the unfortunate words and in southampton were the stumbling blocks to our editor but is not this new disposition of the lines much for the worse and would one not almost be tempted to suppose from the great distance between the king and the relative pronoun he that the scene was to take ship for france  the proposed alteration therefore introduces confusion instead of restoring sense and the old reading in this case as in most others gives the true sense the lines indeed might perhaps be otherwise ranged but this order is the most natural and the best    fearing that i may have already trespassed too far on your paper i shall reserve the continuation of these remarks till you hear from me again perhaps mr baldwin you may hear from me again and again and again in the mean time i remain  your constant reader and humble servant christopher dennis   to the printer of the st jamess chronicle hydeparkcorner saturday march         sir if you ever on sundays or holydays bestow eighteenpence a side on a horse and turn his head toward the west you may probably have beheld me your present correspondent placed close against hydepark wall a little beyond st georges hospital my traveling name or rather the name which travelers on the western road have given me is captain nose a kind of cognomen derived after the roman custom from the most remarkable prominence of a certain feature of my face tully from a similar reason was surnamed cicero and ovid was called naso from the very same cause that i have been christened captain nose the poet on account of some illicit amors was driven into exile i who am a veteran in the military service am rewarded as handsomely as many other veterans and while the soldiers of the three regiments of foot guards are put into wooden boxes to watch the ducks in st jamess park i am stationed a perpetual centry against hydepark wall to observe the motions of all the goers and comers in and out of this extensive metropolis  if you ever were at paris mr baldwin you must know that it is impossible to pass any of the barriers without an impertinent fellow of an officer tearing open your coach door to see that you do not export or import so much as a bottle of sour wine without defraying the duties on it were i to take the same liberty with every coach that passes by my station such is the jealousy of military establishments in this free country that i might probably in less than a week fall into the hands of the civil power be seized by fieldings runners be carried to give an account of myself before the bowstreet police and perhaps ultimately be conveyed out of town again toward the northwest when i might be allotted a more disagreeable station than that which i occupy at present to say the truth i do not want to take so near an inspection of passengers as an highwaymans horse for it is easy enough to see how the world goes even with half an eye and though you may perceive that i only glance at them in profile yet they do not drive so hastily along but i am able to give a tolerable account of them such an account if you think it will be of service to your chronicle is occasionally at your service the tatler pretended to maintain an intercourse with a spirit called pacolet do not you then disdain a correspondent in crayons for perhaps even the notified connoisseur mr town did not collect more intelligence from his cousin village than you may receive from me nor did even the spectator reap more advantages from his inquisitive short face than you may derive from my long nose master baldwin  at present writing mr baldwin i have only time to send you the following hasty advices however if they

       sir a reverend estimator of the manners and principles of the times lately deceased pronounced effeminacy to be the characteristick of the britons of the present age how unjustly voltaire no friend to this country has taken notice observing that the english answered the charge by carrying their conquests into every quarter of the globe  were i to attempt to assign the reigning principle that governs all ranks and orders of men in this kingdom i should not hesitate to mention the spirit of prodigality and extravagance which may now be said to be epidemical raging with equal violence in court and city town and country and confounding high and low rich and poor one with another  set a beggar on horseback says the old english proverb and he will ride to the devil though the devil himself as sir francis wronghead observes would scarce imagine that he would ride post to him and yet at present every beggar has got on horseback and seems resolved to run a race with his superiors  that he who has nothing or perhaps is worse than nothing should not be afraid of being ruined is not very wonderful but that they who are as happy as a good fortune can make them should take the greatest pains to divest themselves of the means of that happiness i have ever thought very extraordinary that a frog should swell with envy and burst itself in order to become a bull is a fable whose moral one may readily comprehend but what aesop of antiquity would have described the noble bull tormented with the same mean pride and roaring and tossing and bellowing till it reduced itself even below the state of the wretched animal it mighttrample on  great goingsout to quote another old saying must have great comings in he who now lives to the extent of his fortune if he multiplies his expenses must multiply his resources or see ruin before him some minds are apt not to be very scrupuloussy delicate in the choice of those resources a shopkeepers apprentice perhaps commits violence on the till an attorneys clerk takes to the gamingtable a tradesman makes a break of it and cheats his honest creditors of eighteen shillings in the pound a genteel buck takes to the turf and a true blood to the heath as to superior orders the gentry and nobility they are above committing these petty larcenies on society if a great commoner a lord or a duke run out they need not descend to these mean shifts they need not attack individuals but realise the wish of caligula and cut off the head of a nation at one blow they need not be guilty of burglaries turn rooks and sharpers commit fraudulent bankruptcies or put travelers into bodily fear on the kings highway they have an opportunity of prostituting their votes selling boroughs etc  in short they may unite all the abovementioned glorious characters in one they may turn robbers of their country  one of the chief schools or rather academies of modern extravagance is the gaminghouse the pupils and students are the rich the professors they who want to get their riches gamesters say the french begin by being dupes and end by being sharpers and perhaps it is impossible even in this country to become an adept in the science without going through the degrees the several colleges of arthurs almacks boodles saunders etc etc in the two parishes of st james and st george have a numerous list of scholars and disciples on their books and should one venture to point out those whom every body acknowledges to be as well read in the mystical parts of the art as lookup himself who knows but one might incur the danger of a praemunire or scandalum magnatum  i beg your pardon ladies i have not said a syllable about you in particular yet awhile it is true but when extravagance is mentioned as a characteristick of the manners of the present age you must be allowed to have your share of it many an honest gentleman has been ruined by his wifes inordinate desire to outvie the wife of his neighbor a violent passion for dress equipage and company are avowedly female failings but gaming that fiend which is too hot even for masculine souls has usurped a dominion over the minds of our countrywomen conversation and fireside society is almost quite lost among us familyvisits blindmansbuff and hotcockles are no more every evening assembly is a route and cards the occupation of every meeting at which every body who plays play higher than they can afford from the pennyquadrille of blackfriars to the unlimited lu in the liberties of westminster  extravagance however like many other vices commonly counteracts itself and defeats its own ends prodigals even during the short period of their splendour rather render themselves ridiculous than important in the eyes of the multitude the world is commonly furnished with materials to judge pretty accurately of the income of particulars and they who seem palpably to exceed the measure of their circumstances instead of creating admiration excite pity or contempt it would seem almost incredible therefore did not experience confute all speculation that any persons should be so mad as to forfeit all the future happiness of their lives for the sake of exposing themselves to public derision for a few short months or at most for a very few years the patience of creditors is soon exhausted and a distressed gentleman who is often put upon ways and means will soon find it very difficult and at last quite impossible to raise the supplies he that will not take up in good time and put himself under a proper regimen for the evils incurred by his extravagance may be assured that the disease will at last cure itself an acquaintance of mine who loves a pun often compares a prodigal to a clock he can go says he as long as he can tick but when he can tick no longer he must stand i would recommend it therefore to every man who is about to contract debts to consider whether he shall be able to pay them and before he adopts a new system of living to ask himself seriously whether he shall be able to support it  i cannot better wind up this rambling dissertation than by annexing to it a copy of a manuscript now in my possession the original i am told was written by that famous military character so celebrated by pope swift and voltaire the e of p  h the personage to whom it was addressed as a familiar epistle is still living and was then in

naturalists never perishes the form indeed is eternally varying but the essence remains the face of whole countries may change animals die plants decay and palaces fall to ruin dust returns to dust but the several atoms are not lost we may with hamlet trace alexander to the stopping a beerbarrel or follow the eminent botanist dr hill till we leave him among the compost of a hotbed of cucumbers  the moral world in the opinion of some speculatists resembles the material they imagine that the certain portion of virtue and vice good and ill qualities which originally actuated mankind is neither increased nor diminished forms of government and modes of politeness may indeed have turned them to different shapes tinged them with different colors and transferred them to different possessors but they have a permanent existence and it would be as absurd to maintain that they are annihilated because they no longer reside in the same persons or retain their old names as to contend that montaguehouse is pulled down because it is rendered the british museum or that sir hans sloanes curiosities are all lost because they are all lodged in montaguehouse  to what region the virtues that have left this island are flown it is difficult to discover but in the moral system there seems at present to be going on a kind of countrydance between the male and female follies and vices in which they have severally crossed over and taken each others places the men are growing delicate and refined and the women free and easy there is indeed a kind of animal neither male nor female a thing of the neuter gender lately started up amongst us it is called a macaroni it talks without meaning it smiles without pleasantry it eats without appetite it rides without exercise it wenches without passion  i may perhaps on some future occasion be ample in animadversion on those ladylike gentlemen who despairing to be thought men are ambitious of resembling women at present i shall rather confine my observations to those adventurous and spirited females who seem resolved to break though the whalebone and buckram fences of modesty and decorum and would no more endure starch in their manners than in a pair of laced ruffles a certain masculine air now distinguishes the ladies and if you see a female enter a public place with a bold knockmedown freedom set her down for a person of

certainly a genius but of a particular stamp he is an excellent classical scholar perhaps one of the best latinists in europe he has combined in himself two talents which seldom meet he is both a good english and latin poet had his inclination led him to have mixed with the fashionable world where he was warmly invited and had he been a nearer inspector of the follies and vices of high life he would certainly have been called by the election of the best critics to the poetical chair where pope sat without a rival till his death and then the laurel like the kingdom of macedonia at the death of alexander was divided among many it must be owned that dr johnsons two satires in imitation of juvenal are among the best titles that have been produced for the poetical inheritance  indeed his morals and manners are so ill suited with loose opinions and thoughtless dissipation that it is no wonder he was soon disgusted with what he saw and heard and which he so well painted and felt in his london  his second satire the tenth of juvenal though written with great force and energy yet seems more the fruit of study than observation his sagacity is wonderful though nearsighted he can discover and describe with great humor the nice discriminations and almost imperceptible touches of the various characters of both sexes his  minds eye has a keenness and certainty that seldom misses the mark and did his pen convey his discoveries in characteristick language he would be equal to the best writers  but here he fails  in his ramblers and idlers whenever he introduces characters their actions deportment and thoughts have a most accurate and minute resemblance to nature but they all talk one language and that language is dr johnsons words are the vehicle of our thoughts as coaches are of our persons the stateequipage should not be drawn forth but upon solemn occasions his peculiarity of diction has given the public a suspicion that he could not succeed in dramatick composition his tragedy of irene is a work of great and just sentiment of poetical though not dramatick language fine imagery and of the osmagna sonaturum but the very soul of tragedy pathos is wanting and without that though we may admire our hearts will sleep in our bosoms  dr johnson has wit humor and a strong imagination which are often exerted with great effect in conversation i will give in a few words the best advice i can to young readers let them admire and study his strength of argument richness of imagery and variety of sentiment without being dazzled with the splendour of his diction let them listen with attention and delight to his entertaining and improving conversation without imitating his dress or manner  the simplex munditiis of horace may perhaps for the first time be as

unnatural to imagine that on the first glance of your eye over the advertisement of a new pamphlet addressed to yourself you are apt to feel some little emotion that you bestow more than ordinary attention on the title as it stands in the newspaper and take notice of the name of the publisher  is it compliment or abuse  one of these being determined you are perhaps eager to be satisfied whether some coarse hand has laid on encomiums with a trowel or some more elegant writer such as the author of the actor for instance has done credit to himself and you by his panegyric or on the other hand whether any offended genius has employed those talents against you which he is ambitious of exercising in the service of your theater or some common scribe has taken your character as he would that of any other man or woman or minister or the king if he durst as a popular topic of scandal  be not alarmed on the present occasion nor with that consciousness of your own merit so natural to the celebrated and eminent indulge yourself in an acquiescence with the justice of ten thousand fine things which you may suppose ready to be said to you no private satire or panegyric but the general good of the republic of letters and of the drama in particular is intended though praise and dispraise stand ready on each side like the vessels of good and evil on the right and left hand of jupiter i do not mean to dip into either or if i do it shall be like the pagan godhead himself to mingle a due proportion of each sometimes perhaps i may find fault and sometimes bestow commendation but you must not expect to hear of the quickness of your conception the justice of your execution the expression of your eye the harmony of your voice or the variety and excellency of your deportment nor shall you be maliciously informed that you are shorter than barry leaner than quin and less a favorite of the upper gallery than woodward or shuter  the following pages are destined to contain a vindication of the works of massinger one of our old dramatick writers who very seldom falls much beneath shakespeare himself and sometimes almost rises to a proud rivalship of his chiefest excellencies they are meant too as a laudable though faint attempt to rescue these admirable pieces from the too general neglect which they now labor under and to recommend them to the notice of the public to whom then can such an essay be more properly inscribed than to you whom that public seems to have appointed as its chief arbiter deliciarum to preside over the amusements of the theater  but there is also by the bye a private reason for addressing you your honest friend davies who as is said of the provident comedians in holland spends his hours of vacation from the theater in his shop is too well acquainted with the efficacy of your name at the top of a playbill to omit an opportunity of prefixing it to a new publication hoping it may prove a charm to draw in purchasers like the head of shakespeare on his sign my letter too being anonymous your name at the head will more than compensate for the want of mine at the end of it and our abovementioned friend is no doubt too well versed in both his occupations not to know the consequence of secrecy in a bookseller as well as the necessity of concealing from the public many things that pass behind the curtain  there is perhaps no country in the world more subordinate to the power of fashion than our own every whim every word every vice every virtue in its turn becomes the mode and is followed with a certain rage of approbation for a time the favorite style in all the polite arts and the reigning taste in letters are as notoriously objects of caprice as architecture and dress a new poem or novel or farce are as inconsiderately extolled or decried as a ruff or a chinese rail a hoop or a bow window hence it happens that the public taste is often vitiated or if by chance it has made a proper choice becomes partially attached to one species of excellence and remains dead to the sense of all other merit however equal or superior  i think i may venture to assert with a confidence that on reflection it will appear to be true that the eminent class of writers who flourished at the beginning of this century have almost entirely superseded their illustrious predecessors the works of congreve vanbrugh steel addison pope swift gay etc etc are the chief study of the million i say of the million for as to those few who are not only familiar with all our own authors but are also conversant with the ancients they are not to be circumscribed by the narrow limits of the fashion shakespeare and milton seem to stand alone like firstrate authors amid the general wreck of old english literature milton perhaps owes much of his present fame to the generous labors and good taste of addison shakespeare has been transmitted down to us with successive glories and you sir have continued or rather increased his reputation you have in no fulsome strain of compliment been styled the best commentator on his works but have you not like other commentators contracted a narrow exclusive veneration of your author has not the contemplation of shakespeares excellencies almost dazzled and extinguished your judgment when directed to other objects and made you blind to the merit of his cotemporaries under your dominion have not beaumont and fletcher nay even johnson suffered a kind of theatrical disgrace and has not poor massinger whose cause i have now undertaken been permitted to languish in obscurity and remained almost entirely unknown  to this perhaps it may be plausibly answered nor indeed without some foundation that many of our old plays though they abound with beauties and are raised much above the humble level of later writers are yet on several accounts unfit to be exhibited on the modern stage that the fable instead of being raised on probable incidents in real life is generally built on some foreign novel and attended with romantic circumstances that the conduct of these extravagant stories is frequently uncouth and infinitely offensive to that dramatick correctness prescribed by late critics and practiced as they pretend by the french writers and that the characters exhibited in our old plays can have no pleasing effect on a modern audience as they are so totally different from the manners of the present age  these and such as these might once have appeared reasonable objections but you sir of all persons can urge them with the least grace since your practice has so fully proved their insufficiency your experience must have taught you that when a piece has any striking beauties they will cover a multitude of inaccuracies and that a play need not be written on the severest plan to please in the representation the mind is soon familiarized to irregularities which do not sin against the truth of nature but are merely violations of that strict decorum of late so earnestly insisted on what patient spectators are we of the inconsistencies that confessedly prevail in our darling shakespeare what critical catcall ever proclaimed the indecency of introducing the stocks in the tragedy of lear how quietly do we see gloucester take his imaginary leap from dover cliff or to give a stronger instance of patience with what a philosophical calmness do the audience dose over the tedious and uninteresting lovescenes with which the bungling hand of tate has coarsely pieced and patched that rich work of shakespeare  to instance further from shakespeare himself the gravediggers in hamlet not to mention polonius are not only endured but applauded the very nurse in romeo and juliet is allowed to be nature the transactions of a whole history are without offense begun and completed in less than three hours and we are agreeably wafted by the chorus or oftener without so much ceremony from one end of the world to another  it is very true that it was the general practice of our old writers to found their pieces on some foreign novel and it seemed to be their chief aim to take the story as it stood with all its appendant incidents of every complexion and throw it into scenes this method was to be sure rather inartificial as it at once overloaded and embarrassed the fable leaving it destitute of that beautiful dramatick connection which enables the mind to take in all its circumstances with facility and delight but i am still in doubt whether many writers who come nearer to our own times have much mended the matter what with their plots and doubleplots and counterplots and underplots the mind is as much perplexed to piece out the story as to put together the disjointed parts of our ancient drama the comedies of congreve have in my mind as little to boast of accuracy in their construction as the plays of shakespeare nay perhaps it might be proved that amidst the most open violation of the lesser critical unities one point is more steadily pursued one character more uniformly shown and one grand purpose of the fable more evidently accomplished in the productions of shakespeare than of congreve  these fables it may be further objected founded on romantic novels are unpardonably wild and extravagant in their circumstances and exhibit too little even of the manners of the age in which they were written the plays too are in themselves a kind of heterogeneous composition scarce any of them being strictly speaking a tragedy comedy or even tragicomedy but rather an indigested jumble of every species thrown together  this charge must be confessed to be true but upon examination it will perhaps be found of less consequence than is generally imagined these dramatick tales for so we may best style such plays have often occasioned much pleasure to the reader and spectator which could not possibly have been conveyed to them by any other vehicle many an interesting story which from the diversity of its circumstances cannot be regularly reduced either to tragedy or comedy yet abounds with character and contains several affecting situations and why such a story should lose its force dramatically related and assisted by representation when it pleases under the colder form of a novel is difficult to conceive experience has proved the effect of such fictions on our minds and convinced us that the theater is not that barren ground wherein the plants of imagination will not flourish the tempest the midsummer nights dream the merchant of venice as you like it twelfth night the faithful shepherdess of fletcher with a much longer list that might be added from shakespeare beaumont and fletcher and their cotemporaries or immediate successors have most of them within all our memories been ranked among the most popular entertainments of the stage yet none of these can be denominated tragedy comedy or tragicomedy the play bills i have observed cautiously style them plays and plays indeed they are truly such if it be the end of plays to delight and instruct to captivate at once the ear the eye and the mind by situations forcibly conceived and characters truly delineated  there is one circumstance in dramatick poetry which i think the chastised notions of our modern critics do not permit them sufficiently to consider dramatick nature is of a more large and liberal quality than they are willing to allow it does not consist merely in the representation of real characters characters acknowledged to abound in common life but may be extended also to the exhibition of imaginary beings to create is to be a poet indeed to draw down beings from another sphere and endue them with suitable passions affections dispositions allotting them at the same time proper employment to body forth by the powers of imagination the forms of things unknown and to give to airy nothing a local habitation and a name surely requires a genius for the drama equal if not superior to the delineation of personages in the ordinary course of nature shakespeare in particular is universally acknowledged never to have soared so far above the reach of all other writers as in those instances where he seems purposely to have transgressed the laws of criticism he appears to have disdained to put his free soul into circumscription and confine which denied his extraordinary talents their full play nor gave scope to the boundlesness of his imagination his witches ghosts fairies and other imaginary beings scattered through his plays are so many glaring violations of the common table of dramatick laws what then shall we say shall we confess their force and power over the soul shall we allow them to be beauties of the most exquisite kind and yet insist on their being expunged and why except it be to reduce the flights of an exalted genius by fixing the standard of excellence on the practice of inferior writers who wanted parts to execute such great designs or to accommodate them to the narrow ideas of small critics who want souls large enough to comprehend them  our old writers thought no personage whatever unworthy a place in the drama to which they could annex what may be called a seity that is to which they could allot manners and employment peculiar to itself the severest of the ancients cannot be more eminent for the constant preservation of uniformity of character than shakespeare and shakespeare in no instance support his characters with more exactness than in the conduct of his ideal beings the ghost in hamlet is a shining proof of this excellence  but in consequence of the custom of tracing the events of a play minutely from a novel the authors were sometimes led to represent a mere human creature in circumstances not quite consonant to nature of a disposition rather wild and extravagant and in both cases more especially repugnant to modern ideas this indeed required particular indulgence from the spectator but it was an indulgence which seldom missed of being amply repaid let the writer but once be allowed as a necessary datum the possibility of any characters being placed in such a situation or possessed of so peculiar a turn of mind the behavior of the character is perfectly natural shakespeare though the child of fancy seldom or never dressed up a common mortal in any other than the modest dress of nature but many shining characters in the plays of beaumont and fletcher are not so well grounded on the principles of the human heart and yet as they were supported by spirit they were received with applause shylocks contract with the penalty of the pound of flesh though not shakespeares own fiction is perhaps rather improbable at least it would not be regarded as a happy dramatick incident in a modern play and yet having once taken it for granted how beautifully nay how naturally is the character sustained  even this objection therefore of a deviation from nature great as it may seem will be found a plea insufficient to excuse the total exclusion of our ancient dramatists from the theater shakespeare you will readily allow possessed beauties more than necessary to redeem his faults beauties that excite our admiration and obliterate his errors true but did no portion of that divine spirit fall to the share of our other old writers and can their works be suppressed or concealed without injustice to their merit  one of the best and most pleasing plays in massinger and which we are told was originally received with general approbation is called the picture the fiction whence it takes its title and on which the story of the play is grounded may be collected from the following short scene mathias a gentleman of bohemia having taken an affecting leave of his wife sophia with a resolution of serving in the king of hungarys army against the turks is left alone on the stage and the play goes on as follows  math i am strangely troubled yet why should i nourish a fury here and with imagined food having no real grounds on which to raise a building of suspicion she ever was or can be false hereafter i in this but foolishly inquire the knowledge of a future sorrow which if i find out my present ignorance were a cheap purchase though with my loss of being i have already dealt with a friend of mine a general scholar one deeply read in natures hidden secrets and though with much unwillingness have won him to do as much as art can to resolve me my fate that follows  to my wish he is come enter baptista julio baptista now i may affirm your promise and performance walk together and therefore without circumstance to the point instruct me what i am  bapt i could wish you had made trial of my love some other way  math nay this is from the purpose  bapt if you can proportion your desire to any mean i do pronounce you happy i have found by certain rules of art your matchless wife is to this present hour from all pollution free and untainted  math good  bapt in reason therefore you should fix here and make no farther search of what may fall hereafter  math o baptista it is not in me to master so my passions i must know farther or you have made good but half your promise  while my love stood by holding her upright and my presence was a watch upon her her desires being met too with equal ardour from me what one proof could she give of her constancy being untempted but when i am absent and my coming back uncertain and those wanton heats in women not to be quenched by lawful means and she the absolute disposer of herself without control or curb nay more invited by opportunity and all strong temptations if then she hold out   bapt as no doubt she will  math those doubts must be made certainties baptista by your assurance or your boasted art deserves no admiration how you trifle and play with my affliction i am on the rack till you confirm me  bapt sure mathias i am no god nor can i dive into her hidden thoughts or know what her intents are that is denied to art and kept concealed even from the devils themselves they can but guess out of long observation what is likely but positively to fortell that this shall be you may conclude impossible all i can i will do for you when you are distant from her a thousand leagues as if you then were with her you shall know truly when she is solicited and how far wrought on  math i desire no more  bapt take then this little model of sophia with more than human skill limnd to the life each line and lineament of it in the drawing so punctually observed that had it motion in so much twere herself  math it is indeed an admirable piece but if it have not some hidden virtue that i cannot guess at in what can it advantage me  bapt i will instruct you carry it still about you and as often as you desire to know how she is affected with curious eyes peruse it while it keeps the figure it now has entire and perfect she is not only innocent in fact but unattempted but if once it vary from the true form and what is now white and red incline to yellow rest most confident she is with all violence courted but unconquered but if it turn all black it is an assurance the fort by composition or surprise is forced or with her free consent surrendered  nothing can be more fantastic or more in the extravagant strain of the italian novels than this fiction and yet the play raised on it is extremely beautiful abounds with affecting situations true character and a faithful representation of nature the story thus opened proceeds as follows mathias departs accompanied by his friend and serves as a volunteer in the hungarian army against the turks a complete victory being obtained chiefly by means of his valor he is brought by the general to the hungarian court where he not only receives many honors from the king but captivates the heart of the queen whose passion is not so much excited by his known valor or personal attractions as by his avowed constancy to his wife and his firm assurance of her reciprocal affection and fidelity to him these circumstances touch the pride and raise the envy of the queen she resolves therefore to destroy his conjugal faith by giving up her own and determines to make him a desperate offer of her person and at the same time under pretense of notice of mathiass being detained for a month at court she dispatches two young noblemen to tempt the virtue of sophia these incidents occasion several affecting scenes both on the part of the husband and wife mathias not with an unnatural and untheatrical stoism but with the liveliest sensibility nobly withstands the temptations of the queen sophia though most virtuously attached to her husband becomes uneasy at the feigned stories which the young lords recount to her of his various gallantries at court and in a fit of jealousy rage and resentment makes a momentry resolution to give up her honor while she is supposed to be yet under the dominion of this resolution occurs the following scene between the husband and his friend  mathias and baptista bapt we are in a desperate straight there is no evasion nor hope left to come off but by your yielding to the necessity you must feign a grant to her violent passion or   math what my baptista  bapt we are but dead else  math were the sword now heaved up and my neck upon the block i would not buy an hours reprieve with the loss of faith and virtue to be made immortal here art thou a scholar nay almost without a parallel and yet fear to die which is inevitable you may urge the many years that by the course of nature we may travel in this tedious pilgrimage and hold it as a blessing as it is when innocence is our guide yet know baptista our virtues are preferred before our years by the great judge to die untainted in our fame and reputation is the greatest and to lose that can we desire to live or shall i for a momentary pleasure which soon comes to a period to all times have breach of faith and perjury remembered in a still living epitaph no baptista since my sophia will go to her grave unspotted in her faith i will follow her with equal loyalty but look on this your own great work your masterpiece and then she being still the same teach me to alter ha sure i do not sleep or if i dream the picture altered this is a terrible vision i will clear my eyesight perhaps melancholy makes me see that which is not  bapt it is too apparent i grieve to look upon it besides the yellow that does assure she is tempted there are lines of a dark color that disperse themselves over every miniature of her face and those confirm   math she is turned whore  bapt i must not say so yet as a friend to truth if you will have me interpret it in her consent and wishes she is false but not in fact yet  math fact baptista make not yourself a pander to her looseness in laboring to palliate what a vizard of impudence cannot cover did ever woman in her will decline from chastity but found means to give her hot lust full scope it is more possible in nature for gross bodies descending of themselves to hang in air or with my single arm to underprop a falling tower nay in its violent course to stop the lightning than to stay a woman hurried by those two furies lust and falsehood in her full career to wickedness  bapt pray you temper the violence of your passion  math in extremes of this condition can it be in man to use a moderation i am thrown from a steep rock headlong into a gulf of misery and find myself past hope in the same moment that i apprehend that i am falling and this the figure of my idol few hours since while she continued in her perfection that was late a mirror in which i saw miraculous shapes of duty staid manners with all excellency a husband could wish in a chaste wife is on the sudden turned to a magical gla and does present nothing but horns and ror  bapt you may yet and it is the best foundation build up comfort on your own goodness  math no that has undone me for now i hold my temperance a sin worse than excess and what was a vice a virtue have i refused a queen and such a queen whose ravishing beauties at the first sight had tempted a hermit from his beads and changed his prayers to amorous sonnets to preserve my faith inviolate to thee with the hazard of my death with torture since she could inflict no less for my contempt and have i met such a return from thee i will not curse thee nor for thy falsehood rail against the sex it is poor and common i will only with wise men whisper unto myself however they seem nor present nor past times nor the age to come has heretofore can now or ever shall produce one constant woman  bapt this is more than the satyrists wrote against em  math there is no language that can express the poison of these aspicks these weeping crocodiles and all too little that has been said against em but i will mould my thoughts into another form and if she can outlive the report of what i have done this hand when next she comes within my reach shall be her executioner  the fiction of the picture being first allowed the most rigid critic will i doubt not confess that the workings of the human heart are accurately set down in the above scene the play is not without many others equally excellent both before and after it nor in those days when the power of magic was so generally believed that the severest laws were solemnly enacted against witches and witchcraft was the fiction so bold and extravagant as it may seem at present hoping that the reader may by this time be somewhat reconciled to the story or even interested in it i will venture to subjoin to the long extracts i have already made from this play one more speech where the picture is mentioned very beautifully mathias addresses himself to the queen in these words  math to slip once i incident and excused by human frailty but to fall ever damnable we were both guilty i grant in tendering our affection but as i hope you will do i repented when we are grown up to ripeness our life is like to this picture while we run a constant race in goodness it retains the just proportion but the journey being tedious and sweet temptations in the way that may in some degree divert us from the road that we put forth in ever we end our pilgrimage it may like this turn yellow or be with blackness clouded but when we find we have gone astray and labor to return unto our neverfailing guide virtue contrition with unfeigned tears the spots of vice washed off will soon restore it to the first pureness  the several passages will i hope be thought by the judicious reader to be written in the free vein of a true poet as well as by the exact hand of a faithful disciple of nature if any of the above arguments or rather the uncommon excellence of the great writers themselves can induce the critic to allow the excursions of fancy on the theater let him not suppose that he is here advised to submit to the perversion of nature or to admire those who overleap the modest bounds which she has prescribed to the drama i will agree with him that plays wherein the truth of dramatick character is violated can convey neither instruction nor delight shakespeare jonson beaumont and fletcher massinger etc are guilty of no such violation indeed the heroic nonsense which overruns the theatrical productions of dryden nobody can have a truer veneration for the poetical genius of dryden than the writer of these reflections but surely that genius is no where so much obscured notwithstanding some transient gleams as in his plays of which he had himself no great opinion since the only plea he ever urged in their favor was that the town had ever received with applause plays equally bad nothing perhaps but the notion of heroic plays could have carried the immediate successors to the old class of writers into such ridiculous contradictions to nature that i may not appear singular in my opinion of drydens dramatick pieces i must beg leave to refer the reader to the rambler no     where that judicious writer has produced diverse instances from drydens plays sufficient to use the ramblers own language to awaken the most torpid risibility  howard and the other illustrious prototypes of bays in the rehearsal must nauseate the most indulgent spectator the temporary rage of false taste may perhaps betray the injudicious into a foolish admiration of such extravagance for a short period but how will these plays stand the blunt of critical indignation when the personages of the drama are found to resemble no character in nature except perhaps the disordered inhabitants of bedlam  if then it must be confessed both from reason and experience that we cannot only endure but attend with pleasure to plays which are almost merely dramatick representations of romantic novels it will surely be a further inducement to recur to the works of our old writers when we find among them many pieces written on a severer plan a plan more accommodated to real life and approaching more nearly to the modern usage the merry wives of windsor of shakespeare the fox the alchymist the silent woman every man in his humor of jonson the new way to pay old debts the city madam of massinger etc etc all urge their claim for a rank in the ordinary course of our winterevening entertainments not only clear of every objection made to the abovementioned species of dramatick composition but adhering more strictly to ancient rules than most of our later comedies  in point of character perhaps the most essential part of the drama our old writers far transcend the moderns it is surely needless in support of this opinion to recite a long list of names when the memory of every reader must suggest them to himself the manners of many of them it is true do not prevail at present what then is it displeasing or uninstructive to see the manners of a former age pass in review before us or is the mind undelighted at recalling the characters of our ancestors while the eye is confessedly gratified at the sight of the actors dressed in their antique habits moreover fashion and custom are so perpetually fluctuating that it must be a very accurate piece indeed and one quite new and warm from the anvil that catches the damon or cynthia of this minute some plays of our latest and most fashionable authors are grown as obsolete in this particular as those of the first writers and it may with safety be affirmed that bobadil is not more remote from modern character than the everadmired and everywheretobemetwith lord foppington it may also be further considered that most of the best characters in our old plays are not merely fugitive and temporary they are not the sudden growth of yesterday or today sure of fading or withering tomorrow but they were the delight of past ages still continue the admiration of the present and to use the language of true poetry  to ages yet unborn appeal and latest time the eternal nature feel lloyds actor  there is one circumstance peculiar to the dramatick tales and to many of the more regular comedies of our old writers of which it is too little to say that it demands no apology it deserves the highest commendation since it has been the means of introducing the most capital beauties into their compositions while the same species of excellence could not possibly enter into those of a later period i mean the poetical style of their dialogue most nations except our own have imagined mere prose which with molieres bourgeois gentilhomme the meanest of us have talked from our cradle too little elevated for the language of the theater our neighbors the french at this day write most of their plays comedies as well as tragedies in rhyme a gothic practice which our own stage once admitted but long ago wisely rejected the grecian iambick was more happily conceived in the true spirit of that elegant and magnificent simplicity which characterized the taste of that nation such a measure was well accommodated to the expressions of the mind and though it refined indeed on nature it did not contradict it in this as well as in all other matters of literature the usage of greece was religiously observed at rome plautus in his richest vein of humor is numerous and poetical the comedies of terence though we cannot agree to read them after bishop hare were evidently not written without regard to measure which is the invincible reason why all attempts to render them into downright prose have always proved and ever must prove unsuccessful and if a faint effort now under contemplation to give a version of them in familiar blank verse after the manner of our old writers but without a servile imitation of them should fail it must i am confident be owing to the lameness of the execution the english heroic measure or as it is commonly called blank verse is perhaps of a more happy construction than even the grecian iambick elevated equally but approaching nearer to the language of nature and as well adapted to the expression of comic humor as to the pathos of tragedy  the mere modern critic whose idea of blank verse is perhaps attached to that empty swell of phraseology so frequent in our late tragedies may consider these notions as the effect of bigotry to our old authors rather than the result of impartial criticism let such an one carefully read over the works of those writers for whom i am an advocate there he will seldom or ever find that tumor of blank verse to which he has been so much accustomed he will be surprised with a familiar dignity which though it rises somewhat above ordinary conversation is rather an improvement than perversion of it he will soon be convinced that blank verse is by no mens appropriated solely to the buskin but that the hand of a master may mould it to whatever purposes he pleases and that in comedy it will not only admit humor but heighten and embellish it instances might be produced without number it must however be lamented that the modern tragic style free indeed from the mad flights of dryden and his cotemporaries yet departs equally from nature i am apt to think it is in great measure owing to the almost total exclusion of blank verse from all modern compositions tragedy excepted the common use of an elevated diction in comedy where the writer was often of necessity put upon expressing the most ordinary matters and where the subject demanded him to paint the most ridiculous emotions of the mind was perhaps one of the chief causes of that easy vigor so conspicuous in the style of the old tragedies habituated to poetical dialogue in those compositions wherein they were obliged to adhere more strictly to the simplicity of the language of nature the poets learnt in those of a more raised species not to depart from it too wantonly they were well acquainted also with the force as well as elegance of their mother tongue and chose to use such words as may be called natives of the language rather than to harmonise their verses and agonise the audience with latin terminations whether the refined style of addisons cato and the flowing versification of row first occasioned this departure from ancient simplicity it is difficult to determine but it is too true that southern was the last of our dramatick writers who was in any degree possessed of that magnificent plainness which is the genuine dress of nature though indeed the plays even of row are more simple in their style than those which have been produced by his successors it must not however be dissembled in this place that the style of our old writers is not without faults that they were apt to give too much into conceits that they often pursued an allegorical train of thought too far and were sometimes betrayed into forced unnatural quaint or gigantick expressions in the works of shakespeare himself every one of these errors may be found yet it may be safely asserted that no other author ancient or modern has expressed himself on such a variety of subjects with more ease and in a vein more truly poetical unless perhaps we should except homer of which by the bye the deepest critic most conversant with idioms and dialects is not quite a competent judge  i would not be understood by what i have here said of poetical dialogue to object to the use of prose or to insinuate that our modern comedies are the worse for being written in that style it is enough for me to have vindicated the use of a more elevated manner among our old writers i am well aware that most parts of falstaff ford benedick malvolio etc are written in prose nor indeed would i counsel a modern writer to attempt the use of poetical dialogue in a mere comedy a dramatick tale indeed chequered like life itself with various incidents ludicrous and affecting if written by a masterly hand and somewhat more severely than those abovementioned would i doubt not still be received with candor and applause the public would be agreeably surprised with the revival of poetry on the theater and the opportunity of employing all the best performers serious as well as comic in one piece would render it still more likely to make a favorable impression on the audience there is a gentleman not unequal to such a task who was once tempted to begin a piece of this sort but i fear he has too much love of ease and indolence and too little ambition of literary fame ever to complete it  but to conclude  have i sir been wasting all this ink and time in vain or may it be hoped that you will extend some of that care to the rest of our old authors which you have so long bestowed on shakespeare and which you have so often lavished on many a worse writer than the most inferior of those here recommended to you it is certainly your interest to give variety to the public taste and to diversify the color of our dramatick entertainments encourage new attempts but do justice to the old the theater is a wide field let not one or two walks of it alone be beaten but lay open the whole to the excursions of genius this perhaps might kindle a spirit of originality in our modern writers for the stage who might be tempted to aim at more novelty in their compositions when the liberality of the popular taste rendered it less hazardous that the narrowness of theatrical criticism might be enlarged i have no doubt reflect for a moment on the uncommon success of romeo and juliet and every man in his humor and then tell me whether there are not many other pieces of as ancient a date which with the like proper curtailments and alterations would produce the same effect has an industrious hand been at the pains to scratch up the dunghill of drydens amphitryon for the few pearls that are buried in it and shall the rich treasures of beaumont and fletcher jonson and massinger lie as it were in the ore untouched and disregarded reform your list of plays in the name of burbage tailor and betterton i conjure you to it let the veteran critics once more have the satisfaction of seeing the maids tragedy philaster king and no king etc on the stage  restore fletchers elder brother to the rank unjustly usurped by cibbers love makes a man and since you have wisely desisted from giving an annual affront to the city by acting the london cuckolds on lordmayors day why will you not pay them a compliment by exhibiting the city madam of massinger on the same occasion  if after all sir these remonstances should prove without effect and the merit of these great authors should plead with you in vain i will here fairly turn my back upon you and address myself to the lovers of dramatick compositions in general they i am sure will peruse those works with pleasure in the closet though they lose the satisfaction of seeing them represented on the stage nay should they together with you concur in determining that such pieces are unfit to be acted you as well as they will i am confident agree that such pieces are at least very worthy to be read there are many modern compositions seen with delight at the theater which sicken on the taste in the perusal and the honest country gentleman who has not been present at the representation wonders with what his london friends have been so highly entertained and is as much perplexed at the townmanner of writing as mr smith in the rehearsal the excellencies of our old writers are on the contrary not confined to time and place but always bear about them the evidences of true genius  massinger is perhaps the least known but not the least meritorious of any of the old class of writers his works declare him to be no mean proficient in the same school he possesses all the beauties and blemishes common to the writers of that age he has like the rest of them in compliance with the custom of the times admitted scenes of a low and gross nature which might be omitted with no more prejudice to the fable than the buffoonry in venice preserved for his few faults he makes ample atonement his fables are most of them affecting his characters well conceived and strongly supported and his diction flowing various elegant and manly his two plays revived by betterton the bondsman and the roman actor are not i think among the number of the best the duke of milan the renegado the picture the fatal dowry the maid of honor a new way to pay old debts the unnatural combat the guardian the city madam are each of them in my mind more excellent he was a very popular writer in his own times but so unaccountably as well as unjustly neglected at present that the accurate compilers of a work called the lives of the poets published under the learned name of the late mr theophilus cibber have not so much as mentioned him he is however take him for all in all an author whose works the intelligent reader will peruse with admiration and that i may not be supposed to withdraw my plea for his admission to the modern stage i shall conclude these reflections with one more specimen of his abilities submitting it to all judges of theatrical exhibitions whether the most masterly actor would not here have an opportunity of displaying his powers to advantage  the extract i mean to subjoin is from the last scene of the first act

while this part of the work was printing the running title of  prose on several occasions intended only for the miscellaneous letters and papers has been continued to these  critical reflections on our old english writers  preface to the works of beaumont and fletcher published in the year      preface to the works of beaumont and fletcher considering the acknowledged excellence of our authors loudly acknowledged by the most eminent of their contemporaries and successors it appears at first sight rather wonderful that in the space of a hundred and fifty years which have elapsed since the death of these poets no more than three complete editions of their works have been published we say three because the first folio professedly included no more of their plays than those which had not before been singly printed in quarto  to what causes are we to attribute this amazing disparity between the reputation of the writers and the public demand for their productions are libraries furnished with books as apartments with furniture according to the fashion or is it necessary because plays were originally written to be acted that they must continue to be perpetually represented or cease to be read  truth we fear obliges us to confess that these questions must without much qualification be answered in the affirmative shakespeare admirable as he is certainly owes some part of his present popularity and the extraordinary preference given to his plays beyond those of all our other dramatists to the mode adopted by the literary world to extol him by the changes of fashion nature and right reason sometimes come into vogue but the multitude take them like coin because they are in currency while men of sense and letters alone appreciate them according to their intrinsic value and receive merit wherever they find it as bullion though it has not the stamp of fashion impressed on it to such men the genius of shakespeare instead of obscuring illustrates the kindred talents of beaumont and fletcher yet such men are but rare and one of the most acute and learned editors of shakespeare speaking of his own notes concerned in a critical explanation of the authors beauties and defects but chiefly of his beauties whether in style thought sentiment character or composition adds that the public judgment has less need to be assisted in what it shall reject than in what it ought to prize nor is the value they set upon a work a certain proof that they understand it for it is ever seen that half a dozen voices of credit give the lead and if the public chance to be in good humor or the author much in their favor the people are sure to follow  to the popularity of a dramatick writer nothing more immediately contributes than the frequency of theatrical representation common readers like barren spectators know little more of an author than what the actor not always his happiest commentator presents to them mutilations of shakespeare have been recited and even quoted as his genuine text and many of his dramas not in the course of exhibition are by the multitude not honored with a perusal on the stage indeed our authors formerly took the lead dryden having informed us that in his day two of their plays were performed to one of shakespeare the stage however owes its attraction to the actor as well as author and if the able performer will not contribute to give a polish and brilliancy to the work it will lie like the rough diamond obscured and disregarded the artists of former days worked the rich mine of beaumont and fletcher and betterton the roscius of his age enriched his catalogue of characters from their dramas as well as those of shakespeare unfortunately for our authors the roscius of our day confined his round of characters in old plays too closely to shakespeare we may almost say of him indeed in this respect as dryden says of shakespeares scenes of magic within that circle none durst walk but he but surely we must lament that those extraordinary powers which have so successfully been exerted in the illustration of shakespeare and sometimes prostituted to the support of the meanest writers should not more frequently have been employed to throw a light upon beaumont and fletcher their plays we will be bold to say have the same excellencies as well as the same defects each perhaps in an inferior degree with the dramas of their great master like his they are built on histories or novels pursuing in the same manner the story through its various circumstances like his but not always with equal truth and nature their characters are boldly drawn and warmly colored like his their dialogue containing every beauty of style and licentiousness of construction is thick sown with moral sentiments interchanged with ludicrous and serious ribaldry and sublime and sometimes enlivened with wit in a richer vein than even the immortal dramas of shakespeare in comedy the critics of their own days and those immediately succeeding gave beaumont and fletcher the preference to shakespeare and although the slow award of time has at length justly decreed the superior excellence of the glorious father of our drama beyond all further appeal yet these his illustrious followers ought not surely to be cast so far behind him as to fall into contemptuous neglect while the most careless works of shakespeare are studiously brought forward the maids tragedy king and no king loves pilgrimage monsieur thomas etc etc etc would hardly disgrace that stage which has exhibited the two gentlemen of verona  mr seward has employed great part of his preface in citing similar passages from shakespeare and our authors and though we do not entirely agree with him in the comparisons he has drawn we cannot resist the temptation of adducing one instance in our opinion more to the advantage of our authors than any mentioned in that preface it is the entire character of the boy hengo in the tragedy of bonduca a character whch is we think taken altogether better sustained and more beautifully natural and pathetick than the prince arthur of shakespeare the scene in king john between arthur and hubert excellent as it is almost passes the bounds of pity and terror and becomes horrible besides which shakespeare to whom a quibble as dr johnson says was the fatal cleopatra for which he lost the world and was content to lose it has enervated the dialogue with many frigid conceits which he has with more than usual impropriety put into the mouth of the innocent arthur while he is pleading most affectingly for mercy  as for example  will you put out mine eyes these eyes that never did nor never shall so much as frown on you  hub i have sworn to do it and with hot irons must i burn them out  arth ah none but in this iron age would do it the iron of itself though heat red hot approaching near these eyes would drink my tears and quench its fiery indignation even in the matter of mine innocence nay after that consume away in rust but for containing fire to harm mine eye are you more stubbornhard than hammered iron oh if an angel should have come to me and told me hubert should put out mine eyes i would not have believed him no tongue but huberts    and again  go to hold your tongue  arth hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert or hubert if you will cut out my tongue so i may keep mine eyes oh spare mine eyes though to no use but still to look on you lo by my troth the instrument is cold and would not harm me  hub i can heat it boy  arth no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief being create for comfort to be used in undeserved extremes see else yourself there is no malice in this burning coal the breath of heaven has blown its spirit out and strewn repentant ashes on its head  hub but with my breath i can revive it boy  arth and if you do you will but make it blush and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes and like a dog that is compelled to fight snatch at his master that does tar him on all things that you should use do me wrong deny their office only you do lack that mercy which fierce fire and iron extend creatures of note for mercylacking uses    the reader we imagine will concur in our disapprobation of the passages printed in italicks between caratach and hengo we do not remember that a line occurs affected or unnatural and nothing can be more exquisitely tender than the several scenes between them the whole play abounds with dramatick and poetic excellence  allowing however freely allowing the general superiority of shakespeare to beaumont and fletcher and indeed to all other poets homer perhaps only excepted yet we cannot so far degrade our authors as to reduce the most excellent of their pieces to a level with the meanest effusions of shakespeare nor can we believe that there are not many of their longneglected dramas that might not with very inconsiderable variations be accommodated to the taste of a modern audience the public have been long habituated to the phraseology of shakespeare whose language in the opinion of dryden is a little obsolete in comparison of that of our authors and irregularities of fable have been not only pardoned but defended when the great english actor of whom we have been speaking first undertook the direction of the stage his friend the present laureat boldly told him a nations taste depends on you the national taste under his happy influence acquired from day to day from year to year an increased relish for shakespeare and it is almost matter of amazement as well as concern that so little of his attention was directed to those dramatick writers whose poetical character bore so great an affinity to the just object of his admiration a deceased actor of great merit and still greater promise very successfully opened his theatrical career by appearing in the tragedy of philaster at the same time the same tragedy contributed not a little to the growing fame of one of our principal actresses that play the two noble kinsmen and some other pieces of beaumont and fletcher besides those we have already enumerated would undoubtedly become favorite entertainments for the stage if the theatrical talents of the performers bore any kind of proportion to the dramatick abilities of the writers since the directors of our theaters in some sort hold the keys of the temple of dramatick fame let them do honor to themselves by throwing open their doors to beaumont and fletcher seeing there are at present but small hopes of emulating the transcendent actor who so long and so effectually impressed on our minds the excellence of shakespeare let them at least rescue their performers from an immediate comparison so much to their disadvantage by trying their force on the characters of our authors the two noble kinsmen indeed has been ascribed falsely as we think to shakespeare the two noble kinsmen says pope if that play be his as there goes a tradition it was and indeed it has little resemblance of fletcher and more of our author than some of those which have been received as genuine unhappy poets whose very excellence is turned against them shakespeares claim to any share in the two noble kinsmen we have considered at the end of that piece to which we refer the reader in this place we shall only enter our protest against the authority of pope who appears to have felt himself mortified and ashamed when he discharged the dull duty of an editor he surely must be allowed to discharge his duty with reluctance and most probably with neglect who speaks of it in such terms in his preface indeed he has with a most masterly hand drawn the outline of the poetical character of shakespeare but in that very preface by a strange perversion of taste he proposes to throw out of the list of shakespeares plays the winters tale which he considers as spurious on no better foundation we think has he asserted that the play of the two noble kinsmen has little resemblance of fletcher there goes a tradition that garth did not write his own dispensary there goes a tradition that the admirable translator of homer like shakespeare himself had little latin and less greek but what candid critic would countenance such a tradition and is such a vague blind playhouse tradition a sufficient warrant for one great poet to tear the laurel from the brows of another  the modern editors of shakespeare contemplate with admiration that indifference to future fame which suffered him to behold with uncommon apathy some of his pieces incorrectly printed during his life without attempting to rescue them from the hands of barbarous editors or preparing for posterity a genuine collection of his works supervised and corrected by himself in our opinion the dedication and preface of heminge and condell more than insinuate the intention of shakespeare had he survived to have published such a collection we hope that they outliving him and he not having the fate common with some to be exequutor to his own writings etc dedication of shakespeares works by heminge and condell it had been a thing we confess worthy to have been wished that the author himself had lived to have set forth and overseene his own writings but since it has been ordained otherwise and he by death departed from that right we pray you do not envy his friends the office of their care and pain to have collected and published them preface of heminge and condell  but be that as it may his supposed carelessness concerning the fate of his pieces after they had been represented is not so very singular many of the plays of beaumont and fletcher also having been inaccurately printed from stolen copies during the lives of the authors and the remainder collected some years after their deaths like the works of shakespeare by the players ben jonson appears to have been the only dramatick poet of that age who paid any attention to the publication of his own compositions  the old quarto copies of beaumont and fletcher have come down to us exactly in the same state with the old quartos of shakespeare the printers of those times not only copied but multiplied the errors of the transcriber an editor nay even a corrector of the press seems to have been a character of which they had not the smallest conception even the titlepages appear to exhibit the very names of the authors at random sometimes announcing the play as the work of one poet sometimes of another and sometimes as the joint production of both a bookseller is somewhere introduced as reprehending the saving ways of an odewriter who he supposed merely to lengthen his work would often put no more than three or four words into a line the old printers seem to have conceived the same idea of the parsimony of poets and therefore often without scruple run verse into prose not adverting to measure or harmony but solely governed by the dimensions of the page whether divided into columns or carried all across from one scanty margin to another their orthography their orthography etc to this article our ancestors seem to have afforded very little attention ingenions for ingenuous alter for altar cozen for cousin desert for defart talents for talons then for than etc etc continually occur in the old books nor does there seem to have been any greater regard paid to proper names one of our poets for instance we find called fleatcher flecher and fletcher and the other beamont beamount and beaumont the name of shakespeare is spelt at least a dozen ways we are told in the first note on the dunciad of an autograph of shakespeare himself whereby it appeared that he spelt his own name without the first e yet even this autograph is not decisive in the registerbook at stratford upon avon the name of the family is regularly entered shakspere in the poets own will which now lies in the prerogativeoffice doctors commons his name is spelt three different ways in the body of the will it is always written shackspere this however may be ascribed to the lawyer the will consists of three sheets the first of which is legibly subscribed shackspere the two others shakspeare it must be acknowledged that the handwriting as well as situation of the first signature is different from that of the two following but it appears extraordinary that a stranger should attempt to falsify a signature which is usually ascribed to each sheet for the sake of giving authenticity to so solemn an instrument and is therefore always taken to be the handwriting of the testator mr garrick however had in his possession the lease of a house formerly situated in blackfriars and but lately taken down on account of the new bridge which belonged to that poet as a party to that lease he signs his name shakspeare and the first syllable of his name is now pronounced in his native county warwickshire with the short a shak and not shakespeare on the other hand it must be confessed that the dialect of that county is more provincial than classical and we believe that all the families who are now known by the poets name both spell and pronounce it shakespeare which indeed seems most reconcilable to etimology if etimology be at all concerned in so capricious a circumstance many of the quartos published in his lifetime not only followed this mode of spelling but seemed nicely to mark the proper pronunciation by printing his name in the title page with a hyphen between the two syllables that compose it thus shakespeare his cotemporary jonson as well as milton and dryden his successors adhered to the same orthography every thing however trivial interests an english reader from the relation it bears to that great poet which is the only excuse we have to offer for so long a note on a point of so little importance is so generally vicious and unsettled and their punctuation so totally defective that the regulation of either rarely merits the triumphs that have so often been derived from it on the whole however these old copies of our poets may by an intelligent reader be perused with satisfaction the typographical errors are indeed gross and numerous but their very number and grossness keeps the reader awake to the genuine text and commonly renders such palpable inaccuracies not prejudicial the genuine work of the author is there extant though the lines are often like a confused multitude huddled on one another and not marshalled and arrayed by the discipline of a modern editor  the first folio containing thirtyfour of our authors pieces never till then collected or printed was published by the players obviously transcribed from the prompters books commonly the most inaccurate and barbarous of all manuscripts or made out piecemeal from the detached parts copied for the use of the performers hence it happens that the stagedirection has sometimes crept into the text and the name of the actor is now and then substituted for that of the character the transcribers knowing perhaps no language perfectly corrupted all languages and vitiated the dialogue with false latin false french false italian and false spanish nay as pope says of the old copies of shakespeare their very welsh is false  the players however notwithstanding the censure of pope yet from cibber sore seem to have been at least with regard to our poets as faithful and able editors as others of that period it is most natural to suppose that the playhouse manuscript contained the real work of the author though perhaps ignorantly copied and accommodated to the use of the theater a writer in his closet often silently acquiesces in the excellence of a continued declamation but if at any time the audience like polonius cry out this is too long such passages are afterward naturally curtailed or omitted in the representation but the curious reader being less fastidious than the proud spectator for in such terms horace speaks of the spectator is pleased with the restoration of these passages in print players says pope are just such judges of what is right as tailors are of what is graceful the comparison is more ludicrous and sarcastick than it is just the poet himself who makes the clothes may rather be called the tailor actors are at most but the empty beaux that wear them and the spectators censure or admire them a tailor however if players must be the tailors though not equal in science to a statuary or an anatomist must yet be conceived to have a more intimate knowledge of the human form than a blacksmith or a capenter and if many of the actors know but little of the drama they would probably have known still less of it had they not been retainers to the stage some improvements as well as corruptions of the drama may undoubtedly be derived from the theater cibber idle cibber wrote for the stage with more success than pope aeschylus sophocles plautus and terence were soldiers and freedmen shakespeare and moliere were actors  the second folio contained the first complete collection of the works of beaumont and fletcher concerning that edition we have nothing to add to what has been said by other editors  the octavo editors of      seemed to aim at little more than reprinting our authors plays and giving a collection of them more portable and convenient than the folios their text however is more corrupt than that of either the quartos or folios the errors of which they religiously preserved adding many vicious readings of their own some of which have been combated in very long notes by their successors  in the year      theobald on the success and reputation of his shakespeare projected an edition of the works of ben jonson what he had executed of it fell into the hands of mr whalley and is inserted in that learned and ingenious gentlemans edition at the same time he exhibited proposals for a publication of the plays of beaumont and fletcher in which he was afterward assisted by mr seward and mr sympson but theobald dying before he had committed more than the first and about half the second volume to the press the undertaking was continued by the two lastmentioned gentlemen and the edition thus jointly or rather severally executed by theobald mr seward and mr sympson at length appeared in the year    0 these gentlemen were the first editors of our poets who professed to collate the old copies to reform the punctuation and to amend the corruptions of the text some attempts also were made to elucidate the obscurities and enforce the excellencies of their authors how far we disagree or coincide with them will appear on inspection of the particular passages to which their several observations refer at present it will be sufficient to declare that we should have been inclined to entertain a more respectful opinion of their labors if they had not very early betrayed that confidence which every reader is tempted to repose in an editor not only by their carelessness but by the more unpardonable faults of faithlessness and misrepresentation their reports of the state of the old copies can never safely be taken on trust and on examination many of those copies will appear to be both negligently collated and untruly quoted their punctuation also notwithstanding their occasional selfapprobation is almost as inaccurate as that of the most ancient and rude editions and their critical remarks have in our opinion oftener been well intended than conceived their work however has in the main conduced to the illustration of our authors and we have seized every fair occasion to applaud the display of their diligence as well as the efforts of their critical acuteness and sagacity such of their notes as appeared incontestible or even plausible we have adopted without remark to those more dubious we have subjoined additional annotations those of less consequence we have abridged and those of no importance we have omitted  in the present edition it has been our chief aim to give the old text as it lies in the old books with no other variations but such as the writers themselves had they superintended an impression of their works or even a corrector of the press would have made yet even these variations if at all important have not been made in silence notes however have been subjoined to the text as briefly and as sparingly as possible but the lapse of time and fluctuation of language have rendered some notes necessary for the purpose of explaining obsolete words unusual phrases old customs and obscure or distant allusions critical remarks and conjectural emendations have been seldom hazarded nor has any ridicule been wantonly thrown on former editors who have only sometimes been reprehended for pompous affectation and more frequently for want of care and fidelity every material comment on these plays has been retained in this edition though often without the long and ostentatious notes that first introduced those comments to the public at the same time we have religiously attributed every observation critical or philological to its due author not wishing to claim any praise as editors but by industriously endeavoring as an act of duty to collect from all quarters every thing that might contribute to illustrate the works of beaumont and fletcher  to conclude we have beheld with pity and indignation the mean parade of many modern editors and we have endeavored to fulfill their duties without imbibing their arrogance we are perhaps too proud to indulge so poor a vanity at least we are too much occupied to litigate readings we think of small importance and too honest to claim restorations not our own or to propose readings as corrections that are no more than restorations the stationer has not disgraced our authors with tobaccopaper the press we trust has done its duty and the rollingpress at a very considerable expense has added its assistance the cuts if we are not deceived are for the most part happily designed and well executed and will probably be deemed an agreeable addition to the work at least we may with truth assert that no authors in the english language published at the same price have so many and so valuable engravings  the province of a painter and an editor are directly opposite in the first instance the canvas receives its chief value from the artist and in the second the artist derives almost all his consequence from the canvas the editor if he lives is carried down the stream of time by his author and if the author be excellent and his commentary judicious still shall his little bark attendant sail pursue the triumph and partake the gale for our parts we have been incited to this undertaking from a real admiration of these poets grounded as we apprehend on their genuine excellencies and a thorough persuasion that the works of beaumont and fletcher may proudly claim a second place in the english drama nearer to the first than the third to those of shakespeare some of their plays being so much in his manner that they can scarcely be distingushed to be the work of another hand  appendix to the second edition of the translation of the comedies of terence published in the year      appendix to the second edition of the translation of the comedies of terence the reverend and ingenious mr farmer in his curious and entertaining essay on the learning of shakespeare having done me the honor to animadvert on some passages in the preface to this translation i cannot dismiss this edition without declaring how far i coincide with that gentleman although what i then threw out carelessly on the subject of his pamphlet was merely incidental nor did i mean to enter the lists as a champion to defend either side of the question  it is most true as mr farmer takes for granted that i had never met with the old comedy called the supposes nor has it even yet fallen into my hands yet i am willing to grant on mr farmers authority that shakespeare borrowed part of the plot of the taming of the shrew from that old translation of ariostos play by george gascoign and had no obligations to plautus i will accede also to the truth of dr johnsons and mr farmers observation that the line from terence exactly as it stands in shakespeare is extant in lilly and udalls flowers for latin speaking still however shakespeares total ignorance of the learned languages remains to be proved for it must be granted that such books are put into the hands of those who are learning those languages in which class we must necessarily rank shakespeare or he could not even have quoted terence from udall or lilly nor is it likely that so rapid a genius should not have made some further progress our author says dr johnson as quoted by mr farmer had this line from lilly which i mention that it may not be brought as an argument of his learning it is however an argument that he read lilly and a few pages further it seems pretty certain that the author of the taming of the shrew had at least read ovid from whose epistles we find these lines hac ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus hic steterat priami regia celsa senis and what does dr johnson say on this occasion nothing and what does mr farmer say on this occasion nothing  in loves labors lost which bad as it is is ascribed by dr johnson himself to shakespeare there occurs the word thrasonical another argument which seems to show that he was not unacquainted with the comedies of terence not to mention that the character of the schoolmaster in the same play could not possibly be written by a man who had traveled no further in latin than hic haec hoc  in henry the sixth we meet with a quotation from virgil tantaene animis coelestibus irae but this it seems proves nothing any more than the lines from terence and ovid in the taming of the shrew for mr farmer looks on shakespeares property in the comedy to be extremely disputable and he has no doubt but henry the sixth had the same author with edward the third which has been recovered to the world in mr capells prolusions  if any play in the collection bears internal evidence of shakespeares hand we may fairly give him timon of athens in this play we have a familiar quotation from horace ira furor brevis est   i will not maintain but this hemistich may be found in lilly or udall or that it is not in the palace of pleasure or the english plutarch or that it was not originally foisted in by the players i stands however in the play of timon of athens  the world in general and those who purpose to comment on shakespeare in particular will owe much to mr farmer whose researches into our old authors throw a luster on many passages the obscurity of which must else have been impenetrable no future upton or gildon will go further than norths translation for shakespeares acquaintance with plutarch or balance between dares phrygius and the troy book of lydgate the history of hamblet in black letter will for ever supersede saxo grammaticus translated novels and ballads will perhaps be allowed the sources of romeo lear and the merchant of venice and shakespeare himself however unlike bays in other particulars will stand convicted of having transversed the prose of holingshead and at the same time to prove that his studies lay in his own language the translations of ovid are determined to be the production of heywood  that his studies were most demonstratively confined to nature and his own language i readily allow but does it hence follow that he was so deplorably ignorant of every other tongue living or dead that he only remembered perhaps enough of his schoolboy learning to put the hig hag hog into the mouth of sir h evans and might pick up in the writers of the time or the course of his conversation a familiar phrase or two of french or italian in shakespeares plays both these last languages are plentifully scattered but then we are told they might be impertinent additions of the players undoubtedly they might but there they are and perhaps few of the players had much more learning than shakespeare  mr farmer himself will allow that shakespeare began to learn latin i will allow that his studies lay in english but why insist that he neither made any progress at school nor improved his acquisitions there the general encomiums of suckling denham milton etc on his native genius mr farmer closes these general testimonies of shakespeares have been only indebted to nature by saying he came out of her hand  some one else expresses it like pallas out of joves head at full gro and mature it is whimsical enough that this some one else wh expression is here quoted to countenance the general notion of shakespeares want of literature should be no other than myself mr farmer does  choose to mention where he met with this expression of some one else  some one else does not choose to mention where he dropped it  prove nothing and ben jonsons celebrated charge of shakespeares small latin and less greek in defense of the various reading of this passage given in the preface to the last edition of shakespeare small latin and no greek mr farmer tells us that it was adopted above a century ago by w towers in a panegyric on cartwright surely towers having said that cartwright had no greek is no proof that been jonson said so of shakespeare  seem absolutely to decide that he had some knowledge of both and if we may judge by our own time a man who has any greek is seldom without a very competent share of latin and yet such a man is very likely to study plutarch in english and to read translations of ovid  postscript this appendix to the second edition of the translation of terence would not have had a place in this collection if it had not repeatedly appeared among the numerous prolegomena to the late variorum editions of shakespeare accompanied with annotations which seem to require some notice  mr steevens in a preface subjoined to that of dr johnson having first declared that the dispute about the learning of shakespeare is now finally settled the reader is at the close of the copy of this appendix referred to dr farmers reply in a note on loves labors lost act ii sc ii p     edit of       the note in question according to the custom of the editors is rather long but i trust i shall do no injustice to dr farmers argument by selecting only his part of it  dr warburton is certainly right in his supposition that florio is meant by the character of holofernes florio had given the first affront the plays says he that they play in england are neither right comedies nor right tragedies but representations of histories without any decorum  the scraps of latin and italian are transcribed from his works particularly the proverb about venice which has been corrupted so much the affectation of the letter which argues facility is likewise a copy of his manner we meet with much of it in the sonnets to his patrons  in italy your lordship well has seen their manners monuments magnificence their language learnt in sound in style in sense proving by profiting where you have been to add to forelearnd faculty facility we see then the character of the schoolmaster might be written with less learning than mr colman conjectured nor is the use of the word thrasonical any argument that the author had read terence it was introduced to our language long before shakespeares time stanyhurst writes in a translation of one of sir thomas mores epigrams lynckt was in wedlock a lofty thrasonical hufsnuffe   it can scarcely be necessary to animadvert any further upon what mr colman has advanced in the appendix to his terence if this gentleman at his leisure from modern plays will condescend to open a few old ones he will soon be satisfied that shakespeare was obliged to learn and repeat in the course of his profession such latin fragments as are met with in his works the formidable one ira furor brevis est which is quoted from timon may be found not in plays only but in every tritical essay from that of king james to that of dean swift inclusive i will only add that if mr colman had previously looked at the panegyric on cartwright he could not so strangely have misrepresented my argument from it but thus it must ever be with the most ingenious men when they talk without book let me however take this opportunity of acknowledging the very genteel language which he has been pleased to use on this occasion  mr warton informs us in his life of sir thomas pope that there was an old play of holophernes acted before the princess elizabeth in the year       farmer  in the edition of shakespeare published in      this appendix again appears with the same reference to dr farmers reply and the addition of the following annotation on the last note in the appendix  it will appear still more whimsical that this some one else whose expression is here quoted may have his claim to it superseded by that of the late dr young who in his conjectures on original composition p  00 vol v edit      has the following sentence an adult genius comes out of natures hands as pallas out of joves head at full growth and mature shakespeares genius was of this kind where some one else the first may have intermediately dropped the contested expression i cannot ascertain but some one else the second trancribed it from the author already mentioned  anon  i flatter myself that my remarks on the subject of the learning of shakespeare and my idea of the extent of his literature were not extravagant and that i expressed myself in such terms as were not calculated to provoke censure or ridicule for my own part though i took no decided part in the question i must confess that the wit and pleasantry of the replies and annotations have not materially altered my opinion which the editors would have more fairly submitted to their readers if dr farmers reply had been given with the appendix instead of being transferred to another volume because some part of his observations related to a character of the play contained in it i must own too that i was rather surprised to see the reverend essayist whose remarks i had treated so respectfully making his reply as a flippant annotator on another publication and rising from the bottom of the page of loves labors lost under the wing of that editor whom in the second impression of his essay he had styled  one of the first critics of the age who was pleased to declare on reading the former edition that the question is now for ever decided with what complacency these acute critics interchange flatteries and compliments and how freely do they throw out censures and sarcasms upon others giving currency to each by annexing them to the popular text of shakespeare  the note of dr farmer referred to in the appendix concerning shakespeares small latin and less greek in the first edition of his essay      stands thus  this passage of ben jonson so often quoted is given us in the admirable preface to the late edition with a various reading small latin and no greek which has been held up to the public for a modern sophistication yet whether an error or not it was adopted above a century ago by a panegyrist on cartwright  on reading the above note i confess that i did not think it necessary to consult towerss panegyric on cartwright taking it for granted on the essayists note that towers had applied the line to the subject of his panegyric as jonson had done before him and yet i cannot even after this frank concession account for dr farmers triumph on so slight a misapprehension that does not at all affect the main question or establish the authority of the various reading the passage in the verses of towers prefixed to the works of cartwright printed in      runs thus thy skill in wit was not so poorly meek as theirs whose little latin and no greek confined their whole discourse to a street phrase such dialect as their next neighbors was   from this quotation it will not only appear that i have at length consulted the panegyric on cartwright but that when talking without book i had not so strangely misrepresented the doctors argument from it his own note to the first edition of his essay certainly tended to countenance the various reading of  small latin and no greek by the adoption of the line by towers his comment on the appendix implies either from my wilfulness or carelessness a misrepresentation of his argument but surely whether towers applied the disputed line to cartwright or his supposed rivals in the drama was of no real consequence though by the by his adoption contains more various readings than one and yet the testimony of ben jonson on which i grounded my opinion remains unimpeached on the whole then have not the critics strangely misrepresented my argument  i give due praise to the ingenious but anonymous annotator in the last edition of shakespeare who has clearly proved that dr farmer transcribed his allusion to pallas from dr young and not from some one else the thought is obvious and might without improbability occur to different writers but the similarity of expression  at full growth and mature proves beyond controversy from whence in the present instance the allusion was taken but after all what is that matter to the learning of shakespeare  on that subject i never engaged myself as a champion on either side of the question but having been in some sort forced into the dispute i cannot but seize every occasion to applaud the ingenuity as well as indefatigable industry of the variorum editors who in the same vein of argument may hereafter proceed to prove that shakespeare could neither read nor write the almost illegible plate engraved after his handwriting will not perhaps convince every inspector that the poet did not write his name as his cotemporaries on the stage have handed it down to us though it differs not only from the recent orthography of the editors those new tuners of accents as well as from the stratford parish register to which mr bell in the impression from his apollo press has religiously adhered the latin in his plays is still allowed to hold its place but we are told lest the reader should be dazzled by it that shakespeare was obliged to read and repeat in the course of his profession such latin fragments as are found in his works and we are expected to embrace this opinion  before his poems inscribed in his own name to his noble patron southampton stand as a motto two lines from ovid as palpable as those in the taming of the shrew but perhaps it will at length be discovered that those poems were not written by shakespeare or if they were that the lines had before been prefixed to some other black lettered pamphlet of that age or at least that been jonson in compassion to his illiterate friend suggested the motto which the shakescene of the times for so the witlings of the day favoring the old orthography called shakespeare could not himself supply  in return for the civilities of the variorum editors i beg leave to propose a small emendation in their list of plays altered from shakespeare in which they have done me the honor of attributing to me without any authority two alterations of the midsummer nights dream of the first it is true i attended the rehearsals at the express desire of mr garrick on his going abroad but the revival as i foretold failing of success the piece was by my advice reduced to two acts under the title of a fairy tale so that i was little more than a godfather on the occasion and the alterations like some of the variorum annotations should have been subscribed anon  when critics make a lucky hit proud of a note of sterling worth each gives his name as sponsor but when mean malice aims at wit like francis in king hal the fourth each cries  anon anon sir remarks or shylocks reply to the senate of venice there are few passages in the plays of shakespeare that have been more repeatedly the subject of critical animadversion than a part of shylocks reply to the duke and the magnificos in the merchant of venice  the lines in question in the second folio which now lies before me run thus and the second folio is i believe in this instance an exact transcript of the first some men there are love not a gaping pigge some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection masters of passion swayes it to the mood of what it likes or loathes    row the first modern editor himself a poet willing i suppose to preserve the poetical expression with no more violation of the text than what was necessary to reconcile it to sense and grammar gives as was his manner without quoting any authority the fifth and part of the sixth line thus masterless passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes   this reading conveying a clear idea without any great violence to the first impressions was received and adopted by pope theobald and hanmer  theobald however willing to support a proposed emendation of his ingenious assistant dr thirlby and at the same time to introduce a comment of warburton starts a difficulty concerning the relative it sways it which according to rowes reading easily and necessarily refers to the word affection in the line immediately preceding  dr thirlbys emendation consisted in a new mode of punctuation by which he thus adjusted the doubtful lines in the passage and others when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection master of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes   warburton with a refined commentary rejects the reading of row preserves the old pointing but changes the number of the verb reading sway for sways affection he interprets to be used for sympathy and we learn from the second edition of dr farmers essay on the learning of shakespeare that affection in the sense of sympathy was formerly technical and so used by lord bacon sir kenelm digby and many other writers  mr steevens in his republication in    0 of the twenty plays of shakespeare first printed in quarto from a professed collation of four different copies of this play entitles the drama the comical history of the merchant of venice and exhibits the passage in question thus some men there are love not a gaping pig some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection masters of passion swayes it to the mood of what it likes or loathes   here the old pointing is preserved but the spelling is in general more modern than even that of the second folio which was indeed an earlier publication than two of the collated quartos  the word masters is exactly conformable to our present orthography and this noun governing the verb that follows is the most material in the whole sentence so material indeed that in order to preserve it the modern editors while they embrace the punctuation of thirlby make a still further deviation from the old copies and changing the number of both noun and verb give the passage thus for affections masters of passion sway it to the mood of what it likes of loathes   this reading seems to have been suggested by sir john hawkins  mr malone converting the noun masters into a verb and changing it into our reads thus for affection masters our passion sways it to the mood of what etc   the patient and laborious capel who commenced his researches long before all the editors since hanmer and yet suffered those editors to anticipate and almost supersede his own publication the diligent but tardy capel adopts the punctuation of thirlby and regulates the passage thus for affection mistress of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes   capel with his usual fidelity gives the rejected reading  masters of at the bottom of the page and as it should seem from the principle established in his introduction from the oldest quarto of capel the variorum editors take no notice  it is remarkable also that theobald in his note reporting thirlbys proposed emendation joins an asterisk to the word master referring to another various reading or conjecture  or mistress but whether this was the original suggestion of thirlby or of himself it is not easy to determine in old books the mode of spelling the word mistress often approaches very near to the word masters in the text and mr steevens who reads masters and for the sake of grammatical concordance changes affection to affections yet quotes a passage from othello which though produced with another intention yet countenances in this instance the reading of capel  and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safe voice on you i must confess that i cannot discover on what principle all the editors since theobald and hanmer have followed the punctuation of thirlby it is impossible i think for any reader accustomed to the manner of our old writers not to feel a certain harshness in the new regulation of the text or indeed to doubt for a moment that the old books gave the second line correctly as at that time spoken on the stage and originally written by the author cannot contain their urine for affection i never heard excellent and very shylock as he is macklins full stop in the middle of this verse without a shock and the following words of the line not only soften the expression but are most easy and natural we still apply the verb affect in the same sense that shylock here uses the noun derived from it and the simple meaning of the line is that others are so affected by the sound of the bagpipe that they cannot contain themselves  the mode of affection here signified granting the old text to be genuine must be sympathy illustrated by an example opposed to those before enumerated and the opposition marked like the hic and ille of the latin by the words some and others though without the two last words of the line the contrast is less clear and the effect of the bappipe might be a third instance of antipathy thirlbys punctuation and rowes reading each suppose affection to signify both sympathy and antipathy each critic must be allowed to be ingenious some word or phrase or line expressive of an irresistible influence over our likings and loathings for shylock speaks of both as well as governing the verb sways is most certainly the grand desideratum the one thing requisite to regulate and explain this difficult passage  the passage as it stands in the old books is evidently defective or corrupt or both and though the reading mistress for masters may remedy the corruption and bring the noun and verb according to the rules of syntax to accord with each other still there remains an imperfection in the context which has driven the commentators as their last resource to a new mode of punctuation my own method may perhaps appear still more desperate but desperate diseases require desperate remedies and without some topical applications the case under consideration is confessedly incurable and i cannot well explain myself without some dissection i must beg leave therefore to give a brief analysis of shylocks reply to the duke who tells him that the court recommend lenity to anthonio and expect a gentle answer from the prosecutor  his answer is to this effect  i have taken a solemn oath to exact the penalty on the bond and deny me justice at your peril if you demand why i prefer a pound of flesh to three thousand ducats i answer it is my humor or if that answer be unsatisfactory i add that there is an uncontrollable and unaccountable influence affecting the mind predominating so absolutely over the passions as to impell them in spite of reason and of will acting in some men by antipathy and in others by sympathy there are instances of both i am an instance of antipathy i abhor i hate anthonio and this hatred this antipathy is the only answer that i will or can give why i prefer a losing suit to a lucrative composition this i take to be a fair abstract of shylocks answer who waving the sic volo with which he follows up his oath proceeds to defend his conduct by the example of other men subject like himself to the irresistible dominion of sympathy and antipathy  on the whole therefore i conceive that the original punctuation should be maintained that the word masters in the old copies should be read mistress and that the imperfection in the sense according to that reading arises from a line or two lost or dropped at the press in which the words sympathy and antipathy so congenial to the argument had most probably a place  to submit this opinion and the whole of my comment fairly to the reader i shall conclude these observations with a transscript of the whole speech from the second folio only introducing in another character the variation of mistress for masters together with one intercalary line meant like the day in leapyear to complete the system and to convey the real meaning of the author his real words are now irrecoverable  the duke concludes the address to shylock in behalf of the senate and himself with these words we do expect a gentle answer jew   shylocks answer is as follows i have possesst your grace with what i purpose and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfet of my bond if you deny it let the danger light upon your charter and your cities freedom you will ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh then to receive three thousand ducats i will not answer that but say it is my humor is it answered what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducates to have it baind what are you answered yet some men there are love not a gaping pigge some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection sovereign antipathy or sympathy mistress of passion swayes it to the mood of what it likes or loathes now for your answer  as there is no firm reason to be rendered why he cannot abide a gaping pigge why he a harmless necessary cat why he a woollen bagpipe but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend himself being offended so can i give no reason nor i will not more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing i bear anthonio that i follow thus a loosing suit against him are you answered   if this exposition is not convincing and conclusive it were in vain to add more arguments to enforce it valeat quantum valere potest the few faults in the punctuation of the old copy are so obious that they cannot mislead the attentive reader but the defect in the construction without addition or alteration is irremoveable the last expedient having in my humble opinion proved unsuccessful a close consideration of the whole passage suggested the former with what propriety the reader will determine  some difficulties for critics will create difficulties have arisen from other lines in this speech johnson never saw a woollen bagpipe and therefore proposes to read wooden a wooden reading which sir john hawkins converts into swelling or swollen but though johnson never saw a woollen bagpipe shakespeare might have seen one nor is it difficult to conceive i think i have seen one the bag i mean for the pipe as he supposes was of wood  the edition also of      now under my eye reads as to offend himself being offended   the twenty plays published by mr steevens in the year    0 from a collation of the quartos exhibit printing more elegantly as to offend himself being offended   in these matters of critical nicety such trifles are not unworthy of observation though perhaps the slight variation might not have the sanction of the ingenious editor but be only an error of the press  since the foregoing article was prepared for the press looking into the variorum edition of shakespeare published in the year      for the purpose of transcribing the anonymous annotation on my note to the appendix i find that mr malone professes to have altered his opinion on this much contested passage and now believes as i do the old reading of the line  cannot contain etc to be genuine deriving the noun affection as i have done from the verb affect but applying it like theobald and thirlby and the modern editors to both sympathy and antipathy in consequence of this interpretation he now reads for the sake of concord masters of passion sway etc   a subsequent note subscribed editor gives the old reading from the author of the remarks with a similar explanation of affection but with no alteration or explanation of the false concord  the reading of the line supposed to be a possible erratum in the edition of      is continued as well as the reading of the passage in question unsupported by plausible conjecture taste or authority  orthopaedia or thoughts on public

researches has made his name as memorable in the annals of english literature as those of bacon or newton has among other smaller works bequeathed to posterity a short tract entitled some thoughts concerning education in this tract containing many excellent remarks many instances of shrewd penetration and much valuable information he has avowed himself a declared enemy to public education which he considers as a sacrifice of innocence to confidence concluding that it is impossible to keep a lad from the spreading contagion if you will venture him abroad in the herd and trust to chance or his own inclination for the choice of his company at school  who would not shrink at the thoughts of encountering so formidable an adversary armed at all points with strong natural sense keen observation satire humor and argument for such weapons he has wielded and with such armor has he defended himself on the subject now under consideration directing all his attacks against the principle i have undertaken to defend yet exercising that freedom of which he has himself given both the precept and example i venture to think for myself and in my turn to submit my thoughts to the public  nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri lockes thoughts on education though published in one continued series and split into sections according to the custom of the times is yet as the dedication declares the mere substance of a correspondence with a private friend and indeed may now fairly be resolved into three separate letters for the writer at three distinct periods reverts to the state of infancy and twice leads the babe through childhood to youth and manhood this may escape the observation of a cursory reader but to a fair and strict examiner is plain and obvious  the following remarks are like the tract on which they are founded somewhat loose and desultory it is indeed very difficult to follow a writer who often resumes a subject that he seems to have dismissed yet order and method have been endeavored to be preserved as far as was possible under such circumstances no material part of the question it is hoped remains unnoticed and it may be added with confidence that no argument has been intentionally misrepresented  virtue virtue and wisdom lock justly considers as the basis of all good education they are indeed as necessary to the operations of the mind as health and vigor to the exertions of the body we will not therefore dispute on a selfevident proposition but rather endeavor to prove on the very principles of the tract now before us that public education is more conducive to the improvement of the understanding and less dangerous to the morals than domestic tuition  it must be obvious to every reader that lock himself enters on the comparison with difficulty and diffidence i confess says he with great candor both sides have their inconveniences he then proceeds to a labored invective against grammar schools as unfavourable to the practice of virtue and therefore says he in conclusion i cannot but prefer breeding of a young gentleman at home in his fathers sight under a governor as much the best and safest way to the great and main end of education where it can be had and is ordered as it should be  perfection no doubt if attainable were much to be desired but alas imperfection is the lot of all human undertakings and all we can effect is to follow that course which is liable to the least objection the excellence of lockes plan is in his own opinion evidently hypothetical so that he is at last driven to acknowledge that what shall be resolved in the case must in a great measure be left to the parents to be determined by their circumstances and conveniences  all that lock says of children while children that is while in a mere state of infancy is in general well worth notice he seems to enter into all their little feelings with as much penetration and much less romance than rousseau whose emile with all its merit and all its originality is in fact an ingenious amplification of lockes work realising in himself the ideal character of the tutor or governor and in emile the person of the pupil whom he takes up from his cradle and carries to his marriage bed just as lock advises on his return from late travel rousseaus work however is not merely the little tract of lock dilated and personified but in many instances a comment sometimes too labored and refined and sometimes acute and plausible few will agree with him that instruction must be delayed till the lessons can be attended with experiment or think it reasonable to refer their little students to the open volume of nature denying them the use of books maps globes and other helps which lock recommends most parents would think lockes method of teaching geography as prudent as it is simple and easy by showing children first the figure and natural parts of the globe and the imaginary and artificial lines afterward but rousseau despises such insufficient methods throws away maps and spheres and by his own example exhorts teachers to carry their scholars at different seasons to the top of a mountain to see the sun rise at midsummer and at christmas this appears rather extravagant but at the same time it may be thought that rousseau properly censures lockes maxim of reasoning with children which he truly says lock himself appears so much embarrassed to defend with equal justice he reprobates lockes method of recommending and encouraging liberality constantly taking care that the child loses nothing by it let all the instances he gives of such freeness continues lock be always repaid and with interest and let him sensibly perceive that the kindness he shows to others is no bad husbandry for himself but that it brings a return of kindness both from those who receive it and those who look on this says rousseau is to teach a child to be generous to appearance and in reality avaricious he reprehends also lockes opinion that the consideration of spirits ought to go before that of matter and body for what idea says he can a child entertain of a being incorporeal and immaterial  but the management of infants is not the chief object of these remarks of the treatment of children lock speaks with fairness and candor but when they advance to maturer age his evident prejudice against public education obscures that precision and depraves that liberality so remarkable in his other works  lock while he so openly and severely censures public education slurs over the defects of domestic tuition yet his subject unavoidably leads him to point out some imperfections and particularly the danger from servants to which might be added the too frequent hereditary taint of the mind from the master and mistress and the contagion of their friends and acquaintance the mischiefs of domestic indulgence cannot indeed be more strongly delineated than in the words of lock himself  he that is not used to submit his will to the reason of others when he is young will scarce hearken or submit to his own reason when he is of an age to make use of it and what a kind of a man such an one is like to prove is easy to foresee   these are oversights usually committed by those who seem to take the greatest care of their childrens education but if we look into the common management of children we shall have reason to wonder in the great dissoluteness of manners which the world complains of that there an any footsteps at all left of virtue i desire to know what vice can be named which parents and those about children do not season them with and drop into them the seeds of as soon as they are capable to receive them i do not mean by the examples they give and the patterns they set before them which is encouragement enough but that which i would take notice of here is the downright teaching them vice and actually putting them out of the way of virtue he then proceeds to show that they principle them with violence revenge and cruelty that lying and equivocation are put into their mouths and commended that the little ones are taught to be proud of their clothes before they can put them on and tempted and encouraged to intemperance and luxury the section concludes with the following paragraph  i shall not dwell any longer on this subject much less run over all the particulars that would show what pains are used to corrupt children and instill principles of vice into them but i desire parents soberly to consider what irregularity or vice there is which children are not visibly taught and whether it be not their duty and wisdom to provide them other instructions  the chief officer in lockes household of private education is a governor or tutor and if you find it difficult says he to meet with such a tutor you are not to wonder  his description of a tutor is indeed chimerical wisdom temperance tenderness diligence and discretion are the lead essential requisites in the character of lockes governor such a man as he delineates is scarce to be found and if found would hardly undertake the task assigned him  his learning however much or little is no great recommendation that a tutor should have latin and learning with the reputation of sobriety every one expects and this generally is thought enough and is all parents look for but when such an one has emptied out into his pupil all the latin and logic he has brought from the university will that furniture make him a fine gentleman or can it be expected that he should be better bred better skilled in the world better principled in the grounds and foundations of true virtue and generosity than his young tutor is  such is the derision bestowed by lock on the scholarship of a tutor and such is his constant contempt of literature and erudition under the sneering denominations of latin and learning a deal of trash dry systems etc which appears very strange from a learned or as lock styles himself a bookish man he not only gives the first place to virtue without which no science polite learning or talents can be of value but much prefers breeding to learning his encomiums on this accomplishment are equal to any of lord chesterfields dissertations on the graces it is indeed always difficult to fix a charge of partiality or incoherency on so cautious and ingenious a writer because he commonly concludes his remarks with some qualifying expressions which however rather seem to bring up the rear as a saving clause than to be intended to militate against the main argument as one instance among many others of these principles and this practice may be produced the following passage with which he winds up his recommendation of the first essential requisite in a tutor  the tutor therefore ought in the first place to be well bred and a young gentleman who gets this one qualification from his governor sets out with great advantage and will find that this one accomplishment will more open his way to him get him more friends and carry him farther in the world than all the hard words or real knowledge he has got from the liberal arts or his tutors learned encyclopoedia not that those should be neglected but by no means preferred or suffered to thrust out the other knowledge of the world also is deemed preferable to learning and languages though by the way he here inadvertently implies the superior force of public education and is obliged to confess that the study of the ancients contributes both to that knowledge and to virtue the tutor however this sage and exemplary monitor described by lock must enter his pupil into the world and at the same time preserve him like the four thieves vinegar from the contagion of society so that a youth must it seems after all encounter the danger so much dreaded in a public education the danger of herding with those of his own time of life and how ill he may be prepared to hazard his morals his health and his fortune in such company the following picture of many a lad mewed up in a private family drawn by the masterly hand of lock himself will exhibit in the most lively colors  the longer he is kept thus hoodwinked the less he will see when he comes abroad into open daylight and be the more exposed to be a prey to himself and others and an old boy at his first appearance with all the gravity of his ivybush about him is sure to draw on him the eyes and chirping of the whole town volery amongst which there will not be wanting some birds of prey that will presently be on the wing for him the tutor however is not to neglect our young masters learning but is to teach him latin like french by talking it into him in constant conversation for he must be constantly with his pupil talk nothing else to him and make him still answer in the same language though perhaps the comparison is not quite fair and apposite french being a living language and latin a dead one grammar however is strictly forbidden by lock as well as rousseau and if the well bred tutor should be incapable a more agreeable teacher may be found and the following method is recommended to all private families  whatever stir there is made about getting of latin as the great and difficult business his mother may teach it him herself if she will but spend two or three hours in a day with him and make him read the evangelists in latin to her for she need but buy a latin testament and having got somebody to mark the last syllable but one where it is long in words above two syllables which is enough to regulate her pronunciation and accenting the words read daily in the gospels and then let her avoid understanding them in latin if she can and when she understands the evangelists in latin let her in the same manner read aesops fables and so proceed on to eutropius justin and other such books i do not mention this as an imagination of what i fancy may do but as of a thing i have known done and the latin tongue with ease got this way supposing the governor to be intelligent able and competent to the instruction of his pupil still the mother is not to lie idle for care is to be taken whilst he is learning foreign languages by speaking and reading nothing else with his tutor that he do not forget to read english which may be preserved by his mother or somebody else hearing him read some chosen parts of scripture or other english book every day  languages says lock being to be learnt by rote custom and memory are then spoken in the greatest perfection when all rules of grammar are utterly forsaken languages may be spoken by rote but surely dead languages especially are not as lock supposes to be learnt so and though an adept may throw away his grammar and dictionary too if he pleases it is strange advice to a student in the lower classes of public schools most of the boys are during the intervals of the school hours under the care of one of the assistants retained at a very moderate cost as a private tutor his method of teaching them to render english into latin and so vice versa is excellent though directly opposite to that recommended by lock and in my opinion so much more excellent in proportion as it is more opposite to translate a portion of one of the gospels for the current week is a common exercise and to fit them for the execution of their task they are made to parse every word in the sentence and by thus having learnt to what part of speech every one belongs together with the number case mood tense etc their task is made easy and they acquire by degrees a radical knowledge of the two languages at once lockes proposal of talking children into a language which he frequently contends that nobody talks and should pretend to write is as little eligible as it is feasible and his substituted method of interlining latin and english while it requires according to his own confession a previous explanation of the various terminations of nouns and verbs their several genders cases numbers and persons proves the necessity of the rules of grammar while it deprives the little students of the use of them the result must be perpetual confusion arising from superficial instructions and a total impossibility of cultivating even their mother tongue as he afterward very properly though inconsistently with his own doctrine recommends english itself should be taught by grammar though by natives first acquired by rote custom and memory the mother tongue is almost sucked in with the mothers milk  take a boy from the top of a grammar school says lock and one of the same age bred as he should be in his fathers family and bring them into good company together and then see which of the two will have the more manly carriage and address himself with the more becoming assurance to strangers here i imagine the school boys confidence will either fail or discredit him and if it be such as fits him only for the conversation of boys he were better be without it this passage is quite of a piece with every other in which lock mentions public education on which occasion he not only as he himself confesses loses his temper but also drops his usual liberality and candor i cannot with patience think he cries in another place that a young gentleman should be put into the herd and be driven with a whip and scourge as if he were to run the gantlet through the different classes ad capiendum ingenii cultum at other times he terms such youths ill bred and vicious boys a mixed herd of unruly boys learning to wrangle at trap or rook at shunfarthing practicing wagferies and cheats and concerting well laid plots of robbing an orchard  the best and perhaps the most direct way of confuting these commonplace invectives were to produce from the same tract in which they have gained a place as evidences of the partiality of the writer other passages written when off his guard that directly contradict these assertions  there is often says lock on one of these occasions in people especially children a clownish shame facedness before strangers or those above them they are confounded in their thoughts words and looks and so lose themselves in that confusion as  to be able to do any thing or at least to do it with freedom and gracefulness which pleases and makes them acceptable plainness of manners is to a certain age perhaps the most ingenuous feature of youth a polish is the last stage of education as well as of arts and manufactures and when given too soon the varnish only hides a defect a boy should not have the manners nor the dress of a man lock himself under the article of manners strongly reprobates the parents and tutors who teize their children about putting off hats and making of legs and justly concludes that if their minds are well disposed and principled with inward civility a great part of the roughness which sticks to the outside for want of better teaching time and observation will rub off as they grow up if they are bred in good company to say the truth much of the security as well as improvement of youth depends on their not having attained the finished breeding of men and the raw diffidence of a school boy would be ill exchanged for the pert confidence of many a homebred fopling the words of rousseau on this head will better express my meaning and are an excellent contrast to the above passage from lock  as there is an age proper for the study of the sciences there is also a sit age to catch the manners of the world comme il y a un age propre a letude des sciences il y en a un pour bien saisir lusage du monde bring a young man of twenty into good company bred as he should be he will in a years time be more amiable and more truly polite than he who has been brought up with that view from his infancy for the first being capable of perceiving the reasons with respect to age condition or sex on which good manners are founded will easily reduce them to their true principles and accommodate them to every occasion while the other going only in the beaten road will be at a loss whenever he is put out of it introduisez une jeune homme de vingt ans dans le monde bien conduit il sera dans un an plus aimable and plus judicieusement poli que celui quon y aura nourri des son enfance car le premier etant capable de sentir les raisons de tous les precedes relatifs a lage a letat au sex qui constituent cet usage les peut reduire en principes et les etendre au cas non prevus au lieu que lautre nayant que sa routine pour toute regle est embarassesi tot quon ly sort  lock himself in another place says that carelessness is allowed to that age and becomes them as well as compliments do grown people or at least if some very nice people will think it a fault i am sure it is a fault that should be overlooked and left to time a tutor and conversation to cure  as for their quarrels at chuck or ball their tricks and truantries he who breeds his son in his own family will in vain expect to see him a man before his time boys will be boys at home or abroad every age has its follies and infirmities and those of youth and childhood though the most innocent are perhaps the most ungovernable  lock talking in his usual style of the malapertness tricking and violence learnt amongst school boys and therefore prefering private education endeavors to strengthen his argument by instancing the retirement and bashfulness which daughters are brought up in but surely daughters are not an apposite example the chief duties of female life are domestic those of a man are public an officer physician lawyer or divine bred with his sister would not i conceive derive due benefit from his education sometimes however her society as well as that of the rest of his family might be of advantage both to his morals and understanding it is not necessary at present to deliver any opinion concerning the proper education of daughters home seems to be their natural province yet that home is often so exceptionable that perhaps even they would in general be in less danger abroad schools exhibiting bills that young ladies are there educated and may be boarded are indeed sometimes dangerous seminaries yet perhaps there are few private families where the minds of daughters are likely to receive so much moral and intellectual improvement as at the respectable recess of the miss lees at bath or the no less wholesome and improving nursery of the miss moors at bristol  lock in his thoughts on education often confounds the idea of educating a single scholar with that of training a number of scholars in the first instance he imposes on fathers and tutors such a task as none but a scriblerus or an old shandy will ever perform and such characters have in common life been long obsolete rousseau and his emile are a young quixote and an old sancho or as rousseau himself rather chooses to style them a robinson crusoe and his man friday  the forming of their minds and manners  says lock requiring a constant attention and particular application to every single boy which is impossible in a numerous flock and would be wholly in vain could he the schoolmaster have time to study and correct every ones particular defects and wrong inclinations when the lad was to be left to himself or the prevailing infection of his fellows the greatest part of the four and twenty hours having in the place just quoted shown the impossibility of paying proper attention to pupils in a public school in the following passages are exhibited the methods to be pursued in a private family both in regard to a single scholar or a set of boys  since he prefers this or that whatever play he delights in to his book that only he shall do and so in earnest set him on work on his beloved play and keep him steadily and in earnest to it morning and afternoon till he be fully surfeited and would at any rate change it for some hours at his book again but when you thus set him a task of his play you must be sure to look after him yourself or set some body else to do it that may constantly see him employed in it and that he be not permitted to be idle at that too this i think is sufficiently evident that children generally hate to be idle all the care then is that their busy humor should be constantly employed in something of use to them which if you will attain you must make what you would have them do a recreation to them and not a business the way to do this so that they may not perceive you have any hand in it is this proposed here viz to make them weary of that which you would not have them do by enjoining and making them under some pretense or other do it till they are surfeited for example does your son play at top or scourge too much enjoin him to play so many hours every day and look that he do it and you shall see he will quickly be sick of it and willing to leave it by this means making the recreations you dislike a business to him he will of himself with delight betake himself to those things you would have him do especially if they be proposed as rewards for having performed his task in that play is commanded him for if he be ordered every day to whip his top so long as to make him sufficiently weary do you not think he will apply himself with eagerness to his book and wish for it if you promise it him as a reward for having whipped his top lustily quite out all the time that is set him children in the things they do if they comport with their age find little difference so they may be doing the esteem they have for one thing above another they borrow from others so that what those about them make to be a reward to them will really be so by this art it is in their governors choice whether scotchhoppers shall reward their dancing or dancing their scotchhoppers whether pegtop or reading playing at trap or studying the globes shall be more acceptable and pleasing to them all that they desire being to be busy and busy as they imagine in things of their own choice and which they receive as favors from their parents or others for whom they have respect and with whom they would be in credit a set of children thus ordered and kept from the ill example of others would all of them i suppose with as much earnestness and delight learn to read write and what else one would have them as others do their ordinary plays and the eldest being thus entered and this made the fashion of the place it would be as impossible to hinder them from learning the one as it is ordinarily to keep them from the other these extracts will perhaps convince most readers of the visionary prospects presented to parental imaginations in many a practical treatise on private education several passages of the same nature occur in the tract now under consideration  one of the ready topics of lockes censure and raillery of public schools is the correction occasionally bestowed on idle irregular or obstinate pupils but say what he will of the use of the rod to lash dull boys into nouns and pronouns verbs gerunds and supines it is rarely exercised by a good schoolmaster but when wilfulness or ill example demands it on which occasions the continued severities enjoined by lock much exceed the utmost rigours of public education as for example  i would have a father seldom strike his child but upon very urgent necessity and as the last remedy and then perhaps it will be fit to do it so that the child should not quickly forget it and again  whenever you come to that extremity it is not enough to whip or beat them you must do it till you find you have subdued their minds till with submission and patience they yield to the correction which you shall best discover by their crying and their ceasing from it upon your bidding without this the beating of children is but a passionate tyranny over them and it is mere cruelty and not correction to put their bodies in pain without doing their minds any good as this gives us a reason why children should seldom be corrected so it also prevents their being so for if whenever they are chastised it were done thus without passion soberly and yet essentially too laying on the blows and smart not furiously and all at once but slowly with reasoning between and with observation how it wrought stopping when it had made them pliant penitent and yielding they would seldom need the like punishment again being made careful to avoid the fault that deserved it besides by this means as the punishment would not be lost for being too little and not effectual so it would be kept from being too much if we gave off as soon as we perceived that it reached the mind and that was bettered for since the chiding or beating of children should be always the least that possibly may be that which is laid on in the heat of anger seldom observes that measure but is commonly more than it should be though it proves less than enough the circumstance of laying on the blows with reasoning between exhibits a whimsical picture and reminds one of the pedagogue of swift concluding every period with a lash and the idea of perceiving the very moment when the cure on the mind is effected by the operation on the tail is still more ludicrous the young patient however might perhaps wish to remind the author of another passage in an early section of this tract there applied to the regimen of the body but not inapplicable on the present occasion  when such a gentle treatment will not stop the growing mischief nor hinder it from turning into a formed disease it will be time to seek the advice of some sober and discreet physician in this part i hope i shall find an easy belief and nobody can have a pretense to doubt the advice of one who has spent some time in the study of physic when he counsels you not to be too forward in making use of physic or physicians i am unwilling to load the page with too many quotations but as the following is peculiarly interesting and entertaining i flatter myself the reader will scarce think it demands an apology  a prudent and kind mother of my acquaintance was on such an occasion forced to whip her little daughter at her first coming home from nurse eight times successively the same morning before she could master her stubbornness and obtain a compliance in a very easy and indifferent manner if she had left off sooner and stopped at the seventh whipping she had spoiled the child for ever and by her unprevailing blows only confirmed her refractoriness very hardly afterward to be cured but wisely persisting till she had bent her mind and suppled her will the only end of correction and chastisement she established her authority thoroughly in the very first occasion and had ever after a very ready compliance and obedience in all things from her daughter for as this was the first time so i think it was the last too she ever struck her correction when necessary is certainly less painful both to parents and children when inflicted abroad than at home it is better that fathers should seem unconscious of the knowledge of all their petty trespasses and lock though he here so much commends the repeated flagellations of a little daughter by a prudent and kind mother yet in the section first quoted declares i think it is best the smart should come more immediately from anothers hand though by the parents order who should see it done  in confirmation of the lenity of masters of public schools i shall venture to mention a little anecdote that came within my own knowledge during the time of my education at westminster a gentleman not long since living was when a schoolboy more distinguished by the goodness of his disposition than the brilliancy of his parts many of the forms usually committed to the care of assistants were however now and then visited by the head master on one of these occasions the gentleman i have spoken of was called out by dr nicoll to read and construe a part of the lesson to the form which being in the upper school the lesson of the day was in greek the honest lad conscious of his inability obeyed the call but instead of attempting the lesson went up to the master and muttered indistinctly flog me sir  speak out child says the master  flog me sir if you please repeats the scholar dropping his book and unbuttoning the master with a chastised smile laying his hand on his young pupils head and gently patting him cried in a mild tone go thy ways boy get thee to thy place again thou art a very honest fellow but thou never wilt be a scholar as long as thou live  this story may serve as a companion to lockes pictures of private correction and may serve to show that good hearts may be found in public schools as well as private families and that the discipline of the rod is not administered with more judicious discrimination in one system of education than the other  the rewards also are at public schools as well chosen and as appropriated as the punishments the latter exhibiting as lock enjoins the disgrace and the former adding to the reputation of the young student the little shining coin of pennies twopences threepences and groats in silver given on any occasional display of industry or excellence are as triumphantly prized and carefully treasured by the young receiver as a medal by an antiquarian and are carefully carried home with joy and pride as pledges of their merit in their class and tokens of the approbation of their master a still higher mark of favor is the seasonable reward of distinguishing the diligence and abilities of a rising lad by promotion in the school and anticipating his remove to a superior form places and preferments are often gained at westminster  emulation that great spur to improvement almost unknown in domestic tuition is greatly encouraged in the field of public education this lock himself acknowledges the custom of challenging as it is termed by the school boys promotes a wonderful desire of excelling amongst young champions for literary preeminence this challenging is thus ordered and proves a keen incitement to diligence and perfection the boys of the form are called out to their lesson of the day the first boy perhaps misconstrues his aesop or ovid the second corrects his mistake and takes his rank and place or the second failing the third the fourth the fifth the sixth or the sixteenth in due order gives the right construction and supersedes all his schoolfellows of the class under examination so that a boy is often transported in a moment from the lower or fag end to the very top of the form as the young students advance toward the superior forms this practice in respect to their maturer years and progress in their studies is judiciously discontinued  when i speak of the custom of public schools i particularly refer to that of westminster where i was bred and with whose customs i am best acquainted not questioning that other public schools have equal advantages  verses and themes so reprobated by lock are intended as exercises to teach scholars better to understand the poetical and prose compositions of the ancients and not meant as he insinuates to render every scholar a poet or declaimer the various measures of poetry are more easily comprehended and more perfectly read by those who reduce the rules of prosody to practice for this purpose metrical centoes ludicrously styled jointed dolls fitting the end of one line to the beginning or middle of another and even nonsense verses have their use for unless virgil and horace are to be prohibited to english pupils like the bible to roman catholics those who study them should be instructed to read them with propriety not conceiving that they are to become virgils and horaces themselves themes tend to open the mind and cannot possibly be prejudicial to explain the thesis to the young students is no more ridiculous than the other helps which lock himself not only allows but even prescribes to be given for the improvement of his pupils milton as well as lock objects to themes and verses as school exercises forcing the empty wits of children to acts of ripest judgment and the final work of a head filled by long reading and observing with elegant maxims and copious invention but surely such objections deny to the improvement and cultivation of the mind the means necessarily used and recommended in the exercises of the body nec literas didicit nec natare was as lock observes a proverb to denote an ill and imperfect education it were as consistent therefore to say that a lad must not go into the water till he can swim as to forbid all attempts at composition till he has acquired and formed a style which depends so much like personal grace and activity upon practice false concords and false quantities reproved and amended guide the learner by degrees to true prosody and syntax barbarizing anglicisms so offensive to milton lead to pure latinity an art says busby is the way of doing a thing surely readily and gracefully grammar is the art of speaking and writing and was that or any other art ever attained without repeated efforts leading by insensible gradations through error to perfection the latin pieces of verse and prose of milton now extant were derived no doubt from long reading and observing his juvenilia admirable as they are were certainly preceded by more puerile exercises and imperfect compositions  didicit prius extimuitque magistrum repetitions by heart are no more than selecting as lock himself directs the beautiful passages from authors and impressing them on the memory of the reciter they should not it is true and they are not be too long nor too frequently exacted yet such exercises undoubtedly serve to strengthen the memory for every faculty of the mind as well as every limb of the body acquires vigor from use and exertion if players whom lock sarcastically instances have not all of them the best memories in the world every player perhaps possesses that faculty in a greater degree than if he had not been called upon to the constant exercise of it in his profession  greek ought not to be excluded as lock seems to exclude it from a young gentlemans education if languages are to be learnt so easily and so readily as lock asserts greek in particular ought not to be omitted and if those who have been initiated in that language do generally as he says seldom afterward make any proficiency how can it be expected that they who have not learnt even the rudiments as boys should attain that language when men this however is his method and proposal give then rather in the course of their education the power and possibility of becoming adepts for this is all that can be done by education and you have discharged your duty every scholar who makes a very considerable progress in any language art or science is chiefly his own master greek is at least as necessary and ornamental to a gentleman as a trade so earnestly recommended by lock and full as polite and beneficial an accomplishment as the art of perfumery varnishing graving working in iron brass or silver cutting or setting of precious stones or even grinding and polishing optical glasses  rousseau is particularly partial to the occupation of a joiner one of the trades recommended by lock and takes notice with an air of triumph that the czar peter exercised the employment of a ships carpenter as to study he denies his pupil all books except robinson crusoe  hardiness so strongly recommended by lock is much more likely to be obtained in a public school than at home where the illjudged tenderness of the parents of mamas especially often produces effeminacy which exposes the little master to the ridicule of all his schoolfellows   sheepish softness it is allowed by lock often enervates those who are bred like foplings at home he owns too on another occasion that it is not unusual to observe the children of gentlemens families treat the servants of the house with domineering words names of contempt and an imperious carriage as if they were of another race and species beneath them  other vices and weaknesses may also be learnt in the parlour the kitchen and the stable of the contagion from a train of vicious domestics lock himself always appears extremely sensible in one place his words are these they frequently learn from unbred or debauched servants untowardly tricks and vices as otherwise they possibly would be ignorant of all their lives  lock well observes that the peculiar physiognomy of the mind is most discoverable in children before cunning has taught them to hide deformities and conceal their ill inclinations under a dissembled outside  public education is infinitely better calculated than domestic tuition for the discovery of the natural features of the mind if a boy wears a mask his schoolfellows will be sure to tear it off and betray his real disposition to general observation and indeed i scarce remember a single instance of a lad bred in a great school who did not retain strong traces of his puerile character all his life after the first scenes of his life therefore to use lockes own words are best acted on a public stage where his predominant passions and prevailing inclinations being more open and exposed are most capable of correction his very schoolfellows become masters in this instance for youth commonly inclines to the benignant and generous side  in regard to morals and religion those great and important considerations if it is duly weighed that the most nice and dangerous part of human life occurs between the commencement and conclusion of the period destined to education it is not wonderful that public schoolboys as well as private pupils should sometimes be found to be defective or culpable the sap will rise in the spring blights will strike the noblest plant and frosts will nip the fairest flower all that can be suggested by art is wholesome manure and providently to fence and guard against the heat or inclemency of the season in public schools the duties of religion are by no means neglected all that lock enjoins is duly taught the exercises of saturday evening and the lessons of monday morning are from the bible and prayer book the daily business of the school begins like that of the house of commons with reading prayers one of the senior boys officiates as chaplain and the prayers are in latin even the sacrament is at a proper age administered to the young disciples and i have witnessed amongst those early communicants a solemnity of preparation and reception that would have done them honor at any succeeding period of their lives  lock with an air of assumed candor toward the master of a school introduces the following observation  the difference is great between two or three pupils in the same house and three or fourscore boys lodged up and down for let the masters industry and skill be never so great it is impossible he should have fifty or one hundred scholars under his eye any longer than they are in school together nor can it be expected that he should instruct them successfully in any thing but their books the forming of their minds and manners requiring a constant attention and particular application to every single boy which is impossible in a numerous flock and would be wholly in vain could he have time to study and correct every ones particular defects and wrong inclinations when the lad was to be left to himself or the prevailing infection of his fellows the greatest part of the four and twenty hours the absolute impossibility of a constant application and particular attention to every single boy and it may be added the doubt whether such particular attention would not rather injure than benefit the pupil by encouraging his selfimportance together with many other obvious difficulties oblige lock himself at last to confess as has before been noticed what shall be resolved in this case must in a great measure be left to the parents to be determined by their circumstances and conveniences but not to take advantage of such a reluctant concession let us rather recommend to the master of a great school to keep a watchful eye on the conduct of the boys during the intervals of the school hours and carefully by himself and his assistants to visit and regulate the boarding houses the masters and mistresses of those houses must submit to his directions or abandon their employments for what parent would commit his son to a family supposed to be adverse to the general discipline of the school and whose inmates are indulged in irregularity and dissipation it is requisite also for schoolmasters to be rather backward in granting leave for too frequent visits at home for where they too much prevail it has happened that the home and the school have each in their turns been pleaded by the young truant as an apology for his absence from both and this is one of the most fatal inroads from private mismanagement on the beneficial influence of public education where the wisdom of the institution is counteracted by the indiscretion of individuals  suppose an author equally inclined to depreciate domestic tuition as lock has in his little tract shown himself disposed to ridicule and vilify public education might not such a writer abandoning the straight path of candor and impartiality and assuming the manners of a satirical pleader and declaimer express himself to the following purport  i cannot bear to see the free spirit and generous nature of a youth that should look abroad into the world of which he is himself a part cabind cribbd confined in the narrow limits of a private family a puny fondling dandled on the lap of his mother or at best perhaps a tiny sportsman or soaker in company of his father if they have a country parson in the house who teaches my young master to read he teaches him to smoke at the same time and envelopes in the same cloud his person and his understanding the first latin that he conveys to him is the old axiom of in vino veritas and his greek if he has any is all anacreontick it is odds indeed whether his learning extends so far he is perhaps a mere lingo or at best a square or a thwackum in mr allworthys splendid mansion over the servants of the family the heir apparent is a little tyrant and from his subjects he learns as soon as he can speak every species of provincial barbarism and as soon as he can think or act every kind of vice and meanness virtue wisdom breeding and learning are seldom to be found under a private roof but must be sought like the deity in a solemn temple consecrated to such sacred worship waving ridicule and irony and adhering as the subject requires to strict truth it must be confessed that public education as well as domestic tuition has its faults but many of the corruptions of schools are brought by the scholars from home at home are the foolish the idle and vicious servants so much dreaded by lock at home indulgence takes the place of discipline and from home they often bring sums of money far beyond their little occasions by which artificial wants are created and disorders introduced this last evil wholly owing to the indiscretion of friends and parents has been particularly noxious to public schools masters can only control and check its influence friends and parents alone can prevent and extirpate it  public schools ought to cultivate the mathematics as well as the classicks both might be taught sufficiently for the initiation of pupils during their stay at a public school from whence they ought to be sent to the universities equally prepared to pursue their philosophical as their classical studies  public schools also generally detain their pupils too long youths should be dismissed from schools at the age of sixteen or seventeen at the latest they are afterward commencing young men and will not patiently submit to the corrections of children when the boys at westminster rebelled because a senior scholar between eighteen and nineteen years of age would not submit to the discipline of the rod dr barker then a prebend contended that the scholar was in the right it was wrong he said to attempt to scourge a youth at that age it was almost sodomy pity that dr barker was not a general  in general it is unadvisable for parents to send their sons to a great public school sooner than at the period of nine or ten years of age not that i would wish the preceding period to be lost and buried in ignorance and idleness let their children in the mean while be sent to some preparatory academy where they may be taught to write to read to speak french to dance to draw and the rudiments of latin according to the grammar of the school for which they are afterward intended a master who cannot by himself and his assistants supply his little students with these helps is unfit to govern such an academy  one great reason for preference of public to private education is this schoolboys being at intervals called home partake occasionally of the enjoyments and society of a family private pupils constantly confined within one narrow circle acquire none of the freedom and spirit of a public education  travel where it can be afforded cannot be accompanied with the benefit that ought to attend it from the first stage of life one of the periods to which lock destines it but being certainly improper at the usual time and in the usual mode may be reserved to lockes last stage and therefore properly succeeding to a removal from the universities when the young traveller if not fit and able to go alone had better not go at all  milton has given a tractate on education containing a plan of a school and university in one intended to annihilate all other schools and universities by instituting as many of such academies as might be necessary in different parts of the kingdom yet in this plan romantic as he almost himself seems to think it he has proceeded on principles very different from those of lock and shown himself the friend and advocate of public education he rather follows the principles of plato and xenophon than adopts the system of lock  his proposed number of pupils is an hundred and fifty more or less he directs the teaching of languages not by rote but by grammar and those not only modern but ancient and of the ancient not only latin but greek and hebrew with the chaldean and syrian dialects so far from objecting to repetitions that he enjoins grammar lessons to be got by heart and poems and orations not merely to be read but  put to memory and solemnly announced with right accent and grace and though like lock he regrets the time thrown away in learning one or two languages yet himself appropriates no less time than nine years from twelve to twenty one to education he also fixes the age of twenty three or twenty four as the proper time for travel if travel be necessary so that on the whole though i have been hardy enough to enter the lists with such a giant antagonist as lock i have milton to support me  it appears indeed on the face of lockes tract that the present plan of education is highly preferable to the system that prevailed at the time of his writing the medical management of children is so much improved that many things which he recommends as contrary to the practice of those times are now in general use and as to the cultivation of their minds were he now living he would no longer lament the want of a sixpenny history of the bible or an aesop with pictures to every fable the booksellers have provided the little students a lilliputian library and every toyshop and stationer will supply them with polygons for the vowels or the whole alphabet in cards or ivory unless they should rather choose to swallow it in gingerbread geography is learnt by the dice like the game of the goose maps are dissected into kingdoms and provinces and perhaps to lock himself we owe many of those valuable achievements  universities those dry nurses that succeed to the first feminaries of education are also much improved in their principles and practice since the aeras of milton and lock and if the students do not at their departure make due progress in their several pursuits and professions the failure must be imputed to themselves who have so ill applied the time they have passed there at one university since the time of milton a great and transcendent genius has advanced the career of science as milton himself carried the flights of poetry beyond the visible diurnal sphere at the other an acute and able jurisprudent whose early loss we still lament instituted a course of lectures of established authority to the professional reader as well as affording in the most elegant terms a code of law necessary for the instruction and perusal of every private gentleman the students too are now less bewildered in the labyrinths of logic and metaphysics to their original resistance to the principles of lock perhaps we owe much of his prejudice to public education his prejudices were he now a living witness of the cordial reception of his doctrines would perhaps vanish though he might still insist and not without justice according to the tirocinium the tirocinium forms part of a collection of poems by w cowper esquire one of which poems is the task a most admirable work in blank verse which gives a most promising earnest of the authors intended translation of homer in that measure of my worthy and ingenious friend mr cowper that discipline should stand as porter at the gate of every college  the study of geography chronology history the elements of natural philosophy and geometry may easily be reconciled to the plan of the early part of public education and should be incorporated with it as to dancing fencing and accounts these are generally taught by separate masters according to the direction of the parents without need of particular injunction or serious dissertation painting and music are indeed not in so general request and the truth is that gentlemen practitioners either misapply much of their time or fall infinitely below the most common artists of either profession if a trade is absolutely necessary to a student and a gentleman that of a gardener seems to be the most healthy and agreeable to which in bad weather may be added the occupation of a joiner or carpenter as on that account both lock and rousseau recommend it and a schoolboy is perhaps more qualified even for such an apprenticeship as well as for the more honorable and hazardous avocations of the army or navy than a young gentleman bred in a private family  lock concludes his tract on education with these words  though i am now come to a conclusion of what obvious remarks have suggested to me concerning education i would not have it thought that i look on it as a just treatise on this subject there are a thousand other things that may need consideration especially if one should take in the various tempers different inclinations and particular defaults that are to be found in children and prescribe proper remedies the variety is so great that it would require a volume nor would that reach it each mans mind has some peculiarity as well as his face that distinguishes him from all others and there are possibly scarce two children who can be conducted by exactly the same method besides that i think a prince a nobleman and an ordinary gentlemans son should have different ways of breeding but having had here only some general views in reference to the main end and aims in education and those designed for a gentlemans son who being then very little i considered only as white paper or wax to be molded and fashioned as one pleases i have touched little more than those heads which i judged necessary for the breeding of a young gentleman of his condition in general and have now published these my occasional thoughts with this hope that though this be far from being a complete treatise on this subject or such as that every one may find what will just fit his child in it yet it may give some small light to those whose concern for their dear little ones makes them so irregularly bold that they dare venture to consult their own reason in the education of their children rather than wholly to rely upon old custom if lock could not call his work a complete treatise on education much less can i presume to submit these loose thoughts to the reader in that light especially as they are not offered under that idea but merely to vindicate public establishments from censures that appeared coming from whomsoever unjust and illiberal if the awful and revered name of lock gave a sanction to prejudices it was but acting with the spirit though without the talents of lock to combat them almost all the systems of private education appear a romantic theory not reducible to practice lock himself says that a prince a nobleman and an ordinary gentlemans son should have a different way of breeding yet the attention enjoined to be given to his pupil not to dwell on the character of his tutor are scarce to be expected even by a prince though he confesses that his views and main end were to suggest hints on those heads necessary for the education of a gentlemans son a telemachus may obtain a minerva for a mentor an english prince may command a markham or a hurd but the son of a gentleman the son of a nobleman i will venture to say will at least derive as much benefit from a public education as from private tuition neither themes nor verses so dreaded by lock impede their progress to the first offices and most important duties these are facts founded on experience and the many illustrious characters that have begun their career on a royal foundation will fully justify my assertion  how many ovids murray were thy boast how many martials were in pulteney lost  the following short and occasional dissertation on tails having been accidentally omitted in its proper place brings up the rear of the prose in this volume  to the printer of the st jamess chronicle thursday august         sir casting my eye on the london gazette a few days ago it gave me infinite pleasure to see particular orders issued from the waroffice that all his majestys regiments of horse and dragoons except the light horse shall be mounted only on such horses as have their full tails without the least part taken from them  never surely did the tyrant man exercise a more wanton piece of cruelty over his subjects of the brute creation than in clipping the tails of the horses and robbing them of their fair and natural proportion castration itself cruel as it is carries to sportsmen and epicures some apology along with it fowls become a plumper and more delicious morsel after being made capons and horses converted into geldings are thereby rendered more tractable but we of the yahoo species have nothing to plead in our excuse to the generous houhnymn for thus barbarously depriving him of a part of his frame which nature has wisely given him for several purposes both of use and ornament  custom it is true has long authorized this savage practice yet it has not been able to reconcile us to it entirely in sculpture painting and tapestry horses still wear their full tails without the least part taken from them do but contemplate the figure of a king on horseback on a pedestal or of a general in a battle piece either on canvas or in the arras the mane and tail of the horse is as full and flowing as the periwig of the rider the tail of bucephalus himself has not a bolder sweep than that of the noble beasts who bear lewis the fourteenth or the duke of marlborough what should we say to stubbs were he to put a set of docked geldings to the chariot of phaeton or how should we consider the very same mutilations were we to make the experiments on other quadrupeds figure to yourself the view of a pasture covered with bulls cows sheep and oxen grazing on a common or a mountain as barebreeched as a highlander  this practice also to the shame of our age and nation be it spoken is both local and recent in the ancient times of chivalry what figure would a knight have made on such a maimed steed and what damsel would have deigned to mount a bobtailed palfry the beginning even of the present century saw our horses still in possession of their full tails it was then the bon ton foppingtons long tails were known on every road in christendom at present except lord falmouths set of duns and the royal octave of creamcoloured horses we have alas no long tails in the kingdom but the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty four is i hope the happy era from whence we may date their restoration all the english cavalry except the light horse shall be mounted only on such horses as have their full tails without the least part taken from them it was indeed high time for such a reformation many centuries elapsed before our constitution provided a law against attempts to deface and maim the human body and it was now become equally necessary to issue the above orders from the waroffice which it is hoped will operate as a kind of coventry act against hogging docking and nicking the horses  as a true patriot i am equally anxious to wipe off a national reflection as to alter the fashion this cruel practice is one of the stains on our manners which has given our enemies occasion to style us the savages of europe in france neither horse nor man nor woman can have too much hair but all carry it unviolated on their heads and their tails without the least part taken from them in england fullbottoms and full tails vanished at the same period cropeared coxcombs and docked horses hogged manes and hogged toupees came in together a wonderful analogy between the treatment of our fellow countrymens heads and their horses tails from this analogy it is that our neighbors have imbibed the associated idea of the savageness of our manners and an englishman at paris is sure to be reproached with the barbarity of our beheading kings and docking horses  a celebrated french writer expresses himself thus on this combination of inhuman usages in this country ah barbare angleterre ou le fatale couteau trenche les tetes aux rois and les cues aux chevaux some curious readers have in vain searched the henriade of voltaire for these lines it would have been equally vain to search the rest of his works or those of any other french author it is indeed impossible that such a couplet could have found a place in the epick poem from which they are pretendedly cited and if the writer had not heard them gravely quoted as lines of voltaire he should have thought it needless to mention that the french distich and the free translation both owe their origin to the writer of hippolitus  voltaires henriade  with a free translation of the above lines i shall conclude these reflections ah barbarous england kings and steeds to dock to curtail tails and sentence block to block   i am sir your humble servant hippolitus
