the beauties of english poesy selected by oliver goldsmith in two volumes  vol i  london printed for william griffin in catharine street in the strand      p  s b  preface my bookseller having informed me that there was no collection of english poetry among us of any estimation i thought a few hours spent in making a proper selection would not be ill bestowed compilations of this kind are chiefly designed for such as either want leisure skill or fortune to choose for themselves for persons whose professions turn them to different pursuits or who not yet arrived at sufficient maturity require a guide to direct their application to our youth particularly a publication of this sort may be useful since if compiled with any share of judgment it may at once unite precept and example show them what is beautiful and inform them why it is so i therefore offer this to the best of my judgment as the best collection that has yet appeared though as tastes are various numbers will be of a very different opinion many perhaps may wish to see in it the poems of their favorite authors others may wish that i had selected from works less generally read and others still may wish that i had selected from their own but my design was to give a useful unaffected compilation one that might tend to advance the readers taste and not impress him with exalted ideas of mine nothing so common and yet so absurd as affectation in criticism the desire of being thought to have a more discerning taste than others has often led writers to labor after error and to be foremost in promoting deformity in this compilation i run but few risques of that kind every poem here is well known and possessed or the public has been long mistaken of peculiar merit every poem has as aristotle expresses it a beginning a middle and an end in which however trifling the rule may seem most of the poetry in our language is deficient i claim no merit in the choice as it was obvious for in all languages the best productions are most easily found as to the short introductory criticisms to each poem they are rather designed for boys than men for it will be seen that i declined all refinement satisfied with being obvious and sincere in short if this work be useful in schools or amusing in the closet the merit all belongs to others i have nothing to boast and at best can expect not applause but pardon

most finished production and is perhaps the most perfect in our language it exhibits stronger powers of imagination more harmony of numbers and a greater knowledge of the world than any other of this poets works and it is probable if our country were called upon to show a specimen of their genius to foreigners this would be the work here fixed upon  what dire offense from amorous causes springs what mighty contests rise from trivial things i sing  this verse to caryl muse is due this even belinda may vouchsafe to view slight is the subject but not so the praise if she inspire and he approve my lays say what strange motive goddess could compel a wellbred lord tassault a gentle belle o say what stranger cause yet unexplord could make a gentle belle reject a lord in tasks so bold can little men engage and in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage sol through white curtains shot a timorous ray and oped those eyes that must eclipse the day now lapdogs gave themselves the rouzing shake and sleepless lovers just at twelve awake thrice rung the bell the slipper knocked the ground and the pressed watch returned a silver sound belinda still her downy pillow pressed her guardian sylph prolonged the balmy rest twas he had summoned to her silent bed the morning dream that hovered over her head a youth more glittering than a birthnight beau that even in slumber caused her cheek to glow seemed to her ear his winning lips to lay and thus in whispers said or seemed to say fairest of mortals thou distinguished care of thousand bright inhabitants of air if ever one vision touch thy infant thought of all the nurse and all the priest have taught of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen the silver token and the circled green or virgins visited by angelpowrs with golden crowns and wreaths of heavenly flowers hear and believe thy own importance know nor bound thy narrow views to things below some secret truths from learned pride concealed to maids alone and children are revealed what though no credit doubting wits may give the fair and innocent shall still believe know then unnumbered spirits round thee fly the light militia of the lower sky these though unseen are ever on the wing hang over the box and hover round the ring think what an equipage thou have in air and view with scorn two pages and a chair as now your own our beings were of old and once enclosed in womans beauteous mould thence by a soft transition we repair from earthly vehicles to these of air think not when womans transient breath is fled that all her vanities at once are dead succeeding vanities she still regards and though she plays no more oerlooks the cards her joy in gilded chariots when alive and love of ombre after death survive for when the fair in all their pride expire to their first elements their souls retire the sprites of fiery termagants in flame mount up and take a salamanders name soft yielding minds to water glide away and sip with nymphs their elemental tea the graver prude sinks downward to a gnome in search of mischief still on earth to roam the light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair and sport and flutter in the fields of air know farther yet whoever fair and chaste rejects mankind is by some sylph embraced for spirits freed from mortal laws with ease assume what sexes and what shapes they please what guards the purity of melting maids in courtly balls and midnight masquerades safe from the treacherous friend the daring spark the glance by day the whisper in the dark when kind occasion prompts their warm desires when music softens and when dancing fires it is but their sylph the wise celestials know though honor is the word with men below some nymphs there are too conscious of their face for life predestined to the gnomes embrace these swell their prospects and exalt their pride when offers are disdained and love denied then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain while peers and dukes and all their sweeping train and garters stars and coronets appear and in soft sounds your grace salutes their ear it is these that early taint the female soul instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know and little hearts to flutter at a beau often when the world imagine women stray the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way through all the giddy circle they pursue and old impertinence expel by new what tender maid but must a victim fall to one mans treat but for anothers ball when florio speaks what virgin could withstand if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand with varying vanities from every part they shift the moving toyshop of their heart where wigs with wigs with swordknots swordknots strive beaux banish beaux and coaches coaches drive this erring mortals levity may call oh blind to truth the sylphs contrive it all of these am i who thy protection claim a watchful sprite and ariel is my name late as i ranged the crystal wilds of air in the clear mirror of thy ruling star i saw alas some dread event impend ere to the main this morning sun descend but heaven reveals not what or how or where warned by the sylph oh pious maid beware this to disclose is all thy guardian can beware of all but most beware of man he said when shock who thought she slept too long leaped up and waked his mistress with his tongue twas then belinda if report say true thy eyes first opened on a billetdoux wounds charms and ardors were no sooner read but all the vision vanished from thy head and now unveiled the toilet stands displayed each silver vase in mystic order laid first robbed in white the nymph intent adores with head uncovered the cosmetic powers a heavenly image in the glass appears to that she bends to that her eyes she rears the inferior priestess at her altars side trembling begins the sacred rites of pride unnumberd treasures open at once and here the various offerings of the world appear from each she nicely culls with curious toil and decks the goddess with the glittering spoil this casket indias glowing gems unlocks and all arabia breathes from yonder box the tortoise here and elephant unite transformed to combs the speckled and the white here files of pins extend their shining rows puffs powders patches bibles billetdoux now awful beauty puts on all its arms the fair each moment rises in her charms repairs her smiles awakens every grace and calls forth all the wonders of her face sees by degrees a purer blush arise and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes the busy sylphs surround their darling care these set the head and those divide the hair some fold the sleeve whilst others plait the gown and bettys praised for labors not her own not with more glories in the etherial plain the sun first rises over the purpled main than issuing forth the rival of his beams launched on the bosom of the silvered thames fair nymphs and welldressd youths around her shone but every eye was fixed on her alone on her white breast a sparkling cross she wore which jews might kiss and infidels adore her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose quick as her eyes and as unfixd as those favors to none to all she smiles extends often she rejects but never once offends bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike and like the sun they shine on all alike yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride might hide her faults if belles had faults to hide if to her share some female errors fall look on her face and you will forget em all this nymph to the destruction of mankind nourished two locks which graceful hung behind in equal curls and well conspired to deck with shining ringlets the smooth ivory neck love in these labyrinths his slaves detains and mighty hearts are held in slender chains with hairy springes we the birds betray slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey fair tresses mens imperial race ensnare and beauty draws us with a single hair the adventurous baron the bright locks admired he saw he wished and to the prize aspired resolved to win he meditates the way by force to ravish or by fraud betray for when success a lovers toil attends few ask if fraud or force attained his ends for this ere phoebus rose he had implored propitious heaven and every power adored but chiefly love  to love an altar built of twelve vast french romances neatly gilt there lay three garters half a pair of gloves and all the trophies of his former loves with tender billetdoux he lights the pyre and breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes soon to obtain and long possess the prize the powers gave ear and granted half his prayer the rest the winds dispersed in empty air but now secure the painted vessel glides the sunbeams trembling on the floating tides while melting music steals upon the sky and softened sounds along the waters die smooth flow the waves the zephyrs gently play belinda smiled and all the world was gay all but the sylph  with careful thoughts oppressed the impending woe sat heavy on his breast he summons strait his denizens of air the lucid squadrons round the sails repair soft over the shrouds aerial whispers breathe that seemed but zephyrs to the train beneath some to the sun their insectwings unfold waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold transparent forms too fine for mortal sight their fluid bodies half dissolved in light loose to the wind their airy garments flew thin glittering textures of the filmy dew dipped in the richest tincture of the skies where light disports in evermingling dies while every beam new transient colors slings colors that change whenever they wave their wings amid the circle on the gilded mast superior by the head was ariel placed his purple pinions opening to the sun he raised his azure wand and thus begun ye sylphs and sylphids to your chief give ear fay fairies genii elves and demons hear ye know the spheres and various tasks assigned by laws eternal to the aerial kind some in the fields of purest ether play and bask and whiten in the blaze of day some guide the course of wandering orbs on high or roll the planets through the boundless sky some less refined beneath the moons pale light pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night or suck the mists in grosser air below or dip their pinions in the painted bow or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main or over the glebe distill the kindly rain others on earth over human race preside watch all their ways and all their actions guide of these the chief the care of nations own and guard with arms divine the british throne our humbler province is to tend the fair not a less pleasing though less glorious care to save the powder from too rude a gale nor let the imprisoned essences exhale to draw fresh colors from the vernal flowers to steal from rainbows ere they drop in showers a brighter wash to curl their waving hairs assist their blushes and inspire their airs nay often in dreams invention we bestow to change a flounce or add a furbelow this day black omens threat the brightest fair that ever deserved a watchful spirits care some dire disaster or by force or slight but what or where the fates have wrapped in night whether the nymph shall break dianas law or some frail chinajar receive a flaw or stain her honor or her new brocade forget her prayers or miss a masquerade or lose her heart or necklace at a ball or whether heaven has doomed that shock must fall haste then ye spirits to your charge repair the fluttering fan be zephyrettas care the drops to thee brillante we consign and momentilla let the watch be thine do thou crispissa tend her favorite lock ariel himself shall be the guard of shock to fifty chosen sylphs of special note we trust the important charge the petticoat often have we known that sevenfold fence to fail though stiff with hoops and armed with ribs of whale form a strong line about the silver bound and guard the wide circumference around whatever spirit careless of his charge his post neglects or leaves the fair at large shall feel sharp vengeance soon overtake his sins be stopped in vials or transfixed with pins or plangd in lakes of bitter washes lie or wedged whole ages in a bodkins eye gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain or alum styptics with contracting power shrink his thin essence like a shriveld flower or as ixion fixed the wretch shall feel the giddy motion of the whirling mill in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow and tremble at the sea that froths below he spoke the spirits from the sails descend some orb in orb around the nymph extend some third the mazy ringlets of her hair some hang upon the pendants of her ear with beating hearts the dire event they wait anxious and trembling for the birth of fate close by those meads forever crowned with flowers where thames with pride surveys his rising towers there stands a structure of majestic frame which from the neighboring hampton takes its name here britains statesmen often the fall foredoom of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home here thou great anna whom three realms obey do sometimes counsel take  and sometimes tea hither the heroes and the nymphs resort to taste awhile the pleasures of a court in various talk the instructive hours they past who gave the ball or paid the visit last one speaks the glory of the british queen and one describes a charming indian screen a third interprets motions looks and eyes at every word a reputation dies snuff or the fan supply each pause of chat with singing laughing ogling and all that meanwhile declining from the noon of day the sun obliquely shoots his burning ray the hungry judges soon the sentence sign and wretches hang that jurymen may dine the merchant from the exchange returns in peace and the long labors of the toilet cease belinda now whom thirst of fame invites burns to encounter two adventurous knights at ombre singly to decide their doom and swells her breast with conquests yet to come strait the three bands prepare in arms to join each band the number of the sacred nine soon as she spreads her hand the aerial guard descend and sit on each important card first ariel perched upon a matadore then each according to the rank he bore for sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race are as when women wondrous fond of place behold four kings in majesty revered with hoary whiskers and a forky beard and four fair queens whose hands sustain a flower the expressive emblem of their softer power four knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band caps on their heads and halberts in their hand and partycolored troops a shining train drawn forth to combat on the velvet plain the skilful nymph reviews her force with care let spades be trumps she said and trumps they were now move to war her sable matadores in show like leaders of the swarthy moors spadillio first unconquerable lord led off two captive trumps and swept the board as many more manillio forced to yield and marched a victor from the verdant field him basto followed but his fate more hard gained but one trump and one plebeian card with his broad sabre next a chief in years the hoary majesty of spades appears puts forth one manly leg to sight revealed the rest his manycolourd robe concealed the rebel knave who dares his prince engage proves the just victim of his royal rage even mighty pam that kings and queens oerthrew and mowed down armies in the fights of lu sad chance of war now destitute of aid falls undistinguished by the victor spade thus far both armies to belinda yield now to the baron fate inclines the field his warlike amazon her host invades the imperial consort of the crown of spades the clubs black tyrant first her victim died spite of his haughty mien and barbarous pride what boots the regal circle on his head his giant limbs in state unwieldy spread that long behind he trails his pompous robe and of all monarchs only grasps the globe the baron now his diamonds pours apace the embroidered king who shows but half his face and his refulgent queen with powers combined of broken troops an easy conquest find clubs diamonds hearts in wild disorder seen with throngs promiscuous strew the level green thus when dispersed a routed army runs of asias troops and africs sable sons with like confusion different nations fly of various habits and of various dye the pierced battalions disunited fall in heaps on heaps one fate oerwhelms them all the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts and wins oh shameful chance the queen of hearts at this the blood the virgins cheek forsook a livid paleness spreads over all her look she sees and trembles at the approaching ill just in the jaws of ruin and codille and now as often in some distempered state on one nice trick depends the general fate an ace of hearts steps forth the king unseen lurked in her hand and mourned his captive queen he springs to vengeance with an eager pace and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky the walls the woods and long canals reply o thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate too soon dejected and too soon elate sudden these honors shall be snatched away and cursed for ever this victorious day for lo the board with cups and spoons is crowned the berries crackle and the mill turns round on shining altars of japan they raise the silver lamp the fiery spirits blaze from silver spouts the grateful liquors glide while chinas earth receives the smoking tide at once they gratify their scent and taste and frequent cups prolong the rich repast strait hover round the fair her airy band some as she sippd the fuming liquor fanned some over her lap their careful plumes displayed trembling and conscious of the rich brocade coffee which makes the politician wise and see through all things with his half shut eyes sent up in vapors to the barons brain new stratagems the radiant lock to gain ah cease rash youth desist ere it is too late fear the just gods and think of scyllas fate changed to a bird and sent to flit in air she dearly pays for nisus injured hair but when to mischief mortals bend their will how soon they find fit instruments of ill just then clarissa drew with tempting grace a twoedged weapon from her shining case so ladies in romance assist their knight present the spear and arm him for the fight he takes the gift with reverence and extends the little engine on his fingers ends this just behind belindas neck he spread as over the fragrant steams she bends her head swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair a thousand wings by turns blow back the hair and thrice they twitchd the diamond in her ear thrice she looked back and thrice the foe drew near just in that instant anxious ariel sought the close recesses of the virgins thought as on the nosegay in her breast reclined he watched the ideas rising in her mind sudden he viewed in spite of all her art an earthly lover lurking at her heart amazed confused he found his power expired resigned to fate and with a sigh retired the peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide to enclose the lock now joins it to divide even then before the fatal engine closed a wretched sylph too fondly interposed fate urged the sheers and cut the sylph in twain but airy substance soon unites again the meeting points the sacred hair dissever from the fair head for ever and for ever then slashed the living lightning from her eyes and skreams of horror rend the affrighted skies not louder shrieks to pitying heaven are cast when husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last or when rich china vessels fallen from high in glittering dust and painted fragments lie let wreathes of triumph now my temples twine the victor cried the glorious prize is mine while fish in streams or birds delight in air or in a coach and six the british fair as long as atalantis shall be read or the small pillow grace a ladys bed while visits shall be paid on solemn days when numerous waxlights in bright order blaze while nymphs take treats or assignations give so long my honor name and praise shall live what time would spare from steel receives its date and monuments like men submit to fate steel could the labor of the gods destroy and strike to dust the imperial towers of troy steel could the works of mortal pride confound and hew triumphal arches to the ground what wonder then fair nymph thy hairs should feel the conquering force of unresisted steel but anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressed and secret passions labored in her breast not youthful kings in battle seized alive not scornful virgins who their charms survive not ardent lovers robbed of all their bliss not ancient ladies when refused a kiss not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die not cynthia when her manteaus pinned awry ever felt such rage resentment and despair as thou sad virgin for thy ravished hair for that sad moment when the sylphs withdrew and ariel weeping from belinda flew umbriel a dusky melancholy sprite as ever sullied the fair face of light down to the central earth his proper scene repaired to search the gloomy cave of spleen swift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome and in a vapor reached the dismal dome no cheerful breeze this sullen region knows the dreaded east is all the wind that blows here in a grotto sheltered close from air and screend in shades from days detested glare she sighs for ever on her pensive bed pain at her side and megrim at her head two handmaids wait the throne alike in place but differing far in figure and in face here stood ill nature like an ancient maid her wrinkled form in black and white arrayed with store of prayers for mornings nights and noons her hand is filled her bosom with lampoons there affectation with a sickly mien shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen practiced to lisp and hang the head aside faints into airs and languishes with pride on the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe wrapped in a gown for sickness and for show the fairones feel such maladies as these when each new nightdress gives a new disease a constant vapor over the palace flies strange phantoms rising as the mists arise dreadful as hermits dreams in haunted shades or bright as visions of expiring maids now glaring siends and snakes on rolling spires pale specter gaping tombs and purple fires now lakes of liquid gold elysian scenes and crystal domes and angels in machines unnumberd throngs on every side are seen of bodies changed to various forms by spleen here living teapots stand one arm held out one bent the handle this and that the spout a pipkin here like homers tripod walks here sighs a jar and there a goosepye talks men prove with child as powerful fancy works and maids turned bottles call aloud for corks safe passed the gnome through this fantastic band a branch of healing spleenwort in his hand then thus addressed the power  hail wayward queen who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen parent of vapors and of female wit who give the hysteric or poetic fit on various tempers act by various ways make some take physic others scribble plays who cause the proud their visits to delay and send the godly in a pet to pray a nymph there is that all thy power disdains and thousands more in equal mirth maintains but oh if ever thy gnome could spoil a grace or raise a pimple on a beauteous face like citronwaters matrons cheeks inflame or change complexions at a losing game if ever with airy horns i planted heads or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds or caused suspicion when no soul was rude or discomposed the headdress of a prude or ever to costive lapdog gave disease which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease hear me and touch belinda with chagrin that single act gives half the world the spleen the goddess with a discontented air seems to reject him though she grants his prayer a wondrous bag with both her hands she binds like that where once ulysses held the winds there she collects the force of female lungs sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues a vial next she fills with sainting fears soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears the gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day sunk in thalestris arms the nymph he found her eyes dejected and her hair unbound full over their heads the swelling bag he rent and all the furies issued at the vent belinda burns with more than mortal ire and fierce thalestris fans the rising fire o wretched maid she spread her hands and cried while hamptons echoes wretched maid replied was it for this you took such constant care the bodkin comb and essence to prepare for this your locks in paper durance bound for this with torturing irons writhed around for this with fillets strained your tender head and bravely bore the double loads of lead gods shall the ravisher display your hair while the eops envy and the ladies stare honor forbid at whose unrivaled shrine ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign methinks already i your tears survey already hear the horrid things they say already see you a degraded toast and all your honor in a whisper lost how shall i then your helpless fame defend twill then be infamy to seem your friend and shall this prize the inestimable prize exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes and heightened by the diamonds circling rays on that rapacious hand for ever blaze sooner shall grass in hydepark circus grow and wits take lodgings in the sound of bow sooner let earth air sea to chaos fall men monkeys lapdogs parrots perish all she said then raging to sir plume repairs and bids her beau demand the precious hairs sir plume of amber snuff box justly vain and the nice conduct of a clouded cane with earnest eyes and round unthinking face he first the snuff box opened then the case and thus broke out  my lord why what the devil z  ds damn the lock before gad you must be civil plague on it it is past a jest  nay prythee pox give her the hair  he spoke and rappd his box it grieves me much replied the peer again who speaks so well should ever speak in vain but by this lock this sacred lock i swear which never more shall join its parted hair which never more its honors shall renew clipped from the lovely head where late it grew that while my nostrils draw the vital air this hand which won it shall for ever wear he spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread the longcontended honors of her head but umbriel hateful gnome forbears not so he breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow then see the nymph in beauteous grief appears her eyes halflanguishing halfdrownd in tears on her heaved bosom hung her drooping head which with a sigh she raised and thus she said for ever cursed be this detested day which snatched my best my favorite curl away happy ah ten times happy had i been if hampton court these eyes had never seen yet am not i the first mistaken maid by love of courts to numerous ills betrayed oh had i rather unadmird remained in some lone isle or distant northern land where the gilt chariot never marks the way where none learn ombre none ever taste bohea there kept my charms concealed from mortal eye like roses that in deserts bloom and die what moved my mind with youthful lords to roam o had i stayed and said my prayers at home twas this the morning omens seemed to tell thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell the tottering china shook without a wind nay poll sat mute and shock was most unkind a sylph too warned me of the threats of fate in mystic visions now believed too late see the poor remnants of these slighted hairs my hands shall rend what even thy rapine spares these in two sable ringlets taught to break once gave new beauties to the snowy neck the sisterlock now fits uncouth alone and in its fellows fate foresees its own uncurld it hangs the fatal sheers demands and tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands oh had thou cruel been content to seize hairs less in sight or any hairs but these she said the pitying audience melt in tears but fate and jove had stopped the barons ears in vain thalestris with reproach assails for who can move when fair belinda fails not half so fixed the trojan could remain while anna begged and dido raged in vain then grave clarissa graceful waved her fan silence ensued and thus the nymph began say why are beauties praised and honored most the wise mans passion and the vain mans toast why decked with all that land and sea afford why angels called and angellike adored why round our coaches crowd the whiteglovd beaux why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows how vain are all these glories all our pains unless good sense preserve what beauty gains that men may say when we the frontbox grace behold the first in virtue as in face oh if to dance all night and dress all day charmed the smallpox or chased old age away who would not scorn what housewifes cares produce or who would learn one earthly thing of use to patch nay ogle might become a saint nor could it sure be such a sin to paint but since alas frail beauty must decay curled or uncurld since locks will turn to gray since painted or not painted all shall fade and she who scorns a man must die a maid what then remains but well our power to use and keep good humor still whatever we lose and trust me dear good humor can prevail when airs and flights and screams and scolding fail beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul so spoke the dame but no applause ensued belinda frowned thalestris called her prude to arms to arms the fierce virago cries and swift as lightning to the combat flies all side in parties and begin the attack fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack heroes and heroines shouts confusedly rise and base and treble voices strike the skies no common weapon in their hands are found like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound so when bold homer makes the gods engage and heavenly breasts with human passions rage against pallas mars latona hermes arms and all olympus rings with loud alarms joves thunder roars heaven trembles all around blue neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound earth shakes her nodding towers the ground gives way and the pale ghosts start at the flash of day triumphant umbriel on a sconces height clapped his glad wings and sat to view the fight proppd on their bodkin spears the sprites survey the growing combat or assist the fray while through the press enraged thalestris flies and scatters death around from both her eyes a beau and witling perished in the throng one died in metaphor and one in song o cruel nymph a living death i bear cried dapperwit and sunk beside his chair a mournful glance sir fopling upwards cast those eyes are made so killing  was his last thus on maeanders flowery margin lies the expiring swan and as he sings he dies when bold sir plume had drawn clarissa down chloe stepped in and killed him with a frown she smiled to see the doughty hero slain but at her smile the beau revived again now jove suspends his golden scales in air weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair the doubtful beam long nods from side to side at length the wits mount up the hairs subside see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes nor feared the chief the unequal fight to try who sought no more than on his foe to die but this bold lord with manly strength endud she with one finger and a thumb subdued just where the breath of life his nostrils drew a charge of snuff the wily virgin threw the gnomes direct to every atom just the pungent grains of titillating dust sudden with starting tears each eye overflows and the high dome reechoes to his nose now meet thy fate incensed belinda cried and drew a deadly bodkin from her side the same his ancient personage to deck her greatgreatgrandsire wore about his neck in three scalrings which after melted down formed a vast buckle for his widows gown her infant grandames whistle next it grew the bells she gingled and the whistle blew then in a bodkin graced her mothers hairs which long she wore and now belinda wears boast not my fall he cried insulting foe thou by some other shall be laid as low nor think to die dejects my lofty mind all that i dread is leaving you behind rather than so ah let me still survive and burn in cupids flames  but burn alive restore the lock she cries and all around restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound not fierce othello in so loud a strain roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain but see how often ambitious aims are crossed and chiefs contend till all the prize is lost the lock obtained with guilt and kept with pain in every place is sought but sought in vain with such a prize no mortal must be blessed so heaven decrees with heaven who can contest some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere since all things lost on earth are treasured there there heros wits are kept in ponderous vases and beaux in snuffboxes and tweezercases there broken vows and deathbed alms are found and lovers hearts with ends of ribband bound the courtiers promises and sick mans prayers the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs cages for knats and chains to yoke a flea dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry but trust the muse  she saw it upward rise though marked by none but quick poetic eyes so romes great founder to the heavens withdrew to proculus alone confessed in view a sudden star it shot through liquid air and drew behind a radiant tail of hair not berenices locks first rose so bright the heavens bespangling with disheveled light the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies and pleased pursue its progress through the skies this the beaumonde shall from the mall survey and hail with music its propitious ray this the blessed lover shall for venus take and send up vows from rosamondas lake this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies when next he looks through galilaeos eyes and hence the egregious wizard shall foredoom the fate of louis and the fall of rome then cease bright nymph to mourn thy ravished hair which adds new glory to the shining sphere not all the tresses that fair head can boast shall draw such envy as the lock you lost for after all the murders of your eye when after millions slain yourself shall die when those fair suns shall set as set they must and all those tresses shall be laid in dust this lock the muse shall consecrate to fame and midst the stars inscribe belindas name the hermit this poem is held in just esteem the versification being chaste and tolerably harmonious and the story told with perspicuity and conciseness it seems to have cost great labor both to mr pope and parnell himself to bring it to this perfection it may not be amiss to observe that the fable is taken from one of dr henry moores dialogues  far in a wild unknown to public view from youth to age a reverend hermit grew the moss his bed the cave his humble cell his food the fruits his drink the crystal well remote from man with god he passed the days prayer all his business all his pleasure praise a life so sacred such serene repose seemed heaven itself till one suggestion rose that vice should triumph virtue vice obey this sprung some doubt of providences sway his hopes no more a certain prospect boast and all the tenor of his soul is lost so when a smooth expanse receives impressed calm natures image on its watery breast down bend the banks the trees depending grow and skies beneath with answring colors glow but if a stone the gentle sea divide swift ruffling circles curl on every side and glimmering fragments of a broken sun banks seas and skies in thick disorder run to clear this doubt to know the world by sight to find if books or swains report it right for yet by swains alone the world he knew whose feet came wandering over the nightly dew he quits his cell the pilgrimstaff he bore and fixed the scallop in his hat before then with the sun a rising journey went sedate to think and watching each event the morn was wasted in the pathless grass and long and lonesome was the wild to pass but when the southern sun had warmed the day a youth came posting over a crossing way his raiment decent his complexion fair and soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair then near approaching father hail he cried and hail my son the reverend fire replied words followed words from question answer flowed and talk of various kind deceived the road till each with other pleased and loath to part while in their rage they differ join in heart thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around now sunk the sun the closing hour of day came onward mantled over with sober gray nature in silence bid the world repose when near the road a stately palace rose there by the moon through ranks of trees they pass whose verdure crowned their sloping sides of grass it chanced the noble master of the dome still made his house the wandering strangers home yet still the kindness from a thirst of praise proved the vain flourish of expensive ease the pair arrive the liveryd servants wait their lord receives them at the pompous gate the table groans with costly piles of food and all is more than hospitably good then led to rest the days long toil they drown deep sunk in sleep and silk and heaps of down at length it is morn and at the dawn of day along the wide canals the zephyrs play fresh over the gay parterre the breezes creep and shake the neighboring wood to banish sleep up rise the guests obedient to the call an early banquet decked the splendid hall rich luscious wine a golden goblet graced which the kind master forced the guests to taste then pleased and thankful from the porch they go and but the landlord none had cause of woe his cup was vanished for in secret guise the younger guest purloind the glittering prize as one who spies a serpent in his way glistning and basking in the summer ray disordered stops to shun the danger near then walks with faintness on and looks with fear so seemed the sire when far upon the road the shining spoil his wily partner showed he stopped with silence walked with trembling heart and much he wished but durst not ask to part murmuring he lifts his eyes and thinks it hard that generous actions meet a base reward while thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds the changing skies hang out their sable clouds a sound in air presaged approaching rain and beasts to covert scud across the plain warned by the signs the wandering pair retreat to seek for shelter at a neighboring seat twas built with turrets on a rising ground and strong and large and unimprovd around its owners temper timorous and severe unkind and griping caused a desert there as near the misers heavy doors they drew fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew the nimble lightning mixed with showers began and over their heads loud rolling thunder ran here long they knock but knock or call in vain driven by the wind and battered by the rain at length some pity warmed the masters breast it was then his threshold first received a guest slow creaking turns the door with jealous care and half he welcomes in the shivering pair one frugal faggot lights the naked walls and natures fervor through their limbs recalls bread of the coarsest sort with eager wine each hardly granted served them both to dine and when the tempest first appeared to cease a ready warning bid them part in peace with still remark the pondring hermit viewed in one so rich a life so poor and rude and why should such within himself he cried lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside but what new marks of wonder soon took place in every settling feature of his face when from his vest the young companion bore that cup the generous landlord owned before and paid profusely with the precious bowl the stinted kindness of his churlish soul but now the clouds in airy tumult fly the sun emerging opes an azure sky a fresher green the smelling leaves display and glittering as they tremble cheer the day the weather courts them from the poor retreat and the glad master bolts the wary gate while hence they walk the pilgrims bosom wrought with all the travail of uncertain thought his partners acts without their cause appear twas there a vice and seemed a madness here detesting that and pitying this he goes lost and confounded with the various shows now nights dim shades again involve the sky again the wandrers want a place to lie again they search and find a lodging nigh the soil improved around the mansion neat and neither poorly low nor idly great it seemed to speak its masters turn of mind content and not for praise but virtue kind hither the walkers turn with weary feet then bless the mansion and the master greet their greeting fair bestowed with modest guise the courteous master hears and thus replies without a vain without a grudging heart to him who gives us all i yield a part from him you come for him accept it here a frank and sober more than costly cheer he spoke and bid the welcome table spread then talked of virtue till the time of bed when the grave household round his hall repair warned by a bell and close the hours with prayer at length the world renewed by calm repose was strong for toil the dappled morn arose before the pilgrims part the younger crept near the closed cradle where an infant slept and writhed his neck the landlords little pride o strange return grew black and gaspd and died horror of horrors what his only son how looked our hermit when the fact was done not hell though hells black jaws in sunder part and breathe blue fire could more assault his heart confused and struck with silence at the deed he flies but trembling fails to fly with speed his steps the youth pursues the country lay perplexed with roads a servant showed the way a river crossed the path the passage over was nice to find the servant rode before long arms of oaks an open bridge supplied and deep the waves beneath the bending glide the youth who seemed to watch a time to sin approached the careless guide and thrust him in plunging he falls and rising lifts his head then flashing turns and sinks among the dead wild sparkling rage inflames the fathers eyes he bursts the bands of fear and madly cries detested wretch  but scarce his speech began when the strange partner seemed no longer man his youthful face grew more serenely sweet his robe turned white and flowed upon his feet fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair celestial odours breathe through purpled air and wings whose colors glittered on the day wide at his back the gradual plumes display the form etherial bursts upon his sight and moves in all the majesty of light though loud at first the pilgrims passion grew sudden he gazed and wist not what to do surprise in secret chains his words suspends and in a calm his settling temper ends but silence here the beauteous angel broke the voice of music ravished as he spoke thy prayer thy praise thy life to vice unknown in sweet memorial rise before the throne these charms success in our bright region find and force an angel down to calm thy mind for this commissioned i forsook the sky nay cease to kneel  thy fellow servants i then know the truth of government divine and let these scruples be no longer thine the maker justly claims that world he made in this the right of providence is laid its sacred majesty through all depends on using second means to work his ends it is thus withdrawn in state from human eye the power exerts his attributes on high your actions uses nor controuls your will and bids the doubting sons of men be still what strange events can strike with more surprise than those which lately struck thy wondering eyes yet taught by these confess the almighty just and where you cannot unriddle learn to trust the great vain man who fared on costly food whose life was too luxurious to be good who made his ivory stands with goblets shine and forced his guests to morning draughts of wine has with the cup the graceless custom lost and still he welcomes but with less of cost the mean suspicious wretch whose bolted door never moved in duty to the wandering poor with him i left the cup to teach his mind that heaven can bless if mortals will be kind conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl and feels compassion touch his grateful soul thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead with heaping coals of fire upon its head in the kind warmth the metal learns to glow and loose from dross the silver runs below long had our pious friend in virtue trod but now the child halfweand his heart from god child of his age for him he lived in pain and measured back his steps to earth again to what excesses had his dotage run but god to save the father took the son to all but thee in fits he seemed to go and twas my ministry to deal the blow the poor fond parent humbled in the dust now owns in tears the punishment was just but now had all his fortune felt a wreck had that false servant sped in safety back this night his treasured heaps he meant to steal and what a fund of charity would fail thus heaven instructs thy mind this trial over depart in peace resign and sin no more on sounding pinions here the youth withdrew the sage stood wondering as the seraph flew thus looked elisha when to mount on high his master took the chariot of the sky the fiery pomp ascending left the view the prophet gazed and wished to follow too the bending hermit here a prayer begun lord as in heaven on earth thy will be done then gladly turning sought his ancient place and passed a life of piety and peace il penseroso i have heard a very judicious critic say that he had an higher idea of miltons style in poetry from the two following poems than from his paradise lost it is certain the imagination shown in them is correct and strong the introduction to both in irregular measure is borrowed from the italians and hurts an english ear  hence vain deluding joys the brood of folly without father bred how little you bested or fill the fixed mind with all your toys dwell in some

and missing thee i walk unseen on the dry smoothshaven green to behold the wandering moon riding near her highest noon like one that had been led astray through the heavens wide pathless way and often as if her head she bowed stooping through a fleecy cloud often on a plat of rising ground i hear the faroff curfew sound over some widewaterd shore swinging slow with sullen roar or if the air will not permit some still removed place will fit where glowing embers through the room teach light to counterfeit a gloom far from all resort of mirth save the cricket on the hearth or the bellmans drowsy charm to bless the doors from nightly harm or let my lamp at midnight hour be seen in some high lonely tower where i may often outwatch the bear with thrice great hermes or unsphere the spirit of

enchantments drear where more is meant than meets the ear thus night often see me in thy pale career till civilsuited morn appear not trickt and frounct as she was wont with the attic boy to hunt but kercheft in a comely cloud while rocking winds are piping loud or ushered with a shower still when the gust has blown its fill ending on the rustling leaves with minute drops from off the eaves and when the sun begins to fling his flaring beams me goddess bring to arched walks of twilight groves and shadows brown that sylvan loves of pine or monumental oak where the rude ax with heaved stroke was never heard the nymphs to daunt or fright them from their hallowed haunt there in close covert by some brook where no profaner eye may look hide me from days garish eye while the be with honeyd thigh that at her flowery work does sing and the waters murmuring with such consort as they keep entice the dewy feathered sleep and let some strange mysterious dream wave at his wings in aerie stream of lively portraiture displayed softly on my eyelids laid and as i wake sweet music breathe above about or underneath sent by some spirit to mortals good or the unseen genius of the wood but let my due feet never fail to walk the studious cloisters pale and love the high embowed roof with antic pillars massy proof and storied windows richly dight casting a dim religious light there let the pealing organ blow to the full voicd quire below in service high and anthems clear as may with sweetness through mine ear dissolve me into ecstasies and bring all heaven before mine eyes and may at last my weary age find out the peaceful hermitage the hairy grown and mossy cell where i may sit and rightly spell of every star that heaven does show and every herb that sips the dew till old experience do attain to something like prophetic strain these pleasures melancholy give and i with thee will choose to live lallegro hence loathed melancholy of cerberus and blackest midnight born in stygian cave forlorn amongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy find out some uncouth cell where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings and the night raven sings there under ebon shades and lowbrowd rocks as ragged as thy locks in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell but come thou goddess fair and free in heaven yclepd euphrosine and by men hearteasing mirth whom lovely venus at a birth with two sister graces more to ivycrowned bacchus bore or whether as some sages sing the frolic wind that breathes the spring zephyr with aurora playing as he met her once a maying there on beds of violets blue and fresh blown roses washed in dew filled her with thee a daughter fair so buxom blithe and debonair haste thee nymph and bring with thee jest and youthful jollity quips and cranks and wanton wiles nods and becks and wreathed smiles such as hang on hebes cheek and love to live in dimple sleek sport that wrinkled care derides and laughter holding both his sides come and trip it as you go on the light fantastic toe and in thy right hand lead with thee the mountain nymph sweet liberty and if i give thee honor due mirth admit me of thy crew to live with her and live with thee in unreproved pleasures free to hear the lark begin his flight and singing startle the dull night from his watchtowr in the skies till the dappled dawn does rise then to come in spite of sorrow and at my window bid good morrow through the sweetbriar or the vine or the twisted eglantine while the cock with lively din scatters the rear of darkness thin and to the stack or barndoor stoutly struts his dames before often listening how the hounds and horn chearly rouse the slumbering morn from the side of some hoar hill through the high wood echoing shrill some time walking not unseen by hedge row elms on hillocks green right against the eastern gate where the great sun begins his state robbed in flames and amber light the clouds in thousand liveries dight while the plowman near at hand whistles over the furrowed land and the milkmaid sings blithe and the mower whets his scythe and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale strait mine eye has caught new pleasures whilst the landscape round it measures russet lawns and fallows gray where the nibbling flocks do stray mountains on whose barren breast the laboring clouds do often rest meadows trim with daisies pied shallow brooks and rivers wide towers and battlements it sees bosomed high in tufted trees where perhaps some beauty lies the cynosure of neighboring eyes hard by a cottage chimney smokes from betwixt two aged oaks where corydon and thyrsis met are at their savory dinner set of herbs and other country messes which the neat handed phillis dresses and then in haste her bower she leaves with thestylis to bind the sheaves or if the earlier season lead to the tanned haycock in the mead sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite when the merry bells ring round and the jocund rebecs sound to many a youth and many a maid dancing in the checkered shade and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holy day till the livelong daylight fail then to the spicy nutbrown ale with stories told of many a feat how fairy mab the junkets eat she was pincht and pulled she said and he by fryars lanthorn led tells how the drudging goblin swet to earn his creambowl duly set when in one night ere glimpse of morn his shadowy flale had thrashd the corn that ten daylabrers could not end then lies him down the lubbard fiend and stretched out all the chimneys length basks at the fire his hairy strength and cropfull out of doors he flings ere the first cock his matin lings thus done the tales to bed they creep by whispering winds soon lulled asleep towered cities please us then and the busy hum of men where throngs of knights and barons bold in weeds of peace high triumphs hold with store of ladies whose bright eyes rain influence and judge the prize of wit or arms while both contend to win her grace whom all commend there let hymen often appear in saffron robe with taper clear and pomp and feast and revelry with mask and antique pageantry such fights as youthful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream then to the welltrod stage anon if johnsons learned sock be on or sweetest shakespeare fancys child warble his native woodnotes wild and ever against eating cares lap me in soft lydian airs married to immortal verse such as the meeting soul may pierce in notes with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out with wanton heed and giddy cunning the melting voice through mazes running untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony that orpheus self may heave his head from golden slumber on a bed of heapt elysian flower and hear such strains as would have won the ear of pluto to have quite set free his half regained eurydice these delights if thou can give mirth with thee i mean to live an elegy written in a country church yard this is a very fine poem but overloaded with epithet the heroic measure with alternate rhyme is very properly adapted to the solemnity of the subject as it is the slowest movement that our language admits of the latter part of the poem is pathetic and interesting  the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd winds slowly over the lea the plowman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his drony flight and drousy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivymantled tower the moping owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incensebreathing morn the swallow twittring from the strawbuilt shed the cocks shrill clarion or the echoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her evening care nor children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share often did the harvest to their sickle yield their surrow often the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth ever gave await alike the inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory over their tomb no trophies raise where through the longdrawn isle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honors voice provoke the silent dust or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have swayed or waked to ecstasy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some villagehampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muses flame far from the madding crowds ignoble strife their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by the unlettered muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to dye for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being ever resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires even from the tomb the voice of nature cries even in our ashes live their wonted fires for thee who mindful of the unhonourd dead do in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate happily some hoaryheaded swain may say often have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wriths its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn muttring his wayward fancies he would rove now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or crossed in hopeless love one morn i missed him on the customd hill along the heath and near his favorite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he the next with dirges due in sad array slow through the churchyard path we saw him borne approach and read for thou can read the lay engraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn the epitaph here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melancholy marked him for her own large was his bounty and his soul sincere heaven did a recompense as largely send he gave to misery all he had a tear he gained from heaven it was all he wished a friend no farther seek his merits to disclose or draw his frailties from their dread abode there they alike in trembling hope repose the bosom of his father and his god  london in imitation of the third satire of juvenal this poem of mr johnsons is the best imitation of the original that has appeared in our language being possessed of all the force and satirical resentment of juvenal imitation gives us a much truer idea of the ancients than even translation could do  though grief and fondness in my breast rebel when injured thales bids the town farewell yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend i praise the hermit

rabble rages now a fire their ambush here relentless ruffians lay and here the fell attorney prowls for prey here falling houses thunder on your head and here a female atheist talks you dead while thales waits the wherry that contains of dissipated wealth the small remains on thamess bank in silent thought we stood where greenwich smiles upon the silver flood struck with the seat that gave eliza birth we kneel and kiss the consecrated earth in pleasing dreams the blissful age renew and call britannias glories back to view behold her cross triumphant on the main the guard of commerce and the dread of spain ere masquerades debauched excise oppressed or english honor grew a standing jest a transient calm the happy scenes bestow and for a moment lull the sense of woe at length awaking

deserves the highest applause as it far surpasses all that went before it the concluding part though a little too much crowded is very masterly  sure there are poets which did never dream upon parnassus nor did taste the stream of helicon we therefore may suppose those made not poets but the poets those and as courts make not kings but kings the court so where the muses and their train resort parnassus stands if i can be to thee a poet thou parnassus art to me nor wonder if advantaged in my flight by taking wing from thy auspicious height through untracd ways and airy paths i fly more boundless in my fancy than my eye my eye which swift as thought contracts the space that lies between and first salutes the place crowned with that sacred pile so vast so high that whether it is a part of earth or sky uncertain seems and may be thought a proud aspiring mountain or descending cloud pauls the late theme of such a mr waller muse whose flight has bravely reached and soared above thy height now shall thou stand though sword or time or fire or zeal more fierce than they thy fall conspire secure whilst thee the best of poets sings preserved from ruin by the best of kings under his proud survey the city lies and like a mist beneath a hill does rise whose state and wealth the business and the crowd seems at this distance but a darker cloud and is to him who rightly things esteems no other in effect than what it seems where with like haste though several ways they run some to undo and some to be undone while luxury and wealth like war and peace are each the others ruin and increase as rivers lost in seas some secret vein thence reconveys there to be lost again oh happiness of sweet retired content to be at once secure and innocent windsor the next where mars with venus dwells beauty with strength above the valley swells into my eye and does itself present with such an easy and unforced ascent that no stupendous precipice denies access no horror turns away our eyes but such a rise as does at once invite a pleasure and a reverence from the sight thy mighty masters emblem in whose face sat meekness heightened with majestic grace such seems thy gentle height made only proud to be the basis of that pompous load than which a nobler weight no mountain bears but atlas only which supports the spheres when natures hand this ground did thus advance twas guided by a wiser power than chance marked out for such an use as if twere meant to invite the builder and his choice prevent nor can we call it choice when what we choose folly or blindness only could refuse a crown of such majestic towers does grace the gods great mother when her heavenly race do homage to her yet she cannot boast among that numerous and celestial host more heroes than can windsor nor does fames immortal book record more noble names not to look back so far to whom this isle owes the first glory of so brave a pile whether to caesar albanact or brute the british arthur or the danish knute though this of old no less contest did move than when for homers birth sevn cities strove like him in birth thou should be like in fame as thine his fate if mine had been his flame but whosoeer it was nature designed first a brave place and then as brave a mind not to recount those several kings to whom it gave a cradle or to whom a tomb but thee great edward iii and the black prince edward and thy greater son the lillies which his father wore he won and thy queen philip bellona who the consort came not only to thy bed but to thy fame she to thy triumph led one captive the kings of france and scotland king and brought that son which did the second bring then did thou found that order whether love or victory thy royal thoughts did move each was a noble cause and nothing less than the design has been the great success which foreign kings and emperors esteem the second honor to their diadem had thy great destiny but given thee skill to know as well as power to act her will that from those kings who then thy captives were in aftertimes should spring a royal pair who should possess all that thy mighty power or thy desires more mighty did devour to whom their better fate reserves whatever the victor hopes for or the vanquished fear that blood which thou and thy great grandsire shed and all that since these sister nations bled had been unspilt had happy edward known that all the blood he spilt had been his own when he that patron chose in whom are joined soldier and martyr and his arms confined within the azure circle he did seem but to foretell and prophesy of him who to his realms that azure round has joined which nature for their bound at first designed that bound which to the worlds extremest ends endless itself its liquid arms extends nor does he need those emblems which we paint but is himself the soldier and the saint here should my wonder dwell and here my praise but my fixed thoughts my wondering eye betrays viewing a neighboring hill whose top of late a chapel crowned till in the common fate the adjoining abbey fell may no such storm fall on our times where ruin must reform tell me my muse what monstrous dire offense what crime could any christian king incense to such a rage was it luxury or lust was he so temperate so chaste to just were these their crimes they were his own much more but wealth is crime enough to him that is poor who having spent the treasures of his crown condemns their luxury to feed his own and yet this act to varnish over the shame of sacrilege must bear devotions name no crime so bold but would be understood a real or at least a seeming good who fears not to do ill yet fears the name and free from conscience is a slave to fame thus he the church at once protects and spoils but princes swords are sharper than their styles and thus to the ages past he makes amends their charity destroys their faith defends then did religion in a lazy cell in empty airy contemplations dwell and like the block unmoved lay but ours as much too active like the stork devours is there no temperate region can be known betwixt their frigid and our torrid zone could we not wake from that lethargic dream but to be restless in a worse extreme and for that lethargy was there no cure but to be cast into a calenture can knowledge have no bound but must advance so far to make us wish for ignorance and rather in the dark to grope our way than led by a false guide to err by day who sees these dismal heaps but would demand what barbarous invader sacked the land but when he hears no goth no turk did bring this desolation but a christian king when nothing but the name of zeal appears twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs what does he think our sacrilege would spare when such the effects of our devotions are parting from thence twixt anger shame and fear those for what is past and this for what is too near my eye descending from the hill surveys where thames among the wanton valleys strays thames the most loved of all the oceans sons by his old sire to his embraces runs hasting to pay his tribute to the sea like mortal life to meet eternity though with those streams he no resemblance hold whose foam is amber and their gravel gold his genuine and less guilty wealth texplore search not his bottom but survey his shore over which he kindly spreads his spacious wing and hatches plenty for the ensuing spring nor then destroys it with too fond a stay like mothers which their infants overlay nor with a sudden and impetuous wave like profuse kings resumes the wealth he gave no unexpected inundations spoil the mowers hopes or mock the ploughmans toil but godlike his unwearied bounty flows first loves to do then loves the good he does nor are his blessings to his banks confined but free and common as the sea or wind when he to boast or to disperse his stores full of the tributes of his grateful shores visits the world and in his flying towers brings home to us and makes both indies ours finds wealth where it is bestows it where it wants cities in deserts woods in cities plants so that to us no things no place is strange while his fair bosom is the worlds exchange o could i flow like thee and make thy stream my great example as it is my theme though deep yet clear though gentle not yet dull strong without rage without overflowing full heaven her eridanus no more shall boast whose fame in thine like lesser currents lost thy nobler streams shall visit joves abodes to shine among the stars and bathe the gods here nature whether more intent to please us or herself with strange varieties for things of wonder give no less delight to the wise makers than beholders sight though these delights from several causes move for so our children thus our friends we love wisely she knew the harmony of things as well as that of sounds from discord springs such was the discord which did first disperse form order beauty through the universe while dryness moisture coldness heat resists all that we have and that we are subsists while the steep horrid roughness of the wood strives with the gentle calmness of the flood such huge extremes when nature does unite wonder from thence results from thence delight the stream is to transparent pure and clear that had the selfenamourd youth gazed here so fatally deceived he had not been while he the bottom not his face had seen but his proud head the airy mountain hides among the clouds his shoulders and his sides a shady mantle clothes his curled brows frown on the gentle stream which calmly flows while winds and storms his lofty forehead beat the common fate of all that is high or great low at his foot a spacious plain is placed between the mountain and the stream embraced which shade and shelter from the hill derives while the kind river wealth and beauty gives and in the mixture of all these appears variety which all the rest indears this scene had some bold greek or british bard beheld of old what stories had we heard of fairies satyrs and the nymphs their dames their feasts their revels and their amorous flames it is still the same although their airy shape all but a quick poetic sight escape there faunus and sylvanus keep their courts and thither all the horned host resorts to graze the ranker mead that noble herd on whose sublime and shady fronts is reared natures great masterpiece to show how soon great things are made but sooner are undone here have i seen the king when great affairs gave leave to slacken and unbend his cares attended to the chase by all the flower of youth whose hopes a noble prey devour pleasure with praise and danger they would buy and wish a foe that would not only fly the stag now conscious of his fatal growth at once indulgent to his fear and sloth to some dark covert his retreat had made where nor mans eye nor heavens should invade his soft repose when the unexpected sound of dogs and men his wakeful ear does wound roused with the noise he scarce believes his ear willing to think thillusions of his fear had given this false alarm but straight his view confirms that more than all he fears is true betrayed in all his strengths the wood beset all instruments all arts of ruin met he calls to mind his strength and then his speed his winged heels and then his armed head with these to avoid with that his fate to meet but fear prevails and bids him trust his feet so fast he flies that his reviewing eye has lost the chasers and his ear the cry exulting till he finds their nobler sense their disproportioned speed does recompense then curses his conspiring feet whose scent betrays that safety which their swiftness lent then tries his friends among the baser herd where he so lately was obeyed and feared his safety seeks the herd unkindly wise or chases him from thence or from him flies like a declining statesman left forlorn to his friends pity and pursuers scorn with shame remembers while himself was one of the same herd himself the same had done thence to the coverts and the conscious groves the scenes of his past triumphs and his loves sadly surveying where he ranged alone prince of the soil and all the herd his own and like a bold knight errant did proclaim combat to all and bore away the dame and taught the woods to echo to the stream his dreadful challenge and his clashing beam yet faintly now declines the fatal strife so much his love was dearer than his life now every leaf and every moving breath presents a foe and every foe a death wearied forsaken and pursued at last all safety in despair of safety placed courage he thence resumes resolved to bear all their assaults since it is in vain to fear and now too late he wishes for the fight that strength he wasted in ignoble flight but when he sees the eager chase renewed himself by dogs the dogs by men pursued he strait revokes his bold resolve and more repents his courage than his fear before finds that uncertain ways unsafest are and doubt a greater mischief than despair then to the stream when neither friends nor force nor speed nor art avail he shapes his course thinks not their rage so desperate to assay an element more merciless than they but fearless they pursue nor can the flood quench their dire thirst alas they thirst for blood so toward a ship the oarfinnd galleys ply which wanting sea to ride or wind to fly stands but to fall revenged on those that dare tempt the last fury of extreme despair so fares the stag among the enraged hounds repels their force and wounds returns for wounds and as a hero whom his baser foes in troops surround now these assail now those though prodigal of life disdains to die by common hands but if he can descry some nobler foe approach to him he calls and begs his fate and then contented falls so when the king a mortal shaft lets fly from his unerring hand then glad to die proud of the wound to it resigns his blood and stains the crystal with a purple flood this a more innocent and happy chase than when of old but in the selfsame place fair liberty pursued and meant a prey to lawless power runnimede where that great charter was first sealed here turned and stood at bay when in that remedy all hope was placed which was or should have been at least the last here was that charter sealed wherein the crown all marks of arbitrary power lays down tyrant and slave those names of hate and fear the happier style of king and subject bear happy when both to the same center move when kings give liberty and subjects love therefore not long in force this charter stood wanting that seal it must be sealed in blood the subjects armed the more their princes gave the advantage only took the more to crave till kings by giving give themselves away and even that power that should deny betray who gives constrained but his own fear reviles not thankt but scorned nor are they gifts but spoils thus kings by grasping more than they could hold first made their subjects by oppression bold and popular sway by forcing kings to give more than was fit for subjects to receive ran to the same extremes and one excess made both by striving to be greater lss when a calm river raised with sudden rains or snows dissolved overflows the adjoining plains the husbandmen with highraisd banks secure their greedy hopes and this he can endure but if with bays and dams they strive to force his channel to a new or narrow course no longer then within his banks he dwells first to a torrent then a deluge swells stronger and fiercer by restraint he roars and knows no bound but makes his power his shores eloisa to abelard the harmony of numbers in this poem is very fine it is rather drawn out to too tedious a length although the passions vary with great judgment it may be considered as superior to any thing in the epistolary way and the many translations which have been made of it into the modern languages are in some measure a proof of this  in these deep solitudes and awful cells where heavnlypensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its longforgotten heat yet yet i love  from abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name dear fatal name rest ever unreveald nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed hide it my heart within that close disguise where mixed with gods his loved idea lies o write it not my hand  the name appears already written  wash it out my tears in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays her heart still dictates and her hand obeys relentless walls whose darksome round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn ye grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thorn shrines where their vigils paleeyd virgins keep and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep though cold like you unmoved and silent grown i have not yet forgot myself to stone all is not heavens while abelard has part still rebel nature holds out half my heart nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain soon as thy letters trembling i unclose that wellknown name awakens all my woes oh name for ever sad for ever dear still breathed in sighs still ushered with a tear i tremble too wherever my own i find some dire misfortune follows close behind line after line my gushing eyes overflow led through a sad variety of woe now warm in love now withering in my bloom lost in a convents solitary gloom there stern religion quenched the unwilling flame there died the best of passions love and fame yet write oh write me all that i may join griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine nor foes nor fortune take this power away and is my abelard less kind than they tears still are mine and those i need not spare love but demands what else were shed in prayer no happier task these faded eyes pursue to read and weep is all they now can do then share thy pain allow that sad relief ah more than share it give me all thy grief heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid some banished lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to its fires the virgins wish without her fears impart excuse the blush and pour out all the heart speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul and waft a sigh from indus to the pole thou know how guiltless first i met thy flame when love approached me under friendships name my fancy formed thee of angelic kind some emanation of the allbeauteous mind those smiling eyes attempring every ray shone sweetly lambent with celestial day guiltless i gazed heaven listened while you sung and truths divine came mended from that tongue from lips like those what precept failed to move too soon they taught me twas no sin to love back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran nor wished an angel whom i loved a man dim and remote the joys of saints i see nor envy them that heaven i lose for thee how often when pressed to marriage have i said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies let wealth let honor wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame before true passion all those views remove fame wealth and honor what are you to love the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and bids them make mistaken mortals groan who seek in love for aught but love alone should at my feet the worlds great master fall himself his throne his world i would scorn em all not caesars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love if there be yet another name more free more fond than mistress make me that to thee oh happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature law all then is full possessing and possessed no craving void left aching in the breast even thought meets thought ere from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be and once the lot of abelard and me alas how changed what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had opposed the dire command barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain the crime was common common be the pain i can no more by shame by rage suppressed let tears and burning blushes speak the rest can thou forget that sad that solemn day when victims at yon altars foot we lay can thou forget what tears that moment fell when warm in youth i bade the world farewell as with cold lips i kissed the sacred veil the shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale heaven scarce believed the conquest it surveyed and saints with wonder heard the vows i made yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixed but you not grace or zeal love only was my call and if i lose thy love i lose my all come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe those still at least are left thee to bestow still on that breast enamored let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressed give all thou can  and let me dream the rest ah no instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care plants of thy hand and children of thy prayer from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you raised these hallowed walls the desert smiled and paradise was opened in the wild no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors no silver saints by dying misers given here bribed the rage of illrequited heaven but such plain roofs as piety could raise and only vocal with the makers praise in these lone walls their days eternal bound these mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crowned where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray and gleams of glory brightened all the day but now no face divine contentment wears it is all blank sadness or continual tears see how the force of others prayers i try o pious fraud of amorous charity but why should i on others prayers depend come thou my father brother husband friend ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move and all those tender names in one thy love the darksome pines that over yon rocks reclined wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wandering streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinkling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid but over the twilight groves and dusky caves longsounding isles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a deathlike silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades every flower and darkens every green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods yet here for ever ever must i stay sad proof how well a lover can obey death only death can break the lasting chain and here even then shall my cold dust remain here all its frailties all its flames resign and wait till it is no sin to mix with thine ah wretch believed the spouse of god in vain confessed within the slave of love and man assist me heaven but whence arose that prayer sprung it from piety or from despair even here where frozen chastity retires love finds an altar for forbidden sires i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault i view my crime but kindle at the view repent old pleasures and solicit new now turned to heaven i weep my past offense now think of thee and curse my innocence of all affliction taught a lover yet it is sure the hardest science to forget how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense and love the offender yet detest the offense how the dear object from the crime remove or how distinguish penitence from love unequal task a passion to resign for hearts so touched so pierced so lost as mine ere such a soul regains its peaceful state how often must it love how often hate how often hope despair resent regret conceal disdain  do all things but forget but let heaven seize it all at once it is fired not touched but rapt not wakened but inspired oh come oh teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life myself  and you fill my fond heart with god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayer accepted and each wish resigned labor and rest that equal periods keep obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composed affections ever even tears that delight and sighs that waft to heaven grace shines around her with serenest beams and whispering angels prompt her golden dreams for her the unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymenaeals sing to sounds of heavenly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy when at the close of each sad sorrowing day fancy restores what vengeance snatched away then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee o cursed dear horrors of allconscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight provoking demons all restraint remove and stir within me every source of love i hear thee view thee gaze over all thy charms and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms i wake  no more i hear no more i view the phantom flies me as unkind as you i call aloud it hears not what i say i stretch my empty arms it glides away to dream once more i close my willing eyes ye soft illusions dear deceits arise alas no more methinks we wandering go through dreary wastes and weep each others woe where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps and lowbrowd rocks hang nodding over the deeps sudden you mount you beckon from the skies clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise i shriek start up the same sad prospect find and wake to all the griefs i left behind for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain thy life a long dead calm of fixed repose no pulse that riots and no blood that glows still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow or moving spirit bade the waters flow soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven and mild as opening gleams of promised heaven come abelard for what have thou to dread the torch of venus burns not for the dead nature stands checked religion disapproves even thou art cold  yet eloisa loves ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn to light the dead and warm the unfruitful urn what scenes appear wherever i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee thy image steals between my god and me thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear with every bead i drop too soft a tear when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priests tapers temples swim before my sight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drowned while altars blaze and angels tremble round while prostrate here in humble grief i lie kind virtuous drops just gathering in my eye while praying trembling in the dust i roll and dawning grace is opening on my soul come if thou dare all charming as thou art oppose thyself to heaven dispute my heart come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace those sorrows and those tears take back my fruitless penitence and prayers snatch me just mounting from the blessed abode assist the fiends and tear me from my god no fly me fly me far as pole from pole rise alps between us and whole oceans roll ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whatever was mine fair eyes and tempting looks which yet i view long loved adored ideas all adieu o grace serene oh virtue heavenly fair divine oblivion of lowthoughted care fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky and faith our early immortality enter each mild each amicable guest receive and wrap me in eternal rest see in her cell sad eloisa spread propt on some tomb a neighbor of the dead in each low wind methinks a spirit calls and more than echoes talk along the walls here as i watched the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound come sister come it said or seemed to say thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and prayed loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep even superstition loses every fear for god not man absolves our frailties here i come i come prepare your roseate bowers celestial palms and everblooming flowers thither where sinners may have rest i go where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow thou abelard the last sad office pay and smooth my passage to the realms of day see my lips tremble and my eye balls roll suck my last breath and catch my flying soul ah no  in sacred vestments may thou stand the hallowed taper trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die ah then thy oncelovd eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me see from my cheek the transient roses fly see the last sparkle languish in my eye till every motion pulse and breath be over and even my abelard be loved no more o death alleloquent you only prove what dust we dote on when it is man we love then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy that cause of all my guilt and all my joy in trance extatic may thy pangs be drowned bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round from opening skies may streaming glories shine and saints embrace thee with a love like mine may one kind grave unite each hapless name and graft my love immortal on thy fame then ages hence when all my woes are over when this rebellious heart shall beat no more if ever chance two wandering lovers brings to paracletes white walls and silver springs over the pale marble shall they join their heads and drink the falling tears each other sheds then sadly say with mutual pity moved o may we never love as these have loved from the full choir when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice amid that scene if some relenting eye glance on the stone where our cold relics lie devotions self shall steal a thought from heaven one human tear shall drop and be forgiven and sure if fate some future bard shall join in sad similitude of griefs to mine condemned whole years in absence to deplore and image charms he must behold no more such if there be who loves so long so well let him our sad our tender story tell the wellsung woes will sooth my pensive ghost he best can paint em who shall feel em most an epistle from mr philips to the earl of dorset the opening of this poem is incomparably fine the latter part is tedious and trifling copenhagen march     0  from frozen climes and endless tracts of snow from streams that northern winds forbid to flow what present shall the muse to dorset bring or how so near the pole attempt to sing the hoary winter here conceals from sight all pleasing objects that to verse invite the hills and dales and the delightful woods the flowery plains and silver streaming floods by snow disguised in bright confusion lie and with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye no gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring no birds within the desert region sing the ships unmoved the boisterous winds defy while rattling chariots over the ocean fly the vast leviathan wants room to play and spout his waters in the face of day the starving wolves along the main sea prowl and to the moon in icy valleys howl for many a shining league the level main here spreads itself into a glassy plain there solid billows of enormous size alps of green ice in wild disorder rise and yet but lately have i seen even here the winter in a lovely dress appear ere yet the clouds let fall the treasured snow or winds begun through hazy skies to blow at evening a keen eastern breeze arose and the descending rain unsullied froze soon as the silent shades of night withdrew the ruddy morn disclosed at once to view the face of nature in a rich disguise and brightened every object to my eyes for every shrub and every blade of grass and every pointed thorn seemed wrought in glass in pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show while through the ice the crimson berries glow the thicksprung reeds the watery marshes yield seem polished lances in a hostile field the stag in limpid currents with surprise sees crystal branches on his forehead rise the spreading oak the beech and towering pine glazed over in the freezing ether shine the frighted birds the rattling branches shun that wave and glitter in the distant sun when if a sudden gust of wind arise the brittle forest into atoms flies the crackling wood beneath the tempest bends and in a spangled shower the prospect ends or if a southern gale the region warm and by degrees unbind the wintry charm the traveller a miry country sees and journies sad beneath the dropping trees like some deluded peasant merlin leads through fragrant bowers and through delicious meads while here enchanted gardens to him rise and airy fabrics there attract his eyes his wondering feet the magic paths pursue and while he thinks the fair illusion true the trackless scenes disperse in fluid air and woods and wilds and thorny ways appear a tedious road the weary wretch returns and as he goes the transient vision mourns a letter from italy to the right honorable charles lord halifax in the year mdcci few poems have done more honor to english genius than this there is in it a strain of political thinking that was at that time new in our poetry had the harmony of this been equal to that of popes versification it would be incontestibly the finest poem in our language but there is a dryness in the numbers which greatly lessens the pleasure excited both by the poets judgment and imagination  while you my lord the rural shades admire and from britannias public posts retire nor longer her ungrateful sons to please for their advantage sacrifice your ease me into foreign realms my fate conveys through nations fruitful of immortal lays where the soft season and inviting clime conspire to trouble your repose with rhyme for wheresoeer i turn my ravished eyes gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise poetic fields incompass me around and still i seem to tread on classic ground for here the muse so often her harp has strung that not a mountain rears its head unsung renowned in verse each shady thicket grows and every stream in heavenly numbers flows how am i pleased to search the hills and woods for rising springs and celebrated floods to view the nar tumultuous in his course and trace the smooth clitumnus to his source to see the mincio draw his watery store through the long windings of a fruitful shore and hoary albulas infected tide over the warm bed of smoking sulphur glide fired with a thousand raptures i survey eridanus through flowery meadows stray the king of floods that rolling over the plains the towering alps of half their moisture drains and proudly swollen with a whole winters snows distributes wealth and plenty where he flows sometimes misguided by the tuneful throng i look for streams immortalized in song that lost in silence and oblivion lie dumb are their fountains and their channels dry yet run for ever by the muses skill and in the smooth description murmur still sometimes to gentle tiber i retire and the famed rivers empty shores admire that destitute of strength derives its course from thrifty urns and an unfruitful source yet sung so often in poetic lays with scorn the danube and the nile surveys so high the deathless muse exalts her theme such was the boyne a poor inglorious stream that in hibernian vales obscurely strayed and unobserved in wild meanders played till by your lines and nassaus sword renowned its rising billows through the world resound wherever the heros godlike acts can pierce or where the fame of an immortal verse oh could the muse my ravished breast inspire with warmth like yours and raise an equal fire unnumberd beauties in my verse should shine and virgils italy should yield to mine see how the golden groves around me smile that shun the coast of britains stormy isle or when transplanted and preserved with care curse the cold clime and starve in northern air here kindly warmth their mounting juice ferments to nobler tastes and more exalted scents even the rough rocks with tender myrtle bloom and trodden weeds send out a rich perfume bear me some god to baias gentle seats or cover me in umbrias green retreats where western gales eternally reside and all the seasons lavish all their pride blossoms and fruits and flowers together rise and the whole year in gay confusion lies immortal glories in my mind revive and in my soul a thousand passions strive when romes exalted beauties i descry magnificent in piles of ruin lie an amphitheatres amazing height here sills my eye with terror and delight that on its public shows unpeopled rome and held uncrowded nations in its womb here pillars rough with sculpture pierce the skies and here the proud triumphal arches rise where the old romans deathless acts displayed their base degenerate progeny upbraid whole rivers here forsake the fields below and wondering at their height through airy channels flow still to new scenes my wandering muse retires and the dumb show of breathing rocks admires where the smooth chisel all its force has shown and softened into flesh the rugged stone in solemn silence a majestic band heroes and gods and roman consuls stand stern tyrants whom their cruelties renown and emperors in parian marble frown while the bright dames to whom they humbly sud still show the charms that their proud hearts subdued fain would i raphaels godlike art rehearse and show the immortal labors in my verse where from the mingled strength of shade and light a new creation rises to my sight such heavenly figures from his pencil flow so warm with life his blended colors glow from theme to theme with secret pleasure tossed amidst the soft variety i am lost here pleasing airs my ravished soul confound with circling notes and labyrinths of sound here domes and temples rise in distant views and opening palaces invite my muse how has kind heaven adorned the happy land and scattered blessings with a wasteful hand but what avail her unexhausted stores her blooming mountains and her sunny shores with all the gifts that heaven and earth impart the smiles of nature and the charms of art while proud oppression in her valleys reigns and tyranny usurps her happy plains the poor inhabitant beholds in vain the reddning orange and the swelling grain joyless he sees the growing oils and wines and in the myrtles fragrant shade repines starves in the midst of natures bounty cursed and in the laden vineyard dies for thirst oh liberty thou goddess heavenly bright profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight eternal pleasures in thy presence reign and smiling plenty leads thy wanton train eased of her load subjection grows more light and poverty looks cheerful in thy sight thou make the gloomy face of nature gay givst beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day thee goddess thee britannias isle adores how has she often exhausted all her stores how often in fields of death thy presence sought nor thinks the mighty prize too dearly bought on foreign mountains may the sun refine the grapes soft juice and mellow it to wine with citron groves adorn a distant soil and the fat olive swell with floods of oil we envy not the warmer clime that lies in ten degrees of more indulgent skies nor at the coarseness of our heaven repine though over our heads the frozen pleiads shine it is liberty that crowns britannias isle and makes her barren rocks and her bleak mountains smile others with towering piles may please the sight and in their proud aspiring domes delight a nicer touch to the stretched canvass give or teach their animated rocks to live it is britains care to watch over europes fate and hold in balance each contending state to threaten bold presumptuous kings with war and answer her afflicted neighbors prayer the dane and swede roused up by fierce alarms bless the wise conduct of her pious arms soon as her fleets appear their terrors cease and all the northern world lies hushed in peace the ambitious gaul beholds with secret dread her thunder aimed at his aspiring head and fain her godlike sons would disunite by foreign gold or by domestic spite but strives in vain to conquer or divide whom nassaus arms defend and counsels guide fired with the name which i so often have found the distant climes and different tongues resound i bridle in my struggling muse with pain that longs to launch into a bolder strain but i have already troubled you too long nor dare attempt a more adventurous song my humble verse demands a softer theme a painted meadow or a purling stream unfit for heroes whom immortal lays and lines like virgils or like yours should praise alexanders feast or the power of music an ode in honor of st cecilias day this ode has been more applauded perhaps than it has been felt however it is a very fine one and gives its beauties rather at a third or fourth than at a first perusal  i twas at the royal feast for persia won by philips warlike son aloft in awful state the godlike hero sat on his imperial throne his valiant peers were placed around their brows with roses and with myrtles bound so should desert in arms be crowned the lovely thais by his side sat like a blooming eastern bride in flower of youth and beautys pride happy happy happy pair none but the brave none but the brave none but the brave deserve the fair chorus happy happy happy pair none but the brave none but the brave none but the brave deserves the fair ii timotheus placed on high amid the tuneful quire with flying fingers touched the lyre the trembling notes ascend the sky and heavenly joys inspire the song began from jove who left his blissful seats above such is the power of mighty love a dragons fiery form belied the god sublime on radiant spires he rode when he to fair olympia pressed and while he sought her snowy breast then round her slender waist he curled and stamped an image of himself a sovereign of the world the listening crowd admire the lofty sound a present deity they shout around a present deity the vaulted roofs rebound with ravished ears the monarch hears assumes the god affects to nod and seems to shake the spheres chorus with ravished ears the monarch hears assumes the god affects to nod and seems to shake the spheres iii the praise of bacchus then the sweet musician sung of bacchus ever fair and ever young the jolly god in triumph comes sound the trumpets beat the drums flushed with a purple grace he shows his honest face now gives the hautboys breath he comes he comes bacchus ever fair and young drinking joys did first ordain bacchus blessings are a treasure drinking is the soldiers pleasure rich the treasure sweet the pleasure sweet is pleasure after pain chorus bacchus blessings are a treasure drinking is the soldiers pleasure rich the treasure sweet the pleasure sweet is pleasure after pain iv soothed with the sound the king grew vain fought all his battles over again and thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain the master saw the madness rise his glowing cheeks his ardent eyes and while he heaven and earth defied changed his hand and checked his pride he chose a mournful muse soft pity to infuse he sung darius great and good by too severe a fate fallen fallen fallen fallen fallen from his high estate and weltring in his blood deserted at his utmost need by those his former bounty fed on the bare earth exposed he lies with not a friend to close his eyes with downcast looks the joyless victor sat revolving in his altered soul the various turns of chance below and now and then a sigh he stole and tears began to flow chorus revolving in his altered soul the various turns of chance below and now and then a sigh he stole and tears began to flow v the mighty master smiled to see that love was in the next degree twas but a kindred sound to move for pity melts the mind to love softly sweet in lydian measures soon he soothed his soul to pleasures war he sung his toil and trouble honor but an empty bubble never ending still beginning fighting still and still destroying if the world be worth thy winning think o think it worth enjoying lovely thais sits beside thee take the good the gods provide thee the many rend the skies with loud applause so love was crowned but muic won the cause the prince unable to conceal his pain gazed on the fair who caused his care and sighed and looked sighed and looked sighed and looked and sighed again at length with love and wine at once oppressed the vanquished victor sunk upon her breast chorus the prince unable to conceal his pain gazed on the fair who caused his care and sighed and looked sighed and looked sighed and looked and sighed again at length with love and wine at once oppressed the vanquished victor sunk upon her breast vi now strike the golden lyre again a louder yet and yet a louder strain break his bands of sleep asunder and rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder hark hark the horrid sound has raised up his head as awaked from the dead and amazed he stares around revenge revenge timotheus cries see the furies arise see the snakes that they rear how they hiss in their hair and the sparkles that flash from their eyes behold a ghastly band each a torch in his hand those are grecian ghosts that in battle were slain and unburyd remain inglorious on the plain give the vengeance due to the valiant crew behold how they toss their torches on high how they point to the persian abodes and glittering temples of their hostile gods the princes applaud with a furious joy and the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy thais led the way to light him to his prey and like another helen fired another troy chorus and the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy thais led the way to light him to his prey and like another helen fired another troy vii thus long ago ere heaving bellows learned to blow while organs yet were mute timotheus to his breathing flute and sounding lyre could swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire at last divine cecilia came inventress of the vocal frame the sweet enthusiast from her sacred store enlarged the former narrow bounds and added length to solemn sounds with natures motherwit and arts unknown before let old timotheus yield the prize or both divide the crown he raised a mortal to the skies she drew an angel down grand chorus at last divine cecilia came inventress of the vocal frame the sweet enthusiast from her sacred store enlarged the former narrow bounds and added length to solemn sounds with natures motherwit and arts unknown before let old timotheus yield the prize or both divide the crown he raised a mortal to the skies she drew an angel down ode for music on st cecilias day this ode has by many been thought equal to the former as it is a repetition of drydens manner it is so far inferior to him the whole hint of orpheus with many of the lines have been taken from an obscure ode upon music published in tates miscellanies  i descend ye nine descend and sing the breathing instruments inspire wake into voice each silent string and sweep the sounding lyre in a sadlypleasing strain let the warbling lute complain let the loud trumpet sound till the roofs all around the shrill echoes rebound while in more lengthened notes and slow the deep majestic solemn organs blow hark the numbers soft and clear gently steal upon the ear now louder and yet louder rise and fill with spreading sounds the skies exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes in broken air trembling the wild music floats till by degrees remote and small the strains decay and melt away in a dying dying fall ii by music minds an equal temper know nor swell too high nor sink too low if in the breast tumultuous joys arise music her soft assuasive voice applies or when the soul is pressed with cares exalts her in enlivening airs warriors she fires with animated sounds pours balm into the bleeding lovers wounds melancholy lifts her head morpheus rouzes from his bed sloth unfolds her arms and wakes listening envy drops her snakes intestine war no more our passions wage and giddy factions hear away their rage iii but when our countrys cause provokes to arms how martial music every bosom warms so when the first bold vessel dared the seas high on the stern the thracian raised his strain while argo saw her kindred trees descend from pelion to the main transported demigods stood round and men grew heroes at the sound enflamed with glorys charms each chief his sevnfold shield displayed and half unsheathed the shining blade and seas and rocks and skies rebound to arms to arms to arms iv but when through all the infernal bounds which flaming phlegeton surrounds love strong as death the poet led to the pale nations of the dead what sounds were heard what scenes appeared over all the dreary coasts dreadful gleams dismal screams fires that glow shrieks of woe sullen moans hollow groans and cries of tortured ghosts but hark he strikes the golden lyre and see the tortured ghosts respire see shady forms advance thy stone o sisyphus stands still ixion rests upon his wheel and the pale specter dance the furies sink upon their iron beds and snakes uncurld hang listening round their heads v by the streams that ever flow by the fragrant winds that blow over the elysian flowers by those happy souls who dwell in yellow meads of asphodel or amaranthine bowers by the heros armed shades glittering through the gloomy glades by the youths that died for love wandering in the myrtle grove restore restore eurydice to life oh take the husband or return the wife he sung and hell consented to hear the poets prayer stern proserpine relented and gave him back the fair thus song could prevail over death and over hell a conquest how hard and how glorious though fate had fast bound her with styx nine times round her yet music and love were victorious vi but soon too soon the lover turns his eyes again she falls again she dies she dies how will thou now the fatal sisters move no crime was thine if it is no crime to love now under hanging mountains beside the falls of fountains or where hebrus wanders rolling in meanders all alone unheard unknown he makes his moan and calls her ghost for ever ever ever lost now with furies surrounded despairing confounded he trembles he glows amidst rhodopes snows see wild as the winds over the desert he flies hark haemus resounds with the bacchanals cries  ah see he dies yet even in death eurydice he sung eurydice still trembled on his tongue eurydice the woods eurydice the floods eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung vii music the fiercest grief can charm and fates severest rage disarm music can soften pain to ease and make despair and madness please our joys below it can improve and antedate the bliss above this the divine cecilia found and to her makers praise confined the sound when the full organ joins the tuneful quire the immortal powers incline their ear borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire while solemn airs improve the sacred fire and angels lean from heaven to hear of orpheus now no more let poets tell to bright cecilia greater power is given his numbers raised a shade from hell here is lift the soul to heaven the shepherds week in six pastorals these are mr gays principal performance they were originally intended i suppose as a burlesque on those of philips but perhaps without designing it he has hit the true spirit of pastoral poetry in fact he more resembles

complexions like the withered leek while katherine pears adorn my ruddy cheek yet she alas the witless lout has won and by her gain poor sparabells undone let hares and hounds in coupling straps unite

muddy pool that stool the dread of every scolding queen yet sure a lover should not dye so mean there placed aloft i will rave and rail by fits though all the parish say i have lost my wits and thence if courage holds myself i will throw and quench my passion in the lake below ye lasses ease your burden cease to moan and by my case forewarned go mind your own the sun was set the night came on apace and falling dews bewet around the place the bat takes airy rounds on leathern wings and the hoarse owl his woeful dirges sings the prudent maiden deems it now too late and till tomorrow comes defers her fate  thursday or the spell hobnelia hobnelia seated in a dreary vale in pensive mood rehearsed her piteous tale her piteous tale the winds in sighs bemoan and pining echo answers groan for groan i rue the day a rueful day i trow the woeful day a day indeed of woe when lubberkin to town his cattle drove a maiden fine bedight he happd to love the maiden fine bedight his love retains and for the village he forsakes the plains return my lubberkin these ditties hear spells will i try and spells shall ease my care with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around when first the year i heard the cuckoo sing and call with welcome note the budding spring i straitway set a running with such haste debrah that won the smock scarce ran so fast till spent for lack of breath quite weary grown upon a rising bank i sat adown then doffd my shoe and by my troth i swear therein i spied this yellow frizled hair as like to lubberkins in curl and hue as if upon his comely pate it grew with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around at eve last midsummer no sleep i sought but to the field a bag of hemp seed brought i scattered round the seed on every side and three times in a trembling accent cried this hemp seed with my virgin hand i sow who shall my truelove be the crop shall mow i strait looked back and if my eyes speak truth with his keen scythe behind me came the youth with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around last valentine the day when birds of kind their paramours with mutual chirpings find i rearly rose just at the break of day before the sun had chased the stars away afield i went amid the morning dew to milk my kine for so should huswives do thee first i spied and the first swain we see in spite of fortune shall our truelove be see lubberkin each bird his partner take and can thou then thy sweetheart dear forsake with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around last may day fair i searched to find a snail that might my secret lovers name reveal upon a gooseberry bush a snail i found for always snails near sweetest fruit abound i seized the vermin home i quickly sped and on the hearth the milkwhite embers spread slow crawled the snail and if i right can spell in the soft ashes marked a curious l oh may this wondrous omen lucky prove for l is found in lubberkin and love with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around two hazle nuts i threw into the flame and to each nut i gave a sweethearts name this with the loudest bounce me sore amazed that in a flame of brightest color blazed as blazed the nut so may thy passion grow for twas thy nut that did so brightly glow with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around as peascods once i plucked i chanced to see one that was closely filled with three times three which when i croppd i safely home conveyed and over the door the spell in secret laid my wheel i turned and sung a ballad new while from the spindle i the fleeces drew the latch moved up when who should first come in but in his proper person  lubberkin i broke my yarn surprised the sight to see sure sign that he would break his word with me eftsoons i joined it with my wonted slight so may again his love with mine unite with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around this ladyfly i take from off the grass whose spotted back might scarlet red surpass fly ladybird north south or east or west fly where the man is found that i love best he leaves my hand see to the west he is flown to call my truelove from the faithless town with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around i pare this pippin round and round again my shepherds name to flourish on the plain i fling the unbroken paring over my head upon the grass a perfect l is read yet on my heart a fairer l is seen than what the paring marks upon the green with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around this pippin shall another trial make see from the core two kernels brown i take this on my cheek for lubberkin is worn and boobyclod on the other side is born but boobyclod soon drops upon the ground a certain token that his loves unsound while lubberkin sticks firmly to the last oh were his lips to mine but joined so fast with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around as lubberkin once slept beneath a tree i twitchd his dangling garter from his knee he wist not when the hempen string i drew now mine i quickly doff of inkle blue together fast i tie the garters twain and while i knit the knot repeat the strain three times a trueloves knot i tie secure firm be the knot firm may his love endure with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around as i was wont i trudged last market day to town with newlaid eggs preserved in hay i made my market long before twas night my purse grew heavy and my basket light strait to the pothecarys shop i went and in lovepowder all my money spent behap what will next sunday after prayers when to the alehouse lubberkin repairs these golden flies into his mug i will throw and soon the swain with fervent love shall glow with my sharp heel i three times mark the ground and turn me thrice around around around but hold our lightfoot barks and cocks his ears over yonder style see lubberkin appears he comes he comes hobnelias not bewrayed nor shall she crowned with willow die a maid he vows he swears he will give me a green gown oh dear i fall adown adown adown  friday or the dirge bumkinet grubbinol bumkinet why grubbinol do thou so wistful seem there is sorrow in thy look if right i deem it is true yon oaks with yellow tops appear and chilly blasts begin to nip the year from the tall elm a shower of leaves is born and their lost beauty riven beeches mourn yet even this season pleasance blithe affords now the squeezed press foams with our apple hoards come let us hye and quaff a cheary bowl let cider now wash sorrow from thy soul  grubbinol ah bumkinet since thou from hence were gone from these sad plains all merriment is flown should i reveal my grief twould spoil thy cheer and make thine eye overflow with many a tear  bumkinet hang sorrow let us to yonder hut repair and with trim sonnets cast away our care gillian of croydon well thy pipe can play thou singst most sweet over hills and far away of patient grissel i devise to sing and catches quaint shall make the valleys ring come grubbinol beneath this shelter come from hence we view our flocks securely roam  grubbinol yes blithesome lad a tale i mean to sing but with my woe shall distant valleys ring the tale shall make our kidlings droop their head for woe is me  our blouzelind is dead  bumkinet is blouzelinda dead farewell my glee no happiness is now reserved for me as the wood pigeon cooes without his mate so shall my doleful dirge bewail her fate of blouzelinda fair i mean to tell the peerless maid that did all maids excel henceforth the morn shall dewy sorrow shed and evening tears upon the grass be spread the rolling streams with watery grief shall flow and winds shall moan aloud  when loud they blow henceforth as often as autumn shall return the dropping trees whenever it rains shall mourn this season quite shall strip the countrys pride for twas in autumn blouzelinda died wherever i gad i blouzelind shall view woods dairy barn and mows our passion knew when i direct my eyes to yonder wood fresh rising sorrow curdles in my blood thither i have often been the damsels guide when rotten sticks our fuel have supplied there i remember how her faggots large were frequently these happy shoulders charge sometimes this crook drew hazel boughs adown and stuffed her apron wide with nuts so brown or when her feeding hogs had missed their way or wallowing mid a feast of acorns lay the untoward creatures to the stye i drove and whistled all the way  or told my love if by the dairys hatch i chance to hie i shall her goodly countenance espy for there her goodly countenance i have seen set off with kerchief starched and pinners clean sometimes like wax she rolls the butter round or with the wooden lilly prints the pound whilom i have seen her skim the clouted cream and press from spongy curds the milky stream but now alas these ears shall hear no more the whining swine surround the dairy door no more her care shall fill the hollow tray to fat the guzzling hogs with floods of whey lament ye swine in gruntings spend your grief for you like me have lost your sole relief when in the barn the sounding flail i ply where from her sieve the chaff was wont to fly the poultry there will seem around to stand waiting upon her charitable hand no succor meet the poultry now can find for they like me have lost their blouzelind whenever by yon barley mow i pass before my eyes will trip the tidy lass i pitched the sheaves oh could i do so now which she in rows pild on the growing mow there every deal my heart by love was gained there the sweet kiss my courtship has explained ah blouzelind that mow i never shall see but thy memorial will revive in me lament ye fields and rueful symptoms show henceforth let not the smelling primrose grow let weeds instead of butterflowers appear and meads instead of daisies hemlock bear for cowslips sweet let dandelion spread for blouzelinda blithsome maid is dead lament ye swains and over her grave bemoan and spell ye right this verse upon her stone here blouzelinda lies  alas alas weep shepherds  and remember flesh is grass  grubbinol albeit thy songs are sweeter to mine ear than to the thirsty cattle rivers clear or winter porridge to the laboring youth or buns and sugar to the damsels tooth yet blouzelindas name shall tune my lay of her i will sing for ever and for aye when blouzelind expired the weathers bell before the drooping flock tolled forth her knell the solemn deathwatch clickd the hour she died and chilling crickets in the chimney cried the boding raven on her cottage sat and with hoarse croaking warned us of her fate the lambkin which her wonted tendance bred dropped on the plains that fatal instant dead swarmed on a rotten stick the bees i spied which erst i saw when goody dobson died how shall i void of tears her death relate while on her darlings bed her mother sat these words the dying blouzelinda spoke and of the dead let none the will revoke mother quoth she let not the poultry need and give the goose wherewith to raise her breed be these my sisters care  and every morn amid the ducklings let her scatter corn the sickly calf that is housed be sure to tend feed him with milk and from bleak colds defend yet ere i die  see mother yonder shelf there secretly i have hid my worldly pelf twenty good shillings in a rag i laid be ten the parsons for my sermon paid the rest is yours  my spinningwheel and rake let susan keep for her dear sisters sake my new straw hat that is trimly lined with green let peggy wear for she is a damsel clean my leathern bottle long in harvests tried be grubbinols  this silver ring beside three silver pennies and a ninepence bent a token kind to bumkinet is sent thus spoke the maiden while her mother cried and peaceful like the harmless lamb she died to show their love the neighbors far and near followed with wistful look the damsels bier spriggd rosemary the lads and lasses bore while dismally the parson walked before upon her grave the rosemary they threw the daisie butterflower and endive blue after the good man warned us from his text that none could tell whose turn would be the next he said that heaven would take her soul no doubt and spoke the hourglass in her praise  quite out to her sweet memory flowery garlands strung over her now empty seat aloft were hung with wicker rods we fenced her tomb around to ward from man and beast the hallowed ground lest her new grave the parsons cattle raze for both his horse and cow the churchyard graze now we trudged homeward to her mothers farm to drink new cider mulld with ginger warm for gaffer treadwell told us by the by excessive sorrow is exceeding dry while bulls bear horns upon their curled brow or lasses with soft stroakings milk the cow while paddling ducks the standing lake desire or battning hogs roll in the sinking mire while moles the crumbled earth in hillocks raise so long shall swains tell blouzelindas praise thus waild the louts in melancholy strain till bonny susan sped across the plain they seized the lass in apron clean arrayed and to the alehouse forced the willing maid in ale and kisses they forget their cares and susan blouzelindas loss repairs  saturday or the flights bowzybeus sublimer strains o rustic muse prepare forget awhile the barn and dairys care thy homely voice to loftier numbers raise the drunkards flights require sonorous lays with bowzybeus songs exalt thy verse while rocks and woods the various notes rehearse twas in the season when the reapers toil of the ripe harvest gan to rid the soil wide through the field was seen a goodly rout clean damsels bound the gathered sheafs about the lads with sharpened hook and sweating brow cut down the labors of the winter plow to the near hedge young susan steps aside she feigned her coat or garter was untied whatever she did she stooped adown unseen and merry reapers what they list will ween soon she rose up and cried with voice so shrill that echo answered from the distant hill the youths and damsels ran to susans aid who thought some adder had the lass dismayed when fast asleep they bowzybeus spied his hat and oaken staff lay close beside that bowzybeus who could sweetly sing or with the rosind bow torment the string that bowzybeus who with fingers speed could call soft warblings from the breathing reed that bowzybeus who with jocund tongue ballads and roundelays and catches sung they loudly laugh to see the damsels fright and in disport surround the drunken wight ah bowzybee why did thou stay so long the mugs were large the drink was wondrous strong thou should have left the fair before twas night but thou satst toping till the morning light cicly brisk maid steps forth before the rout and kissed with smacking lip the snoring lout for custom says whoever this venture proves for such a kiss demands a pair of gloves by her example dorcas bolder grows and plays a tickling straw within his nose he rubs his nostril and in wonted joke the sneering swains with stammring speech bespoke to you my lads i will sing my carrols over as for the maids  i have something else in store no sooner gan he raise his tuneful song but lads and lasses round about him throng not balladsinger placed above the crowd sings with a note so shrilling sweet and loud nor parishclerk who calls the psalm so clear like bowzybeus sooths the attentive ear of natures laws his carols first begun why the grave owl can never face the sun for owls as swains observe detest the light and only sing and seek their prey by night how turnips hide their swelling heads below and how the closing colworts upwards grow how willawisp misleads nightfaring clowns over hills and sinking bogs and pathless downs of stars he told that shoot with shining trail and of the glowworms light that gilds his tail he sung where woodcocks in the summer feed and in what climates they renew their breed some think to northern coasts their flight they tend or to the moon in midnight hours ascend where swallows in the winters season keep and how the drowsy bat and dormouse sleep how nature does the puppys eyelid close till the bright sun has nine times set and rose for huntsmen by their long experience find that puppies still nine rolling suns are blind now he goes on and sings of fairs and shows for still new fairs before his eyes arose how pedlars stalls with glittering toys are laid the various fairings of the countrymaid long silken laces hang upon the twine and rows of pins and amber bracelets shine how the tight lass knives combs and scissars spies and looks on thimbles with desiring eyes of lottries next with tuneful note he told where silver spoons are won and rings of gold the lads and lasses trudge the street along and all the fair is crowded in his song the mountebank now treads the stage and sells his pills his balsams and his aguespells now over and over the nimble tumbler springs and on the rope the venurous maiden swings jack pudding in his partycolored jacket tosses the glove and jokes at every packet of rareeshows he sung and punchs feats of pockets picked in crowds and various cheats then sad he sung the children in the wood ah barbarous uncle stained with infant blood how blackberries they plucked in deserts wild and fearless at the glittering fauchion smiled their little corpse the robinredbreasts found and strewn with pious bill the leaves around ah gentle birds if this verse lasts so long your names shall live for ever in my song for buxom joan he sung the doubtful strife how the sly sailor made the maid a wife to louder strains he raised his voice to tell what woeful wars in chevychace befell when piercy drove the deer with hound and horn wars to be wept by children yet unborn ah withrington more years thy life had crowned if thou had never heard the horn or hound yet shall the squire who fought on bloody stumps by future bards be waild in doleful dumps all in the land of essex next he chaunts how to sleek mares starch quakers turn gallants how the grave brother stood on bank so green happy for him if mares had never been then he was seized with a religious qualm and on a sudden sung the hundredth psalm he sung of taffey welsh and sawney scot lillybullero and the irish trot why should i tell of bateman or of shore or wantleys dragon slain by valiant moore the bower of rosamond or robin hood and how the grass now grows where troy town stood his carrols ceased the listening maids and swains seem still to hear some soft imperfect strains sudden he rose and as he reels along swears kisses sweet should well reward his song the damsels laughing fly the giddy clown again upon a wheatsheaf drops adown the power that guards the drunk his sleep attends till ruddy like his face the sun descends  mac flecknoe the severity of this satire and the excellence of its versification give it a distinguished rank in this species of composition at present an ordinary reader would scarce suppose that shadwell who is here meant by mac flecknoe was worth being chastised and that drydens descending to such game was like an eagles stooping to catch flies the truth however is shadwell at one time held divided reputation with this great poet every age produces its fashionable dunces who by following the transient topic or humor of the day supply talkative ignorance with materials for conversation  all human things are subject to decay and when fate summons monarchs must obey this flecknoe found who like augustus young was called to empire and had governed long in prose and verse was owned without dispute through all the realms of nonsense absolute this aged prince now flourishing in peace and blessed with issue of a large increase worn out with business did at length debate to settle the succession of the state and pondring which of all his sons was fit to reign and wage immortal war with wit cried it is resolved for nature pleads that he should only rule who most resembles me sh  alone my perfect image bears mature in dullness from his tender years sh  alone of all my sons was he who stands confirmed in full stupidity the rest to some faint meaning make pretense but sh  never deviates into sense some beams of wit on other souls may fall strike through and make a lucid interval but sh  s genuine night admits no ray his rising fogs prevail upon the day besides his goodly fabric fills the eye and seems designed for thoughtless majesty thoughtless as monarch oaks that shade the plain and spread in solemn state supinely reign heywood and shirley were but types of thee thou last great prophet of tautology even i a dunce of more renown than they was sent before but to prepare thy way and coarsely clad in norwich drugget came to teach the nations in thy greater name my warbling lute the lute i whilom strung when to king john of portugal i sung was but the prelude to that glorious day when thou on silver thames did cut thy way with welltimd oars before the royal barge swelled with the pride of thy celestial charge and big with hymn commander of an host the like was never in epsom blankets tossed methinks i see the new arion sail the lute still trembling underneath thy nail at thy wellsharpend thumb from shore to shore the trebles squeak for fear the bases roar echoes from pissingalley sh  call and sh  they resound from astonhall about thy boat the little fishes throng as at the morning toast that floats along sometimes as prince of thy harmonious band thou wieldst thy papers in thy threshing hand st andres feet never kept more equal time not even the feet of thy own psyches rhyme though they in number as in sense excel so just so like tautology they fell that pale with envy singleton forswore the lute and sword which he in triumph bore and vowed he never would act villerius more here stopped the good old sire and wept for joy in silent raptures of the hopeful boy all arguments but most his plays persuade that for anointed dullness he was made close to the walls which fair augusta bind the fair augusta much to fears inclined an ancient fabric raised to inform the sight there stood of yore and barbican it hight a watchtowr once but now so fate ordains of all the pile an empty name remains from its old ruins brothelhouses rise scenes of lewd loves and of polluted joys where their vast courts the motherstrumpets keep and undisturbed by watch in silence sleep near these a nursery erects its head where queens are formed and future heroes bred where unfledged actors learn to laugh and cry where infant punks their tender voices try and little maximins the gods defy great fletcher never treads in buskins here nor greater johnson dares in socks appear but gentle simkin just reception finds amidst this monument of vanished minds pure clinches the suburbian muse affords and panton waging harmless war with words here flecknoe as a place to fame well known ambitiously designed his sh  s throne for ancient decker prophesied long since that in this pile should reign a mighty prince born for a scourge of wit and flail of sense to whom true dullness should some psyches owe but worlds of misers from his pen should flow humourists and hypocrites it should produce whole raymond families and tribes of bruce now empress fame had published the renown of sh  s coronation through the town roused by report of fame the nations meet from near bunhill and distant watlingstreet no persian carpets spread the imperial way but scattered limbs of mangled poets lay from dusty shops neglected authors come martyrs of pies and relics of the bum much heywood shirley ogleby there lay but loads of sh  almost choked the way bilkd stationers for yeomen stood prepared and h  n was captain of the guard the hoary prince in majesty appeared high on a throne of his own labors reared at his right hand our young ascanius sat romes other hope and pillar of the state his brows thick fogs instead of glories grace and lambent dullness played around his face as hannibal did to the altars come swore by his sire a mortal foe to rome so sh  swore nor should his vow be vain that he till death true dullness would maintain and in his fathers right and realms defense never to have peace with wit nor truce with sense the king himself the sacred unction made as king by office and as priest by trade in his sinister hand instead of ball he placed a mighty mug of potent ale loves kingdom to his right he did convey at once his scepter and his rule of sway whose righteous lore the prince had practiced young and from whose loins recorded psyche sprung his temples last with poppies were overspread that nodding seemed to consecrate his head just at the point of time if fame not lie on his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly so romulus it is sung by tybers brook presage of sway from twice six vultures took the admiring throng loud acclamations make and omens of his future empire take the sire then shook the honors of his head and from his brows damps of oblivion shed full on the filial dullness long he stood repelling from his breast the raging god at length burst out in this prophetic mood heavens bless my son from ireland let him reign to far barbados on the western main of his dominion may no end be known and greater than his fathers be his throne beyond loves kingdom let him stretch his pen  he paused and all the people cried amen

writers wit yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defense and justify their authors want of sense let em be all by thy own model made of dullness and desire no foreign aid that they to future ages may be known not copies drawn but issue of thy own nay let thy men of wit too be the same all full of thee and differing but in name but let no alien s  dl  y interpose to lard with wit thy hungry epsom prose and when false flowers of rhetoric thou would cull trust nature do not labor to be dull but write thy best and top and in each line sir formals oratory will be thine sir formal though unsought attends thy quill and does thy northern dedications fill nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame by arrogating johnsons hostile name let father flecknoe fire thy mind with praise and uncle ogleby thy envy raise thou art my blood where johnson has no part what share have we in nature or in art where did his wit on learning fix a brand and rail at arts he did not understand where

scenes purloin as thou whole ethridge do transfuse to thine but so transfused as oil and waters flow his always floats above thine sinks below this is thy province this thy wondrous way new humors to invent for each new play this is that boasted bias of thy mind by which one way to dullness it is inclined which makes thy writings lean on one side still and in all changes that way bends thy will nor let thy mountainbelly make pretense of likeness thines a tympany of sense a tun of man in thy large bulk is writ but sure you are but a kilderkin of wit like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep thy tragic muse gives smiles thy comic sleep with whatever gall thou setst thyself to write thy inoffensive satires never bite in thy felonious heart though venom lies it does but touch thy irish pen and dies thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame in keen iambics but mild anagram leave writing plays and choose for thy command some peaceful province in acrostic land there thou may wings display and altars raise and torture one poor word ten thousand ways or if thou would thy different talents suit set thy own songs and sing them to thy lute he said but his last words were scarcely heard for bruce and longvil had a trap prepared and down they sent the yet declaiming bard sinking he left his drugget robe behind borne upwards by a subterranean wind the mantle sell to the young prophets part with double portion of his fathers art on poetry a rhapsody here follows one of the best versified poems in our language and the most masterly production of its author the severity with which walpole is here treated was in consequence of that ministers having refused to provide for swift in england when applied to for that purpose in the year      if i remember right the severity of a poet however gave walpole very little uneasiness a man whose schemes like this ministers seldom extended beyond the exigency of the year but little regarded the contempt of posterity  all human race would fain be wits and millions miss for one that hits youngs universal passion pride was never known to spread so wide say britain could you ever boast three poets in an age at most our chilling climate hardly bears a sprig of bays in fifty years while every fool his claim alleges as if it grew in common hedges what reason can there be assigned for this perverseness in the mind brutes find out where their talents lie a bear will not attempt to fly a foundered horse will often debate before he tries a fivebarrd gate a dog by instinct turns aside who sees the ditch too deep and wide but man we find the only creature who led by folly combats nature who when she loudly cries forbear with obstinacy fixes there and where his genius least inclines absurdly bends his whole designs not empire to the rising sun by valor conduct fortune won not highest wisdom in debates for framing laws to govern states not skill in sciences profound so large to grasp the circle round such heavenly influence require as how to strike the muses lyre not beggars brat on bulk begot not bastard of a pedlar scot not boy brought up to cleaning shoes the spawn of bridewell or the stews not infants dropped the spurious pledges of gypsies littring under hedges are so disqualifyd by fate to rise in church or law or state as he whom phoebus in his ire has blasted with poetic fire what hope of custom in the fair while not a soul demands your ware where you have nothing to produce for private life or public use court city country want you not you cannot bribe betray or plot for poets law makes no provision the wealthy have you in derision of state affairs you cannot smatter are awkward when you try to flatter your portion taking britain round was just one annual hundred pound now not so much as in remainder since cibber brought in an attainder for ever fixed by right divine a monarchs right on grubstreet line poor starvling bard how small thy gains how unproportiond to thy pains and here a simile comes pat in though chickens take a month to fatten the guests in less than half an hour will more than half a score devour so after toiling twenty days to earn a stock of pence and praise thy labors grown the critics prey are swallowed over a dish of tea gone to be never heard of more gone where the chickens went before how shall a new attempter learn of different spirits to discern and how distinguish which is which the poets vein or scribbling itch then hear an old experienced sinner instructing thus a young beginner consult yourself and if you find a powerful impulse urge your mind impartial judge within your breast what subject you can manage best whether your genius most inclines to satyr praise or humrous lines to elegies in mournful tone or prologue sent from hand unknown then rising with auroras light the muse invoked sit down to write blot out correct insert refine enlarge diminish interline be mindful when invention fails to scratch your head and bite your nails your poem finished next your care is needful to transcribe it fair in modern wit all printed trash is set off with numerous breaks  and dashes  to statesmen would you give a wipe you print it in italic type when letters are in vulgar shapes it is ten to one the wit escapes but when in capitals expressed the dullest reader smokes the jest or else perhaps he may invent a better than the poet meant as learned commentators view in homer more than homer knew your poem in its modish dress correctly fitted for the press convey by pennypost to lintot but let no friend alive look into it if lintot thinks twill quit the cost you need not fear your labor lost and how agreeably surpised are you to see it advertised the hawker shows you one in print as fresh as farthings from the mint the product of your toil and sweating a bastard of your own begetting be sure at wills the following day lie snug and hear what critics say and if you find the general vogue pronounces you a stupid rogue damns all your thoughts as low and little sit still and swallow down your spittle be silent as a politician for talking may beget suspicion or praise the judgment of the town and help yourself to run it down give up your fond paternal pride nor argue on the weaker side for poems read without a name we justly praise or justly blame and critics have no partial views except they know whom they abuse and since you never provoked their spite depend upon it their judgements right but if you blab you are undone consider what a risk you run you lose your credit all at once the town will mark you for a dunce the vilest doggrel grubstreet sends will pass for yours with foes and friends and you must bear the whole disgrace till some fresh blockhead takes your place your secret kept your poem sunk and sent in quires to line a trunk if still you be disposed to rhyme go try your hand a second time again you fail yet safes the word take courage and attempt a third but first with care employ your thoughts where critics marked your former faults the trivial turns the borrowed wit the similies that nothing fit the cant which every fool repeats town jests and coffeehouse conceits descriptions tedious flat and dry and introduced the lord knows why or where we find your fury set against the harmless alphabet on as and bs your malice vent while readers wonder whom you meant a public or a private robber a statesman or a south sea jobber a prelate who no god believes a parliament or den of thieves a pickpurse at the bar or bench a duchess or a suburb wench or often when epithets you link in gaping lines to fill a chink like steppingstones to save a stride in streets where kennels are too wide or like a heelpiece to support a cripple with one foot too short or like a bridge that joins a marish to moorlands of a different parish so have i seen illcoupled hounds drag different ways in miry grounds so geographers in afric maps with savage pictures fill their gaps and over unhabitable downs place elephants for want of towns but though you miss your third essay you need not throw your pen away lay now aside all thoughts of fame to spring more profitable game from party merit seek support the vilest verse thrives best at court a pamphlet in sir bobs defense will never fail to bring in pence nor be concerned about the sale he pays his workmen on the nail a prince the moment he is crowned inherits every virtue round as emblems of the sovereign power like other bawbles in the tower is generous valiant just and wise and so continues till he dies his humble senate this professes in all their speeches votes addresses but once you fix him in a tomb his virtues fade his vices bloom and each perfection wrong imputed is fully at his death confuted the loads of poems in his praise ascending make one funeralblaze as soon as you can hear his knell this god on earth turns d  l in hell and lo his ministers of state transformed to imps his levee wait where in the scenes of endless woe they ply their former arts below and as they sail in charons boat contrive to bribe the judges vote to cerberus they give a fop his tripplebarking mouth to stop or in the ivory gate of dreams project excise and south sea schemes or hire their partypamphleteers to set elysium by the ears then poet if you mean to thrive employ your muse on kings alive with prudence gathering up a cluster of all the virtues you can muster which formed into a garland sweet lay humbly at your monarchs feet who as the odours reach his throne will smile and think em all his own for law and gospel both determine all virtues lodge in royal ermine i mean the oracles of both who shall depose it upon oath your garland in the following reign change but the names will do again but if you think this trade too base which seldom is the dunces case put on the critics brow and sit at wills the puny judge of wit a nod a shrug a scornful smile with caution used may serve awhile proceed no further in your part before you learn the terms of art for you can never be too far gone in all our modern critics jargon then talk with more authentic face of unities in time and place get scraps of horace from your friends and have them at your fingers ends learn aristotles rules by rote and at all hazards boldly quote judicious rymer often review wise dennis and profound bossu read all the prefaces of dryden for these our critics much confide in though merely writ at first for filling to raise the volumes price a shilling a forward critic often dupes us with sham quotations peri hupsous and if we have not read longinus will magisterially outshine us then lest with greek he overrun ye procure the book for love or money translated from boileaus translation and quote quotation on quotation at wills you hear a poem read where battus from the tablehead reclining on his elbowchair gives judgment with decisive air to whom the tribe of circling wits as to an oracle submits he gives directions to the town to cry it up or run it down like courtiers when they send a note instructing members how to vote he sets the stamp of bad and good though not a word be understood your lesson learnt you will be secure

ideas of your mind the poet after having touched upon the proper objects of magnificence and expense in the private works of great men comes to those great and public works which become a prince this poem was published at the time when some of the new churches built by the act of queen anne were ready to fall being founded on boggy land and others vilely executed through fraudulent cabals between undertakers officers etc when dagenhambreach had done very great mischiefs when the proposal of building a bridge at westminster had been petitioned against and rejected when many of the highways throughout england were hardly passable and most of those which were repaired by turnpikes made jobbs for private lucre and infamously executed even to the entrances of london itself at this time there had been an uninterrupted peace in europe for above twenty years  proud to accomplish what such hands designed bid harbors open public ways extend bid temples worthier of the god ascend bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain the mole projected break the roaring main back to his bounds their subject sea command and roll obedient rivers through the land these honors peace to happy britain brings these are imperial works and worthy kings from the dispensary canto vi this sixth canto of the dispensary by dr garth has more merit than the whole preceding part of the poem and as i am told in the first edition of this work it is more correct than as here exhibited but that edition i have not been able to find the praises bestowed on this poem are more than have been given to any other but our approbation at present is cooler for it owed part of its fame to party  and now the delegate prepares to go and view the wonders of the realms below thrice did the goddess with her sacred wand the pavement strike and strait at her command the willing surface opens and descries a deep descent that leads to nether skies hygeia to the silent region tends and with his heavenly guide the charge descends thus numa when to hallowed caves retired was by aegeria guarded and inspired within the chambers of the globe they spy the beds where sleeping vegetables lie till the glad summons of a genial ray unbinds the glebe and calls them out to day hence pancies trick themselves in various hue and hence junquils derive their fragrant dew hence the carnation and the bashful rose their virgin blushes to the morn disclose hence the chaste lilly rises to the light unveils her snowy breasts and charms the sight hence arbours are with twining greens arrayed toblige complaining lovers with their shade and hence on daphnes laureled forehead grow immortal wreaths for phoebus and nassau the insects here their lingering trance survive benumbed they seem and doubtful if alive from winters fury hither they repair and stay for milder skies and softer air down to these cells obscener reptiles creep where hateful nutes and painted lizzards sleep where shivering snakes the summer solstice wait unfurl their painted folds and slide in state here their new form the numbed erucae hide their numerous feet in slender bandage tied soon as the kindling year begins to rise this upstart race their native clod despise and proud of painted wings attempt the skies now those profounder regions they explore where metals ripen in vast cakes of oar here sullen to the sight at large is spread the dull unwieldy mass of lumpish lead there glimmering in their dawning beds are seen the aspiring seeds of sprightly tin the copper sparkles next in ruddy streaks and in the gloom betrays its glowing cheeks the silver then with bright and burnished grace youth and a blooming luster in its face to the arms of those more yielding metals flies and in the folds of their embraces lies so close they cling so stubbornly retire their loves more vilent than the chymists fire near these the delegate with wonder spies where floods of living silver serpentize where richest metals their bright looks put on and golden streams through amber channels run where lights gay god descends to ripen gems and lend a luster brighter than his beams here he observes the subterranean cells where wanton nature sports in idle shells some helicoeids some conical appear these mitres emulate those turbans are here marcasites in various figure wait to ripen to a true metallic state till drops that from impending rocks descend their substance petrify and progress end nigh livid seas of kindled sulphur flow and whilst enraged their fiery surges glow convulsions in the laboring mountains rise and hurl their melted vitals to the skies he views with horror next the noisy cave where with hoarse dinns imprisoned tempests rave where clamorous hurricanes attempt their flight or whirling in tumultuous eddies fight the warring winds unmoved hygeia heard braved their loud jars but much for celsus feared andromeda so whilst her hero fought shook for his danger but her own forgot and now the goddess with her charge descends where scarce one cheerful glimpse their steps befriends here his forsaken seat old chaos keeps and undisturbed by form in silence sleeps a grisly wight and hideous to the eye an awkward lump of shapeless anarchy with sordid age his features are defaced his lands unpeopled and his countries waste to these dark realms much learned lumber creeps there copious m  safe in silence sleeps where mushroom libels in oblivion lie and soon as born like other monsters die upon a couch of jett in these abodes dull night his melancholy consort nods no ways and means their cabinet employ but their dark hours they waste in barren joy nigh this recess with terror they survey where death maintains his dread tyrannic sway in the close covert of a cypress grove where goblins frisk and airy specter rove yawns a dark cave with awful horror wide and there the monarchs triumphs are descried confused and wildly huddled to the eye the beggars pouch and princes purple lie dim lamps with sickly rays scarce seem to glow sighs heave in mournful moans and tears overflow restless anxiety forlorn despair and all the faded family of care old mouldering urns racks daggers and distress make up the frightful horror of the place within its dreadful jaws those furies wait which execute the harsh decrees of fate febris is first the hag relentless hears the virgins sighs and sees the infants tears in her parched eye balls fiery meteors reign and restless ferments revel in each vein then hydrops next appears amongst the throng bloated and big she slowly sails along but like a miser in excess she is poor and pines for thirst amidst her watery store now loathsome lepra that offensive spright with foul eruptions stained offends the sight still deaf to beautys soft persuading power nor can bright hebes charms her bloom secure whilst meager pthisis gives a silent blow her strokes are sure but her advances slow no loud alarms or fierce assaults are shown she starves the fortress first then takes the town behind stood crowds of much inferior name too numerous to repeat too foul to name the vassals of their monarchs tyranny who at his nod on fatal errands fly now celsus with his glorious guide invades the silent region of the fleeting shades where rocks and ruful deserts are descried and sullen styx rolls down his lazy tide then shows the ferryman the plant he bore and claims his passage to the further shore to whom the stygian pilot smiling said you need no passport to demand our aid physicians never linger on this strand old charons present still at their command our awful monarch and his consort owe to them the peopling of their realms below then in his swarthy hand he grasped the oar received his guests aboard and should from shore now as the goddess and her charge prepare to breathe the sweets of soft elysian air upon the left they spy a pensive shade who on his bended arm had raised his head pale grief sat heavy on his mournful look to whom not unconcerned thus celsus spoke tell me thou much afflicted shade why sighs burst from your breast and torrents from your eyes and who those mangled manes are which show a sullen satisfaction at your woe since said the ghost with pity you will attend know i am guaicum once your firmest friend and on this barren beach in discontent am doomed to stay till the angry powers relent those specter seamd with scars that threaten there the victims of my late ill conduct are they vex with endless clamours my repose this wants his palate that demands his nose and here they execute stern plutos will and ply me every moment with a pill then celsus thus o muchlamented state how rigid is the sentence you relate methinks i recollect your former air but ah how much youre changed from what you were insipid as your late ptisans you lie that once were sprightlier far than mercury at the sad tale you tell the poppies weep and mourn their vegetable souls asleep the unctuous larix and the healing pine lament your fate in tears of turpentine but still the offspring of your brain shall prove the grocers care and brave the rage of jove when bonfires blaze your vagrant works shall rise in rockets till they reach the wondering skies if mortals ever the stygian powers could bend entreaties to their awful seats i would send but since no human arts the fates dissuade direct me how to find blessed herveys shade in vain the unhappy ghost still urged his stay then rising from the ground he showed the way nigh the dull shore a shapeless mountain stood that with a dreadful frown surveyed the flood its fearful brow no lively greens put on no frisking goats bound over the ridgy stone to gain the summit the bright goddess tried and celsus followed by degrees his guide the ascent thus conquered now they tower on high and taste the indulgence of a milder sky loose breezes on their airy pinions play soft infant blossoms their chaste odours pay and roses blush their fragrant lives away cool streams through flowery meadows gently glide and as they pass their painted banks they chide these blissful plains no blights nor mildews fear the flowers never fade and shrubs are myrtles here the morn awakes the tulip from her bed ever noon in painted pride she decks her head robbed in rich dye she triumphs on the green and every flower does homage to their queen so when bright venus rises from the flood around in throngs the wondering nereids crowd the tritons gaze and tune each vocal shell and every grace unsung the waves conceal the delegate observes with wondering eyes ambrosial dews descend and incense rise then hastens onward to the pensive grove the silent mansion of disastrous love here jealousy with jaundice looks appears and broken slumbers and fantastic fears the widowed turtle hangs her moulting wings and to the woods in mournful murmurs sings no winds but sighs there are no floods but tears each conscious tree a tragic signal bears their wounded bark records some broken vow and willow garlands hang on every bough olivia here in solitude he found her downcast eyes fixed on the silent ground her dress neglected and unbound her hair she seemed the dying image of despair how lately did this celebrated thing blaze in the box and sparkle in the ring till the green sickness and loves force betrayed to deaths remorseless arms the unhappy maid all over confused the guilty lover stood the light forsook his eyes his cheeks the blood an icy horror shivered in his look as to the coldcomplexiond nymph he spoke tell me dear shade from whence such anxious care your looks disordered and your bosom bare why thus you languish like a drooping flower crushed by the weight of some relentless shower your languid looks your late illconduct tell o that instead of trash you would taken steel stabbed with the unkind reproach the conscious maid thus to her late insulting lover said when ladies listen not to loose desire you style our modesty our want of fire smile or forbid encourage or reprove you still find reasons to believe we love vainly you think a liking we betray and never mean the peevish things we say few are the fair ones of rufillas make unasked she grants uninjurd she will forsake but several caelias several ages boast that like where reason recommends the most where heavenly truth and tenderness conspire chaste passion may persuade us to desire your sex he cried as custom bids behaves in forms the tyrant ties such haughty slaves to do nice conduct right you nature wrong impulses are but weak where reasons strong some want the courage but how few the flame they like the thing that startle at the name the lonely phoenix though professed a nun warms into love and kindles at the sun those tales of spicy urns and fragrant fires are but the emblems of her scorched desires then as he strove to clasp the fleeting fair his empty arms confessed the impassive air from his embrace thunbodyd spectre flies and as she moved she chid him with her eyes they hasten now to that delightful plain where the glad manes of the blessed remain where hervey gathers simples to bestow immortal youth on heroes shades below soon as the bright hygeia was in view the venerable sage her presence knew thus he  hail blooming goddess thou propitious power whose blessings mortals more than life implore with so much luster your bright looks endear that cottages are courts where those appear mankind as you vouchsafe to smile or frown finds ease in chains or anguish in a crown with just resentments and contempt you see the foul dissentions of the faculty how your sad sickening art now hangs her head and once a science is become a trade her sons never rifle her mysterious store but study nature less and lucre more not so when rome to the epidaurian raised a temple where devoted incense blazed often father tyber views the lofty fire as the learned son is worshipped like the fire the sage with romulus like honors claim the gift of life and laws were then the same i showed of old how vital currents glide and the meanders of their refluent tide then willis why spontaneous actions here and whence involuntary motions there and how the spirits by mechanic laws in wild careers tumultuous riots cause nor would our wharton bates and glisson lie in the abyss of blind obscurity but now such wondrous searches are forborne and paeans art is by divisions torn then let your charge attend and i will explain how her lost health your science may regain haste and the matchless atticus address from heaven and great nassau he has the mace the oppressed to his asylum still repair arts he supports and learning is his care he softens the harsh rigor of the laws blunts their keen edge and grinds their harpy claws and graciously he casts a pitying eye on the sad state of virtuous poverty when ever he speaks heavens how the listening throng dwells on the melting music of his tongue his arguments are emblems of his mien mild but not faint and forcing though serene and when the power of eloquence he would try here lightning strikes you there soft breezes sigh to him you must your sickly state refer your charter claims him as your visiter your wounds he will close and sovreignly restore your science to the height it had before then nassaus health shall be your glorious aim his life should be as lasting as his fame some princes claims from devastations spring he condescends in pity to be king and when amidst his olives placed he stands and governs more by candor than commands even then not less a hero he appears than when a laurel diadem he wears would phoebus or his g  le but inspire their sacred vehmence of poetic sire to celebrate in song that godlike power which did the laboring universe restore fair albions cliffs would echo to the strain and praise the arm that conquered to regain the earths repose and empire over the main still may the immortal man his cares repeat to make his blessings endless as they are great whilst malice and ingratitude confess they have strove for ruin long without success when late joves eagle from the pyle shall rise to bear the victor to the boundless skies awhile the god puts off paternal care neglects the earth to give the heavens a star near thee alcides shall the hero shine his rays resembling as his labors thine had some famed patriot of the latin blood like julius great and like octavius good but thus preserved the latin liberties aspiring columns soon had reached the skies loud ios the proud capitol had shook and all the statues of the gods had spoke no more the sage his raptures could pursue he paused and celsus with his guide withdrew eclogue i selim or the shepherds moral scene a valley near bagdat time the morning the following eclogues written by mr collins are very pretty the images it must be owned are not very local for the pastoral subject could not well admit of it the description of asiatic magnificence and manners is a subject as yet unattempted amongst us and i believe capable of furnishing a great variety of poetical imagery  ye persian maids attend your poets lays and hear how shepherds pass their golden days not all are blessed whom fortunes hand sustains with wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains well may your hearts believe the truths i tell it is virtue makes the bliss wherever we dwell thus selim sung by sacred truth inspired nor praise but such as truth bestowed desired wise in himself his meaning songs conveyed informing morals to the shepherd maid or taught the swains that surest bliss to find what groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind when sweet and blushing like a virgin bride the radiant morn resumed her orient pride when wanton gales along the valleys play breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away by tigris wandering waves he sat and sung this useful lesson for the fair and young ye persian dames he said to you belong well may they please the morals of my song no fairer maids i trust than you are found graced with soft arts the peopled world around the morn that lights you to your loves supplies each gentler ray delicious to your eyes for you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow and yours the love that kings delight to know yet think not these allbeauteous as they are the best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair who trust alone in beautys feeble ray boast but the worth bassoras pearls display drawn from the deep we own their surface bright but dark within they drink no lustrous light such are the maids and such the charms they boast by sense unaided or to virtue lost selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain that love shall blind whence once he fires the swain or hope a lover by your faults to win as spots on ermin beautify the skin who seeks secure to rule be first her care each softer virtue that adorns the fair each tender passion man delights to find the loved perfections of a female mind blessed were the days when wisdom held her reign and shepherds sought her on the silent plain with truth she wedded in the secret grove immortal truth and daughters blessed their love o haste fair maids ye virtues come away sweet seace and plenty lead you on your way the balmy shrub for you shall love our shore by ind excelled or araby no more lost to our fields for so the fates ordain the dear deserters shall return again come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear to lead the train sweet modesty appear here make thy court amidst our rural scene and shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen with thee be chastity of all afraid distrusting all a wise suspicious maid but man the most  not more the mountain do holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew a silken veil conceals her from the view no wild desires amidst thy train be known but faith whose heart is fixed on one alone desponding meekness with her downcast eyes and friendly pity full of tender sighs and love the last by these your hearts approve these are the virtues that must lead to love thus sung the swain and ancient legends say the maids of bagdat verified the lay dear to the plains the virtues came along the shepherds loved and selim blessed his song eclogue ii hassan or the cameldriver scene the desert time midday in silent horror over the boundless waste the driver hassan with his camels past one cruise of water on his back he bore and his light scrip contained a scanty store a fan of painted feathers in his hand to guard his shaded face from scorching sand the sultry sun had gained the middle sky and not a tree and not an herb was nigh the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view with desperate sorrow wild the affrighted man thrice sighed thrice struck his breast and thus began sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way ah little thought i of the blasting wind the thirst or pinching hunger that i find bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage soon shall this scrip its precious load resign then what but tears and hunger shall be thine ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griefs a more than equal share here where no springs in murmurs break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way cursed be the gold and silver which persuade weak men to follow farfatiguing trade the lilly peace outshines the silver store and life is dearer than the golden ore yet money tempts us over the desert brown to every distant mart and wealthy town full often we tempt the land and often the sea and are we only yet repaired by thee ah why was ruin so attractive made or why fond man so easily betrayed why heed we not while mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefore think the flowery mountains side the fountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o cease my fears  all frantic as i go when thought creates unnumberd scenes of woe what if the lion in his rage i meet  often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to the mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way at that dead hour the silent asp shall creep if aught of rest i find upon my sleep or some swoln serpent twist his scales around and wake to anguish with a burning wound thrice happy they the wise contented poor from lust of wealth and dread of death secure they tempt no deserts and no griefs they find peace rules the day where reason rules the mind sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o hapless youth for she thy love has won the tender zara will be most undone big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid when fast she dropped her tears as thus she said farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain yet as thou go may every blast arise weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs safe over the wild no perils may thou see no griefs endure nor weep false youth like me o let me safely to the fair return say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn o let me teach my heart to lose its fears recalled by wisdoms voice and zaras tears he said and called on heaven to bless the day when back to schiraz walls he bent his way eclogue iii abra or the georgian sultana scene a forest time the evening in georgias land where tefflis towers are seen in distant view along the level green while evening dews enrich the glittering glade and the tall forests cast a longer shade what time it is sweet over fields of rice to stray or scent the breathing maize at setting day amidst the maids of zagens peaceful grove emyra sung the pleasing cares of love of abra first began the tender strain who led her youth with flocks upon the plain at morn she came those willing flocks to lead where lillies rear them in the watery mead from early dawn the livelong hours she told till late at silent eve she penned the fold deep in the grove beneath the secret shade a various wreath of odorous flowers she made that these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of persia see the modern history of mr salmon gaymotleyd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose the violet blue that on the mossbank grows all sweet to sense the flaunting rose was there the finished chaplet well adorned her hair great abbas chanced that fated morn to stray by love conducted from the chase away among the vocal vales he heard her song and sought the vales and echoing groves among at length he found and wooed the rural maid she knew the monarch and with fear obeyed be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved the royal lover bore her from the plain yet still her crook and bleating flock remain often as she went she backward turned her view and bad that crook and bleating flock adieu fair happy maid to other scenes remove to richer scenes of golden power and love go leave the simple pipe and shepherds strain with love delight thee and with abbas reign be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love on the cool fountain or the shady grove still with the shepherds innocence her mind to the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined and often as spring renewed the plains with flowers breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours with sure return she sought the sylvan scene the breezy mountains and the forests green her maids around her moved a duteous band each bore a crook allrural in her hand some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung with joy the mountain and the forest rung be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved and often the royal lover left the care and thorns of state attendant on the fair often to the shades and lowroofd cots retired or sought the vale where first his heart was fired a russet mantle like a swain he wore and thought of crowns and busy courts no more be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved blessed was the life that royal abbas led sweet was his love and innocent his bed what if in wealth the noble maid excel the simple shepherd girl can love as well let those who rule on persias jewelld throne be famed for love and gentlest love alone or wreathe like abbas full of fair renown the lovers myrtle with the warriors crown o happy days the maids around her say o haste profuse of blessings haste away be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved eclogue iv agib and secander or the fugitives scene a mountain in circassia time midnight in fair circassia where to love inclined each swain was blessed for every maid was kind at that still hour when awful midnight reigns and none but wretches haunt the twilight plains what time the moon had hung her lamp on high and past in radiance through the cloudless sky sad over the dews two brother shepherds fled where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led fast as they pressed their flight behind them lay wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away along the mountains bending sides they ran till faint and weak

hapless must thou know the toils of flight or some severer woe still as i haste the tartar shouts behind and shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind in rage of heart with ruin in his hand he blasts our harvests and deforms our land yon citron grove whence first in fear we came droops its fair honors to the conquering flame far fly the swains like us in deep despair and leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  secander unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword in vain unheard thou callst thy persian lord in vain thou courtst him helpless to thine aid to shield the shepherd and protect the maid far off in thoughtless indolence resigned soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy no wars alarm him and no fears annoy  agib yet these green hills in summers sultry heat have lent the monarch often a cool retreat sweet to the sight is zabrans flowery plain and once by maids and shepherds loved in vain no more the virgins shall delight to rove by sargis banks or irwans shady grove on tarkies mountain catch the cooling gale or breathe the sweets of alys flowery vale fair scenes but ah no more with peace possessed with ease alluring and with plenty blessed no more the shepherds whitening tents appear nor the kind produces of a bounteous year no more the date with snowy blossoms crowned but ruin spreads her baleful fires around  secander in vain circassia boasts her spicy groves for ever famed for pure and happy loves in vain she boasts her fairest of the fair their eyes blue languish and their golden hair those eyes

than crooks and staffs prepare to shield your harvests and defend your fair the turk and tartar like designs pursue fixed to destroy and steadfast to undo wild as his land in native deserts bred by lust incited or by malice led the villain arab as he prowls for prey often marks with blood and wasting flames the way yet none so cruel as the tartar foe to death inured and nursed in scenes of woe

shilling by mr j philips this is reckoned the best parody of milton in our language it has been an hundred times imitated without success the truth is the first thing in this way must preclude all future attempts for nothing is so easy as to burlesque any mans manner when we are once showed the way  happy the man who void of cares and strife in silken or in leathern purse retains a splendid shilling he nor hears with pain new oysters cried nor sighs for cheerful ale but with his friends when nightly mists arise to junipers magpye or town hall two noted alehouses in oxford   00 repairs

encircles ariconium fruitful soil whence flow nectareous wines that well may vie with massic setin or renowned falern thus while my joyless minutes tedious flow with looks demure and silent pace a dun horrible monster hated by gods and men to my aerial citadel ascends with vocal heel thrice thundering at my gate with hideous accent thrice he calls i know the voice illboding and the solemn sound what should i do or whither turn amazed confounded to the dark recess i fly of woodhole strait my bristling hairs erect through sudden fear a chilly sweat bedews my shuddring limbs and wonderful to

perdue in a nook or gloomy cave prompt to inchant some inadvertent wretch with his unhallowed touch so poets sing grimalkin to domestic vermin sworn an everlasting foe with watchful eye lies nightly brooding over a chinky gap protending her fell claws to thoughtless mice sure ruin so her disembowelld web arachne in a hall or kitchen spreads obvious to vagrant flies she secret stands within her woven cell the humming prey regardless of their fate rush on the toils inextricable nor will aught avail their arts or arms or shapes of lovely hue the wasp insiduous and the buzzing drone and butterfly proud of expanded wings distinct with gold entangled in her snares useless resistance make with eager strides she towering flies to her expected spoils then with envenomed jaws the vital

i live from pleasure quite debarred nor taste the fruits that the suns genial rays mature johnapple nor the downy peach nor walnut in roughfurrowd coat secure nor medlar fruit delicious in decay
