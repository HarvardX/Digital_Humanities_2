william franklin who resided eight months at shirauz in      and       chap iii continued the baths in persia are very commodious and well worth the attention of a stranger they consist generally of two large apartments one of which furnishes a place for undressing the other is the bath on the side of the first are stone benches raised two feet from the ground covered with mats and carpets where the bathers sit to undress and thence they proceed to the bath through a long narrow passage the bath is a large room of an octagon form with a cupola at top through which the light and air are admitted on the sides of this room are small platforms of wood raised about a foot from the ground on which the people who enter to bathe perform their devotions a ceremony the persians always previously observe at the upperend of the room is a large basin or reservoir of water built of stone wellheated by means of stoves made at the bottom with iron gratings over them and adjoining is another of cold water of either of which the bather has his choice in the morning before day a servant goes to the terrace on the top of the house and sounds a shell or horn to give notice that the bath is ready when any person comes to bathe he undresses himself in the front room as was said ties a cloth about his middle which reaches down to his knees and proceeds to the stove when he comes out of the hot bath which is generally in the space of ten or twelve minutes the people of the house stand ready to perform the operation of rubbing and to effect this he is laid on his back at full length with a pillow to support his head a brush made of camels hair is then used which completely cleans the body after some time rubbing they rinse the whole body with several basins of warm water and the person is reconducted to the dressing room where he shifts and dresses at leisure receiving a calean to smoke  chardin says that the servants of the bath rub the bather from head to foot in so rough a manner that those who are not used to it think he is about to flea them afterward he shaves the persons head and face if he desires it cuts his finger and toenails handles his body squeezes and rubs it and stretches every finger and limb as if he was about to dislocate them and this takes up a quarter of an hour after the person has been thus stretched and squeezed he plunges into the bath again and being wiped dry returns to the dressing room and puts on his clothes the time for the mens bathing is from daybreak to four in the afternoon and that for the women from four till midnight when it is the womens turn to bathe the male servants of the bagnio withdraw and are succeeded by girls the ladies are never so finely dressed as when they come to bathe this is the only opportunity they have of vying with each other in the article of clothes and their perfumes and essences are enough to stifle one who is not used to them  great men have bagnios in their own houses and those of a lower rank have them adjoining to their houses reserve them to themselves at certain times but let them out to others on condition only of keeping a constant fire with vessels and other implements necessary for bathing  the persians are much more scrupulous than any other eastern nation in permitting foreigners to go into their baths which if attempted without their knowledge they prevent alleging in excuse that if it was known that they admitted a ferengy this is the word they express christians by they should lose both their custom and reputation as the bath would be thereby deemed polluted  during the spring the baths are dressed out in great finery a custom distinguished by the natives under the name of gul reazee or the scattering of roses from the vast quantity of those flowers strewed in the apartments this ceremony continues a week or ten days during which time the guests are entertained with music dancing coffee sherbet etc and the dressing room is decked out with paintings lookingglasses streamers and other ornaments at the expense of the master of the humaum or hummum as we call it who compliments his customers on the occasion though a small present is made by them to the musicians in shirauz the baths are used alternately by men and women every other day  in the center of the city of shirauz is a large building called by the persians shah cheraug or the kings lamp and is considered as a place of the greatest sanctity being the mausoleum of the mother of one of their imaums or heads of the faith it is a place of high antiquity but the exact date of its foundation cannot be ascertained the tomb of the celebrated and deservedly admired hafiz one of the most famous of the persian poets stands about two miles from shirauz here government has erected a most elegant aivan or hall with apartments adjoining no cost has been spared to render it agreeable it stands in the middle of a large garden in the front of the apartments is a stone reservoir with a fountain in the center in the garden are many cypress trees of extraordinary size and beauty as well as of great antiquity under the shade of these trees is the tomb of hafiz of fine white marble from tauris eight feet long and broad covering the original tomb on the top and sides are select pieces from the poets own works most beautifully cut in the persian nustaleek character during the spring and summer season the inhabitants visit this spot and amuse themselves with smoking playing at chess and other games reading also the works of hafiz whom they esteem more than any of their poets and whom they venerate almost to adoration never speaking of him but in the highest terms of rapture and enthusiasm a most elegant copy of his works is kept upon the tomb for the purpose and inspection of all who go there the principal youth of the city assemble here and show every possible mark of respect for their favorite poet making plentiful libations of the delicious wine of shirauz to his memory  sadis tomb another of their famous poets who flourished about five hundred and fifty years ago is also in being though out of repair it is situated at the foot of the mountains that border the plain or valley of shirauz it is a large square building at the upperend of which are two alcoves or recesses in the wall that on the right is the tomb of sadi just in the state it was in when he was buried built of stone six feet long and two and a half broad on the sides are engraved many sentences in the old nuskhi character relating to the poet and his works on the tomb is placed for the inspection of all who visit it a manuscript copy of his works most elegantly transcribed and this place the people of shirauz visit occasionally as they do the tomb of hafiz  not far from hafizs tomb is a magnificent building called heft tun or seven bodies erected in commemoration of seven dervises who came from a great distance to reside in this country and took up their abode on this spot and there continued till they all died each burying the other successively until the only survivor was buried there by the neighbors this hall is lined one third of the height with white tauris marble and the cieling ornamented with blue and gold enamel it has some tolerable paintings executed in the persian style amongst which is one of abrahams offering up his son isaac and another of moses when a boy tending the flocks of his fatherinlaw jethro over the doors are the portraits of the two celebrated poets hafiz and sadi at full length that of hafiz habited in the old persian dress painted with a rosy complexion and a large pair of whiskers apparently about thirtysix years old sadi is the figure of a venerable old man with a long beard turned white with age in a religious dress with long flowing robes holding a small crook or ivory staff in his right hand and a charger of incense in the other  derbend is the capital of shirvan and situated in    degrees of north latitude it is a city of great antiquity and the only place now standing on the shores of the caspian sea which has any thing to boast of it seems to be admitted that the greatest part of it was built by alexander the great derbend has often changed its masters having been several times in the hands of the turks the tartars are said to have had possession of it the russians kept possession of it for several years during this century but it is now again in possession of the persians it is about three english miles long but not more than half a mile broad extending from the verge of the shore due west up to the foot of a lofty mountain the whole in a declivity and its natural situation is such as to form in strict propriety the gates of persia on this side for there is no passage to the westward without going deep into the mountains which are guarded by their proper inhabitants who have not submitted to the persian yoke here is a citadel with a governor that mounts  0 pieces of cannon this city is divided into three parts each part having its distinct wall the upper town which is half a mile square constitutes the citadel and no person can enter it but the soldiers of the garrison  the walls of the middle town are about  0 feet high  0 feet thick at the base and from    to    at top having a breastwork with portholes three feet thick it is defended also by about six flanking bastions the walls are of a shelly stone strongly cemented how nature has produced these or whether they have remained since the deluge must be left to the curious to determine we can only observe that such shells do not appear on any of the caspian shores the rocks about the town are of the same composition  the city gates are very strong and well made arches with sliding holes to shoot arrows or throw down stones from the streets are not regular nor were they paved in      though they had been so formerly it was in this year that the russian ambassador made his entry into persia and mr van mierop who accompanied him tells us that though many of the houses are supported on one side by the hills numbers were fallen down and the greatest part in ruins it is hardly possible to describe the miseries which this place suffered about four years before when nadir shah the persian king came in person against the lesgee tartars we saw a specimen of it says he by the carcases of horses and other animals which was suffered to remain in the streets and ruined houses we found in this town near  00 men whose eyes nadir shah had caused to be put out at one time here is a very magnificent mosque whose roof is supported by    arches nadir converted it into a barn and we rode into it without giving offense here are also several caravanseras belonging to the armenians  the eastermost part of the lower town is washed by the sea the walls are guarded by two round bastions without which was formerly a harbor for small vessels nadir built a palace here caused several streets or houses to be erected and made it a free port with a view of establishing a great commerce but it came to nothing and this part of the town is uninhabited  on the south side of derbend are many vineyards and gardens for an extent of eight miles but these as well as their arable lands have partaken the common fate of war as the neighborhood of this city is the country of the lesgee tartars and as we had not an opportunity of speaking of them when describing the vast extent of tartary the reader will doubtless not be displeased at having here some little account of them particularly as it will relieve him from a continued dry description of towns and places  these tartars are known to be some of the bravest people in the world their country extends south from near the latitude of tarku about  0 leagues and    westward they are under different chiefs who in case of danger to their own common liberty unite their forces some few have been subjected to the persians but those to the north and west of the persian dominions have never submitted they are able to bring  0 or  0000 men into the field they have had frequent wars with the persians and lastly with nadir shah who with   000 men pursued a great body of them into the hills but was at last obliged to retreat with a considerable loss  though these tartars in flying parties pillage the armenians and georgians if any stranger traveling into their country or on the borders of it seeks their protection and chooses a guide from among them let him meet never so strong a party it is enough if the guide declares he is his guest they are hardly ever known to violate the laws of hospitality in any instance of this nature  in their persons they are wellmade of good stature and extremely active their countenance is swarthy their features are regular and their eyes black and full of life  their dress resembles the greek or arabian manner many of them wearing the same kind of drawers reaching to their ancles their caps are not so lofty as those of the persians neither do all of them wear their beard some preferring whiskers only  they live after the manner of persians professing the mahomedan religion their valleys are exceedingly fertile producing plenty of wheat barley and oats with abundance of sheep and their hills are covered with vines they are ingenious in several manufactures of wool and camels hair and none of the neighboring nations equal them in making firearms which they fell to the persians they deal largely in madder the armenians trade with these tartars and these tartars with the russians  i must not omit tauris supposed to be the ancient ecbatana it is called by the turks and persians tabriz and was the metropolis of media diodorus siculus is of opinion it was founded by semiramis who with incredible labor brought water there from the mountain orontes whilst josephus assures us that it was built at least a royal palace in it by the prophet daniel it was formerly best known by the name of ecbatana and was then in the greatest splendour the ancients say it was    miles about and had walls  0 cubits high and  0 broad but there is now little or nothing left either of the walls or palaces however tauris is still a considerable town being five miles round populous and a place of great trade the inhabitants amount to about  0000  tauris like most other cities in persia stands in a plain surrounded by mountains from whence there falls a small stream which runs through the middle of it but when the snows melt is increased to a torrent here are several noble meydans or squares one of them almost equal to the royal meydan at ispahan they have also their covered streets or exchanges where abundance of rich merchandise is exposed to sale and their mosques and bagnios are much after the model of those in other cities already described  the city of tauris has also often changed its master sometimes the turk and at others the persian has possessed it but as the citizens seem attached to the persians the turks have several times burnt and plundered it tauris stands about  00 miles north of ispahan which the caravans usually travel in    days its latitude is    degrees odd minutes from the towns and buildings already described it will be easy to form a judgment of the rest i will proceed therefore to mention  teflis which is the capital of georgia and supposed to be the acropolis of the ancients which was taken by pompey but under the dominion of the persians though inhabited chiefly by christians there being    christian churches and not one mahomedan mosque except that in the castle which stands on an eminence in the center it is a bishops see and has a handsome cathedral built in form of a cross the other churches belong partly to the georgians and partly to the armenians these as well as the other public buildings are built of stone as are their bazars caravanseras bagnios etc which are after the same model with those in other towns of persia it is large well peopled and the houses built with brick  the climate of this country georgia is soft not very different from that of italy the men are remarkably tall comely robust and wellmade ostentatious and proud of a splendid appearance the women under the name of circassians are celebrated for their beauty all over asia i have already treated of circassia which lies much further to the northwest than teflis and have spoken of the women of this country  teflis is situated in    degrees of north latitude on the river kur or cyrus at the foot of a mountain it is not of very large extent but elegantly built on the south side on the declivity of the mountain stands the castle once a place of strength but hardly tenable at present  the next place i shall notice is gombron a seaport town most resorted to of any in the persian dominions and where the east india company had a factory above  00 years it is situated in    degrees  0 minutes north latitude about  00 miles from shirauz is two or three miles round and stands on a level ground close to the sea the narrowest part of the gulf of persia the country almost insensibly rising every way for some miles without any considerable hill except toward the north the coast of arabia lies opposite to it at about  0 leagues distance but it does not seem to be further over than from dover to calais besides the natives it is inhabited by english dutch portuguese arabs jews armenians banians and several other nations of which the armenians and banians are much the greatest merchants it has a wall toward the land and toward the sea there are three small forts mounted with five guns each and a platform of eight there is also a castle mounted with    guns for the security of the road the houses in many of the streets are falling down the people having the same humor here as in other parts of persia to let those of their ancestors drop and erect new ones for themselves through a superstitious opinion that if the person who inhabited a house was in their conceit unlucky the next inhabitant of the house will be unlucky also  the best houses are built of stone brought from the islands of kishee or larrak but they are generally built of brick sundried they have sometimes two stories and a wooden contrivance to strike the wind down into the lower rooms these machines are about  0 feet high and look like towers the houses belonging to the english and dutch east india companies are as well built as any in the town but the english factors are most of them removed to bossora at the bottom of the gulf in the turkish territories which is the last city i shall take any notice of  bossora or bussora is situated in latitude    degrees  0 minutes north on the banks of a fresh water river which is a branch of the euphrates the city is a large one but indifferently fortified a mudwall encircles the town with mudbastions and turrets it had formerly a wet fosse which is now dried up in many parts but notwithstanding these disadvantages it held out upwards of eight months in      when besieged by the persians here is a grand mosque and a convent of italian missionaries although the great desert extends to the walls of the city the banks of the river on each side are very fertile and pleasant their fields produce corn pulse rice and several european fruits and the country round abounds in game  having mentioned the principal cities in existence i will mention one now in ruins but for its antiquity and grandeur better worth a description than any we have dwelt on this is the famous city of persepolis where are found the noblest ruins of an ancient palace or temple that are now to be seen on the face of the earth even rome itself they say is nothing compared with these venerable remains of antiquity the place at this day is called chilmanar or forty pillars it is situated about  0 miles northeast of shirauz  it is seated at the foot of a mountain at the northeast end of that spacious plain where persepolis once stood and generally held to be part of the palace of darius who was conquered by alexander the great it stands on a rising ground and the adjoining mountains encircle it in form of an amphitheatre we ascend to the pillars by a grand flight of steps of blue stone  0  in number  0 feet in length and  0 inches broad so that a horse may easily go up or down them  mr herbert says it was built upon a mountain of dark colored marble and the steps hewed out of the solid rock but those who have viewed it more accurately since observe that the steps are composed of large stones fifteen or sixteen feet long and of such a thickness that six or seven steps are cut out of one stone and the whole being so artificially joined that they appear to be but one piece  the staircase divides as you ascend one flight winding to the right and the other to the left having a wall on each side and a ballustrade on the other afterward both flights or branches turn again and end at a square landingplace from whence you go into a portico of white marble  0 feet wide on it are carved in basso relievo two beasts as large as elephants but their bodies like horses with the feet and tails of oxen ten feet farther stand two fluted columns of whitish stone about six feet high beside their capitals and bases and as thick as three men can fathom round a little farther stand two pillasters embellished with two sphinxes of an immense size dressed out with a profusion of beadwork represented standing on the sides above are inscriptions of an ancient character which no one yet has been able to decypher beyond this portal is another flight of steps leading to the grand hall of columns on its sides or walls are a variety of figures in basso relievo a kind of triumph consisting of a great train of people in distinct companies some carrying banners others offerings after all comes a car drawn by several horses with a little altar on it from whence fire seems to ascend at the head of the staircase is another basso relievo representing a lion seizing a bull cut with great exactness and close to this are other inscriptions in ancient characters on the top of the second staircaise is a square place which has been surrounded with columns to which the name of forty pillars has been given although a vast number of ages have elapsed since the foundation of this building fifteen of the colums remain yet entire they are from seventy to eighty feet in height and are masterly pieces of masonry their pedestals are curiously worked and appear little injured by the hand of time the shafts are fluted to the top and the capitals are adorned with a profusion of friezework  from this hall we proceed eastward till we arrive at the remains of a large square building to which we enter through a door of granite most of the doors and windows of this apartment are still standing they are of black marble and polished like a mirror on the sides of the entrance are bassreliefs of two figures at full length representing a man stabbing a goat over another door is the representation of two men at full length behind stands a domestic holding a spread umbrella at the south entrance of this room are two large pillars on which are cut four figures dressed in long garments holding in their hands spears ten feet in length vast numbers of broken pillars shafts and capitals are scattered over a considerable extent of ground some of them of such enormous size that it is wonderful how they could have been brought whole and set up together indeed every part of the remains of these noble ruins indicate their former grandeur truly worthy of being the residence of a great and powerful monarch and whilst viewing them the mind becomes impressed with an awful solemnity when we consider the celebrity of this vast empire once the patron of the arts and sciences and the seat of a wise and flourishing government when we reflect on the various changes and revolutions it has undergone at one period a field for the daring ambition of an alexander at another for the enthusiasm of an omar we must feel the strongest conviction of the mutability of all human events there are the remains of other buildings reaching up the side of the mountains equally magnificent and beautiful in their ruins with human figures cut on the walls carrying bows and arrows and spears in their hands all of them with caps in the form of turrets which was the mode of headdress among the ancient medes sir john chardin and mr le brun have given it as their opinion that this place was the sepulture of the ancient kings of persia the modern natives call this place the assembly of king gemsheed and say that prince used to visit it with the nobles and great men of his court in order to enjoy a delightful view of the adjacent country of which there cannot be a finer prospect than from hence in another place close by we ascend by a stone staircaise into a magnificent court of a quadrangular form several pedestals of pillars and the remains of two grand portals all of granite are still visible and the cornices of the portals are perfect on many of the broken pieces of the pillars are ancient inscriptions in several parts of this palace are stone aqueducts cut under ground eight feet deep and a half broad made with a design to carry off the water running down from the mountains  these venerable ruins have suffered much from the ravages of time but what still remains of them are as hard and durable as the soil they stand on they are covered with inscriptions mr niebur has given them all in his second volume most elegantly and accurately copied but the most learned and best acquainted with the eastern languages have been baffled in every attempt to make out their meaning it is one of the most considerable difficulties to solve when and by whom this palace was originally built the grecian historians have given very imperfect accounts of it and the persians no less so by the present natives mr franklin says the place is called tukht gemsheed or the throne of king gemshed who they affirm built it between three and four thousand years ago it is related in grecian history that alexander the great set fire to and destroyed the whole city of persepolis the noblest and wealthiest city in the world with this rich and splendid palace about the year of the world      or   0 years before christ instigated to it in a fit of debauchery by the celebrated courtezan thais the athenian in revenge for the towns the persian emperor had stroyed in greece but this story says mr franklin though it has the sanction of history if we reflect on what still remains of these ruins any one on viewing them would suppose such an event impossible to have taken place he might have burned the city but of such a nature are the remains of the palace that all the fire that could be applied to them would not make the smallest impression on these huge masses of stone equal in point of durability and hardness to the solid rock  it is to be remarked that in the figures throughout the whole of the palace the rules of art are not attended to the muscles of the figures are wanting yet the drapery is finely done and the proportions in general are well kept up though the contour is only observed which gives a sameness to the whole sir john chardin says whoever was the architect was ignorant of grecian and of roman architecture and supposes the defects i have mentioned were occasioned by finishing the work in a hurry but on the other hand it is more natural to conceive the work altogether to have been the ne plus ultra of those days as the ornaments of the palace of shirauz are in the same style as these at persepolis and as the architecture of the present persians is similar to that of ancient times  the materials of which the ruins consist are chiefly hard blue stone but the doors and windows of the apartments are all of black marble and so beautiful and highly polished that we may see our faces in them one of the principal things worthy admiration is the immense strength of the foundation the whole of the palace takes in a circumference of   00 square yards the front is  00 paces from north to south and   0 from east to west the height of the foundation in front is in several parts from  0 to  0 feet and consists of two immense stones laid together it is much to be feared that in the course of a few centuries earthquakes may destroy the columns and remaining apartments but whatever may be their fate the foundations must endure until the rock on which it is built shall cease to exist  chap iv of the people the modern persians are in many respects a handsome people they are personable men of a good stature wellshaped cleanlimbed and of agreeable features and in georgia and the northern provinces of an admirable fair complexion toward the south they are a little upon the olive they are also robust warlike and hardy and are now all become soldiers their eyes and their hair are generally black in most parts of the country the men shave their heads very close but the young men have often a lock on each temple their cheeks are shaved but the beard on their chin reaches up to their temples their priests and religious men wear their beards long only clip them into form and the common people cut theirs pretty short but none suffer any hair to grow on their bodies most of the men have clothcaps which rise ten or twelve inches and terminate at the top in four corners they wear a shorter cap in summer faced with gray bucharian lambskin their ears which are very large are always left bae and generally hang down owing to the weight of their caps and many are proud to show that their ears are not cut off crimson is a color they much affect in their caps as well as in their outward garments and it makes a grand appearance deep persians blue is the color of their mourning the better sort of people wear a sack of kermania wool wrapped about their heads as turbans some of these are so exceeding fine as to cost  000 crowns    l english and the common price for such as are good is eight or ten crowns and their sashes cost from   l to    l each their heads are thus kept very warm and the more so as they seldom pull off their caps but wear them even in the presence of their king next their skins they wear a shirt if it may be so called of colored silk or callico generally blue or chequered which they wear out without ever washing it this shirt has an open bosom without neck or wristbands and is made close to the arm they have a pair of drawers or trowsers close before which reaches half down their legs their stockings are made of woollen cloth but not at all shaped to the leg sitting loose like boots but in general they only wear woollen trowsers which reach over the ancles over the shirt they wear a waistcoat and upon these they wear a coat with close sleeves and buttons and loops before tied with a sash this coat is wide at bottom and hangs like a bell or hoop a little below their knees besides they put or frequently another coat without sleeves the upper coat being the shortest and in the wintertime over all they wear another coat lined with furs these furcoats are as often worn for state as for warmth for it is common to see a great man sit in his fablecoat in the midst of summer instead of shoes they have piqued slippers without quarters turned up at the to and made of turkey leather neither tied nor buckled some are made of shagreen being the skin of horses rumps prepared hard and tough like seals skin and with such high heels that though they are calculated to carry them out of the dirt are extremely uneafy to those who are not accustomed to them when they ride they have boots of yellow leather their bridles saddles and housings are immoderately fine the last being a cloth of gold and so large as almost to hide the hindquarters of the horse the outer garment of the common people is a slight cotton in general they wear two or three light vestments and reaching only to their knees it gives them a great advantage over the turks who wear long effeminate robes silk is worn in summer by men of distinction especially for undergarments and these as well as their cotton and woollen undergarments are quilted of course warm and light under the sash round the waist they carry a long pointed knife mounted with gold or silver and sheathed and this whether on foot or on horseback ladies they say do the same writers carry their pen and ink about them  the women about shirauz have at all times been celebrated over those of other parts of persia for their beauty and not without reason they are tall and wellshaped but their bright and sparkling eyes is a striking beauty this however is in a great measure owing to art for they rub their eyebrows and eyelids with the black flower of antimony which adds an incomparable brilliancy to their natural luster as the women in mahomedan countries are down to the meanest covered with a veil from head to foot a sight is never to be obtained of them in the street but living as mr franklin did in the family of a persian he had many opportunities of seeing them unveiled the females says hanway who do not labor in the field are seldom seen abroad except in a morning before the sun rises and then they are covered with veils which reach to their feet when they travel on horseback every lady of distinction is not only veiled but has generally a servant who runs or rides before her to clear the way and on such occasions the men even in the marketplace always turn their backs till the women are past it being deemed the highest ill manners to look at them the care which they take to conceal their faces to avoid the imputation of acting indelicately and contrary to custom has made so strong an impression on them that if a woman was accidentally surprised she would show her whole person rather than her face  the dress of the women is simple differing from the men rather for the distinction of sexes than otherwise they wear neither turbans on the head nor sashes about their waist and their coats or vests reach almost down to their heels they adorn their arms with bracelets and their heads with jewels of several kinds one of these is composed of a light gold chainwork set with small pearls with a thin goldplate pendant about the size of a crownpiece on which is engraved an arabian prayer this is fixed to the hair at the upper part of the temple and hangs upon the cheek below the ear or is bound round the arm they have large earrings and some bordering on india wear gold rings set with pearls in their nostrils the poorer sort wear the same things in baser metal their hair hangs in tresses falling down the back their shirts as well as the mens are of a thin manufacture of silk and cotton but these are open at the breast in the manner of mens shirts in europe whilst the mens are supported on the left shoulder by a small button the women also wear drawers and slippers as the men  some girls wear a stiffened cap upon their heads turned up before like a hunting cap with a herons feather in it neither men nor women wear gloves but their fingers are full of rings as their arms are of bracelets they wear necklaces of gold or pearl hanging down on the bosom with a locket full of perfume  as black hair and large black eyes are most common so are they most in esteem and the thickest and broadest eyebrows are thought the finest the women if their eyebrows be not black will as i have observed color them and are accustomed to paint their faces and rub their hands and feet with hannay a kind of orangecoloured pomatum  as the clothes both of the men and women are of the richest flowered and brocaded silks it appears that dress is no inconsiderable article in persia particularly as persons of small fortune endeavor to vie with their superiors and will have fine clothes though they want food those who wear sables which they will not be without if they can purchase them seldom pay less than an hundred pounds for a closebodied coat all this with the rich trappings of their horses when they ride which they do almost every day if they go but a stones throw must amount to a vast sum and this keeps them poor however as there are no where more personable men finer horses or richer equipages the persians are allowed to make as splendid a figure as any people whatever poverty may prey on them at home but they are loaded with gold and jewels abroad and as they have always a clear sunshine and bright heaven these cast a more than ordinary luster on their persons and their finery is set off to the greatest advantage  in point of dress the persians differ remarkably from the turks for in turkey any person who is not a seiud or descendant of the prophet wearing the least green upon his garments would most probably be stoned whereas in persia green is the general and favorite color even to their shoes a turk also thinks himself defiled by the touch of a christian even on his garments the persians on the contrary will eat out of the same plate drink out of the same cup and smoke out of the same calean  the persians in their dispositions says mr franklin are much inclined to sudden anger are quick fiery and very sensible of affronts which they resent on the spot but they are not vindictive and yet if their kindness to their best friends happens to be turned by the fortune of war into enmity they often become insensible this seems to be more owing to a custom of cruelty than a revengeful disposition on the other hand there are not many instances of the placable temper which the christian religion so strongly recommends in theory however they are friends to this virtue and apparently exceed the christians in the duty of resignation they are of a sedentary turn and delight in sitting still and musing i never found any of them says hanway walk in their apartments as the english often do a turk being on board an english man of war enquired very seriously if the people were troubled with an evil spirit because says he they are never at rest  the persians are certainly a brave and courageous people but their frequent wars have much depraved their ancient urbanity of manners and introduced a strife peculiar to the lower class of people when two persons begin fighting it always raises a great crowd who generally enter into the contest and the whole presently becomes a scene of tumult and confusion until the arrival of the daroga or judge of the police who puts an end to the fray hospitality is a part of their religion on occasions of the least intercourse men of any distinction invite strangers as well as their friends to their table and it is remarkable how they pride themselves in other testimonies of respect  they are naturally inclined to temperance and with regard to diet seem to be more in a state of nature than the europeans by way of amusement they use opiates but not near so much as the turks the following is their mode of living they always rise at daybreak in order to perform their devotions their first prayer is said before sunrise after which they breakfast this consists of grapes or any other fruits of the season with a little bread and cheese made of goatsmilk they then drink a cup of very strong coffee without milk or sugar and then the calean or pipe is introduced the smoke of which is contrived to be drawn through a basin of cold water for the persians of all ranks smoke tobacco  their second time of prayer is repeated when the sun declines from the meridian soon after which they dine their dinner consists of curds bread and fruits of various kinds animal food not being usual at this meal the third hour of prayer is about four oclock in the afternoon  the fourth hour of prayer is after sunset when this is finished the persians eat their principal meal or supper this generally consists of pilau which is boiled rice well buttered and seasoned with a fowl a piece of mutton or a kid served up with it and sometimes colored with saffion or curry sometimes they eat roast meat when the meal is ready a servant brings notice of it and at the same time brings an ewer and water to wash their hands which is an invariable custom with them both before and after eating they eat very quick conveying their food to their mouths with their fingers knives and forks being unknown in persia and grease their chins and beards as much as their fingers sherbets of different sorts are introduced and the meal concludes with a desert of delicious fruits the supper being finished the family sit in a circle and entertain each other by relating stories of which they are excessively fond and also of repeating passages from the works of their most favorite poets and amusing themselves at various kinds of games and it is worthy of remark that when the oldest man in company speaks though poor and at the lowerend of the room he is always attended to the fifth or last prayer is said about an hour after supper  mr hanway supped once with a man of distinction and describes it as follows supper being brought in a servant presented a basin of water and a napkin hung over his shoulders he went to every one in the company and poured water on their hands to wash in the courtyard stood a lamp which was supplied with tallow and in the middle of the room upon the floor was one large wax candle which they snuffed with scissars into a teacup of water a large salver in form of a teaboard was set for every person covered with a plate of pilau in which was a small quantity of mincemeat mixed up with fruit and spices there were also plates of comfits several china basins of sherbets as sweet sour and other waters with cakes of rice and others of wheatflour on which were sprinkled the seeds of poppies and others of the like nature as they esteem it an abomination to cut either bread or any kind of meat after it is dressed these cakes are made thin that they may be easily broken with the hand and their meat which is generally mutton or fowls is so prepared that they divide it with their fingers pork is never eaten here nor veal and beef but seldom nor do they eat hares or other animals forbidden by the jews they use no beaten pepper only whole pepper they never salt their meat nor is salt ever brought to table they dress their meat and fowls the day they are killed and put by nothing to be cold they sit down on the floor crosslegged at their meals and a cloth is spread on the carpet in common families the person who has the provision before him distributes it to the company they use no spoons except for soups or liquid and take up their rice by handfuls as do the people in india they wash their hands before and after meals and wipe them in their handkerchiefs common people at ispahan seldom dress their food at home but when they have shut up their shops go to an eatinghouse and buy pilau for their families it is remarked of the persians that so far from shutting their doors at mealtimes they invite all to eat that come to their houses at that time remembering to this day the hospitality of abraham and observing that had he not been of a hospitable disposition he probably had missed the honor of entertaining three angels every man may retire from an entertainment without ceremony and what they leave of meats is always given to the poor  when a person makes an entertainment it is usually a supper notwithstanding which the guests generally come at   or  0 in the morning and spend the whole day they discourse they smoke eat sweatmeats and pass away the time in a thousand amusements sometimes they hear heroic poems in honor of their prince sometimes singingwomen are introduced who sing dance and play and show a number of antic tricks to divert the company and if any of the guests are disposed to withdraw with any of these dancing girls they are shown into a private room and when they return no one takes any notice of it wine they have none but their usual drink is sherbets and water cooled in summertime with ice the officers of the army will indulge with wine and other persons drink under a pretense of doing it for their health but the chief of what is here made is transported to neighboring countries or drank by christians in persia but they raise their spirits with opium mankind seem generally to confess that they cannot sustain the cares and inquietudes of life without some such expedient what is tobacco but an opiate it is not the smell or taste we are enamoured with but it lulls men into pleasing thoughts within an hour after they have taken a pill of opium it begins to operate and a thousand pleasant scenes present themselves to their imagination they laugh they sing and say abundance of droll things like men intoxicated with wine but when the effect of it is gone off they find their spirits exhausted and grow pensive and melancholy till they repeat the dose and the longer they have been used to it the greater proportion they must take to answer the purpose so that some take as much at one time as would destroy half a dozen europeans a decoction of poppyseed is sold also in most cities in persia and in these houses we shall see people eating and talking as ridiculously as men do when they are drunk if there is any reason in the prohibition of wine it is to prevent people playing the fool and injuring their health which is as effectually done by opium as by wine  in their conversation the persians aim much at elegance and are perpetually repeating verses and passages from the works of their most favorite poets hafiz sadi and jami a practice universal from the highest to the lowest for those who have not the advantages of education make shift thus to bear their part in conversation by remembering what they hear they delight also in jokes and quaint expressions and are fond of playing upon each other which they sometimes do with great elegance and irony there is one thing much to be admired in their conversations which is the strict attention they pay to the person speaking whom they never interrupt on any account  they are so accustomed in their common discourse to use extravagant and hyperbolical compliments on the most trifling occasions that it would at first inspire a stranger with an idea that every inhabitant of the place was willing to lay down his life shed his blood or spend his money in his service and this mode of address which in fact means nothing is practiced not only among the genteel people but even among the meanest artificers freedom of conversation is a thing totally unknown here as that walls have ears is proverbially in the mouth of every one the fear of chains which bind their bodies has also enslaved their minds and their address to men of superior rank to themselves is marked with signs of the most abject and slavish submission while on the contrary as all men of this stamp are they are as haughty and overbearing to their inferiors  the persians with respect to outward behavior are certainly the parisians of the east whilst a rude and insolent demeanor marks the character of the turkish nation toward foreigners and christians the behavior of the persians would on the contrary do honor to the most civilized nations they are kind courteous civil and obliging to all strangers without being guided by those religious prejudices so prevalent in every other mahomedan country they are fond of enquiring after the manners and customs of europe and in return very readily afford any information in respect to their own country hospitality is with them so great a virtue that a man thinks himself highly honored if you will enter his house and partake of what it affords whereas going out of a house without smoking a calean or taking some refreshment is a high affront they say that every meal a stranger partakes with them brings a blessing on the house  the ancient persians are recorded to have taught their children a most exact reverence for truth but the present generation are as notorious for falsehood they poison with a sweetmeat in always saying what is pleasing whether it be true or not franklin says they are the greatest liars in the world practicing the most improbable falsities with the gravest air imaginable and so far from being abashed by a detection they always endeavor to turn it off with a laugh and even confess themselves that they think there is no harm in telling a lie provided it turns out of any benefit to themselves and they will always in every business they are engaged in first endeavor to bring it about by lying and knavery which if unsuccessful in those with whom they have to deal being fully as expert as themselves they will then conclude the bargain with truth and honesty but either way to them is equally indifferent in their dispositions they are cheerful but rather inclined to seriousness than loud mirth  they are very eager to gain money and are lavish in expending it when they have furnished themselves with an equipage a house and gardens agreeable to their wishes they will rather than lay by their money lay it out in building caravanseras mosques and on other public occasions insomuch that travelers observe that there are no people in the world that take less thought for the morrow a man to whom a fortune of  0000 l shall fall will in a few months lay it out in purchasing wives and slaves clothes and furniture without considering where he is to get more and in two or three months after this will dispose of what he has bought for present subsistence this chardin assures us he has seen in a thousand instances  another charge against the persians is that they are much addicted to women and the reason alleged is that they have several wives and concubines but whether any other people would not have as many if their laws permitted them is a question especially if they were taught as the mahomedans are that the enjoyment of women will constitute a great part of their happiness in the next world as well as in this surely those nations may with more reason be charged with lasciviousness who break through all restraints both civil and religious and fly at the whole sex even the wives and daughters of their most intimate friends and acquaintance but if it be true that the persians admire boys and that every great man has his ganymede it is a crime they are justly to be detested for this however seems to intimate that they have less respect for the fair sex than they ought and contradicts the former charge  the notion which the persians have imbibed concerning the female world prevents their being involved in the distresses of love such as losing their senses for the sake of a woman though they are betrayed into many improprieties of conduct on this account jealousy which generally prevails in the warmest climates is not unknown to the heart of a persian the nearer approach to the sun may affect mahomedans as well as christians but as in the politer countries of christendom women are generally considered on an equality with men and in persia as much inferior to them there must consequently among christians be a greater regard to conjugal love the difference in religion as well as in the customs and manners of countries will hardly admit a comparison but as jealousy sometimes occasions the infidelity of women in europe it is always a safeguard to them in asia where they are never constituted the guardians of their own honor  we find custom has a great influence on the manners of mankind in all countries in france there is a more liberal indulgence to women than in england and yet contrary to this rule it is beyond dispute that english wives greatly exceed the french in chastity this i take to be owing to the natural gaiety of the french which puts them more off their guard whereas a more serious turn of mind creates an awe and keeps the enemy at a distance on the other hand in portugal and other countries in the south of europe where jealousy most abounds and where the least confidence is reposed in women there is the most incontinence so that it is hard to say whether jealousy has tended most to this immorality or this immorality established jealousy as a kind of natural vice  in short whether it is from jealousy or what other cause there is no part of the world where the women are so strictly guarded as in persia even in the indies and turkey neighboring kingdoms they live in freedom in comparison with these for though a husband should have the greatest indifference for his wife yet the reflection a wifes imprudent conduct casts upon her husband is more than he is able to bear and as a woman is here considered as polluted if she suffers a man to cast but an eye upon her and both her and her husbands honor is lost by her appearing in public it is no wonder their apartments are so strictly guarded if this furious love and jealousy was the consequence of the climate it would at all times have been the same but we find in the days of the patriarch abraham who lived on the confines of this country the women enjoyed as great a liberty as with us or sarahs beauty would not have brought her husbands life in danger we find also ahasuerus king of this very country left haman in the room with his beloved queen whilst he retired to his garden and esther made entertainment for the great lords of the court and was there in person which sufficiently shows that they allowed the ladies as great liberties in persia in those days as in any part of europe at present  the persians give this reason among others for shutting up their women that their prophet was heard to say in his last moments whilst dying take care of your religion and your wives and great care they take of them indeed for their harams are not enclosed with a single wall but frequently have two or three and these of an extraordinary height the men are taught also as they value their salvation and the glory of god never to cast an eye on their neighbors women or even the places where they are kept and if they should meet the camels that carry them in the streets or on the road though they are shut up so close that it is impossible to see them yet the men turn aside their faces as they pass by or go out of the way and the women are taught that their honor and virtue does not consist in preserving their chastity only but in preventing their being seen or seeing any man but their lord and they are accordingly prohibited from conversing with their brothers or nearest male relations we are speaking now of the women kept in the harams of great men so great a particularity not being always preserved with other women  as the persians hold that women were made only for their pleasure and for the continuance of the species and that there is no manner of occasion for them in the management of the affairs of the world as in business of any kind whatever they suffer them to pass their lives in idleness and luxury accordingly we see them almost all the day lolling on carpets with their little slaves rubbing and chafing them which is the common amusement in the east sometimes they take opium or smoke their country tobacco which is so mild that it may be taken from morning till night without disturbing their heads their food is dressed by their slaves and their clothes also made and washed by them so that they have nothing to do but to indulge themselves and please their tyrants  the women of the haram are attended chiefly by eunuchs and there are a vast number of them dispersed throughout the whole kingdom of persia especially in the kings palaces and those of the quality where they have almost every thing of value entrusted to their care and in a manner govern the affairs of their masters the women never stir abroad without them either on a visit or even to the bath but they are not permitted to interrupt their privacy in their chambers  the eunuchs also teach the children of the family to read and write and instruct them in the principles of their religion till it is thought fit to put them into the hands of the learned and even then they have the care of the young gentlemen not suffering them to be at any time out of their sight and as to the kings children who never stir out of the haram till they come to the throne they have no other masters some few of these eunuchs are versed in the liberal and mechanic arts and it is happy where the prince who succeeds falls into the hands of such a one for otherwise he comes to the throne a mere novice  eunuchs are generally cut between seven and ten years of age if not done till they are fifteen not one in four would survive the operation an eunuch between eight and sixteen years of age is sold in persia for  00 l english money at least and sometimes for  00 l according to their capacities people choose to buy them in order to train them up to their wishes which done they seldom change their masters whilst they live not having any friends or relations which they know their sole dependence is on their lord and they make it their whole business to please him and generally manage matters so as to obtain the government of the family they are brought from the coast of malabar few persons have any white eunuchs except the king who has seldom less of one sort or other than three or four thousand men of the first rank have usually half a dozen in their houses those of inferior quality two or three as these unhappy men are not taken up with amorous pursuits and can have no views to the raising of families of their own they are generally very diligent in their respective employments and faithful to their masters  chap v of their customs etc the usual salute in this country is bowing the body a little and clapping the right hand to the breast but men never stir their cap or their turban those who are more familiar press the palm of your hand between both theirs and then raise them to their forehead to express the high and cordial respect they have for you before the king the viceroys of provinces and other great men they bow their faces three times to the ground as they approach them as to europeans if they are not clothed in the persian dress they expect them to take off their hats and to be treated with the same marks of respect as are shown to men of quality in their own country the awful manner in which the persians treat their superiors in rank scarce having any voice or opinion whilst in their presence is a specimen of the genuine growth of arbitrary power and a despotic invasion of the common sense as well as the common liberty of mankind  upon any occasion of mourning or rejoicing the persians never fail to visit each other and people of condition always expect the compliments of their dependants on such occasions they are introduced into a large hall where coffee and tobacco is set before them and with which they refresh themselves till the great man appears as soon as they see him every man rises up and stands in his place having bowed to them as he passes by every one bows much lower to him again and after he has taken his seat he makes a sign to the company to sit if the master of the house be already in his hall the visitor comes in softly and stepping to the next vacant place stands gravely with his feet close together and his hands across till the master of the house makes a sign to him to sit down if a person receives a visit from a superior he acts different from the english custom in placing him on the right hand it being a mark of respect in persia to place a person on the left hand  the persians are not much addicted to gaming indeed most of the scrupulous ones consider all games of chance to be unlawful but there are those who play at cards dice tables chess and other games not in use among us the king and persons of rank divert themselves sometimes with the fights of wild beasts as in india and the common people are amused at times with tumblers ropedancers and jugglers as with us they have also martial and rural amusements the former i will speak of by and by the latter consists in hunting and coursing  their greyhounds are something like our irish greyhounds but the stags and antelopes they course are so swift of foot that the dogs cannot come up with them without the assistance of hawks of which they have various kinds brought from circassia muscovy and the northern parts of the empire these hawks are taught not only to fly at partridges quails rabbits hares etc but even at deer and wild beasts and to train them up to this they stuff the skin of these animals fasten a piece of flesh on the head of it with which they feed the hawk drawing the stuffed skin along upon wheels to use them to fix themselves on the head whilst it moves when they have used the young hawk to this for some time they carry him to the sport with some old staunch hawk that is used to the game the dogs being let loose the hawks are soon after thrown off who pursue the deer fastening on its nose striking their talons into the flesh and keep beating their wings about his head so that he cannot see his way and thus gives the dogs an opportunity to come up with him the gentlemen usually carry a little kettledrum at their saddlebow to call off their hawks some of them it is said have formerly been taught to fly at men chardin tells us that the governor of tauris whom he was particularly acquainted with used to divert himself with this sport sometimes not sparing even his friends that one day he let his hawks fly at a gentleman and they tore his face and eyes in that manner that he died of it which the king being made acquainted with resented it so far that he turned him out of office  when the king or the great omrahs or lords go a hunting the country people for ten or fifteen leagues round are ordered to drive all the wild beasts and game into a certain place surrounded with strong nets or fences and when thus enclosed every one of the company shoots at which he pleases and a horrible slaughter is made of them many hundreds are often killed at one of these hunting matches but they usually wait till the men of the greatest rank in the field come up and discharges an arrow after which every one shoots as fast as he can there being a strange medley of deer antelopes wild hogs wolves foxes hares etc all driven in a crowd together as for hounds and hunting by scent they know nothing of it indeed their country seems too dry for this kind of sport even had they proper dogs they frequently however train up panthers and leopards to hunt the game or rather to surprise it for these animals creep from one cover to another till they can jump upon their prey as a cat does on a mouse but never run after it in a continued course  about astrabd the peasants support themselves by catching wild ducks they go in boats on the caspian during the night near the marshy banks which are covered with rushes and carry great lights on the stern then ringing a number of small bells the birds are confounded and fly to their very hands  music seems to be no part of their genius both singing and dancing are considered in persia as disgraceful people of condition will not suffer their children to learn either the one or the other but it is left almost entirely as it is all over the east to common wenches and prostitutes it is reckoned an indecency in people of any reputation to sing and would render a man contemptible who should attempt it in company they call their singingwomen caine intimating that they derive their skill from the daughters of cain who they pretend were the first inventors of singing and music in the east they sing and play by rule though they make but poor harmony at least such as is pleasing to an european ear yet they are much delighted with our music there is no such thing as singing in parts but sing one after another and generally to some strung instrument as the lute or the viol their men sing better than the women but there are not many of them that practice it music being prohibited by their religion their ecclesiastics and devotees will not so much as be present at such entertainments which is one reason that the science is not arrived at a greater perfection there they have a great number of instruments both of strung and wind music some in shape like our hautboys and flutes others like the viol harp virginals kettledrum and trumpet but the strings of their instruments are not made of gut touching any thing belonging to a dead animal especially the entrails being held a pollution the strings therefore are made of twisted silk or brasswire  their trumpet is the most monstrous instrument for size and sound that can be met with it is commonly seven or eight feet long and proportionably wide at the great end and as much as a man can hold up these and their drums in a manner drown all other sounds and indeed their music as it is called serves chiefly instead of clocks to let people know the time of day or night sounding constantly at certain hours bells they have none and when the king or any great man goes out of his palace notice is always given of it by the sound of drums and trumpets placed over the palacegates or in some balcony or gallery and their noise is so great that it may be heard at a vast distance in some places music and dancing girls make part of a great mans equipage and run before him when he goes abroad but in general the performers are a ragged strolling rabble and except some of the kings are scarce worth hearing however on any festival as the circumcising of a child or other joyful occasion they come and play before peoples doors and usually have something given them for their pains  hanway says that the kings secretary invited him at amul where there is a palace and which city is said to have been founded upwards of  000 years to hear his music of which one instrument resembled a flute another a kettledrum and a third a guitar to which an old man and two boys sung and danced the boys moved their heads legs and arms whilst singing in a very extravagant manner a priest was next sent for remarkable for being a good singer and this man raised his voice to a degree of amazement his quavers were mixed with a very harsh guttural sound and the distortions of his visage such as created rather horror than delight  i will take the opportunity here of saying something of their mode of traveling there are no wheelcarriages in this country but all persons travel on camels horses mules or asses the women who are to be concealed as much as possible are put into a square wooden machine a kind of covered chair called kedgavay about three feet deep and just high enough for a person to sit down in over head are three or four hoops like those which support the tilt of a wagon with a cloth thrown over them these are hung over the back of a camel like a pair of paniers their asses are much larger and swifter of foot than ours and will trot ten miles at a pretty good rate but are very obstinate and unlucky and frequently throw their riders but if travelers have any great distance to go they perform their journey with caravans or cafilas as they are called in persia a cafila is composed of camels horses and mules the whole of which are under the direction of a cheharwa dar or master it is to him the price of a mule or camel is paid and he stipulates with the traveller to feed and take care of the beast during the journey he has under him several inferior servants who help to unload the beasts of burden water them and attend them whilst on the journeys the cafila keeps as close as possible and on its arrival at munzil gah or place of encampment for the day each load is deposited on a particular spot marked out by the master to which the merchant who owns the goods repairs his luggage forms a crescent in the center are placed the bedding and provisions a rope or line made of hair is then drawn round the whole at the distance of about three yards each way which serves to distinguish the separate encampments during the night the beasts are all brought to their stations opposite to the goods they are to carry in the morning and are made fast to the hairrope above mentioned at the hour of moving which is generally between three and four in the morning they load the mules and camels and the passengers are awakened by the jingling of the bells tied round the necks of the beasts in order to prevent their straggling during their march when all things are ready the master orders those nearest the road to advance and the whole moves off in regular succession where there are caravanseras travelers find their lodging gratis and can there purchase provisions at the best hand  though the roads in this country are steep and mountainous yet such care is taken in laying bridges and causeways and to level and open the ways that a traveller seldom meets with any difficulties but what are easily surmounted  here are no general posts but if any person has letters to send he dispatches a shater or footman express who will travel a thousand miles in    or  0 days and not ask more than  0 d or   s a day english they carry with them a bottle of water and a little bag of provision and this serves them for thirty or forty hours they generally leave the high road and cross the country the nearest way there are families which make this their only employment and breed their children up to it practicing them to run from their infancy  the king and all the great men have several of these shaters or runningfootmen in their retinue but before a man can be admitted one of the kings footmen he must give sufficient proof that he wants neither heels nor breath for he must run from the great gate of the palace to a place a league and a half from the city twelve times in one day and each time bring an arrow which is delivered him by those who stand at the end of the race to show he has run the whole course and this he performs between the rising and setting of the sun being no less than a hundred and eight miles it is always some favorite servant of the kings who is admitted to this honor on the day of trial the elephants and horsemen are drawn up in the royal square with drums and trumpets sounding as if it were some festival the great men give presents to the shater and some ride the course with him to ingratiate themselves with the prince and the mob hail him every time he returns with shouts and acclamations the chams and viceroys who admit of a shater into their service make him run the same number of miles and they are caressed and presented by all their dependants in the same manner the kings shaters are though not so largely for it is usual for the shater to receive a thousand pounds on such an occasion  chap vi of their marriages births funerals etc as the women are never to be seen in persia a man is obliged to be contented with such an account of his mistresss beauty and accomplishments as he receives from others they are allowed four legal wives with whom they may enter into formal contracts before the civil magistrate who is also an ecclesiastic but they are generally contented with one and she seems to be taken on political views on account of the distinction or interest of her family or to serve as a governess or mistress to the rest of the women who wait upon her and rank only as concubines notwithstanding they have the honor of their masters bed and their issue are equally legitimate for there is no such thing as a bastard in persia those born before and those after marriage have the same privileges nor is it any disavantage to a son in regard to his inheritance to be born of a concubine or even of a black slave  love is the least motive for entering into a contract with a lawful wife as she is called especially among the great nor does she expect much of it but it is the number of slaves the clothes the equipage and figure the man makes in the world which are the great inducements for a woman or her friends to ally herself to any family if the wife is so unfortunate as to be in love with her husband she is usually very unhappy for she will frequently have the mortification of seeing him leave her bed for that of a slave and perhaps for a common strumpet and in return for her passion may possibly be presented with the venereal disease and if she shows any resentment will probably see another wife introduced into the house to govern in her stead for if a man should be discontented with his wife after marriage which is sometimes the case here as in other countries he is at liberty to divorce her a man being always by the mahomedan law enabled to put away his wife at discretion this is performed by giving her every thing he had previous to the marriage which after her death goes to her children if she has any and by redemanding the contract of his wifes relations the ceremony of divorce is called by the persians telaak if again after the divorce the husband should be inclined to take his wife back he is at liberty so to do and this for three times successively and when it so happens the contract must be renewed each time but after the third time he is expressly forbidden to remarry the same woman but it seldom happens that a man who is divorced from his wife is inclined to take her back again those who do so being in little estimation with their neighbors and with respect to the number of wives a man has that person is most esteemed who attaches himself to one  contracts of marriage in persia as well as in many other places in the east are often made between families at a very early period and although consummation does not take place till many years after yet the woman contracted cannot divorce herself or be absolved from the contract unless with the consent of her betrothed husband except on forfeiture of a considerable sum of money the same also binding on the part of the man  the usual suggestions for a woman to obtain a divorce are that her husband is impotent or spends too much of his time with his female slaves and concubines and does not pay her attention sufficient in either of which cases the magistrate will grant a divorce and both parties are at liberty to marry elsewhere  a widow is obliged to wait four months after the death of her husband before she is permitted by law to marry again but the concubine of a person deceased may go to another as soon as she pleases  when the parents of a young man have determined upon marrying him they look out amongst their kindred and acquaintances for a suitable match having succeeded the young mans father mother or sister assemble a company of their friends and go to the young womans house and propose the match if her father approves the proposals as a token of compliance he orders sweetmeats to be brought in and the company at that time take their leave some days after the females of the mans family assemble at the house of the intended bride when the terms of marriage are settled and the customary presents on the part of the bridegroom promised these if the person be in middling circumstances generally consist of two complete suits of apparel of the best kind a ring a lookingglass a small sum of money about ten or twelve tomans which sum is called mehr a kaween or the marriageportion it being given for the express purpose of providing for the wife in case of a divorce there is also provided a quantity of household furniture of all sorts as carpets matts bedding kitchenutensils etc after this a writing or contract is drawn up in the presence of and witnessed by the cadi or magistrate or in his absence by an akhund or priest which is signed and sealed and deposited in the hands of the brides father this ceremony being finished the marriage by the mahomedan law is deemed perfect but prior to the contract the person of the man is examined by the parents or friends of the woman and that of the woman by the mother or other relations of the man nothing now remains but to celebrate the wedding which generally takes place the second or third day after signing the contract the night before the wedding the friends and relations of the bride assemble at her house attended by music dancing girls and other signs of festivity this night is distinguished by the appellation of sheb hinna bundee or the night on which the hands and feet of the bride are stained with the herb of hinna well known all over the east previous to the ceremony a large quantity of this herb is sent by the bridegroom to the house of the bride and on the day of staining she is first conveyed to the bath where having bathed she is brought back to her own house and her hands and feet are stained with hinna and her eyebrows and forehead painted with the antimony powder called surma this being finished the remains of the herb are sent back to the bridegroom where the like operation is performed upon him by her friends the wedding night being come the friends of both parties men and women assemble at the house of the bride in order to convey her to her husband they are attended with all sorts of music singers and dancing girls and all are dressed in their smartest apparel each of the women having on a veil of red silk the presents which the bridegroom has made are all put into trays covered with red silk and carried on mens shoulders after waiting at the door for some time the bride is brought forth covered from head to foot in a veil of red silk or painted muslin a horse is then presented for her to mount sent by the bridegroom and when mounted a large lookingglass is held before her by one of the bridemaids all the way to the house of her husband as an admonition that it is the last time she will look into a glass as a virgin being now about to enter into the cares of the married state the procession then sets forward in the following order first the music and dancing girls next the presents on mens shoulders then follow the relations and friends of the bridegroom all shouting and making a great noise next to these comes the bride surrounded by all her female friends and relations one of whom leads the horse by the bridle being arrived at the house of her husband they are met at the door by his father and mother and from thence conducted up stairs the bride then enters the room and the bridegroom who is at the upper end makes a low obeisance and then advances takes her in his arms and embraces her soon after they retire to a private chamber and on their return to the company it causes great rejoicing all then sit down to supper in separate apartments the men eating with the bridegroom in one room and the women with the bride in another the supper is prolonged to a late hour in the night with cheerfulness and festive mirth and the rejoicings continue eight or ten days  the armenians who were originally of the greek church though now differing a little from it are subjects of persia marry their children usually in their infancy to prevent their being carried into the harams of the great men for either the persians are so just as not to take any mans wife from him or too nice to take women who have been in the possession of another but though the parties are frequently contracted at four or five years of age the marriage is seldom celebrated till they are eight or ten and the bridegroom every year at easter sends the bride a fine vest suitable to her rank that is the parents transact all these matters among themselves the consent of the young people being asked only for form sake when they are brought to church  on the day of marriage the bridegroom being richly dressed mounts his horse and attended by his nearest relations comes to the house of the brides father when she also gets on horseback being dressed in the finest silks but covered with a veil and accompanied by her friends and relations with lighted torches in their hands proceeds to the church being alighted from their horses the bride and bridegroom go up to the altar where standing pretty close together face to face the bishop resting his book upon their heads reads the service and having received their consent gives them his blessing whereupon the drums and trumpets sound the music plays and they return to the bridegrooms house in the same order as they came unless they hear mass and receive the sacrament as they frequently do on these occasions for then the bride is carried back to her fathers house and the wedding is not consummated till some days after the guests are splendidly entertained on these occasions as in other countries only that the men and women eat and drink in separate rooms in the evening the bride and bridegroom are conducted to the nuptial chamber and the company retire after a profusion of rose water being thrown about and a thousand wishes for the happiness of the newmarried couple  some days after the wedding the bridal portion is sent to the husbands house consisting of fine clothes gold silver and jewels according to the rank of the parties some choice fruits and sweetmeats are usually added all carried in fine boxes and cabinets attended by such music as the country affords  there is still another people in persia who go under the name of christians but whose religion seems to be composed of christianity judaism and mahomedanism they are called christians of st john and inhabit near the gulf of persia in the province of chusistan where it is computed there are not less than  0000 families of them their marriages if travelers do not impose upon us have something very particular in them but as all who speak of this people agree in their accounts i will venture to give the relation as i find it it seems the priests and relations of the bridegroom go in the first place and demand of the bride whether she be a virgin if she answers yes they make her swear to it and not contented with this she undergoes an examination by the priests wife afterward the bride and bridegroom are brought to a river where the priest baptizes them then the bridegroom leads the bride home to his house where being seated close together the priest reads a long service upon the occasion he next takes a book of divination and casts lots to discover the happy hour for consummation the bridegroom having bedded his spouse goes with her to the bishop acknowledges that he is satisfied of his wifes virtue and the bishop in consequence performs the remainder of the marriage ceremony putting rings on their fingers and baptizing them again but if the husband will not vouch for the honor and virtue of his wife the bishop will have no concern in the celebration of the marriage but leaves it to an inferior priest and the woman loses her reputation  at the naming of children among the persians the following ceremony is observed the third birthday after the child is born the friends of the lyingin woman assemble at her house attended by  and dancing girls hired for the occasion after playing and dancing some time a mullah or priest is introduced who taking the child in his arms demands of the mother what name she chooses the infant should be called by being told he begins praying and after a short  wpers in the childs ears telling it distinctly three times and calling it by its name to remember and be obedient to its father and mother to venerate the koran and the prophet to abstain from those things that are unlawful and practice those things which are good and virtuous having repeated the mahomedan profession of faith he redelivers the child to its mother after which the company are entertained with sweetmeats and refreshments a part of which the females carry away with them in their pockets firmly believing it will be the means of their having children themselves  the ceremony of the sunnut or circumcision is generally performed within  0 days from the birth of the child as being the safest time but it is unlawful if not performed before the boy is fourteen years old the operation is performed by a barber with a razor there being no surgeons in persia after the jewish ritual and in the manner practiced by the mussulmen in india and at such times the parents of the child invite their friends to an entertainment sir john chardin says that in some parts of persia they circumcise old women with great men this ceremony is uncommonly splendid mr franklin tells us he was an eyewitness of the rejoicings made by the inhabitants of shirauz in honor of the king of persias son who was circumcised on the   th of april       on the  0th great preparations having previously been made the bazars or covered marketplaces were splendidly illuminated particularly the grand bazar which was adorned throughout with lustres of partycolored lamps suspended from the roof about half way down the shops of the merchants on each side were dressed out in great finery with silver paper rich hangings etc the walls on each side to a considerable height covered with tapestry lookingglasses and many paintings done in the persian style most of them representing the ancient kings of persia and india in the different dresses of their respective countries as well as designs taken from their admired poets bands of music and dancing women were constantly performing night and day throughout the different bazars on scaffoldings erected for that purpose and the whole was a scene of festivity for seven days and as many nights among several ingenious things observable on this occasion the sight presented at the arsenal was most worthy of notice in the center of this building the armourers had suspended in the air a brassmortar of  00 lb by some hidden means as nothing appeared to support it either above or below the only visible thing being a number of colored bottles sticking to it as if to keep it buoyant in the atmosphere i was told however says mr franklin that it was effected by means of a wire passed from the roof of the place to the mouth of the mortar but not being visible to the spectators it gave it a very ingenious effect the decorations on this occasion cost the shopkeepers and tradesmen considerable sums as besides the illumination they were obliged to make a handsome pieshcush or present to the king and his son who also on this occasion gave a grand entertainment in the citadel to which the principle men in the city were invited and the whole was concluded by a magnificent display of fireworks  the funerals of the persians are conducted in a similar manner to those in other mahomedan countries on the death of a mussulman the relations and friends of the deceased being assembled make loud lamentations over the corpse they are generally interred the evening of the day on which they die they are always washed before they are buried for this purpose there are reservoirs but the poorer sort are commonly taken to the nearest pond being washed the body is wound up in a cotton cloth on which are stamped several passages of the koran and it is thus carried to a place of interment attended by some of the relations of the deceased and a priest singing some parts of the koran all the way to the grave should any mussulman chance to meet the corpse during the procession he is obliged by the precepts of his religion to run up to the bier and offer his assistance to carry it crying out at the same time lah illah ill lillah that is there is no god but god after the interment the relations of the deceased return home and the women of the family make a mixture of wheat honey and spices which they eat in memory of the deceased sending a part of it to their friends and acquaintance that they also may pay him a like honor this custom seems to be derived from very great antiquity for we read in homer of sacrifices and libations being frequently made to the memory of departed souls  chap vii of their trade and manufactures manufactures and trade are at present greatly decayed in persia owing to the long civil wars but as the persians are very ingenious industrious and of quick capacities there is little doubt but if a regular and permanent government was once again to be established they would flourish as other nations do they work in fillagree and ivory remarkably well and are good turners at shirauz they have a glass manufactory where they cast great quantities and convey it to all parts of persia they have neither iron brass nor pewter in their kitchenfurniture most of their utensils being copper tinned and their braziers and tinmen are good workmen  kom is remarkable for excellent swordblades and their armourers damask them as well as any european their firearms are but ill contrived and the locks are made by europeans the persians not having ingenuity sufficient to make these any more than clocks and watches which they purchase from other countries but all sorts of cutlery goods they are expert in the art of making lookingglasses they do not understand but use little unequal steel mirrors which owing to the dryness of the air seldom rust or grow dull as the use of the bow is what they value themselves much upon no country produces better they are made of wood and horn bound round with sinews and painted as fine as possible the bowstring is made of twisted silk the size of a goosequill and their quivers are leather worked with silk or embroidered  embroidery they excel in both in gold and silver either on cloth silk or leather they almost cover their saddles and housings with it and their stitching of leather is beyond any thing we can do they ride with their stirrups short and where we use brasses about the trappings of our horses their men of rank have gold  silks are the principal manufacture of the country wrought and unwrought the wrought are taffeties tabbies satins and silk mixed with cotton or camels and goats hair brocades and gold tissue of brocades they have a hundred sorts some of them the richest any where met with and the gold velvet here wrought is admirable all their rich stuffs are very durable the gold and silver does not wear off or tarnish whilst the stuff lasts but keeps its color and brightness the finest looms for these stuffs are at ispahan cashan and yesd the turkey carpets which we have in england and the turkey leather are both made in persia but called turkey because they are brought to us through that country shagreen comes also from persia which chardin says is made of the skin of an asss rump camelhair stuffs are made in carmenia these are as soft and smooth and almost as fine as those made of beaver wool but are not very strong there is some calicoe here which they figure and dye but they are not equal to the india callicoes  earthenware is another manufacture in which the persians excel much beyond the dutch some say it is equal to china their gold wiredrawers and threadtwisters are capital in their way chardin says they will draw a dram weight of gold into a wire  00 yards long their dying is preferable to any thing of the kind in europe but this is not so much ascribed to the artist as the air which being as i have observed uncommonly dry and clear gives a brightness to the colors and fixes them  persian tailors work very neatly and as the mens clothes are made of the richest flowered and brocaded silks which they make to fit so very exact as to do them great credit their sewing is incomparably beyond any thing we can boast of they work flowers also upon their carpets cushions and windowcurtains so well that they seem as if painted with the tailors we must not forget to mention their barbers who are no less excellent in their way for they will shave the head almost at halfadozen strokes and have so light a hand that you scarce feel them they use only cold water and hold no basin under the chin but have their water in a cup like a teacup after they shaved a man they cut the nails of his feet and hands with a little iron instrument like a bodkin sharp at the end which done they rub and chafe his flesh and stretch his arms a refreshment which is as agreeable to europeans as the natives in this hot country  the goldsmiths in persia are bunglers they do best in filligree work they also make stonerings and engrave tolerably watches and clockwork they are totally ignorant of or any thing which requires springs  paper is made of rags silk and cotton is very thin smooth and will bear but on one side it is not so white as ours nor in any respect comparable to it their ink is made of galls vitriol the rind of the pomegranate with burnt rice powdered which being made into a cake is dissolved in gum instead of quills they use a reed somewhat larger than a quill their characters are arabic the mahomedans consider paper as sacred think it wrong in any one to burn or tear it or put it to any improper use for say they the name of god may be written on it and it would be impious to profane it if it be not written on it is designed they say for writing matters on which concern religion the laws either divine and human and other venerable purposes and ought not to be put to common use  they have not the art of printing all their books are manuscript and writing is considered as a liberal art in their rings they wear agates which serve for seals and on which is often engraved a verse from the koran  trade in persia is generally carried on by brokers and stockjobbers who are a very cunning subtle geneneration after they have agreed at the sellers house they ascertain the price with their fingers putting their hands under a cloth the end of the finger stands for one the bent finger for five and the strait for ten the hand open for a hundred and if shut a thousand during this reckoning they carry so steady a countenance as to render it impossible for a stranger to gather any thing from it the mahomedans though possessed of the governing part of the country are not the greatest foreign traders the armenians engage the european trade for the religion of the mahomedan persians forbids them to touch the food or even the persons of those whom they look upon to be polluted government find themselves under a necessity to protect and encourage their christian subjects for they value their foreign trade and the revenue attendant on it of course suffer them to live happy and easy toward georgia are many christians and the great towns of julpha and ispahan are inhabited altogether by christians but of all nations the russians are most advantageously situated to trade with persia the intestine broils of that country have often contributed to its advantage for besides cloth and other european goods the russians export red leather furs etc and receive in return rawsilk hence arose their jealousy of the british traders for the russian merchants particularly those of moscow and the trading towns on the wolga no sooner observed that the persian markets were glutted with european goods by the russian company of england than they began to murmur resolving to make remonstrances to the court on the subject the armenians extended their trade to the north of persia far beyond the russians for by means of their credit in holland joined to their own capitals they employed in commerce about  00000 l this stock was even insufficient to support them for the excessive glut of the market in ghilan and the terrible oppression of the persian government stopped the circulation of their trade and consequently sunk their credit in holland at length they were all constrained to abandon persia and in      they retired to astrachan to wait with their effects till there should be a fair opportunity of returning thither whilst the russia company were in security they could not be insensible of the benefits of buying rawsilk of the peasants of ghilan but advantages may be overrated and cease to be such when attended with vexations and inconvenience like those which the caspian traders experienced  it was not however the less ungrateful to observe the armenians a people in themselves despicable and of no consequence to russia in competition with the british nation supported and protected in this trade when measures were so apparently taken to wrest it from the english  the russians do indeed allege that many of these armenians are subjects of their country and it is true in general that such of them as are engaged in the caspian trade do put themselves under the protection of that empire these people are educated in all the servilities of asia and understanding how to accommodate themselves to indignities which the genius of a free nation will hardly submit to are in some measure the better qualified to carry on a commerce through foreign dominions the commencement of our traffic with persia happened in      in the third year of the reign of queen elizabeth and factories were first established at shirvan in      the turks conquered the western coasts of the caspian sea and in great measure prevented the advancement of that commerce which the merchants naturally flattered themselves would happen in consequence of a favorable decree obtained from abdallah khan then king of shirvan and hyrcania which last is now called ghilan several english merchants were employed in this traffic of whom one thomas alcocke was murdered in persia afterward christopher borough went into persia in      and returned home in      he built a vessel on the wolga at niezarovogorode in which he transported several kinds of merchandise as far as baku at niezabad his vessel was stranded and great part of his cargo lost at derbend he sold a part of his goods to the turks and bought another vessel to bring home his returns of raw silk but either through want of experience or constrained by necessity he came to russia so late as the month of november which occasioned his ship to be cut to pieces by the ice the cargo however was saved in a boat which floating out to sea with the ice and being in great danger of perishing was at length frozen up the crew left their boat and the cargo and went in search of assistance but losing their way their lives were much endangered by hunger as well as by a shower of arrows from a flying party of najai tartars at last they had the good fortune to bring their cargo safe to astrachan and thus ended the british caspian commerce  occasional voyages have since been made by british subjects under the russian protection in the close of the last century but not with any view of establishing trade  i shall finish this short view of the trade of persia by giving a general idea of the different kinds of european goods which the russians and armenians now send into the northern provinces of that kingdom the chief demand next to dutch cloth is for british woollens gloucester and ordinary yorkshire cloths likewise indigo cochineal and in good times rick silks gold and silver lace velvets and other rich manufactures  with regard to the quantity of goods imported by the persians over the caspian sea whilst the port of gombroon was open to the several nations of europe the caspian traders could but ill form an idea of the general consumption in that kingdom the russian company was the mere sanguine in it is expectations from a knowledge that in the beginning of this century the factors of the east india company had extended their trade as far as tauris on the westerncoast of the caspian where they sold great quantities of the woollen manufactures of great britain but when the british factors of ghilan whose situation was now so much more advantageous would have made an experiment of the like nature they discovered that city and it is confines in so ruinous a state as blasted their hopes of doing any business in those quarters  when persia enjoyed repose the agent of the east india company of england lived in splendour the regal government being held in great veneration in that empire he acted as immediately under the crown of england and from thence derived an influence which he could not otherwise have possessed his pompous manner of living had some good effects but the expense was too considerable to be long grateful to the company  the advantages which the east india company of england enjoyed beyond the russia company were such as will hardly admit of a comparison nor indeed is it material to my present purpose i shall pass over in silence the trade of great britain to the gulf of persia as also that between persia and india observing only that after the portuguese had settled themselves in the east indies they took the island of ormu and being masters of the sea carried on the trade between those countries  chap xlviii of their army and navy the standing forces of persia were never fixed at any determinate number but were computed in the reign of nadir at  00000 men besides attendants the pay given to soldiers was about  00 crowns a year one with another besides the allowance which chiefly consisted of rice but the dearness of provision and the expensive manner of living in camp rendered this large pay absolutely neceessary it has been observed that soldiers generally fight best when they have something to lose if their wealth does not involve them in effeminacy alexander encouraged the macedonians by representing the persian riches as an object of plunder and consequently as a motive to exert themselves but under nadir we do not find that any of their enemies considered the valuable effects of the persian soldiery in that light this method served also to keep them dependant by their being obliged to spend their money in articles of vanity the late king of portugal john i humbled his nobility by indulging their pride and other christian princes have done the same by their subjects with great success the riches of a shahs camp consist in horsefurniture nadir says hanway had four complete sets one mounted with pearls another with rubies a third with emeralds and the last with diamonds most of which were of so prodigious a size as hardly to merit belief for many of them appeared as large as a pidgeons egg franklin speaks of a famous jewel of nadir shahs called dereau nour which has been carried out of persia by some armenian merchants and sold to the empress of russia for eighty thousand pounds beautiful as their diamonds are their luster is greatly lost by the barbarous manner in which they are set some of them are bored through after the manner of the asiatics who often spoil their precious stones by this method  it is usual with the persian kings to encourage the army in the use of costly furniture the officers and even soldiers of rank have the bridles of their horses mounted with silver with a manepiece of plate and an ornamental chain likewise their sword belts and other accoutrements are mounted with the same metal the handles of their battleaxes are studded or covered with thin silverplates and in their sashes about their waist they wear a knife the handle and case of which is covered with silver but the workmanship is bad officers and persons of distinction are obliged to wear goldcased knives and some of the great men have silver stirrups nadir particularly encouraged expensive ornaments among the soldiers he had the policy to oblige some by presents which led to a general vanity throughout his army for all were desirous of costly trappings and readily expened their money to gain the good opinion of their commander  the persian troops not being incumbered with bagbage or artillery make prodigious swift marches and fall upon the enemy in their camp with incredible fury when they least suspect such a visit at other times they will cut off their provisions and turn the waters from their usual course and having harrassed them through a desert country attack them when they are fatigued and weary when an enemy makes head against them they will fly till they have got an advantageous ground and then return and charge again like the parthians they shoot more arrows in their retreat than when they advance they never throw intrenchments round their camps but choose a mountain or difficult pass for that purpose but in sieges they entrench and usually take a place by undermining it and it is thought no people understand mining or subterraneous works better than the persians  in their camps a general regularity is observed as far as is agreeable to the size and shape of the ground it being a rule constantly pursued to place the tents of certain principal ministers and officers in the front or to the right or left of the shahs quarters that some of them may be always near him the circuit of the quarter allotted to the shahs own tents is very large the entrance consists on one side of a line of uniform tents serving for guardrooms and on the other of the tents in which the affairs of chancery and the like public concerns are transacted about  00 yards beyond this avenue is the pavillion in which the shan usually sits to give audience and transact business it is generally oblong supported by three poles with gilded balls at the top the covering of a cotton cloth of a brickcolour and the lining of clouded silk the floor covered either with carpet or cloths and the body of the pavillion having on each side a kind of alley through which the attendants walk round sometimes the shah sits upon a large sopha or chair crossleggd and sometimes on the floor the hindpart of his tent is divided into small apartments where the officers who do not appear in his majestys presence attend there is nothing sumptuous in this pavilion the front of which is always open even in the worst of weather when it is extremely cold several pots of lighted charcoal are placed in the middle at a considerable distance behind are placed the shahs private tents to some of which he retires at his meals and in order to render them warm there are indian pannels which are occasionally set up but to these he only admitts his secret emissaries when they have any remarkable intelligence to communicate contiguous to these are the tents of the shahs ladies which differ from the others in having several curtains that form separate apartments one without another the boundaries of the shahs quarters are generally occupied by his eunuchs and female slaves and almost this whole circuit particularly toward the residence of the women are surrounded by a strong fence of network round which the nightguard patroles and severely punishes all intruders as there are no lights in these parts nor any tents near them it frequently happens that people who coming to the camp by night ignorantly straggle thither are sure to be illtreated when that happens none but officers in immediate waiting are permitted to enter the royal pavilion the officers of state and people in business stand in the open air in all weathers forming a semicircle in front of the tent if they are brought to answer for their conduct they are held under the arm by a proper officer to prevent their escape or committing any other acts of violence the same ceremony is observed toward foreign ambassadors and great men under pretense of respect but in truth it is done to prevent any accident or attempt being made on the shahs life the tents of persons of distinction are for the most part oblong and are supported by three poles the outside of coarse cotton cloth which is glazed to prevent the rain from penetrating the inside lined with woollen or silk according to the different seasons of the year and the circumstances of the owner the ground is spread with a thick cotton cloth or matt and over that is laid a carpet or woollen printed cloth of several colors and of british manufacture besides this the floor is laid with felts which supply the place of bedsteads and featherbeds though some have their beds raised above the ground to avoid the damps the top and sides of the tents of great officers are sometimes lined with pannels on which flowers and a variety of figures are wrought the back is appropriated for women but such grandees as have several women place a set of tents at a distance from their own which are surrounded with cottoncloths to prevent their being seen the part of the camp called the camp market begins at the end of the square fronting the guardroom and is near half a mile long it consists of tents on each side like a street running as direct as the nature of the ground will admit the tents are filled with provisions apparel horsefurniture and other necessaries brought for sale together with a vast property arising from the daily confiscations of the shah the care of the market is committed to an officer who rides up and down to keep order and when any disputes arise they are brought before the deroga bazar or superintendant of the market who acquires a considerable income from rents fees presents and extortions the shopkeepers are little better than common sutlers but such as carry on great business are under the protection of the principal courtiers who are the grand dealers in flower of rice of which there is always a great consumption and as these courtiers have frequently supernumerary servants camels and mules they send them to the distant provinces that produce rice which they bring to the camp for sale and make great profits but if the shopkeepers or traders interfere with them in these branches of trade they generally mark them for destruction nadir used frequently to enquire the price of necessaries reduced them as he thought proper and fined the marketpeople upon every transgression but the most notorious instance of injustice to shopkeepers was his obliging them when his tents and their appurtenances were grown old to take them and pay him the value of new ones  we having had frequent occasion to mention this wonderful tyrant nadir the reader will not be displeased to have a slight sketch of his character and remarkable exploits particularly as he has been considered by all the world as a second alexander it will serve to enliven and relieve the mind from the tediousness of dry description and give a further insight into his military conduct  tohmas kouli khan or as he afterward called himself nadir shah was born in the year      at a village or more probably in a tent a few days journey to the south east of mesched not far from kaelat he was descended from the affhars a tribe of tartars subject to persia that live by husbandry and supply the persians with horses and cattle nadirs father earned his bread by making caps and sheepskin coats which is the apparel of the lowest order of common people in persia nadir was bred to no other employment than that of a shepherd and being only thirteen years of age when his father died was left in so poor a condition that he was obliged to gather sticks in woods for the support of himself and mother and carry them to market on an ass and a camel which were his only patrimony  it is recorded of him that when he returned in triumph from his conquest of india he chanced to pass the place of his nativity where he made a set speech to his chief captains and particularly mentioned his fathers camel concluding to this effect you now see to what a height it has pleased the almighty to exalt me from hence learn not to despise men of low estate when he was seventeen or eighten years of age the ousbec or usbec tartars made an invasion into khorasan or chorassan they put many of the inhabitants to the sword and reduced others to slavery among the last nadir kouli and his mother she died in captivity but he made his escape in   0  and returned to chorassan from this time we hear no more of him till with some of his companions he stole a flock of sheep the money which this produced enabled him to retire to the mountains he however did not continue the profession of a robber but entered into the service of a bey or lord by whom he was employed as a courier and was once sent with dispatches of importance to the persian court of ispahan in company with another courier whether nadir was ambitious of being the sole carrier of these dispatches or whether his fellowcourier did not travel fast enough or for what other secret reason it is unknown but he killed him after his arrival at ispahan he told his story so well as to procure admittance to the ministers of shah sultan hussein to whom he assigned such plausible reasons for his conduct on the road that he was not only acquitted but received presents and was sent back with answers to the letters he had brought his master received him with such a countenance as gave reason to suspect he meditated his destruction nadir perceived it and resolved to kill him also and he was the more induced to this from a violent passion he had conceived for his daughter whom he had demanded in marriage but was refused after the murder was perpetrated he took the lady away and retired to the mountains the effect of this enterprise was the birth of riza kouli myrza whose genius and disposition so much resembled his fathers this action acquired him the reputation of courage and being joined by some of the domestics of his late master he became a robber and continued so for some time at length he offered his services to babulu khan governor of chorassan by whom he was accepted in the capacity of gentleman usher  it may appear strange that the chief of a gang of robbers should have an honorable office bestowed on him by the governor of a province but when it is considered that personal courage was the greatest recommendation and more prevalent than virtue or any polite accomplishments it may somewhat reconcile the conduct of the governor of chorassan in      the distresses of persia began to increase and he had not been long in the service of babulu khan before the command of an army was given him to proceed against the tartars who were making vast inroads on the frontiers of chorassan many of the officers refused to serve under their new general and their places were filled by those whom nadir approved of  nadir was successful in his expedition and elated with victory returned in triumph to mesched where he was received with joy the fire of his ambition blazed and he demanded to be confirmed in his office of general under the command of babulu khan who assured him he would write to the court in his favor and that nothing should be wanting on his part to reward his merit whether babulu khan deceived him or whether the weak administration of shah sultan hussein evaded the promotion of nadir is uncertain but he retired from mesched with chagrin and sought new adventures after having been beaten on the soles of his feet by order of the khan for abusing the governor declaring it his opinion that he had not acted as a man of honor nadir was again turned loose into the world and sought to retrieve his fortunes and to obtain revenge but we shall pass over the various and many wonderful vicissitudes of his life and give only his general character and a few of his transactions after he was created king  nadir had always an eye to the crown but to acquire it he found it necessary to wear an appearance of justice for the distraction he had occasioned in persia by his conquests and cruelties left him with very few friends whom he could trust but his own relations and those whom he had exalted to the principal posts were true to the cause he had undertaken by his artifice he deposed the reigning shah under the pretense of his incapacity to govern and crowned the shahs son an infant in the cradle and having corrupted the principal officers of state as well as his own generals he called an assembly the next day and harrangued them declaring the insufficiency of the shah toehmas whom he advised to be dethroned and his son immediately crowned the discourse met with the applause his most sanguine expectations could suggest from those who were entirely his creatures shah toehmas was declared incapable of holding the reins of government the young infant was brought in his cradle and the diadem fixed on the right side of his head as a mark of sovereignty nadir first took the oath of allegiance on the koran and postrated himself in homage to the new king and the great officers followed his example thus did this great and wicked man under the specious pretense of promoting the honor and interest of his country prepare the way to ascend the giddy heights of his ambition he seemed already to look down on the instruments of his pride as wretches who were assiduous in forging their own chains nadir and his creatures now gave laws not so much in the form of a regency as in consequence of their offices he acquired nadir shah crowning himself the ascendence and in fact was sovereign orders were issued to notify the accession of abas iii to the throne he was now possessed of unlimited power and might have grasped at the crown but he was not ignorant of the danger that attended the attempt his ambition and policy he seasoned with patience till his army was more accustomed to his authority and received more demonstrative proofs of his abilities in the mean while he marched against the competitors of the crown and conquered the neighboring princes who contended against his usurpation and having now the entire regency quickly seated himself on the throne  on the   th of march      under the name of nadir shah the people paid him homage and he accepted the crown with an air of dignity mixed with arrogance an armenian patriarch performed part of the ceremony but the plume and diadem he changed from the left side to the right to show that to his own arm only he was indebted for his exaltation this instrument of divine wrath now accomplished his end and reached a point which caesar could not obtain though in valor generosity and strength of mind this celebrated roman was not inferior to the persian usurper yet he excelled him in learning politeness and humanity to which nadir had never any pretensions  cromwell was baffled in many of his attempts and neither by skill or valor could he succeed rome though corrupt in the extreme and ripe for a change of that form of government by which she had arrived at so high a pitch of glory had yet some honest spirits who thought the killing of a tyrant warrantable or at least not so great an evil as slavery in england there were numbers whose principles were untainted and who saw the error committed in attempting to change the monarchy into a republican government but in persia ignorance prevailed with corruption of manners and prepared the necks of the people for the yoke to which they then submitted and in a few years after they saw pyramids of human heads erected on the spot where they chose their king see the plate persians  nadir being at the summit of his glory and ambition tempered the natural fierceness of his disposition with some acts of munificence he entertained the people and among other amusements was that of shooting an arrow at a gold plate which was fixed on a lofty pole those who shot down the mark were to receive it for their skill together with a coat of honor the motto he chose for his seal was this as the jewel was fallen out of the king of fame and glory so god has restored it in the name of nadir the coins struck had these inscriptions  nadir king of kings and glory of the age another was coins proclaim throughout the earth the reign of nadir the king who conquers the world  being now at the height of his ambition nadir thought of nothing but to enrich himself accordingly he prepared for an expedition against india his success was rapid like caezar he came he saw and conquered victory now seemed to court the ambitious nadir and elate with the hope of giving laws to that vast empire he affected a more than common state observed a strict administration of justice and attended regularly to business kept people to proclaim his victories and a considerable number of young men with standards of red silk were ordered to attend on particular occasions the preparations to oppose his progress at the court of the mogul seemed to give him no concern on the contrary he prepared himself to receive homage from the indian lords having given battle to the indian forces and subdued them he sent a letter to their general saying that he knew the moguls treasure and added i had intended to put your emperor and his troops to the sword but i will favor them go and tell him to come to me and we will make up our quarrel in a convenient manner mahomed shah the indian king was conducted to his tent and placed by his left side he then addressed him saying that riches were his chief object he wished not deprive him of his empire and assured him that his life should be secure that after he had received the subsidy he demanded and which must be paid he would leave him in quiet possession of his dominions mahomed shah heard his determination with sorrow and confusion for language so foreign to a court could not but touch the heart of a king whose weakness did not amount to insensibility nadir had nothing to fear from his military power for his own army amounted to near one hunhundred and sixty thousand men he suffered him therefore to retire to his own camp mahomed shah gave orders for the dead bodies of his soldiers which were spread for near twelve miles to be interred and at the same time gave up the military chest to nadir with all it is treasures nadir shah like alexander was victorious wherever he went the indians gave way at his approach and quietly submitted a prey to his unbounded avarice he marched his troops through all their chief cities where after the manner of the east every house and shop was shut not a soul appeared in the streets but a mournful silence every where prevailed as if it presaged some dreadful calamity if the unhappy indian ventured to defend himself he was instantly killed or in torture suffered to linger with the loss of his nose and cars so barbarous was nadir that the people often went in a body and in tears of anguish and distress prostrated themselves and begged for bread the inhabitants of any consideration were obliged to declare under their handwriting what money and effects they were possessed of and if they concealed any thing they were punished with the utmost severity nadir aimed the shaft at all and millions felt the wounds he inflicted amidst the din of war all sense of humanity was confounded and every noble sentiment yielded to his insatiable thirst of accumulating riches nadir in imitating the celebrated macedonian here forgot his virtues like him he was the idol of his soldiers until his cruelties became too enormous but he never possessed the generosity of alexander where the one was beloved the other was feared and where compassion is due to the memory of alexander nadirs can only excite our hatred and raise our indignation the natural greatness of mind in men born to empire seems to find no object adequate to it except in conquest but to lead to true greatness the mind should be cultivated by an enlightened education which nadir never experienced and even if he had his heart was by nature too depraved to reach the summit of perfect heroism  his cruelty was extreme and his avarice no less so for according to hanway he took from the indians eighty seven millions five hundred thousand pounds of english money of which sum seven milmillion five hundred thousand pound was in gold and silver the remainder in the plate rich manufactures etc of the great mogul and the indian lords cruelty was a kind of diversion to nadir and was excited by his avarice and jealousy of his own security as well as a habit of insensibility yet he was remarkable for his love of women and in india he caused the bellies of eighty soldiers to be ripped open for no other crime than being present when one of their comrades forced an indian woman he is said to have had a virgin brought to his bed every night for some years before his death but contented himself at the close of his life with thirtythree in his wars in turkey he often carried his seraglio with him no king ever inflicted punishments in a greater variety or with circumstances more studied or reversed than nadir they are too shocking and numerous to relate but an instance or two may not be unacceptable two persons of distinction wrote to him several times complaining of each other he sent for them to the camp and pronounced them both rascals and since said he you are so fond of troubling me with epistles i will spoil your sport and accordingly he ordered their eyes to be put out his wantonness in cruelty was not less apparent when he ordered a mans teeth to be pulled out for no other reason than their being buckteeth but amidst all his cruelty he still could feel and his savage ferocity could yield to the dictates of nature for when his son riza kouli attempted his life and told him to his face he was a tyrant and ought to die and that the most he could do was to kill him for an attempt upon his life the afflicted nadir entreated him to think of his crime and ask pardon consider says he i am your general your sovereign your friend your father consider the duty you owe me in these several relations reflect on the small acknowledgements which i require of you you are in my power but i would not have you perish live be happy and a king whenever providence shall take me from the earth he then employed his principal officers to persuade his son to repentance but he remained inflexible and said he had done no wrong in attempting his fathers life nadir being informed of his obstinacy between rage and tenderness said i will not take away your life but i will make you an example to all the princes of the earth i will cut out your eyes  riza kouli with a fierceness peculiar to himself replied cut them out and put them into  the indecent mention of a woman of honor and distinction is no less disrespectful in persia than in the polite parts of europe consequently it is the highest indignity to mention in gross terms the favorite wife of a king and riza koulis expression was the most insulting he could use  a similar punishment was likewise inflicted on the soldier whom riza kouli employed to kill his father when he was at the pass where alexander pursued bessus the bactrian traitor he was wounded in the hand and would have been assassinated but for the intrepidity of the eunuchs round him the soldier made his escape and was not taken till above a year after the fact when seized he was led to the camp and confessed what he had done nadir said to him you are a very brave fellow but to prevent your taking such good aim again you must lose your eyes though necessity obliged nadir to deprive his darling son of his sight he lamented at passing so harsh a sentence repugnant to his sentiments of affection and with a mixture of paternal tenderness admired his genius and intrepidity and hoped to have preserved him to continue the diadem in his family hut finding him still unshaken he never after permitted him to have any women nor would he trust him in any place but under his own eye as he grew old his avarice and cruelty seemed to vie with each other for at ispahan he committed barbarities beyond any of the former years of his reign  this ancient city which the civil wars had nearly reduced to ruin he seemed determined to complete he made heavy exactions put numbers of the inhabitants to death and burnt many of the indian and armenian merchants alive restrained by no ties of justice nor the tears of the miserable by no regard of hospitality nor the protection due to strangers he tortured and put to death by the most inhuman methods he could devise such oppression barbarity and tyranny must ever meet with untimely fate and though nadir used frequently to say he considered himself sent by providence to correct the wickedness of men and made that a plea for his inhumanity yet neither his own intrepidity nor the vast power he commanded could protect him from that providence he had insulted for soon after his departure from ispahan he fell a victim to his own oppression and was killed in the act of the most sanguine violence on the plains of sultan meydan about twentyfour miles from mesched he called together the chiefs of the ousbegs turkumans and tartars who composed his army and having sworn them to secrecy disclosed a design of putting to the sword all the persians in his camp and that he would fire a skyrocket as a signal for the massacre and when this work was done he would load them with money and great honors purposing after he had erected a huge pyramid of persian heads to retire and end his days at kaelat a georgian slave in nadirs tent accidentally overheard part of this bloody plot and discovered it to another who at night sent to the principal of the persian officers and communicated the intelligence minds tinctured with jealousy soon caught the alarm and belief was soon confirmed under so fatal an extremity no resolution could be taken but that nadir himself should die  saleh beg an officer of courage and colonel of a body of afhars offered his service for that purpose and demanded only four chosen men as followers the time of nadir going to rest was past and it was but a few hours before the signal for the intended massacre was to be given saleh beg and his followers under a pretense of urgent business passed the guard and rushing into the outward partition of the haram met an eunuch whom they dispatched from thence they proceeded through the haram and in their way met an old woman whom they killed likewise they knew not where nadir slept till by the light of a lamp they discovered jewels here they rushed in and found him when the assassins approached him nadir drew his sabre and demanded what business they had saleh beg made no reply but cut him with his sabre on the left side of his collarbone this did not prevent the shahs collecting himself sufficiently to kill two of the the soldiers who came up to finish their leaders business he was then going from the tent when the cords of it tripped him up and saleh beg gave him a mortal wound nadir cried mercy and i will forgive you all to which this officer replied you have not shown mercy therefore merit none saleh beg having performed this business cut off nadirs head but the tartars to whom the tyrant had always shown a preference began to revenge his death and fell on the persians with incredible fury so that before daylight above five thousand men on both sides were slain the tartars were shown the slaughtered body but insisted on seeing his head also when being satisfied he was dead the whole remaining army instantly dispersed  this ended the life of a man whose actions made such a splendid figure even in the european world had he been consigned to his grave instead of being destined for a diadem many a stream of blood many a million of treasure had been saved to his country but we must leave him to revise his own actions since he is in the hands of that judge whose law it is our honor and happiness to obey and whose counsels it is impiety to scrutinize as we have before observed it is not our intention to dwell long or enter minutely into the motives of his actions and to unravel the foldings of a heart mixed and composed of qualities unintelligible upon common principles  the reader will however not be displeased with our digression and will forgive the following little narrative taken from hanway since it has been remarked that ballads and the simple tales of the inferior part of mankind often mark the character and spirit of the times with as much energy as the labor of the historian mr otter of the academy of paris received this remarkable speech from a peasant of persia on his being questioned why he did not cloth his daughter better you says the peasant ask this question much at your ease but i fancy you do not know nadir shah instead of thinking of our clothes it is well if we can get a morsel of bread are we not obliged to sell all we have to find him money and prevent our being bastinadoed to death they now demand of me three tomans  0 crowns i know not where to get them my cattle my flocks and my movables are already carried off by the shahs collectors i have only two or three sheep left whose milk serves to nourish me and this poor little girl whom i would gladly sell even to a foreigner if i could get for her the sum they demand of me she can never be in a worse condition than she is here especially if she should have the misfortune to lose me which must infallibly happen if i am not in a condition to pay this money but to return to our subject  the persians have very little maritme strength in the gulf of persia they once had between  0 and  0 ships some built in europe and some in pegu and surat but they were generally navigated by indians and portuguese their shipcarpenters are mostly indians who perform their business with neatness but are very slow and unfit for large work neither do they understand much of the structure of vessels or the manner of navigating them they have a seacoast of  00 leagues to the southward and the caspiansea to the north where they formerly built ships to protect themselves against the cossacks the muscovites generally transport persian merchandise in their own vessels and have the navigation of the sea nearly to themselves which has rendered their conquests easy on that side and if the coast was fortified and could be constantly supplied with ammunition from muscovy it would be difficult for the persians to remove them  chap ix of their revenue the lands of persia are either such as are in occupation or such as are not that is such as are cultivated or such as are uncultivated of which the latter are ten to one more than the former the lands are of four kinds the lands of the state the demesne lands the lands of the church and those of private men the lands of the state are in the possession of the governors of provinces who receive from them their own revenue and assign the rest for the payment of their officers and the troops they are obliged to maintain for every soldier has his pay assigned him on some village or farm  the demesne lands are the kings estate out of which the officers of the household are paid and the supernumerary troops which the king maintains the residue is given among the courtiers and favorites or managed by the vizirs and intendants who remit the produce of them into the treasury the lands of the church are the donations of their princes or private men and are accounted sacred they are never taxed on confiscated for any crime and after a years possession the title of them cannot be called in question the lands of private gentlemen are holden of the crown for the term of ninetynine years paying an inconsiderable annual rent and at the expiration of the above term of years they are allowed to renew by advancing one years income if a person wishes to build on unoccupied lands he must obtain a grant from the crown for ninetynine years and pay a small annual rent so that all ranks of men derive their estates from the crown as amongst us and there seems little other difference but that the persians have a term renewable at pleasure and our freeholders have an inheritance but both acquire a perpetuity by payment of their fines and accustomed rents the king has a right to a third of the produce of the lands and the grain of persia being subject to much injury from hail locusts and other insects the tenants insist on an abatement in such cases and assemble in multitudes of seven or eight thousand round the palace at isphan the court send orders to the receivers to make such allowances as the case requires and and to investigate the truth of the complaints but the court is always defrauded for the countrymen so well understand the force of bribes that they commonly make a purse and procure a favorable representation of the case from the kings officers the king has likewise a third of the husbandmans cattle governors of provinces are obliged from time to time to make large presents to the court of the best the country affords whether silk grain fruits cattle or whatever is in esteem amongst than and these are sent in gratuities sufficient for the kings household and therefore may be accounted a considerable part of the revenue the king has also the seventh fleece and the seventh of the breed of the cattle of those lands which are not appropriated to his use which adds greatly to the revenue for the shepherds of persia like the ancient patriarchs possess vast flocks and herds on which they constantly attend living in tents and removing from one place to another as they can find pasture for lands unoccupied by particular persons are free for all men to graze on and are deemed the kings the payment of the seventh beast is an acknowledgement of his dominion and property the king has an officer in every province to inspect the shepherds and to secure the seventh of the cattle for his service of horses he is entitled only to every third colt  minerals and precious stones belong to the king only and he has two per cent of all money the money that is raised by the waters increases the revenue for every person must pay for its being let into his fields and gardens the country being so parched nothing will grow without such assistance the tribute of a ducat is paid to the crown by those who are not of the religion of the country whether natives or foreigners the customs and portduties belong to the revenue but those do not amount to much for they have no considerable port except gombroon merchandise carried in and out of persia pays only a small sum for a camels load and in proportion for every mule or ox without examining the packs there is a tax of tenpence on every shop of working trades and twentypence on the rest all handicraft trades pay no duty to the crown but they are obliged to work for the king when he requires it without pay which saves the treasury a great deal of money and which may well be esteemed a part of the revenue but that which exceeds all is the benefit arising from contingencies namely what is derived from the confiscation of estates and the presents made by lords governors of provinces etc and particularly those on newyearsday they present the king with wrought silks horses asses beautiful boys and girls gold silver precious stones perfumes and every thing rich and curious or that may contribute to luxury and the pleasures of life the people are not oppressed or impoverished by these presents but appear in easy circumstances and there are few either tradesmen or husbandmen who do not wear rings on their fingers and arms there is no polltax in persia except on those who are of a different religion it is not easy to ascertain the amount of the revenue of the crown it depending so much on contingencies but it may one year with another be reckoned at four millions sterling which considering that their troops are paid from the lands of the state is very considerable but as the splendour and magnificence of the persian court is much beyond what we see in europe little remains at the end of the year the court with the women the eunuchs and other officers and servants seldom consists of less than ten thousand persons which belong to the household and including the troops of the great men and their dependents it must require an immense sum to maintain them  all bargains in gombroon are made for shahees and the company keep their accounts in them reckoning them worth fourpence each though that coin is rarely met with but in its stead coz and mamoodas are current every where ten coz being equal to one shahee and two shahees equal to one mamooda two hundred shahees make a toman equal to  l  s  d english horses camels houses etc are generally sold by the toman and they usually reckon their estates this way such a one they say is worth so many tomans as we say pounds in england  the persians have five seals which are used in five several branches of business one concerns the demesne lands a second is used for commissions letters patent etc a third for military affairs a fourth for the revenue and another for things relative to the household there are no arms engraven on them but on one are the names of the twelve imans or patriarchs on another a scrap of the alcoran or some pious expression showing their dependence on god and his prophet mahomet they are made of turquoises rubies emeralds or some precious stone about the size of a crownpiece the principal seal the king always wears round his neck and on fridays all instruments which require the royal seal are carried to the palace and impressed before the king on a kind of thick ink  chap x of their government laws etc the government of persia is monarchical and in every branch of it strictly despotic the favor of the prince and of those on whom his authority devolves is essential to the security of foreign merchants and this is best procured by proper and timely presents by a good appearance and a resolute discreet support of their own dignity the persians are not unskilled in the laws of justice and humanity but war having been for many years their only study and a fondness for outward show their predominant passion their laws are but little regarded when they interfere with their inclinations hence a good horse a silvermounted bridle and a girl will generally induce a persian to violate justice and even to commit that for which he is morally certain of death  the usual title of the king of persia is shah or patshaw the disposer of kingdoms which is the highest in asia and equivalent to that of emperor in europe they add also to the kings titles those of sultan and caun or cham which is that of the tartar sovereign to acts of state the persian monarch does not subscribe his name but oftentimes in his patents enumerates the several kingdoms and provinces under his dominion his subjects address him as the most renowned of all men living the source of power majesty and glory equal to the sun substitute of heaven object of all mens vows master of the conjunctions head of the most excellent religion prince of the faithful shadow of the almighty god father of victory lord of the revolutions of the world disposer of thrones and crowns with these or such like titles petitions are given to the throne but when they speak to the king they usually style him the lieutenant of god or the prince through whom god dispenses his grace and favor to men those of the blood royal are styled mizza which signifies the son of a prince  the persians like the romans prefer all men indifferently to posts in the state and in the army the gownmen sometimes command as generals and soldiers sit as judges in the courts of justice and the same person has been primeminister and high priest but they generally take care to prefer the native persians to civil and ecclesiastical employments the highest ecclesiastic in every town is a judge and tries civil causes under the governor who generally refers the parties to him and upon the receipt of his verdict the governor gives a final judgment there is seldom any regard paid to a persons birth or fortune in his promotion but the king disposes of places as he apprehends his subjects are qualified for them they enjoy their posts during life and sometimes their children after them when they have behaved well and there are instances where a government has continued in a family for many generations but as the favorites of the court are always endeavoring to promote their own creatures this seldom happens  the first minister in the kingdom is the atamandoulet a word which signifies the support of the empire when he is addressed he is styled the grand vizir no business of consequence is transacted in the state but by the direction of this minister nor any grant or act of state of the kings held to be valid till countersealed by him the reason is that their kings being bred up with women are perfectly ignorant of affairs of state it is therefore necessary for the welfare of the people and the good order of government that their commands should be considered by a wise minister before they are are enforced the king is a mere cipher and of no other use but to sanction the public acts the prime minister being in reality the king who when his age renders him unfit to attend public business is permitted to retire to his family and end his days in peace the second post in the government is that of the divan bey whose office may be compared to that of our lord chief justice and sometimes to that of our lord chancellor but have divans or a council to whom the administration of justice is committed these magistrates decide on all causes civil or military except when the king in person sits in judgment the divan bey or lord can command any cause to be removed to his tribunal from any court in the kingdom and during the late reigns no king has been known to concern himself in examining the decrees of the divan bey in the third rank come the generals and next the secretary of state who registers the public acts and has the care of the records he appoints also a deputy in every province of the empire who transmits all affairs of consequence to be laid before the ministry the last great officer is the mirab or lord of the water who superintends the aquaducts every province has its mirab for in so dry a country it is necessary all should have an equal share of water ambassadors and foreigners transact business with the nazir or treasurer and steward of the household who possesses great influence but is not permitted to pay any money from the treasury unless the order bears the seal of the primeminister the chief justice and two other officers of the revenue the master of the horse has studs of horses in every part of the kingdom and appoints officers to superintend them the royalhuntsman is not less powerful having a thousand huntsmen and falconers at his command they breed for the chase lions ounces panthers and dogs and have hawks and birds of prey which are bred to attack wild beasts as well as birds  after these the principal physician holds his seat together with the astrologer which are places of great honor and profit there is also a highchamberlain who always stands behind the king a white eunuch likewise attends his majesty who has greater influence than any round the court he serves the king on his knees at table tastes his meat dresses and undresses him commands his wardrobe and has the government of the eunuchs of the palace he never leaves his majesty but when he visits the ladies he carries a little box covered with precious stones in which he has two or three fine handkerchiefs opium perfumes and cordials with which he serves him whenever he may call for them he is very powerful because he has so many opportunities of ingratiating himself and is equally feared and respected by his majestys ministers  in every province of persia there is a governor who is often as despotic as a sovereign prince military causes are always tried by these governors who though they are accountable for all their actions and have often their ears cut off and noses slit and are severely beaten on the back bastinadoed on their feet till their nails come off and not unfrequently strangled yet they seldom abstain from acts of violence and oppression so great is their love of cruelty and their fondness of showing the extent of their power  the governors in their respective provinces live in almost as much state as their sovereign having the same kind of officers as the king they enjoy the same titles and there is scarce any difference but in their numbers and their pensions the governor commands the militia of the province and assigns lands for their maintenance he reviews them and sees they are fit for service examines their arms and horses and observes their maneuvers there are officers under them appointed to watch their conduct and to oppose them if they commit any thing against the state if a governor returns from his command which he never does but by express order of the court he waits without the gate of the palace and gives notice of his arrival by some friend who reports that he attends to throw himself at his majestys feet orders are then given for his admittance unless he has been guilty of great misconduct in which case he is not suffered to appear but an order is dispatched from the primeminister and sealed by the king for his immediate execution the person who bears the mandate cuts him in pieces with a sabre crying out when he falls on him by the kings command whenever a minister is disgraced his whole estate is withheld and he experiences so great a reverse of fortune until the kings pleasure be known that no man dares give him even a cup of water if he is acquitted of the charge against him he is restored again to his family and property  the civil and canonlaws of the persians are blended together mahomet contrived this in imitation of the lawgivers of old who to enforce their laws pretended their injunctions were the dictates of heaven this great imposter had an eye to the jewish law especially the book of leviticus where the civil law and ceremonies are mingled together according to the principle of the mahometans the same person bears the spiritual and temporal sword and is both high priest and king he commands in war and administers justice explains the articles of faith and regulates the ecclesiastical dicipline as the patriarchs of the jews did and as the patriarch of their religion and his successors used to do for the first five ages  according to the persian doctors the civil magistrate ought not to concern himself in the administration of justice any further than to execute such sentences as the clergy pronounce but the temporal power retains its authority and does not allow the clergy any other share in the supreme court of justice than to give their opinion in difficult cases the alcoran is their chief lawbook and if their decision is not clear by the precepts it contains they refer to the sayings and acts of mahomet and afterward to those of the imans but in general they do not consult books determining without any regard to the writings of the alcoran the laws of the persians are not always strictly observed for if they were christians would not be able to live in persia any more than jews and pagans but would be every day subject to abuse and plunder from the precepts of the alcoran at least as they are explained and interpreted by their doctors for it is impossible to prevent the insults of the vulgar who are frequently so bigoted to their superstition and incensed by the clergy against all who differ from them that there have been instances of outrages committed on foreigners purely on account of religion and the influence of the priests is sufficient to screen from punishment all offenses committed against christians as well as pagans  the imans teach that no faith is be kept with those of another persuasion and that it is lawful to deprive infidels of their goods and estates from hence probably our dissenters derive their favorite tenet that dominion is founded in grace and the world with its abundance was intended only for the godly so that with impunity they defraud and plunder and think they are fulfilling the decrees of heaven and doing a meritorious act when robbing their fellow creatures such baneful doctrine did our dissenters avow in the days of cromwell but notwithstanding the bigotry of a few affected puritans the generality of the persians respect us greatly and think there is no nation whose merchants are more just or honorable in their dealings  all facts are proved in court by living testimony and a man is at liberty to claim his right even the partys own deed will not exclude him if he can prove any force fraud or imposition where there are no witnesses an oath is tendered to the person who denies the charge and he is sworn upon the alcoran with great solemnity the judge first kissing the book which is enclosed in a linen cloth and touching it with his forehead presents it himself to the person about to swear who puts his hand on it when opened and swears to speak the truth if he is of a different religion the judge sends an officer with him to a priest of that religion if a christian he swears by the gospel if a jew by the old testament if an indian idolater by his adored cow and if a gaur or a worshiper of fire he swears by the flames the reason they never swear an unbeliever by the alcoran is because he does not consider it as a divine book and they fear he should profane it of course forbid him even to touch the cover of it  the women plead their own causes and it is but decent they should they are veiled that they may acquire more assurance and set secluded from the court collecting their arguments and enforcing them with the most bitter cries and lamentations they never appear but to sue for a divorce and the usual plea is impotence of the husband sailing not most bitterly to bewail and lament and to deafen the judge with cries and clamor  in criminal causes the civil magistrate never interferes neither is the ecclesiastical law at all consulted they are left entirely to the temporal courts which determine according to the nature of the offense and former presidents these courts consist of three persons the president of the divan the governor of the city and the nazir they have no public prison and consequently no sheriffs or jailors who have the custody of prisoners but every magistrate confines the criminal in his own house until he is brought to trial which is within twentyfour hours after he is taken and sentence is no sooner passed than it is executed the servants of the judge perform the office of executioner criminals of state have the carcan or threecornered yoke round their necks to which the right hand is fastened and the king in person sits in judgment against such offenders all tumults and riots are severely punished in persia and of course seldom happen so that murder and housebreaking is very unfrequent if a person  so unfortunate as to kill another and the fact be proved before the judges the offender is not punished by the court but is delivered to the friends of the deceased who put him to death in what manner they please all the relatives of the deceased assemble and with loud cries demand the ancient privilege of having the blood of him who had murdered their kinsman which the magistrate seldom fails of promissing them but sometimes the murderer by presents to the judge and by giving money to the relations obtains his pardon if the relations persist in having his blood the judge gives him up with these words i give you the murderer according to ourlaw make yourselves satisfaction with his blood but remember god is merciful the judges servants are then ordered to observe the directions of the prosecutors and guard him to the place they desire whither they accompany him with curses and abuse when he arrives at the place of destination he is left to their mercy and they often inflict the most cruel tortures on the miserable wretch even the women stain their hands with the murderers blood but should it so happen that life should still remain in the offender after their departure they cannot by their laws again return to complete the execution  ordinary crimes are usually punished by fines if the parties are men of substance if not they give them a number of blows on the soles of their feet not less than thirty nor exceeding three hundred their feet are often very much swollen with the blows and turn black and sometimes the nails of their toes come off the remedy they use is to set the unfortunate man in warm horsedung almost up to the middle for several days after which they foment the parts with spirits of wine pickpockets and pilfering rogues are marked with a hot iron in the forehead and housebreakers have the right hand cut off the same punishment is inflicted on those who counterfeit money for the first offense but for the second their bellies are ripped open  for capital offenses the criminals feet are tied to a camel and his head hanging down to the ground his belly is ripped open and his bowels hang over his head after being dragged through the streets he is hung on a tree by his heels and is often several hours before he expires they have other modes of punishing for capital crimes by impailing casting from a rock and many more too horrid for the feeling mind to dwell on  in persia the decision of causes cannot be protracted to a tormenting or devouring length why they should be more tedious in limited than in absolute monarchies appears strange unless in certain instances slavery is prefered to liberty or the name of liberty to the reality of it the law is certainly an excellent and necessary profession but two many are bred up to it consequently in pursuit of support they deviate from the original design by perplexing with injurious refinements that which it is their duty to renderplain and intelligible  chap xi of their liberal arts learning and language the persians at this period know little of painting or statuary their relegion indeed discourages painting and the rigid imans forbid the representation of every created animal like the chinese they attempt to imitate nature but she is pourtrayed in so barbarous a manner that they appear to have considered her as deformed the europeans far excel them in every liberal art yet their antiquities are somewhat curious and evince a genius superior to the artists of modern times all the mahometans are averse to statues and pictures and are more set against them than the most rigid of our dissenters a mohemetan would not for his life perform his devotions in a room of paintings and in this instance they greatly resemble the primitive christians who through their abundance of sanctity covered the pictures of their saints whenever they were in company with their mistresses thinking thus to veil themselves from their observation their pictures are seldom drawn with a full face because they have not the smallest idea of giving life to their performances by the judicious disposition of light and shade their flowers are better painted and they have the advantage of us in the brilliancy of their colors which are vivid to a degree of beauty which cannot be preserved in damp climates however the persians have a few good paintings and preserve the portraits of their celebrated poets hafez and sadi they are represented at full length and habited in the old persian dress  poetry is held in great esteem in persia and it is customary in common discourse to introduce moral sentences and poetical narrations from their writers and a persian never thinks he entertains his guest unless he quotes different passages and moral precepts from some favorite poet they still preserve the spirit of poetry and have many traces of that fertility and strength of imagination for which in times past they were deservedly famous  they have a number of schools in every town where arabic is taught which is considered a learned language but the alcoran is the standard of good language both as to grammar and rhetoric men of fortune prefer private tutors for their children and no nation is more attentive to the education of their young men and to the training them to manly exercises after they have been some time at school they finish their education at college where they are instructed in the principles of their religion their colleges are large and are very richly endowed the largest of them have fifty or sixty apartments and to each of them are two chambers at ispahan there are fiftyseven colleges most of them of royal foundation where there are professors of every science who are paid annually by the scholars but many read lectures and teach the liberal arts gratis and these are generally great officers who have been discarded or have voluntarily retired from court these frequently give books and paper to their pupils and often entertain them at their houses and by this means endeavor to regain their reputation for nothing adds more to the dignity or honor of a persian nobleman than to instruct young men at their own expense and be thus patrons of learning and of learned men they have no public disputations or lectures as in england but when the collegians have made considerable progress in the sciences they dispute with their tutors  the turkish language is the most common in persia and prevails on the southern part of the caspian as well as in those provinces which were formerly conquered by the turks the pure persic is little known but in the southern parts on the coast of the persian gulf and the confines of arabia and particularly at ispahan in matters of learning they use arabic in which is deposited the greatest part of that knowledge for which the persians were once distinguished and the polite people are fond of arabian words which renders their discourse the less intelligible to men of inferior rank the learned languages familiar to europeans are not known amongst them as time seems to have made no change in the customs of asia but the same manners remain as we read of two thousand years ago so the language particularly the persian has the same ideom and sublimity of expression  they write as the hebrews did from the right to the left and often range their lines in an arbitrary manner so that upon one leaf of paper they sometimes write in ten different directions and this only to show the writers ability in observing the proportion of words and lines in each  the language of the persians is extremely beautiful and it is to be lamented it is not introduced as an essential accomplishment in the system of our education it is a melancholy reflection that whilst years are bestowed in acquiring an insight into the greek and roman authors that those very writers should have been neglected from whom the greeks evidently derived both the richness of their mythology and the peculiar tendency of their expressions mr richardson has entered into this subject with great ability and happy is it for the advancement of learning when men of genius differ in opinion on themes of fair and reasonable investigation for they show us it is not impossible either to doubt with modesty or to dissent with candor sir william jones has published a beautiful hymn addressed to the god camdes which reflects much light on literary information this god is the same as the eros of the greeks and the cupid of the romans his bowstring is composed of swarming bees and his arrows are tipped with flowers delicious to the smell but fatal to the taste  to the eastern krishen and gopia which are likewise mentioned in the above most elegant composition are we indebted for the names of apollo and the muses but it is not amidst the tender shades of poetry alone that the persian scholar may find pleasure and instruction history and philosophy stand ready to receive their welcome guest and to refresh his weary steps with whatever is curious or interesting the etymologist too will find an ample field in the study of the oriental tongue and we hope to see the auspicious moment when the majesty of ancient knowledge shall be again confessed by mankind for learning has its link in the golden chain with which providence has bound every thing together and we cannot make a more noble or amiable use of our abilities than by wiping away that rust of indolence which has so long defiled its beauty  when under the pretense of commerce we became the cruel invaders of anothers right was it not reasonable to suppose we should at least have made ourselves acquainted with the language of the conquered but private avarice shut up the gates of public virtue victory disdained to twine around her sword the wreath of science and although the persian language is the language in which all business is necessarily transacted yet there never was any advancement made by us in such literature till the publication of sir william jones who is now placed at the head of a learned society at bengal and has it in contemplation to publish annually an asiatic miscellany what is there we may not hope from his benevolent exertions  the persian gazel or ode is very similar to that of anacreons  dropping odours dropping wine and whether anacreon borrowed the gaity of his odes from the gazel or whether the divine hafez inirched his native language by an imitation of the trean bard it is not easy to determine the similarity of sentiment is oftentimes wonderful and it may with equal truth be said of both that they wrote not so much to the understanding as to the heart  the curious reader will find much entertainment in the perusal of the very elegant translations of the persian gazel published by mr not and to whom i am principally indebted for the foregoing ingenious observations on the persic poetry  having conducted our readers over the regions of poetry the connection leads us to consider music the sister art but here we find no dulcet tones to sooth the pensive ear but a barbarous mixture of sounds that little suits the extreme tenderness and delicacy of their poetry the tuneful muse seems to have trembled at their religion which forbad her to be wooed by the nobles of persia under such oppression has the music of this poetical country ever labored it is true they have a number of different instruments which are so rudely constructed as to afford but indifferent harmony they have no professors of the science and consequently its refinement being in the hands of the inferior class of people can make but little progress  astrology is much studied in persia and particularly by the natives of chorasanwho are celebrated for this art they teach the art of divination and interpret dreams they have charms for all disseases and take their spells and authorities from the alcoran which they render as they please according to the nature of the circumstance they have a number of physicians who with the astrologers do great injury to the country insomuch that they are become proverbial yet so great is their authority and influence over all that even the king entertains vast numbers in his pay and they are no less feared than respected  the persians make use both of the solar and lunar year the last for their festivals which are appointed on certain days of the month and for their religious ceremonies their months begin and end with the moon and consequently their years are shorter than ours by eleven days but their solar year consists of     days which is of an ancient date for quintus curtius speaking of dariuss train says that the magi were followed by     particular persons according to the number of the days of the year which consisting of    months seven had thirty days and five thirtyone days a piece which completed the      the year begins at the time of the equinox and it is the part of the astrologer to make an exact observation by the astrolabe of the very minute when the sun coming to the equator enters into aries this day they call naurus or neurus that is the new day and when they are to make any computation of their age they say they have lived or completed so many nauruses or years their epoch begins with the hegyra or flight of mahomet which is coincident with the  0th of july     years after the birth of our savior  the persians have fallen into a great absurdity in their manner of instructing it is common to see boys reading lessons out of the koran in arabic which they do not understand and to add to this farce as they sit they make a motion with their head and body alleging that this helps study thus does affectation supply the place of real learning they acknowledge that the europeans have an universal skill in arts and sciences to many of which they are entire strangers and their present mode of education is not likely to remove this evil  thus the revolutions of time and the changes to which human affairs are subject in consequence of mens iniquity have involved those nations in ignorance who once enjoyed all the advantages which could grace and adorn human nature and who were distinguished as patterns of learning and politeness  chap xii of their religion superstition etc zoroaster the founder of the ancient persian religion appeared in the year of the world    0 this great philosopher was struck with the demonstration of the perfections of that selfexisting being who is the author of all good being at a loss to account for the introduction of evil into the world he imagined there were two principles one the cause of good which he represented by light the other that of evil which he figured to himself by darkness he considered light as the most perfect symbol of true wisdom and intellectual endowment and darkness the representative of things hateful and destructive from hence he was led to inculcate an abhorence of all images and to teach his followers to worship god only under the form of fire considering the brightness purity and incorruptibility of that element as bearing the most perfect resemblance to the nature and perfection of the good deity for the same reason the persians adore the sun and think the throne of die almighty is seated in it in the composition of this world good and evil being mixed together they believed they would continue till the end of all things when each should be separated and reduced to it is own sphere the ancient persians erected no temples but offered their sacrifices in the open air and generally on the top of a hill for they esteemed it injurious to the majesty of the god of heaven to shut up in walls him to whom all things are open whom the world cannot contain and to whom the whole earth with regard to man should be esteemed a house or temple  another philosopher of the name of zoroaster arose about  00 years after the former near the conclusion of the reign of darius the son of hyestaspas who undertook to reform the articles of their religion he maintained there were two angels one of light the other of darkness who were at perpetual variance with each other and that where the angel of light prevails there good arises and where the spirit of darkness there evil predominates he affirmed that this opposition would remain till the close of the world when there would be a day of judgment on which all would receive a just retribution according to their works after which the angel of darkness and his followers would be separated to eternity from light and those who cultivated and cherished the spiritual nature and obeyed the angel of light should go into a world triumphant amidst everlasting brightness and should receive rewards due to their good deeds these opinions in some sort are still preserved and many of the ancient persians still hold a strict veneration for fire to the everlasting fire near the city of baku pilgrims continue to flock to expiate their own sins and those of others marking their foreheads with saffron wearing very little apparel living on wild celery or a kind of jerusalem artichoke and keeping one arm in some particular position they remain unalterably fixed in their attitude  the persians acknowledge the koran as first promulged to be the great law of their prophet mahomet but they trace their ecclesiastical divisions and inveterate animosities as high as his immediate successor aliway mohomets brothers son and married to fatima the daughter of that false prophet from this the persians naturally infer his right to the succession which was invaded by his uncles abubker omar and osman the brothers of mahomet whose usurpation both as kings and prophets is approved by the turks at length ali succeeded and the dispute might have been lost in oblivion had he made no difference in the koran yet this produced no extraordinary effects till the   th century when sheffie a man of exemplary life who pretended a regular descent from ali began to teach and expound the mohammedan law and the doctrine of alis followers in preference to the turkish doctors of divinity this revived the remembrance of the injury done to ali by his uncles whom the persians began to curse in their public prayers they also changed the form of the mohammedan creed by giving ali the title of the friend of god these two sects being divided those who maintained the succession of abubeker omar and osman called themselves sunnis whilst the followers of ali took the name of schias  experience has proved how impossible it is to keep mankind steady to any form of worship even where they profess the same faith in essentials and if this is the case where religion is founded in truth as in that of christ it is no wonder that so absurd a doctrine as that of mohomedanism professed by so many millions of people spread over such a vast tract of country should create dissentions with regard to ceremonials and the construction of texts in themselves inexplicable nor is it strange that this should produce national and irreconcillable hatred  the persians believe the mosaic to have been the true religion before christ whom also they acknowledge to have been a true prophet and teacher sent by god but that the religion he taught was contained in a book which at mahomets coming was taken by the angel gabriel into heaven and the koran brought down in its stead this however they do not atattempt to prove they say also that jesus christ did not die upon the cross but that another person was miraculously brought there in his place thus confessing the truth of our saviors mission but confounding it with absurd fables  the persians in their prayers acknowledge but one god mahomet is his prophet and ali his friend they appear not to have that modesty which prevails among christians of the best sort who to avoid the imputation of affectation or hypocrisy are as zealous not to be seen on their knees as afraid to commit any criminal action if a bold masculine piety and a sincere awful sense of the supreme being are very consistent things this excuse of modesty must be owing to an error in education the reservedness of some christians is often carried to excess persons pious before marriage have been known to be confessedly negligent in their devotions afterward the prejudices of education being such as that neither party chose to be seen on their knees and neglect we all know soon becomes a habit  not so does the enlightened milton paint our first parents not so does nature or reason dictate surely this is not what our savior meant by desiring us to retire to our closet and is diametrically opposite to what may be inferred from that passage of scripture that the unbelieving party in marriage is saved by the believer such an excess of reserve if such is common must be injurious to religion and highly destructive of the advantages derived to mankind by the example of piety particularly in the matrimonial state  the persians seem to be under the influence of enthusiasm without which devotion in some men is but a languid office their imaginations are warm and we must not judge of the seeming extravagance of their expressions by our colder feelings their phrases and metaphors are highly just and beautiful although they may widely differ from the coolness observable in the english mode of devotion passion in matters of religion is certainly necessary and it should be left to nature herself to determine how far it should prevail but a happy mixture of hope love and fear under the influence and guidance of reason constitute that passionate warmth which is not only warrantable but in many minds essential  let thy words be few is an admonition well suited to the weakness of human nature and the observance of it at the same time shows the strength of the understanding but the persians in contradiction to this precept and the experience of mankind make long prayers after washing themselves and combing their beards they often count beads like some christians who probably learnt it from them at certain parts of their prayer they stand at others kneel and prostrating themselves on the earth set their forehead on a bit of clay near the size of a crown piece supposed to be brought from mecca and consequently to have a charm this they always carry with them tied to the upper part of the arm they have stated hours of prayer are punctual in their observance of this duty and to all appearance perform it with more attention than christians generally do and although they are extremely immoral they give one proof of religion greatly superior to the christians for they seldom mention the name of the supreme being except on solemn occasions or at least in a respectful manner the persians possess some jewish rites amongst them and when they pray never permit the image of any sensible object to be before them nor is it allowed to pray with any thing of gold about them as if it was esteemed an object of idolatry they invoke the intercession of the departed souls of some of their prophets and pious men  it is wonderful to consider in how many instances the persians demonstrate the highest superstition sneezing is held a most happy omen especially when repeated often the hands with the fingers interchanged and some particular posture of the body are considered as full of magic power and if used maliciously of dangerous consequence as their minds are tainted with a fondness of whatever is marvelous and the belief of the agency of invisible power on the most trival occasions they think the meteor that resembles the falling stars and which are vulgarly called so are the blows of the angels on the heads of the devils who would pry into the secrets of paradise cats are held in great esteem but dogs in abomination so that a dog is never permitted to come into a room yet they use them for a diversion the turks are not much behind them in this folly in the reign of shah abas the grand seignior sent to that prince to desire that as none but their prophet and his children had been dressed in green none of his subjects might be permitted to wear that color especially in stockings to this shah abas who was a man of sense made answer that if the grand seignior would prevent the dogs pissing on the grass in turkey he would comply with his request innumerable are the instances of their absurdity in the belief of invisible agents and of their superstition in the usual occurences of life but it has ever prevailed and has been common in a greater or less degree to mankind of all religions and in all countries happy it is for those people who profess a religion which teaches them to acquiesce in things superior to the reason and comprehension of mankind our condition does not permit us to know every thing it is against the laws of our nature and consequently a crime to attempt it thus where our understanding is puzzled in the fearful investigation of the things which belong to god we should pay our adoration and submission to the great author of nature and place our humble and firmest confidence in him  a map of poland with its dismembered provinces map of poland  a description of poland from busching cox marshall and others chap i of the country climate productions etc the word pole in the polish language signifies a flat level country but that the kingdom and the whole nation derive their name from that origin cannot be affirmed with any certainty this large kingdom from east to west is two hundred german or geographical miles in length and one hundred and forty in breadth each mile being about four miles and a half english toward the north it borders on prussia courland livonia and russia and toward the east on russia and little tartary to the south it is bounded by moldavia transylvania and hungary to the west by silesia brandenburg and pomerania the air is somewhat cold but salubrious and more temperate than might be supposed from its northerly situation the country is for the most part level and has but few hills on the carpathian mountains which separate poland from hungary the air is very cold for it snows there in the midst of summer and in some parts the snow never melts the belsciattan mountains are a continuation of the carpathian hills the kingdom of poland consists of three principal provinces great poland little poland and the grand duchy of lithuania this division is of great utility with regard to the public law of poland according to which the nation consists of three distinct people  the soil of this country is extremely fertile and yields plenty of grain of which there cannot be a greater proof than that near  00 vessels and floats most of which are laden with corn annually pass down the vistula to dantzick in podolia volkinia and ukraine and the province of russia corn grows in vast plenty and with little culture or manure in great and little poland agriculture receives more attention and labor but the harvests make ample amends for the care of the industrious peasants the soil of lithuania is as fruitful as that of podolia and samogitia though it was formerly very woody and the greatest part of it lay uncultivated but having enjoyed much tranquillity and the advantages of agriculture it is become prodigious fertile and produces a great quantity of wheat and other corn besides hemp and flax it is likewise famous for honey the meadows and pastures afford nourishment for numerous flocks and herds and the sheep yield fleeces of superior excellence podolia abounds with a fine breed of horses and horned cattle but in all ages this country has been exposed to the inroads of barbarous nations which living on plunder have often ravaged it in the most cruel manner so fruitful are its meadows that grass often grows to a wonderful height and sometimes a person cannot see the horns of the cattle that are grazing in the meadows as an instance of the plenty of every kind of provisions it is a fact that from the year   0  to      during which time there were several armies in poland there was not the least scarcity of bread polish prussia is likewise a very fruitful country and is remarkable for excellent pasturage peat oker of all kinds chalk belemnites agates chalcedonies cornelians onyxes opals jasper fine rock crystal amethysts granite topazes sapphires and even rubies and diamonds are found in poland this country also affords marienglass or muscovy glass talc alum saltpeter amber pitcoal and an inexhaustable quantity of chalk which is hewn out of the rocks in large blocks and salt springs also spar quicksilver lapis calaminaris iron lead a small quantity of tin gold and silver but there are no mines of the two last metals wrought in poland they have manna which is produced from an herb that grows in the meadows and fenny grounds and is gathered in great quantities from june till the end of july the polish kermes berries are always gathered in may before they are quite ripe for in the month of july they swarm with insects which leave a kind of protuberance behind them so that the berries are rendered unfit either for dying or medicine the country abounds in mines of salt which is of different colors but when pounded is of a dirty ash color like what we call brown salt the principal mines are at boenia and wieliczka in the latter are many subterraneous passages and in some of them are chapels and altars hewn out of the saltrock in the chapel crucifixes and the images of saints are set up carved of salt and a light is burning perpetually the places where the salt is hewn out of the mine and the empty cavities from whence it has been taken are called chambers and some of them are so spacious that a large church might be erected in them in these chambers are warehouses for the reception of salt casks and magazines for the fodder of horses and stables which contain numbers of horses employed in the mines in some places the tops and bottoms of the chambers are covered with thick mountains of salt chrystals which by the light of the candle reflect the most surprising luster and the most beautiful rays pieces of coal and petrified wood are occasionally found buried in the salt the rocks of salt are so stupendous and of such an enormous mass that they exhibit a wonderful phenomenon in the natural history of the globe it is supposed that this spot was formerly covered with the sea from the appearance of the uppermost bed of the earth as the surface immediately over the mines is sand the second clay mixed with sand and gravel and containing petrifactions of marine bodies the third is of calcarious stone from hence naturalists seem to agree that it is a gradual deposit formed by the evaporation of its waters they trace back the working of these amazing inexhaustable mines above  00 years how much earlier they were known cannot be ascertained  their profits are immense and are appropriated to the kings privy purse the annual average amounting to l       s  d sterling they now belong to the emperor being situated within the province which he dismembered from poland but are far from yielding a revenue equal to that which they afforded the king of poland for the austrian commissioners imprudently raised the price of salt from a notion that poland could not exist without obtaining that commodity as usual from wielitska and would therefore be obliged to receive it at any price this mode of proceeding offended the poles and the king of prussia with his usual sagacity did not neglect this opportunity of extending his commerce he immediately imported large quantities of salt which he procured chiefly from spain to dantzic memmel and koningsburg from whence it was conveyed up the vistula into the interior provinces by these means he furnished great parts of poland with salt at a cheaper rate than the inhabitants could procure it from the house of austria and in      the mines of wielitska only supplied the districts which immediately border upon austrian poland  the most common way of manuring the ground is by burg and as they have vast plains which lay unvated and overrun with long grass this is done without much labor when the heart of one piece is worn out they pursue the same method with another being under no necessity of continually ploughing the same their ploughs are nearly such as ours but are made of wood the reason iron is not used is that they fear it will damage their crops their ground is tilled with small horses or oxen two of which are sufficient and wheat is generally sown because it is more profitable than barley poland abounds in wood such as oak beech pine and firtrees it also yields abundance of honey and wax and a great quantity of mead is made of the former which liquor derives its name from the polish word miode signifying honey  great numbers of cattle are fattened in poland and sent for sale into germany the horned breed abound so much that  0 or  0000 oxen are annually driven out of the kingdom their horses are very strong swift and beautiful and every where prolific the forests contain deer hares wolves foxes bears elks wildasses and oxen and in ukraine near nieper sheep and horses are found wild the wild ox was formerly very common in europe but exists no where but in the lithuanian forests in some parts of the carpathian mountains and in causalus the bison or wildox of america is supposed to be the same but rendered different by a change of climate they have likewise an extraordinary creature called bohac which much resembles the guinea pig but is more of the nature of the beaver they dig holes in the earth which they generally inhabit in the month of october and seldom quit them but for food till april they have different apartments for their lodgings provisions and their dead and live together by ten and twelve in a herd  in the rivers are innumerable shoals of fish and in the the country great quantities of tame and wild fowl their partridges it is said often turn white in winter in the north part of lithuania the same as they do in muscovy the eagle and vulture are very common among the birds of prey lithuania is remarkable for the beauty of its birds and possesses the remiz or small species of titmouse called parus pendulinus it is curious in the structure of its nest which is formed with wonderful art the shape is like a purse composed of gosamer and minute fibers and lined with moss the entrance is on the side very small and round and so constructed as to preserve the eggs or little ones from the smallest injury it is suspended on the twig of a willow or at the most slender extremity of some other tree over a river and seldom lays more than four or five eggs  there are many capital cities in the three provinces of poland warsaw and cracow which are the principal in the province of great poland warsaw stands on the vistula and in the center of the kingdom and is the royal residence it is surrounded by a moat and double wall and consists of the old and new town with two handsome suburbs it possesses several elegant stone buildings and palaces a great number of beautiful convents and churches an hospital an arsenal and a statue of king sigismund iii the valuable library of count zuluski opened in the year      is said to contain about  00000 volumes and is both an ornament and advantage to the city some years since an academy for military exercises and a literary society were instituted at warsaw the number of inhabitants are computed at  0000 among which there are many foreigners it wears rather a melancholy appearance though its situation is pleasant being built on an eminence from the banks of the vistula and occupies a vast extent of ground the streets are broad and spacious but illpaved the palaces of the nobility are numerous and splendid but the greater part of the houses are illconstructed wooden hovels particularly those of the suburbs on the whole it exhibits a confused scene with the strong contrast of wealth and poverty luxury and distress a provincial assembly or diet and a court of judicature is held here on which account it is far preferable to cracow which city disputes the honor of preeminence with warsaw for it was formerly the capital of poland where the kings were elected and crowned and was once near the center of the polish dominions but is now a frontier town  the royal palace is a noble edifice beyond comparison the finest building in poland the apartments are well fitted up and furnished in the english manner being executed by the london artists and brought from there at the kings expense the room called the hall of victory from formerly having been a hall is converted into a saloon hung with tapestry from brussels the ceiling pannels doorcases and window frames are all neatly executed in white carving gilt the rooms are very numerous and all the offices for a court extremely convenient  the fortifications at warsaw are sufficient to prevent the towns being insulted by flying parties or small armies but could not stand a siege of any duration against an army well provided its walls are good and flanked with bastions and tolerably lined with artillery the ditch is broad and deep and the waters of the vistula may be let in at pleasure but the extent of these fortifications is too great to be defended effectually with less then eight thousand men warsaw is populous it being the capital of poland and the miserable state of most of the other towns throughout poland has contributed greatly to its increase there are many polish families reside in it which were once in affluence but now reduced to live in a very mean way speaking of warsaw the residence of the present king of poland and the city where the court is held we will take the opportunity of mentioning the court as described by mr coxe in his entertaining travels with lord herbert the english minister being absent in the country we carried our letters of recommendation to count rzewuski great marshal of the crown who received us with much civility and appointed sunday morning to present us to the king at his levee  at the hour appointed we repaired to the court and were admitted into the audiencechamber where the principal officers of the crown were waiting for his majestys appearance in this chamber i observed four busts placed by order of his present majesty namely those of elizabeth queen of england henry iv of france john sobiesky and the present empress of russia at length the king made his appearance and we were presented his majesty talked to each of us a considerable time in the most obliging manner he said many handsome things of the english nation mentioned his residence in london with great appearance of satisfaction and concluded by inviting us to supper in the evening of which honor we had before had previous intimation from the great marshal the king of poland is handsome in his person with an expressive countenance a dark complexion roman nose and penetrating eye he is uncommonly pleasing in his address and manner and possesses great sweetness of condescension tempered with dignity he wore a full dressed suit which circumstance i mention because he is the first king of this country who has not worn the national habit or who has not shaved his head after the polish custom his example has of course had many imitations and i was much surprised to see so few of the nobility in the national garb the natives in general are so attached to this dress that in the diet of convocation which assembled previous to the election of his present majesty it was proposed to insert in the pacta conventa an article whereby the king should be obliged to wear the polish garment but this motion was overruled and he was left at liberty to consult his own taste at his coronation he laid aside the ancient regal habit of ceremony and appeared in robes of a more modern fashion with his hair flowing upon his shoulders  the levee being ended we went over the palace which was built by sigismund iii and which since his time has been the principal residence of the polish monarchs the palace stands upon a rising ground at a small distance from the vistula and commands a fine view of that river and the adjacent country next to the audiencechamber is an appartment fited up with marble which his majesty has dedicated by the following inscription to the memory of his predecessors the kings of poland regum memoriae dicavit stanislaus augustus bocce momentum      the portraits of the sovereigns are ranged in chronological order the series begins from boleslaus and is carried down to his present majesty whose picture is not finished these heads are all painted by bacciarelli and well executed the portraits of the earlier kings are sketched from the painters imagination but that of ladislaus ii and most of his successors are copied from real originals altogether they produce a pleasing effect and may be considered as an agreeable species of genealogical table in the adjoining apartment are hung the heads of the members of the kings literary society  the court days do not exhibit any great circle of polish lords the most considerable in the kingdom are not only in opposition to the crown but even in open arms against it but the officers who are obliged to attend the nobles of the kings party together with foreign ministers and russian officers fill the room pretty well  cracow stands on a spacious plain near the vistula and occupies a vast extent of ground the inhabitants scarcely amount to   000 so badly is it peopled the houses are for the most part of stone and many of them well built and were once richly furnished and very magnificent but most of them at this period are uninhabited or in a melancholy state of decay the town exhibits the remains of ancient magnificence and from the numbers of falling and fallen houses it appears as though it had been lately sacked and looks like a great capital in ruins the marks of grapeshot and cannon are discernible on its walls from the fury of charles xii who beseiged it and caused great devastation at the commencement of the present century but it has suffered still more by the repeated sieges it has undergone when alternately in the possession of the russians and confederates it is surrounded with high brick walls fortified with round and square towers after the old manner of fortification the streets are broad and handsome but almost every house wears the appearance of ruined grandeur yet the churches have retained their original splendour this city is famous for a university founded and endowed by cassimer the great and finished about the year   0  and improved and completed by ladislaus iaghellon  the cathedral is a noble building and is dedicated to st stanislaus formerly bishop of the sea whom bolislaus ii killed at the altar with his own hands because the good bishops admonitions were grown insupportable to him the remains of st stanislaus are enclosed in a silver shrine and masses are continually performed day and night in this church in the treasury of the cathedral among other things of great value the regalia namely the crown and scepter are deposited and on this occasion the treasurer of the kingdom has the care of it the kings of poland are always crowned and their remains are interred in this church  toward the southern part of the town near the vistula rises a small eminence upon whose top is a palace surrounded with brickwalls and old towers which form a kind of citadel to the town it was founded by ladislaus jaghellon the greatest part of it was demolished by charles the xii in   0  when he entered the town in triumph after the battle of clissow there are some remains of the old structure consisting of a few apartments which remain in the state they existed in the last century the walls of the apartments are painted with tilts and tournaments and some represent the coronations of the kings of poland others are painted with grotesque shapes and carved heads of extraordinary appearances they are all of large dimensions and show the remains of ancient magnificence but are entirely without furniture since the year   00 the laws of poland have expressly enjoined that cracow should be the place of coronation and such has been the superstitious attachment of the poles to this custom that when john sliesky was desirous of being crowned at leopold on account of its vicinity to the army which he was to command against the turks at the time of his election the polish patriots strongly opposed any innovation and he was obliged to repair to cracow for the performance of the ceremony since ladislaus all the succeeding kings except the present have been consciated at cracow it has often been consumed by fire and was once visited by the plague in   0  and   0  which swept away several thousands of the inhabitnts the city is supposed to have been founded by a polish or bohemian prince of the name of cracus in the year of christ  00 from whom it takes its name here is likewise the burial place of cracus not far from the city is another of his daughter venda who it is said drowned herself in the vistula that she might not be compelled to marry a person for whom she had entertained an aversion  the houses in poland consist chiefly of groundfloors for they seldom live up stairs neither are their buildings united but the dwelling house is over against the gate the kitchen and offices on one side a round or square court and the stables on the other which are all generally built of wood some there are who affect to imitate the italians and build much higher with stone or brick and some of their towns are very regularly built and are three or four stories high the rooms are usually hung with tapestry and the rest of the furniture is proportionably rich except where they are liable to the incursions of the tartars and there they keep as little furniture as possible the houses of the peasants are no better than huts built with poles in a round form and open on the top to let out the smoke they are covered with boards or thatch and as they seldom consist of more than one room the people and their cattle sleep together  chap ii of the people their customs manners etc the poles in their persons make a noble appearance and are rather tall than short their complexions fair and their hair usually of a pale yellow their deportment is stately and their countenance of a serious aspect they possess great corporal strength and are long lived in their features and general appearance they resemble asiatics rather than europeans and are certainly descended from tartar ancesters it has been remarked that the singular manner in which they poles wear their hair is the most ancient token of their origin for so early as the fifth century some nations who were comprehended under the name of sythians had the same custom for at the court of attila a scythian lord is described whose head was shaved in a circular form which perfectly agrees with the present fashion in poland the dress of the poles is rather singular but elegant they wear a vest which reaches down to the middle of the leg and a kind of gown over it lined with furs and girded with a sash with slieves close to the arm like a waistcoat also a fur cap and their shirts are without collar or wristbands they have neither stock nor neckcloth their breeches make but one piece with their stockings and instead of shoes turkey leather boots are in use with their soles and deep iron heels bent like a half moon they bear a sabre and poleaxe never putting them off but when they go to bed the sabre hangs by a leathern strap with their handerchief knife and sheath and a small stone set in silver to whet the knife on when on horseback which is very frequent for a pole cannot stir a mile without his horse they wear over all a short cloak which is commonly covered with furs both within and without the better sort of people wear sables and others the skins of tigers leopards etc the peasants usually clothe themselves with a sheepskin with the wool on in winter and in summer a thick coarse cloth and make buskins and shoes of the bark of trees their shirts are of a thick linen and they wear drawers the habit of the women is similar to that of the men but the fashion of both sexes has of late years very much imitated the french and english modes the women of the lower class wear on their heads a wrapper of white linen under which their hair is braided and hangs down in two plaits several of them have a long piece of white linen hanging by the side of their faces and covering their bodies below their knees which gives them the appearance of doing penance the dress of the ladies is a simple polnaise or long robe edged with fur  the common food of poland is beef or veal mutton is not in much esteem venison wildfowl and river fish they have in great plenty but no seafish they eat but little bread though there is such a quantity of corn preferring roots which they dress various ways soup and broth they do not regard neither are they send of roasting their meat too much in their sauces they use a great deal of saffron and spices and season their dishes very high they are immoderate lovers of bacon peace are reserved for the better rank of people they are as fond of mushrooms as the muscovites and pickle their cabbage and preserve it all the year round their usual drink is beer which in some parts is made only of malt but in others of ground wheat in lithuania and many provinces of poland they have mead or metheslin and at warsaw they frequently mix the juice of cherries blackberries etc with their honey and give it different names but besides the product of the country beer and mead they have great quantities of wine imported from hungary france spain italy and germany that of hungary exceeds the spanish in strength and is brought over the carpathian mountains in large casks drawn upon carriages by oxen which renders it very dear the best being sold for twenty shillings the polish pot which is three quarts the italian wines likewise come by land but are not so much drank as the rest the french and rhenish wines come by way of the baltic to dantzick and are much weaker than the others all their strong waters and spirits are extracted from wheat barley oats cider etc they are drank by the common people though sometimes in winter the higher class use them when rendered palatable with anniseed cinnamon and other spices their liquors are all in general very strong and well suited to their hardy manner of living  the poles are an animated people and are for the most part openhearted and honest more prone to be deceived than capable of deceit and not so easily provoked as appeased courteous affable and most hospitable to strangers of great spirit and exceed all other nations in vivacity they use much action in ordinary conversation apply themselves early to learning but having acquired a complete knowledge of the latin language neglect to study more the women speak latin fluently and it is said they learn it in their nunneries the nobility and gentry are fond of arms and possess a passion for traveling endeavoring to qualify themselves for employments in church and state they leave the care of trade and husbandry to common people and are in general so innured to hardships that the germans are deemed an effeminate race in comparison of them their armies have been often been known to lie abroad in the snow all the winter and if they were well disciplined their troops would be invincible  both men and women are fond of parade and extravagance and in nothing do they evince their disposition for magnificence more than in the multitudes of their servants horses and arms a polish gentleman dresses his servant equal with himself presently reduces his estate to keep up the idle ceremonies of his establishment he himself has often forty different suits of clothes the richest imaginable but these are handed down from father to son the nobles and chief gentry have all their horse and foot guards which attend night and day at their gates and houses these go before their masters coach in the streets and they never appear in greater pomp than when at the general diet or assembly of the states their numbers vary from four hundred to a thousand and they esteem themselves superior to german princes especially those of the senate who indeed want little to distinguish them from sovereigns in their respective districts but the privilege of coining money at their meals trumpets and music play and a great number of gentlemen wait on them at table it is usual for a nobleman to give meat to his servant as he waits behind him which he receives and eats standing serving his master with the most profound respect with wine or whatever he may call for this circumstance will appear less strange when we consider that many of the inferior nobility submit to enter into the service of the superior which in poland is considered as no disgrace for in general they are treated liberally suffered to eat at the same table and have a peasantboy to wait on them but should any of these gentlemenservants neglect their duty they are whipped naked with little regard to their quality even this punishment is not considered as disgraceful nor any situation they may be subject to provided they never apply themselves to trade or husbandry either employment being deemed infamous for a polish gentleman  the ladies of the polish grandees often carry their extravagance to a pitch of refinement truly ridiculous it is not unusual to see one of these ladies attended in her train of servants and coach with six horses by an old gentleman usher a governante and a dwarf of each sex to bear a train and if it be night she is surrounded with flambeaux her equipage the reader will have an idea of if he figures to himself every thing that is shewy in life every thing that is magnificent ceremonious and expensive pomp in general is limited only by the extent of the estate though that not unfrequently falls a victim to the vanity of its owner who being forbidden by the rules of honor to enrich himself by trade is reduced to perfect beggary or obliged to enter into the service of the nobles  the mode of salutation among the poles is by inclining their heads and striking their breasts with one of their hands while they stretch the other toward the ground but when a common person meets a superior he bows his head almost to the earth waving at the same time his hand with which he touches the bottom of the leg near the feet of the person to whom he pays his obeisance men of all ranks generally wear whiskers and shave their heads leaving only a circle of hair upon the crown  they are fond of society and entertain in the most friendly manner they find neither spoons knives or forks but every person brings his own the moment their guests enter the house the gates are immediately shut nor are suffered to be opened until the company depart every man of distinction sets his hall apart for the purpose of entertainment in which is a place railed in where an immense quantity of plate is shown and over it a gallery for music which consists of an organ violins etc those who are invited bring their servants with them and although there is always a profusion of every delicacy there is very little returned to the family but the gentlemans servants seize what is left and they have a napkin on purpose to carry off the sweetmeats for their ladies after the cloth is removed the gentlemen usually sit and drink a great while and smoke tobacco when the ladies retire the women are always admitted to their feasts and drink wine in bumpers which is customary with the poles nor will they easily excuse the gentlemen from pledging them  as a proof of the magnificence and elegance of the polish entertainments we shall add an account of a fete champetre as described by mr coxe and given by the princess zartoriski to lord herbert  povonski the villa of prince adam zartoriski is about three miles from warsaw in the midst of a forest the situation is almost level with here and there a gentle slope which produces an agreeable variety a river runs through the grounds which are laid out in the english taste with a beautiful intermixture of lawn and wood walks are cut through the wood and carried along the side of the water the house which stands upon a gentle rise has the appearance of a cottage constructed like those of the peasants with trunks of trees piled upon each other and thatched with straw besides the principal building inhabited by the prince and princess there are separate cottages for the children and attendants ch of which has its enclosures and a small garden this group of structures bears the resemblance of a village composed of huts scattered at a small distance from each other other buildings such as summerhouses pavillions rustic sheds and ruins are dispersed throughout the grounds the stables are constructed in the form of a halfdemolished amphitheatre several romantic bridges rudely composed of trunks and bent branches of trees contribute to heigthen the rusticity of the scenery  upon our arrival we repaired to the principal cottage where the princess was ready to receive us we expected the inside to be furnished in the simple style of a peasants hovel but were surprised to find every species of elegant magnificence which riches and taste could collect all the apartments are decorated in the most costly manner but the splendor of the bathroom was peculiarly striking the sides are covered from top to bottom with small square pieces of dresden china each ornamented with a sprig and the border and cieling are painted with beautiful festoons the expense of fitting up this apartment must have been prodigious as i was informed there were at least three thousand square pieces of china used each of which cost at dresden three ducats or  l  s  d  after having surveyed all the apartments we proceeded to an enclosure near the house surrounded with large blocks of granite heaped one upon another and fallen trees placed in the most natural and picturesque shapes here we drank tea upon the lawn from thence we repaired to the several cottages inhabited by the children which are fitted up in different styles but with equal elegance every thing without doors conveyed an idea of a happy peasants family and all within was costliness and state such a contrast of simplicity and magnificence can hardly be conceived we next walked round the grounds which are elegantly laid out in our taste of gardening the company then all adjourned to a turkish tent of rich and curious workmanship pitched in a beautiful retired field near the stables which represent a ruined amphitheatre this tent belonged to the grand vizier and was taken during the late war between the russians and the turks under it was a settee and a carpet spread upon the ground here we staid conversing until it was quite dark when the princess proposed returning she led us through the house to a small spot of rising ground where we were suddenly struck with a most beautiful illumination a rustic bridge consisting of a single arch over a broad piece of water was studded with several thousand lamps of different colors while the reflection of this illuminated bridge in the water was so strong as to deceive the eye and give the whole the appearance of a brilliant circle suspended in the air the effect was splendid beyond description and considerably heightened by the gloom of the forest in the background while we continued admiring this delightful scene a bank of music struck up at a little distance and amused us with an excellent concert  we were then lead from this exchanting spot across the illuminated bridge to a thatched pavillion opened at the sides and supported by pillars ornamented by garlands and twisted festoons of flowers we found within a cold collation and sat down to a table covered with all kinds of delicacies with the most costly wines and every species of fruit which art or nature could furnish the evening was delightful the scenery picturesque the fare delicious the company in good spirits for who could be otherwise when every circumstance which the taste and ingenuity of our fair hostess could invent conspired to heighten the entertainment the collation being ended we rose from table which i concluded to be the close of the entertainment but was agreeably disappointed the gardens were suddenly illuminated we all ranged about as fancy dictated and were gratified by the sound of wind instruments played by persons dispersed in different parts of the grounds we repassed the bridge and returned into the cottage when the two eldest daughters of the princess who were dressed in grecian dresses of the most elegant simplicity performed a polish and a cossac dance the former serious and graceful the latter comic and lively the eldest son a boy about eight years old next performed a hornpipe with wonderful agility and afterward a dance in the style of the polish peasants with much humor it was now past two in the morning we seemed as if we could stay for ever but as there must be an end of all sublunary joys we took our leave expressing our thanks and gratitude in language far unequal to our feelings i can scarce form to myself a fete champetre so elegant and i am satisfied it will seldom fall to the lot of the same person to partake of such a pleasing entertainment twice in his life  the amusements and exercises of the poles contribute much to their health their diversions being warlike and manly hunting and feats of horsemanship they value themselves greatly on leaping vaulting and jumping is much in fashion and dancing is a favorite amusement music has its charms with this people and tends much to promote the natural vivacity of their dispositions and conversation in which they excel and are extremely fond of it  the polish noblemen are assiduous to amuse and it is considered essential in the etiquette of hospitality to invent whatever may be novel or will tend to the satisfaction of their guests in their endeavors and indeed in their houses decorations and furniture they happily blend the english and french modes their generosity is intimately connected with their politeness and as they spare no expense and have naturally a good taste they always succeed in creating pleasure and surprise  the polish gentlemen generally travel on horseback but the country being open and but few hills a calash and pair of horses is very much used on a journey the peasants have little wooden wagons tilted with a kind of basket work and their wheels all of a piece without spokes travelers seldom meet with any thing to eat in the country inns in poland but are obliged to buy provisions in the towns and carry them with their baggage this inconveniency is somewhat obviated in the persons of foreigners who if they want a supply send to the lord of the village who furnishes them with every necessary their inns are but few and those very miserable the innkeepers choosing not to provide more than sufficient for their own family owing to the want of honesty in the natives when they travel finding from experience that their guests are seldom in the mind to make any returns for their entertainment the inns have boarded booths at the end of which are little rooms with a fireplace but without furniture where the traveller may sleep if he pleases but the fleas and other vermin will so disturb him that he had better retire and contentedly repose with his cattle  passing through forests the traveller frequently observes the traces of former enclosures and sometimes even the vestiges of paved streets are discernible he is often impeded by waters whose bridges are kept but in ill repair and it is necessary to be very careful in passing them and in winter a sledge must be procured for the coach or calash to pass over the ice the cold is extreme in the northern parts of the country for which reason it is necessary to provide coats lined with fur and cases to put the feet in when riding in a calash horsemen line their boots and seldom travel without a cordial dram the horse is sometimes in danger of being frozen against which they use the same remedy as the russians by rubbing it with snow  mr coxe thus speaks of the roads and of the inconvenience of traveling i never saw a road so barren of interesting scenes as that from cracow to warsaw there is not a single object throughout the whole tract which can for a moment draw the attention of the most inquisitive traveller the country for the most part is level with little variation of surface and is chiefly overspread with vast tracts of thick gloomy forests and even where the country was more open the distant horizon was always skirted with wood the trees were mostly pines and firs intermixed with beech birch and small oaks the occasional breaks in the forest presented some pastureground and here and there a few meagre crops of corn  without having actually traversed it i could hardly have conceived so comfortless a region a forlorn stilness and solitude prevailed almost throughout the whole extent with few symptoms of an inhabited and still less of a civilized country though in the high road which unites cracow to warsaw in the course of about     english miles we met in our progress only two carriages and about a dozen carts the country was equally thin of human inhabitants a few straggling villages all built of wood succeeded one another at long intervals whose miserable appearance corresponded to the wretchedness of the country around them in these assemblages of huts the only places of reception for travelers were hovels belonging to jews totally destitute of furniture and every species of accommodation  we could seldom procure any other room but that in which the family lived in the article of provision eggs and milk were our greatest luxuries and could not always be obtained our only bed was straw thrown upon the ground and we thought ourselves happy if we could get it clean even we who were by no means delicate and who had long been accustomed to put up with all inconveniences found ourselves distressed in this land of desolation though in most countries we made a point to suspend our journey during night in order that no scene might escape our observation yet we here preferred continuing our rout without intermission to the penance we endured in the receptacles of penury and filth and we have reason to believe the darkness of the night deprived us of nothing but the sight of gloomy forests indifferent crops of corn and objects of human misery the road bore as few marks of industry as the country it intersects it was best where it was sandy in other parts it was scarce passable and in the marshy grounds where some labor was absolutely necessary to make it support the carriages it was raised with sticks and boughs of trees thrown promiscuously on the surface or formed by trunks of trees laid crossways  in the marriage ceremonies or burials of the poles there is little that requires a particular description but it is observable that they celebrate them with vast pomp and expense and it is customary for all at the wedding to contribute to the portion of the bride by giving present which are often very magnificent by the laws of poland the estate of the father is equally divided among his children except any of them go into a monastery and then their portion is divided among the rest the younger children as in other popish countries are encouraged by their parents to take the vow upon them that their estates may be preserved entire for the eldest son which would otherwise dwindle away to nothing where there happens to be a numerous issue  the diseases of the poles are very few that of the plica is the most painful and is supposed to proceed from an acrid viscous humor penetrating into the hair which is tubular it then exudes either from its sides or extremities and clots the whole together either in separate folds or in one undistinguished mass its symptoms more or less violent according to the constitution of the patient or malignity of the disease are itchings swellings eruptions ulcers intermitting fevers pains in the head langour lowness of spirits rheumatism gout and sometimes with convulsions palsy and madness these symptoms gradually decrease as the hair becomes affected if the patient is shaved on the head he relapses into all the dreadful complaints which preceded the eruption of the plica and he continues to labor under them until a fresh growth of hair absorbs the ancient humor this disorder is deemed hereditary and is proved to be contagious when in a virulent state many physical causes have been supposed to render the plica more frequent in these regions than in any other parts and it would be endless to enumerate the various conjectures with which each person has supported his favorite hypothesis but the most probable are those assigned to dr vicat the first cause is the nature of the polish air which is rendered insalubrious by numerous woods and morasses and occasionally derives an uncommon keenness even in the midst of summer from the position of the carpathian mountains for the southern and south easterly winds which usually convey warmth in other regions are in this chilled in their passage over their snowy summits the second is unwholesome water for although poland is not deficient in good springs yet the common people usually drink that which is nearest at hand taken indiscriminately from rivers lakes and even standing pools the third cause is the inattention of the natives to cleanliness for experience shows that those who are not negligent in their persons and habitations are less liable to be afflicted with the plica than others who are deficient in that particular in a word the plica polonica appears to be a contagious distemper which like the leprosy still prevails among a people ignorant in medicine and inattentive to check its progress but it is very rarely known in those countries where proper precautions are taken to prevent it spreading  chap iii of their trade manufactures etc there are few manufacturers in poland and the commodities of the country are for the most part exported unwrought out of the kingdom religious zeal or rather bigotry has greatly injured the trade and commerce of poland but so late as the year      manufactures have been established which seem to promise success under the patronag of the present amiable monarch these manufactures employ  000 persons including those dispersed in the contiguous villages who spin linen and worsted thread here are twenty foreigners who direct the different branches the rest are natives belonging to the kings demesnes the apprentices are boys and girls all children of the polish peasants who are clothed and fed and have besides a small allowance in money the directors says mr coxe complain of their having no emulation among them and that although they are better fed and clothed than the other peasants yet they cannot excite them to industry by any other means than force nor is this a matter of wonder for as they still continue in a state of servitude if they acquire any unusual profit and carry it to their parents they are apprehensive lest it should be taken away it having frequently happened that any little pittance they had gained by their labor has been wrested from in order to pay the quitrents which their parents owed to their lords one of the apprentices more shrewd than than the rest said to the director who was trying to stimulate her industry what advantage shall i attain if i follow your advice let me become ever so skillful in my trade i shall always continue subject to my master the labor will be mine the profit his  to which observation no reply could be given most of them adds mr coxe appeared with a settled melancholy in their countenances as made my heart ach to see them and it was easy to perceive they worked from compulsion and not from inclination  as some remedy for this evil it has been proposed after a certain time of years to give liberty to those who particularly excel and distinguish themselves by any extraordinary exertions but this humane proposal has been rejected from a notion that such persons when once made free would do longer continue to work and that by these means the manufactures would be deprived of their best hands though this inconvenience however might occasionally take place yet the encouragement of such a regulation would beget alacrity and excite industry and would therefore create a greater number of artists than it would emancipate it would now and then occasion the loss of a manufacturer but it would diffuse such a knowledge of the manufacture as to render the loss immaterial  the manufactures are still in their infancy but their institution reflects considerable luster upon his present majestys reign and more particularly as his attention was not withdrawn from them during the civil commotions which so lately shook his throne  the manufactures are chiefly of linen leather hardware and earthenware and these are far from being improved as they might be the better sort of people looking upon every thing that relates to trade or mechanic employments as beneath their care and the lower class being vassals to the rest have neither time nor stock to make any considerable improvement  the language of the poles is the sclavonian but there are so many different dialects of it spoken in the different provinces of this kingdom that one part of the people scarce understand the other they all however agree in multiplying consonants and if they did not sound more vowels when they speak than are contained in the words they write it would be impossible to utter them the latin is as universally spoken as the sclavonian there being a school in every village for the teaching it and the girls learn it in their nunneries it is spoken even by the the lower class of people but without any regard to accent quantity or purity of language from the time of king sigismund i to the reign of wladislaus iv was the interval when arts and sciences flourished most in poland since that era the polish muse seems to have drooped and languished however they now begin to revive for at present the purity and elegance of the polish and latin languages are studied the new philosophy is introduced the mathematics are taught and natural philosophy flourishes the learned in this country also apply themselves to the study of polish history which they cultivate and improve endeavoring to make the good writers of former ages better known and useful to the present this and the valuable library of count zaluski at warsaw opens an inestimable treasure of ancient authors the greek language begins to be studied in poland and literary correspondences are carried on with learned foreigners it is true the press has not produced so many books in poland as in other countries but this may be imputed in a great measure to a want of able publishers liberal patrons of learning and well regulated printinghouses  there are two universities one at cracow and the other at vilna the former was under the direction of priests called academicians and the latter superintended by the jesuits but in both the course of study was chiefly confined to theology since the suppression of the jesuits the king has established a committee of education composed of members distinguished either by high station or enlightened understandings this committee has an absolute power in matters of education appoints professors regulates their salaries and directs their studies the advantages of this regulation have already been experienced the university of cracow has been called the mother of polish literature principally supplying all the other seminaries with professors and learned men but the removal of the royal residence to warsaw together with its civil and intestine commotions have greatly obscured its luster its most flourishing period was under sigismund augustus in the sixteenth century when several german reformists fled from the persecutions of the emperor charles v and took refuge in this city these reformists gave versions of some of the sacred writings and other theological publications which spread the reformed religion over great part of poland the protection afforded by sigismund augustus to men of learning of all denominations and the universal toleration to every sect of christians created a suspicion that he was inclined to the new church had publicly renounced the catholic faith and avowed the reformed religion  although says mr coxe from the nature of the government learning has never been widely diffused in poland yet there never have been wanting men of genius and literature who have been an ornament to their country and perhaps no nation can boast a more regular succession of excellent historians or a greater variety of writers deeply conversant in the laws statutes and constitution under sigismund i and his son sigismund augustus the arts and sciences began to be greatly distinguished by royal patronage they were cherished by some of the succeeding monarchs particularly john sobieski but o prince has paid them more attention than the present king stanislaus augustus his munificence in this particular has been attended with the happiest effects the polish literati have within a few years given to the public a much greater variety of elegant compositions than ever appeared in any former period of the same length what is more material a taste for science has spread itself among the nobles and begins to be regarded as an accomplishment the enlargement of mind derived from the licentious spirit of the nobles from this new pursuit has already weaned several of them from their habits of barbarous turbulence and greatly civilized their civil deportment it may in time teach them thoroughly to comprehend the true interest of their country and the expedience of due subordination hitherto deemed incompatible with liberty these petty despots will perhaps be induced to lay aside that contempt for their vassals they will perceive that the burghers and peasants are the true supports of their country and that poland wants nothing but justice and order to become as flourishing as the neighboring states  the present king studiously encourages all attempts to refine and polish his native tongue and for the promotion of learning gives a dinner every thursday to men of science and abilities his majesty himself presides at table and takes the lead in the graces of conversation as much as in rank the persons admitted to this society read occasionally treatises upon different topics of history natural philosophy and other miscellaneous subjects poetry is likewise cultivated at these meetings  the established religion in poland is that of the roman catholic and few people possibly are more zeaolus or bigoted in their way which proceeds from the constant opposition and the provocations they meet with from the lutherans and calvinists there is a decree that no person shall be elected king of poland without first making a solemn profession of the orthodox roman catholic religion and that the queen must either have been brought up in that communion or publicly declare herself a member of it neither arians socinians or anabaptists are not tolerated in poland the protestants by virtue of the treaty signed at oliva in the year      solicited and obtained a free exercise of their religion but a great number of their churches have been taken from them and demolished and such open violation of the laws of justice and equity are of late become so frequent that the protestants at this time possess only twenty two churches in the cities and towns and sixtyfive in the villages of poland the greeks are equally oppressed with the protestants whilst the jews are indulged with innumerable priviliges and abound so much that the country is styled the paradise of the jews it is said there are above two millions of jews only in the villages of poland but to show how great is the superiority of the popish religion it must be observed that the king is styled orthodoxus as a title of honor that st floridan and st adalbert are worshipped as the patron saints of poland that the number of monasteries in this kingdom amounts to     and of nunneries to     besides two hundred and fortysix seminaries and thirtyone abbeys and lastly the clergy are possessed of two thirds of the lands and revenues of the kingdom  there are two archbishops and fourteen bishops the primate of poland is the archbishop of gnesna who styles himself the popes legate borne by virtue of a decree of the council of lateran his power is almost equal to the kings and has a golden cross carried before him when he visits the king the great chamberlain receives him at the stairs foot and the king comes into the antichamber to meet him during a vacancy in the throne he is interrex  neither the regular or secular clergy of poland are to be admired for their morals though the people as in all other popish countries give them abundance of respect and in most of their courts of judicature some of the judges are of the clergy pluralities are allowed and the clergy make no scruple of living at a distance from their cures the laity on the contrary are devout and generous in the benefactions to their churches and altars of the saints but are not very compassionate toward the distressed and poor suffering frequently their own slaves and menial servants to perish for want of necessaries and behaving to these unhappy wretches as if they were of another species socinianism has made a great progress in this kingdom during the last century and there have been acts of state in several reigns particularly in the last for the extirpation of all people of that persuasion notwithstanding which they suffer mahometanism and there are no less than  0000 tartars in lithuania who are allowed the free exercise of that religion the armenians and others of the greek church have also on the frontiers of muscovy and podolia bishops abbots and priests of their persuasion with the free exercise of their religion and all dissidents are permitted to have churches without bells schools and seminaries and are rendered capable of sitting in inferior courts of justice and in the tribunal appointed to receive appeals in matters of religion  chap iv of their government revenues etc the poles when considered as members of the community are either nobles citizens in which class merchants artists and mechanics are included or peasants who are mostly vassals to the nobles it is not easy to estimate the number of inhabitants of poland but some have supposed the kingdom together with lithuania to contain   000000 and when it is remembered that they have no colonies have often enjoyed peace for many years and possessing no fewer than  000000 jews which are said to dwell in their villages exclusive of them in their towns and cities the calculation may not appear greatly exaggerated  the nobles of poland have from time immemorial resided in the country and each inhabiting his own seat or castle manages his estate by his vassals or hired servants and maintains himself and his whole family by agriculture breeding of bees grazing and hunting some of the nobility spend part of their time in the cities or towns there are among the polish nobility gentes or tribes and these are divided into distinct families distinction is not owing to the different places or provinces where they live but are ranked according to the names and arms they bear though poland has its princes counts and barons yet the whole noblesse are naturally on a level excepting the difference arising from the posts some of them enjoy hence all those of noble birth call each other brothers  the polish nobility enjoy a great number of privileges and indeed the boasted liberty of the kingdom remains only with the nobles for they have the power of life and death over their vassals who on that account groan under an oppressive slavery every nobleman is absolute lord of his estates insomuch that the king cannot demand any subsidy from him nor oblige him to maintain or find quarter for any soldiers  the peasants in poland as in all feudal governments are slaves but they are not all in an equal state of subjection they are distinguished into two sorts the germans and the natives during the reign of boleslaus the chaste and particularly in that of cassimir the great many germans settled in poland who had the privilege on enjoying their own laws and their descendants still continue the possession of several privileges not given to the polish peasants the good effects of these privileges are very evident in the general state of their domestic economy their villages are better built their estates better cultivated than those of the native poles they have more heads of cattle pay their lords more punctually and are much neater in their persons and general appearance the native peasant has ever labored under the tyranny and oppression of his lord and his slavery has always been extremely rigorous until the time of cassimir the great when the lord could not put his prisoner to death with impunity for in      cassimir levied a fine for the murder of a peasant and enacted that in case of his decease without issue his immediate heir should inherit and that because he was capable of bearing arms he should be considered as a freeman  by such benevolent exertions and regulations did this amiable monarch endeavor to alleviate the miserable vassalage of his subjects but they have all proved ineffectual against the power and tyranny of the nobles who have either eluded or caused them to be abrogated even now there are above an hundred laws unfavourable to the peasants which among other greivances erect summary tribunals subject to no appeals and impose the and impose the severest penalties on those who quit their habitations without leave from such numerous and oppressive edicts to prevent their emigration do the peasants suffer such extreme wretchedness who cannot be detained in their native country but by the terror of the severest punishments  the government of poland is with very great propriety styled a republic because the king is so extremely limited in his prerogative that he more resembles the chief of a commonwealth than the sovereign of a powerful monarchy the supreme legislative authority of the republic resides in the three estates of the realm the king the senate and equestrian order assembled in a national diet the executive power which was heretofore entrusted to the king and senate is now according to the new form of government invested in the permanent council the crown of poland is elective and all order of succession prescribed any person who endeavors to break this law is considered as an enemy to his country and is liable to be punished accordingly no person can be chosen king but a man of noble origin that is any gentleman who is a native of poland and possesses landed property in the kingdom  his majestys titles are king of poland great duke of lithuania duke of russia prussia massorie samogitia keivie etc the arms of the crown of poland are in the first and fourth gules an eagle argent crowned and armed or with some other bearings for the dukedoms  the mode of election is somewhat singular the place of assembly is in an open field near the village of wola not far from warsaw it is surrounded with a ditch and a rampart and has three gates one of which is toward the east for great poland the second toward the south for little poland and the third facing the west is for lithuania the senators or counselors of state are accomodated on this occasion with a woodenhouse built for that purpose without this ediice the representatives assemble in a place called kola that is a circle or crown and those noblemen who attend the election in person pitch their tents at a greater distance from it the sovereign is elected by the spiritual and temporal counselors of state and none but roman catholics dare appear at the ceremony the king is elected on horseback and in case their should be a turbulent minority the majority immediately quell the tumult by cuting them to pieces with their sabres the king elect then swears to observe the pacta conventa which are drawn up in the polish language and administered by the states after this he is proclaimed king and crowned in the cathedral of cracow by the arch bishop of gnesna in signing the pactaconventa he engages to introduce no foreigners into the army or government so that in fact he is little more than the president of the senate which is composed of a primate the archbishop of lemburgh the bishops and   0 laymen consisting of the great officers of state the palatines and castellans the king is not permitted to enter into war to assemble an army conclude a peace or make any public alliances neither is he invested with the power of sending envoys on any important occasion imposing taxes contributions or customs or of coining money without the consent of the states he can make no laws determine no religious disputes nor can he alienate any of the royal demesnes neither is he permitted to undertake or carry into execution any matters of importance that concern the kingdom without the consent of the states duly convened his chief prerogative is the having the disposal of the posts of honor and royal demesnes but without consulting the states he cannot increase or diminish the honorary posts nor confer upon one person more than one office neither is it in his power to displace any person when once appointed  should the king be absent his place is supplied by the archbishop of gnesna if that see is vacant by the bishop of plosko  the constitution of poland is subject to so many changes that it is difficult to speak of it with certainty for it is new modelled with every king according to the pacta conventa he is obliged to sign yet it still preserves the outlines of a noble and free government  the diets of poland are extraordinary the former meet once in two or three years and the latter is summoned by the king upon critical emergencies but one dissenting voice renders all their deliberations ineffectual  on important measures the king sends the heads of the business that is to be treated of which are given to the provincial diet assembled for the purpose of consultation the starosts are governors and judges in their particular starosties or districts and make reports of the opinion of the assemblies  there are ten principal officers of state who are senators the two great marshalls one of poland the other of lithuania the chancellor of the kingdom and the chancellor of the duchy the treasurer of the kingdom and of the duchy the submarshal or marshal of the court of the kingdom and the same of the court of the duchy the king presides over the public welfare which is committed to his care and he consults the states about every thing relative to the kingdom he is the protector both of the laws and his subjects and all courts of judicature are held in his name he grants titles of nobility but not privileges annexed to those titles which require the consent of the states and when no diet is assembled he can consult with the counselors and ministers of his court he can summon the nobility on any emergency has the chief command of the army and possesses many other prerogatives of less importance  the most extraordinary characteristic is the constitution of poland and which seems peculiarly to distinguish this government from all others both in ancient and modern times is the liberum veto or tribunal negative that is vested in every member of a diet or dietine and which must ever be destructive of good order and government because they have not only like the tribunes of ancient rome a power of putting a negative upon any law but even of dissolving the assembly that every member of a numerous society should be invested with such a dangerous privilege in the midst of the most important national transactions is a circumstance at once incredible pregnant with anarchy and detrimental to the public welfare the privilege originated under the administration of john cassimir in the year      when the diet of warsaw was debating upon transactions of the utmost consequence which required a speedy determination one sicinski nuntio of ulpita in lithuania cried out i stop the proceedings having uttered these words he quitted the assembly and repairing immediately to the chancellor protested that as many acts had been proposed and carried contrary to the constitution of the republic if the diet continued to sit he should consider it as an infringment of the laws the members were thunderstruck at a protest of this nature hitherto unknown warm debates ensued about the continuing or dissolving the diet at length however the venal and discontented faction that supported the protest obtained the majority and the assembly broke up in confusion  from the continual revolutions which the constitution of poland suffers we may easily infer that notwithstanding their boasted liberty the poles are by no means a free people indeed their historians however they may differ in many points unanimously agree in reprobating their affectation of liberty the shadow rather than the reality of freedom which is in fact merely a turbulent system of aristocratic licentiousness where a few members of the community are above the control of law while the majority are excluded from its protection as a proof of this assertion and prevailing discontent and licentiousness no circumstance can better evince its truth than the following extraordinary attempt upon the life of his present majesty the particulars of which we beg leave to give our readers as authentically related by mr coxe the story is affecting and interesting to an englishman because the person of his present majesty stanislaus augustus is well known to many and his residence in england all must be acquainted with  the king being considered by a set of confederates as unlawfully elected they imputed to his fatal elevation all the various ills under which the kingdom groaned from the oppression of the russians and formed a plan the most daring modern history can mention by an attempt to assassinate him  a polish nobleman named pulaski a general in the army of the confederates was the person who formed the dangerous enterprise and the conspirators who executed it were about forty in number headed by three chiefs lukawski strawenski and kosinksi these chiefs had been engaged and hired by pulaski who obliged them by the most solemn oath either to deliver up the king alive into his hands if possible or else put him to death they were to have thirtyseven persons to assist them on the  d of november they obtained admission into warsaw unsuspected or undiscovered by disguising themselves as peasants who came to sell hay which they brought in wagons the more effectually to escape detection  on sunday night the  d of september      a few of these conspirators remained in the town and the others placed themselves when his majesty was expected to pass at his usual hour of returning to the palace the king had been on a visit to his uncle prince zartoriski grand chancellor of lithuania and was on his return from thence between nine and ten oclock he was in his coach accompanied by his aiddecamp and fifteen or sixteen attendants when attacked by the conspirators he was only at the distance of two hundred paces from the princes palace who commanded the coachman to stop on pain of instant death they fired several shots into the carriage one of which passed through the body of a heyduc who endeavored to defend his master from the violence of the assassins the aiddecamp together with all the remainder of the attendants immediately fled and endeavored to secure themselves mean while the king had opened the door of his carriage to effect his escape under the shelter of the night which was extremely dark he had even alighted when the assassins seized him by the hair exclaiming with horrible execrations we have thee now thy hour is come  one discharged a pistol at him so very near that he felt the heat of the flash whilst another cut him across the head with his sabre and penetrated the bone then seizing him by the collar and mounting him on herseback they dragged him along the ground between their horses at full gallop for near five hundred paces through the streets of warsaw all was confusion and disorder during this time at the palace where the attendants who had deserted their master had spread the alarm the footguards ran to the spot from whence the king had been conveyed but found only his hat which being bloody increased their apprehensions for his life the whole city being in an uproar the assassins profitted by the general confusion and finding the king almost incapable of breathing from the violence with which they had dragged him they mounted him on horseback and redoubled their speed fearing to be overtaken when they came to the ditch at warsaw they forced him to leap his horse over which in attempting the horse fell and broke his leg they then mounted his majesty on another all covered with dirt as he was and having crossed the ditch began to rifle the king by tearing off the eagle of the order of prussia which he wore round his neck and the diamond cross hanging to it he entreated them to leave his handkerchief to which they consented his tablets likewise escaped their rapacity the assassins having thus plundered him for the most part retired with an intent probably to notify to their respective leaders the success of their enterprise and the approach of the king as a prisoner only seven remained of which kosinski was the chief the night being dark they mistook their way and as the horses could not keep their legs the king was obliged to follow them on foot with only one shoe the other being lost in the dirt they continued to wander in uncertain paths without getting any distance from warsaw and remounting the king on horseback they were proceeding two of them holding him on each side by the hand and a third leading his horse when his majesty finding they had taken a road which led to a village called burakow warned them not to enter it because there were some russians stationed in that place who might attempt to rescue him then finding himself in pain from the inconvenience of the posture they held him in he besought them since they were determined he should proceed at least to give him another horse and boot this request was complied with and ignorant of their way they at length found themselves in a wood a league distant from warsaw from the time they had passed the ditch they repeatedly demanded of kosinski if it was not time to kill the king and these demands were reiterated in proportion to the obstacles and difficulties they encountered in the mean while warsaw was in the utmost confusion the guards were afraid to pursue their sovereign least they should be prompted to massacre his majesty to savor their own escape  the king during this time remained in the hands of the seven assassins who proceeding with him through the wood were on a sudden alarmed by a russian patrole or detachment instanly holding council four of them disappeared leaving him with the other three who compelled him to walk on scarce a quarter of an hour after a second russian guard challenges them two of the assassins than fled and left the king alone with kosinski the chief both on foot his majesty exhausted with fatigue implored his conductor to stop and suffer him to take a moments repose kosinski refused and menacing him with his naked sabre informed him that beyond the wood they should find a carriage still continuing their walk they arrived at the convent of birlany when kosinski appeared lost in thought and agiated by his reflections the king perceived his disorder and observing that he wandered without knowing the road said to him i see you are at a loss which way to proceed let me enter the convent of birlany and do you provide for your own saty no replied kosinski i have sworn thn proceeding on to mariemont a small palace belonging to the house of saxony not above half a league from warsaw kosinski betrayed some satisfaction at finding where he was and the king still demanding an instants repose he at length consented being seated on the ground the king emplyd these moments in softening his conductor and beseeching him to permit him to escape he represented the atrocity of the crime he had committed in attempting to murder his sovereign and the invalidity of kosinski and the king of poland an oath taken to perpetrate so heinous an action kosinski lent attention to his discourse and began to betray some remorse but said he if i should consent and reconduct you to warsaw i shall be taken and executed  this reflection plunged him into new uncertainties and embarassments i give you my word answered his majesty that you shall suffer no harm but if you doubt my promise escape while there is yet time i can find my way to some place of security and will certainly direct your pursuers to take a contrary road to that which you have chosen kosinski could no longer contain himself but prostrated at his feet implored forgiveness for the crime he had committed and swore to protect him against every enemy relying on his generosity for pardon and preservation his majesty assured him of his safety but judging it prudent to gain some asylum without delay he made toward a mill at some distance off kosinski knocked but in vain no answer was given he then broke a pane of glass in the window and entreated shelter for a nobleman who had been plundered by robbers the miller refused thinking them the banditti and continued for some time to persist in his denial the king then approached and looking through the broken pane prevailed with the miller by saying if we were robbers as you suppose it would be very easy for us to break the whole window instead of one pane of glass this argument procured admittance and the king wrote the following note to general coccei colonel of the footguards by a kind of miracle i have escaped from the hands of the assassins and am now at the mill of mariemont come as soon as possible and take me from hence i am wounded but not dangerously it was with great difficulty the king could persuade any one to carry the note to warsaw the people of the mill imagining he was a nobleman just plundered by robbers they feared least they should fall in with the troop kosinski offered to restore what he had taken but the king left him all except the blue ribbon of the white eagle  when the messenger arrived with the note the joy and astonishment was incredible coccei instantly rode to the mill followed by a detachment of the guards he met kosinski at the door with his sabre drawn who admitted him as soon as he knew him the king had sunk into a profound sleep from extreme fatigue and was stretched on the ground covered with a millers cloak coccei threw himself at his majestys feet calling him his sovereign and kissing his hand  it is not easy to paint or describe the astonishment of the miller and his family who instantly imitated cocceis example by throwing themselves on their knees the king returned to warsaw in the generals carriage and soon recovered the wound and bruises he had received the diet at the request of the king remitted the capital punishment of the inferior conspirators and condemned them only to work for life by his benevolent intercession the different modes of torture and horrible punishments inflicted on regicides were mitigated and both lukawski and strawenski were only simply beheaded kosinski was detained under very strict confinement and was obliged to give evidence against his two companions  on general cocceis arrival at the mill the first question his majesty asked was whether any of his attendants had suffered from the assassins and upon being informed one of the heyducs was killed on the spot and another dangerously wounded his mind naturally feeling now rendered more susceptible by his late danger was greatly affected and his joy at his own escape considerably didiminshed  upon his return to warsaw continues mr coxe the streets were illuminated and crowded with people who followed incessantly crying the king is alive when he entered the palace the doors were flung open and persons of all ranks were admitted in his presence to felicitate him on his escape the scene was affecting beyond expression every one struggled to get near him to kiss his hand or even to touch his clothes all were so transported with joy that they even loaded kosinski with caresses and called him the savior of their king his majesty was so affected with these signs of zeal and affection that he expressed in the most feeling manner his strong sense of their attachment and declared it was the happiest hour of his whole life  the family of the heyduc who had saved the kings life by the loss of his own was amply provided for and his body was buried with great pomp with an elegant inscription expressive of the mans fidelity and his own gratitude the monument is a pyramid standing upon a sarcophagus with a latin and polish inscription the translation of which is as follows  here lies henry butzau who on the third of november      opposing his own breast to shield stanislaus augustus from the weapons of nefarious paricides was pierced with repeated wounds and gloriously expired the king lamenting the death of a faithful subject erected this monument as a tribute to him and an incentive to others  having spoken of the sufferings of his present majesty of poland it may not be unacceptable to give some account of the remarkable partition of the kingdom which was planned soon after the kings escape and instigated with such profound secrecy that it was scarcely suspected before it was carried into execution the king of prussia the empress queen and the empress of russia had entered into an alliance to dismember the kingdom of poland these allied powers acting in concert set up their formal pretensions to the respective district ordering upon brandenburg for the king of prussia polish or western prussia had long been an object of his ambition exclusive of its fertility commerce and population its local situation rendered it highly valuable to that monarch it lay between his german dominions and eastern prussia and while possessed by the poles cut off at their will all communication between them during the course of the last general war he experienced the most fatal effects from the disjointed state of his territories by the acquisition of western prussia his dominions would be rendered compact and his troops in time of war be able to march from berlin to koningsburg without interruption almost all the southern and eastern parts of the kingdom bordering upon hungary together with the rich saltworks of the crown were marked out for the empress queen of hungary and bohemia and a large district of country about mohilow upon the banks of the dnieper for the empress of russia but though each of these powers pretended a legal right to the territories allotted to them respectively and published manifestoes in justification of the measures which they had taken yet as they were conscious that the false reasonings by which they supported their pretensions were too gross to impose upon mankind they forced the poles to assemble a new diet and threatened them if they did not consent unanimously to sign a treaty for the ceding of those provinces to them the whole kingdom should be laid under a military execution and treated as a conquered state  in this extremity of distress several of the polish noblemen protested against this violent act of tyranny and retired into foreign states choosing rather to live in exile to have their landed property confiscated than be instrumental in signing the ruin of their country but the king was prevailed on to put his signature to the act and his example was followed by many of his subjects as the troops of the three courts had possession of the greatest part of poland nothing remained toward completing the partition but the accession of the empress of russia who regarded with a jealous eye the introduction of foreign powers into poland possessing an uncontrolled ascendancy over the whole country she could propose no material advantage from the formal acquisition of a part and must purchase a moderate addition to her territory by a considerable surrender of her authority the king of prussia well acquainted with the interests of russia in regard to poland and the capacity of the empress to discern those interests forbore opening any negotiation on the subject of the partition until she was involved in a turkish war he then sent his brother prince henry to petersburgh who suggested to the empress that the house of austria was forming an alliance with the port which if it took place would create a most formidable combination against her that the friendship of that house was to be purchased by acceding to the partition that upon this condition the emperor was willing to renounce his connection with the grand signior and would suffer the russians to prosecute the war without molestation the queen anxious to push her conquests against the turks and dreading the interposition of the emperor in that quarter perceiving likewise between the courts of vienna and berlin that it would not be in her power at the present juncture to prevent the intended partition closed with the proposal and selected no inconsiderable portion of the polish territories for herself the treaty was signed in feb      by the russian austrian and prussian plenipotentiaries  this violent dismemberment and partition of poland has justly been considered as the first great breach in the modern political system of europe which awaited in anxious expectation what would be the issue of this unexpected union yet such was the secrecy with which the partitioning powers proceeded that for some time after the ratification of the treaty only vague conjectures were entertained even at warsaw concerning their real intentions and the late lord cathcart the english minister at petersburgh was able to obtain no authentic information of its signature until two months after the event  it would be too tedious to enter into a detail of the pleas urged by the three powers in favor of their several demands and no less uninteresting to lay before the reader the answers and remonstrances of the king and senate as well as the appeals to the other states which had guaranteed the possessions of poland the courts of london paris stockholm and copenhagen remonstrated against the usurpations but remonstrances without assistance can avail but little poland submitted to the dismemberment not without the most violent struggles and now for the first time severely felt and lamented the fatal effects of faction and discord  the conduct of the late king of prussia has greatly oppressed the kingdom his exactions were enormous and his penalties the most severe he obliged the priests to abandon their abbeys convents and cathedrals and the nobles were forced to quit their lands from all his proceedings it would appear that his prussian majesty acknowledged no right but his own no pretensions but those of the house of brandenburg and no rule of justice but his own pride and ambition even to his death he had an eye to a change in the constitution and endeavored to make the crown hereditary instead of being elective  the revenues of the king arise chiefly from the crownlands the saltmines in the palatinate of cracow ancient tolls and customs particularly those of elbing and dantzic the rents of marienburg dirshau and rogenhus and of the government of cracow and district of niepoliomicz but by the late dismemberment poland lost nearly half her annual income the king however draws from the public treasury l  0   sterling which in addition to the remaining royal demesnes and some stariosties granted for his use make the present income the same as before the dismemberment out of this income he only pays his household expenses and menial servants the salary of the great officers of state and the other general expenses being supplied from the public fund the whole revenue of the government including the royal demesnes and stariosties lately granted to the king amount to l        out of which when the king has received his privy purse there remains only l          s a sum so small that it hardly seems in any wise equal to the purposes for which it is designed and yet it is nearly adequate to the ordinary current expenses for the regular army is small the great officers of state receive little or nothing from the public treasury being amply rewarded with the royal fiefs which are so numerous and profitable each palatinate pays its own officers from its private treasury while the several judges justices of the peace and other civil officers who enjoy the territorial jurisdiction may enrich themselves sufficiently by extortions and oppressions without any salary  chap v of their army laws and punishments the ordinary army of the poles consists of   000 men in poland and   000 in lithuania cantoned into crown lands the king has a corpse of  000 troops in his own pay and entirely dependent upon himself these troops chiefly consist of ulans or light horse who furnish alternately the escort which accompanies his majesty the ulans are chiefly tartars many of them mahometans and are greatly to be relied on for their fidelity the corpse is composed of gentlemen and vassals all forming in squadron together though differently armed they both indiscriminately carry sabres and pistols but the gentlemen only bear lances of about ten feet long instead of which the others are armed with carabines their dress is a high fur cap a green and red jacket pantaloons of the same color which cover the boots as low as the knee and a petticoat of white cloth descending to the knee their lances at the end of which is fastened a long swallowtailed flag of black or red cloth are shorter and weaker than those of the austrian croats but they carry and use them much in the same manner and with no less dexterity the men are well grown and handsome but greatly disfigured with their petticoats and pantaloons the horses on which they are mounted are about fourteen hands high of remarkable spirit and with great strength of shoulder poland is much esteemed for its breed of horses and the king of prussia procures his light cavalry from this country the breed has been much injured by the late civil wars and the nobility are now chiefly supplied from tartary  the armies of poland and lithuania are independent of each other being separately commanded and under the directions of their respective generals but in time of war the king in person generally leads the army every polish gentleman has a right to maintain as many troops as he pleases which occasions perpetual petty dissentions and disputes so that the whole kingdom may be a scene of endless commotion it redounds therefore greatly to the honor of the natural disposition of the poles that amid these incentives to confusion a much greater degree of tranquillity is maintained than could well be conceived  in delineating the military establishment we should not omit the russian troops which having been long quartered in this country may be considered as forming part of the national army  the whole kingdom till lately was under the protection of russia who ruled over it with as much unbounded authority as over one of its own provinces the king in effect was but a viceroy whilst the russian ambassador had the real sovereignty and regulated all the affairs of the kingdom according to his own direction the empress maintained within the country near  0000 soldiers every garrison was composed of russian and native troops a thousand of the former were stationed at warsaw and each gate of the town guarded by a russian and polish sentinel such was the situation of poland and to what a wretched state must that country be reduced which owes its tranquillity to the interposition of a foreign army  atrocious crimes such as murder etc are punished by beheading or hanging lesser delinquencies by whipping hardlabour and imprisonment the nobles never suffer any corporal punishment but are liable only to imprisonment and death the criminal causes of the nobility are decided in the ducal supreme court to which the superiors are summoned as assessors however an appeal lies to the king except in causes of wilful murder burning of houses robbery rapes or open violence ecclesiastical causes are tried by the chancellor assisted by the superintendant and provosts if any disputes happen to arise between the duke and nobility they are decided only by the king in person the administration of justice in the towns belong either to the magistrate or the prefect of the district in which the defendant lives according to the nature of the cause and the second or last instance or hearing is at the ducal court torture was abolished in      by an edict of the diet introduced by the influence of the king a regulation as expressive of his majestys judgment as of his benevolence it is an infinite satisfaction to see the rights of humanity extending themselves into countries where they had been but little known a circumstance that must cast a great reflection on those nations which like france have attained the highest pitch of civilization and yet has retained to this period the useless and barbarous custom of torture in laws relating to debtors the creditor proceeds against the debtor at his own expense and until the trial is finished allows him threehalfpence a day for his maintenance when the debt is proved the creditor is released from the abovementioned contribution the debtor continues in prison at the discretion of the creditor until the debt is discharged and if he has no means of subsistence is obliged to maintain himself by working with the other delinquents in cutting wood sawing stone or cleaning the streets in case a gentleman contracts a debt an action lies against his lands and goods and not against his person unless he gives a note of hand with a double signature one intended as an ascertainment of the debt the other as a renunciation of his exemption from arrests but a person of high distinction even though he should bind himself by this engagement can bid defiance to all danger of imprisonment  from this sketch of the administration of justice in this country the expediency of a thorough reformation is very apparent but as any innovations in the courts of justice calculated to produce any essential benefit must materially infringe on the privileges of the nobles and counteract the national prejudices the most useful code can scarcely expect to receive the sanction of the diet  a description of prussia from busching hanway marshall riesbec moore etc chap i of the country productions cities etc prussia is bounded partly by water and partly by other countries toward the north it is bordered by samogitia toward the east by the lithuanian palatinates of trocko and podolia on the south lies poland and masovia and on the west it is bounded by polish prussia and the baltic sea its length from the northern extremity near deutschkrottengen to soldau is forty german miles and its breadth from the great duchy of lithuania near schiwind to the western coast of samland is twentyfour german miles in other places it is much narrower each german mile is nearly equal to five english  the kingdom of prussia thus bounded does not take in prussia royal which was subject to poland but only that which was called ducal russia and belonged to the house of brandenburg polish prussia in the year      was seized by the king of prussia from poland as also the cities of dantzic thorn and elbing free cities then under the protection of poland so that the dominions of the king of prussia are the largest of any of the german princes except those of the house of austria they contain    0 square german miles which is equal to the kingdoms of naples sicily and portugal put together  as many parts of the king of of prussias dominions lie scattered abroad it may not be improper to enumerate them in poland he has royal prussia in uppersaxony brandenburg pomerania and swedish pomerania in lowersaxony magduberg and halberstadt in westphalia ravensburg lingen cleves meurs and mark in the netherlands gelder in switzerland neufchatel and add to these east friesland lip gulich and tecklenburg  with respect to the climate of ducal prussia the last two months of spring and the first two summer months are temperate warm and pleasant and the weather generally very favorable to ripen the fruits of the earth but before and after these mouths the air is cold and piercing the autumn being often wet and the winter severe the air however is well purified by high winds and frequent storms  the chief rivers are the vistula spoken of in our description of poland the pregel the memel the passarge and the all these are partly navigable but at certain times of the year and in high winds are apt to overflow their banks and cause dreadful inundations  the country is watered also by several large bays lakes and canals which yield great plenty of fish and the convenience of a water communication between several towns for the conveyance of merchandise etc  the bay or lake frischehaf is from one and a quarter to three german miles in breadth and twelve in length and has a communication with the baltic its mouth into the sea is an english mile over and its depth twelve feet the bay fischehaf is thirteen german miles long and six broad and joins the sea near memel where it is and english mile broad and nineteen feet deep the coasts are every where inhabited by fishermen called curen  there are a great number of inland lakes from one to eight german miles long and one or two in breadth those of spirding angesburg rein and drausen are the principal  the soil produces plenty of corn esculent herbs fruits and pasturage prussia abounds with flocks and herds and exceeding fine horses its chief commodities are wool honey wax pitch pit coal flax hemp hops and buckwheat  this country also affords plenty of game as white and common hares elks stags deer roebucks and wild boars is is also infested with beasts of prey as lynxes wolves foxes and bears in little lithuania are fine flocks of sheep and very excellent horses  there are some few woods but these are diminishing particularly those of oak among other productions of this country the russian manna called schwadengrusse is found in the meadows on the top of a kind of grass and gathered in the morning whilst the dew lies on it amber is found in great quantities on the coasts of the baltic in russia especially on the samland shore it owes its origin to a sulphurous matter and is pellucid and generally of a yellow color that it was once in a fluid state is manifest from the number of flies spiders and other insects etc which are found frequently enclosed in it amber is found chiefly in large trees buried under ground in a vitriolic earth the profits arising from it is one of the prussian regalia and amount annually to about   000 dollars it is chiefly used by turners who make a variety of toys of it  the beautiful red color so renowned in prussia and called st johns blood is made of the eggs of a worm or small insect there found the country contains some iron ore but yields neither salt wine nor minerals being for the most part a plain champaign country  the late king having taken some pains to promote agriculture the farmer seems more at ease than any other class of men the trading part of the people and the army are compelled to consume the productions of their own country and of course their provisions are dearer than those of other countries the late king has cultivated large tracts of waste land drained morasses and built and improved many hundred villages in almost every village is a nobleman whose principal occupation is agriculture and seeds are imported from poland russia england and other countries there is a privy counselor by name brenkenhoff a man who born without one penny has made himself worth millions by his industry and agriculture he sent for rye from archangel which succeeded so well that his seeds were begged throughout pomerania silesia brandenburg and russia and the country gained considerable sums which before used to be paid to the poles and russians for this commodity in consequence of this whenever mr brenkenhoff had any thing to ask of the king for himself or his province he always couched his request in the following manner had i not brought rye from archangel your majesty and your subjects would not have had the many thousands you now possess it is fit therefore and proper that you should grant me my request mr brenkenhoff has imported large quantities of camels and buffaloes from asia the latter of which seems to thrive very well but camels do not succeed so well rearing of sheep and the cultivation of tobacco are next to the corn trade the great resources of the country speculative farmers make a great quantity of coarse silk   000lb of it are woven here annually  chap ii of the cities the chief cities belonging to the king of prussia are koningsberg berlin potsdam breslau and dantzic there are many others but it would be endless to describe them and indeed to little purpose as they contain nothing very curious  the capital of the whole kingdom is konningsberg it is situated in n latitude       it is a fine large city the rampart round which is seven english miles it has thirtytwo ravelins and eight gates this rampart incloses several gardens the large castle moat and some meadows and fields the whole circuit of the city is above eight english miles the number of houses about   00 koningsberg properly consists of three towns joined together and of several suburbs one part of the town which is the most modern stands on an island formed by the pregel and the buildings are erected upon piles of alder which by length of time are become as hard as iron in this part stands the fine cathedral in which is a famous organ consisting of  000 pipes and finished in the year       the city is about the size of copenhagen has several palaces and has seven bridges over the pregel one of which consists of five arches and is   0 feet long and being situated at the mouth where it discharges itself into the frischehaf bay and this bay opening itself into the baltic sea it has a commodious port and is a place of good trade it lies about eighty miles east of dantzic has a university twentyfive churches fourteen of which are lutheran and eleven calvinists and a roman catholic church an academy of sciences of fine arts and painting with public libraries fine hospitals and many public edifices with handsome gardens here is also a palace built in the form of an oblong square and the area within is     paces long and    broad one side has apartments for the royal family and the three others are appropriated for offices of state in one corner of the quadrangle is a tower having     steps to the top which command a view of the whole city and country round here is a charitable fund from which  00 indigent persons receive weekly pensions besides those who are supported in almshouses and hospitals the city is lighted in the manner of paris with candles in lanthorns hung on lines tied across the streets  koningsberg has always made a considerable figure in commerce and shipping and was formerly one of the hanstowns koningsberg contains  0000 inhabitants and  000 soldiers most of the inhabitants are german lutherans but here is a small colony of french calvinists the polish and lithuanian languages are here spoken  the buildings are in a vile state and mostly old the city is a great collection of houses and streets without gance beauty or order even our grammar schools are superior to their academies koningsberg has a considerable trade in hemp and flax it is seven german miles or thirty five english from palaw the sea port so that only one small vessel can come up to the town the river is very narrow here but there are some very pleasant gardens on its banks  berlin is in the marquisate of brandenburg pleasantly situated in a fruitful country on the river spree having vineyards on one side meadows on another and a forest on the third stored with all manner of game it lies in n latitude     0   degrees east of london and    miles west of frankfort upon oder it is the capital of the marquisate and the residence of the king it is divided into two parts by the river the north part of which is properly berlin the southern part is called coln where stands the electoral palace a magnificent free stone structure the town is well built and the streets are remarkable large wide spacious and well paved with plantations of trees frederickstreet is two english miles and a half long others which go off at the right angles are a mile or a mile and a half long the squares and public places are spacious the whole encompassed with a wall and a regular modern fortification canals being cut from this city to the rivers oder and elbe and the one falling into the baltic and the other into the german ocean renders it one of the first trading towns in germany it may be reckoned one of the cities in europe it has a few very magnificent buildings the rest are neat houses built with a fine white freestone generally one or at most two stories high but the finishing within does not correspond with the elegance of the outside soldiers being quartered in private houses and are generally on the ground floor looking to the street and there being at some times near  00000 men here in arms the houses are generally full of them of the public edifices usually visited by travelers are the kings palace that of his brothers the arsenal the churches of notradame st nicolas st martins the romish chapel the opera house the equestrian statue of fredirick i etc the front of the arsinal which forms one side of the palace would be extremely fine but is loaded with ornament similar to those on the screen of the prince of waless house in pall mall the building is full of useful arms the romish chapel is a very plain heavy doric edifice with a cupola at top and is by far the most elegible place of worship in the city but has a very elegant portico the opera house is a modern building on a very grand scale something like the mansion house in london but with considerable more depth it has this inscription in front fredericus rex apollini et musis the roof within is supported by pillars which makes it a fine saloon but they rather obstruct the scenes it has three galleries and is reckoned to hold  000 persons the orchestre is paid by the king and consists of fifty performers indeed the whole expense of the opera is defrayed by the king in the upper galleries on each side of the stage are six trumpeters seated who salute the royal family on their entrance and going out with martial music but the late king would not have this compliment paid to him the equestrian statue of frederick i is a fine performance the horse is remarkably well executed and there is great spirit in the attitude of the figure it stands upon a pedestal with four human figures as large as life one at each corner this statue stands on the pont neuf a new bridge built over the river spree  in the corner of one of the squares is a statue of marshal schwenin represented holding the ensign with which he advanced at the famous battle of prague perceiving his troops on the point of going he seized this from the officers hands whose duty it was to carry it and marched toward the enemy calling out let all but cowards follow me the troops ashamed to abandon their general charged once more and turned the fortune of the day but the brave old marshal was killed in the eightyfourth year of his age  instead of saints and crucifixes the late king intended to ornament the churches of berlin with the portraits of men who had been useful to the state those of the marshals schwerin keith winterfield and some others are already placed in the great lutheran church  the most fashionable walk in berlin is in the middle of one of the principal streets before the houses on each side there is a causway and between these two causeways are fine gravel walks planted with limetrees tents are pitched under these and ice lemonade and other refreshments sold the regimental music practice here in the summer and the company often walk in the evening till it is very late  the soldiers here in garrison are generally pretty quiet and the police of the town is tolerably well regulated but there are some kind of irregularities says moore that prevail in the highest degree public courtezans are more numerous than in any other town in europe in proportion to the number of inhabitants they appear openly at the windows in the day time beckon to passengers as they walk in the streets and ply for employment in any way they please without disturbance from the magistrate it seems to be a received opinion here that the peace and happiness of the community are not interrupted by this species of licentiousness therefore no one is allowed to molest or abuse those who have chosen this way of life for a profession and as little attention is paid to those who frequent the chambers of these ladies as if they stepped into any other house or shop to purchase any other commodity  another species of debauchery is said also to prevail in this capital but dr moore imagines what is said of it is much exaggerated  the better kind of citizens and manufacturers live entirely among those of their own rank and without affecting the manners of the courtiers or stooping to the mean debauchery of the commonalty maintain the decency plainness and modesty of the german church  the society into which strangers may be admitted in this capital is not various or extensive the prussian officers of the higher ranks whose time is not entirely engrossed like that of their inferiors by the duties of their profession live mostly with their own families or with each other the late king did not approve of their forming intimacies with foreign ministers or with strangers  the entrance into berlin is airy and elegant the streets are regular and clean and the houses uniform the number of inhabitants are reckoned at  00000 and there are from   000 to  0000 men always in garrison the palace is the first object that strikes the eye of the traveller but one of the square sides is an old building and the wall of the grand front being seven or eight feet thick the rooms within do not receive sufficient light from the windows to show them to advantage when hanway was there in    0 the apartments in the palace were adorned with silver in every shape and so massive that the fashion of it came to no more than seven per cent so that  000000 of dollars might be realized on any emergency but marshall tells us that when he was there twenty years afterward the late king had melted down the greatest part of it for the war expenses and that very little of it was restored here are pictures of charles v and his empress the frames of which are silver and weighed   0lb each and a grand crown luster that weighed near a ton weight also a music gallery in silver and so on but marshall says when he was there in    0 most of the furniture for a royal palace was very mean there are some fine pictures and several of barberini the celebrated female dancer the throne in the audience chamber is velvet embroidered with gold in a grand taste but there is nothing extraordinary otherwise but a bed of crimson and a clock which has  00 ciphers with electroral crowns all set with pearls and the rooms are in the same taste in this bed it is usual to lodge persons of the blood royal on their marriage nights  the kings library would be deemed a mean apartment for a common school it is open to the public certain hours in the day here is a collection of  00 bibles of different languages and editions here is the first bible printed in america one printed in    0 the first printed in the german language and the identical bible which charles i of england used when he was beheaded and presented to the elector of brandenburg by doctor juxlen  the cabinet of curiosites has among other things two cannon balls which meeting in the air the warmth of the iron or perhaps being made red hot with the violence of the motion united them together an oak with stags horns the stag having been hunted with great violence ran his horns into a young tree and there expired and the tree growing the horns at length appeared as a natural production  in    0 the late king was preparing several amusements for the entertainment of frederick marquis of barrille who married his eldest sister the most distinguished of which was the carnival and the expenses amounted to  0000 crowns this entertainment consisted of quadrilles or four companies in the dresses of romans carpathians grecians and persians all mounted on horses richly caparisoned in the same manner each party being composed of six combatants the first was conducted by the prince of prussia the other three by his two brothers and the marquis the kings cousin they had also the arms of the several nations and were followed each by a band of music proper to the respective countries and habited and attended after the same manner the procession of the whole made a splendid show but to mr hanway who was present it was only of a theatrical kind for he saw but little of the pride and beauty of horses or horsemanship nor was the area allotted for the entertainment half large enough what rendered the first trial ridiculous was its being exhibited by the light of lamps the greater part of which was blown out by the wind however the next exhibition of these tilts and tournaments was in broad day and the prizes were allotted to those who were judged to perform best without any other bloodshed than that of one of the princes cutting his toe with his own sword  a mock battle was afterward fought which was incomparably a more grand entertainment four thousand men being marched out in the morning early about a german mile from the city near the village britz were followed by another detachment of the same number the hussars and cuirassiers had several skirmishes in the way both armies plied their field artillery warmly at length a rivulet was passed a wood was attacked and the enemy driven from it to a village which was carried sword in hand after this they went through all the various evolutions and exercises of both cavalry and infantry as might be supposed in a real engagement changing their position on a tract of about two english miles during the space of three hours at this show almost the whole city of berlin was present there are sometimes reviews here of  0000 men and there maneuvers will continue three days dr moore was at one of these  berlin by strangers has been called a little paris the french language being almost as well understood as the german the city abounds in elegant structures and is computed near one third as large as london yet not containing above one eighth part of the inhabitants from whence it may easily be accounted why grass is found growing in many of their capital streets the whole of this city bespeaks but little variety it is about four miles and a half long and about three miles broad but within this enclosure are many gardens and some fields but not more than  000 houses whereas in paris there are near  0000 the emptiness of many places is a singular contrast to the magnificence of the buildings nor is the contrast of this magnificence with the circumstances of the people less striking whilst you are gazing at the beauty of a building in the first style of architecture finely stuccoed with a magnificent front and all the outward appearance of a ducal residence on a sudden a window shall open on the lower story and a cobbler shall bring out a pair of boots and hang them up under your nose to dry the leather lost in wonder at this phenomenon the second story window shall open and a breechesmaker shall treat the eye with a pair of new washed breeches soon after this another window shall open in the same story and a tailor shall hang out a waistcoat or some woman shall throw filh upon his head a little further on a palace of the corinthian order shall strike the eye and you shall suppose it belonging to some prince of the blood scarce have your wandering eyes reached the top but you are saluted by a jew who asks you if you have any thing to swop then cast your eyes a flight lower and behold shirts hanging to dry belonging to an officer who is shaving himself and whom you would hardly conceive to have two shirts belonging to him you may walk on through two or three streets of the same kind till you arrive at the house of a general officer known by the sentinel at the door but you see neither porter nor footman nor any thing of that train of attendants so visible at vienna  riesbec tells us that the inns throughout berlin are little better than the bignios in london that they keep lists of ladies in their neighborhood who are seated according to their prices and that a servant is always waiting at hand to fetch them the landlords are very imposing and every thing is exceedingly dear six r seven livres is paid for a bottle of bad burgundy and a certain measure of wood that costs but a trifle at paris is sold for a guinea and a half though brandenburg is full of woods but marshall says he had as good private lodgings for fifteen shillings a week as he could have in london for thirtyfive  potsdam is a fine well built city where the king has a palace and has finer houses than those at berlin built with freestone but are inhabited only as at berlin by persons of lower rank it is seated on an island formed by the havel and some neighboring lakes and is about four german miles in circuit here is a fine canal of fifty paces wide and  000 in length cut from the havel through the center of the town to a branch again of the same river this canal is planted on both sides with trees and surrounded with well built houses before the palace which was originally a castle is a large square adorned with roman columns in which the garrison is daily exercised the pleasure gardens adjoining are beautifully laid out and ornamented with waterworks gildings and statues in the marketplace is erected a pyramid or obelisk of four sides composed of variegated silesian marble seventyfive feet high on each side is a marble bust of the kings from frederick i to frederick ii the pedestal is of white italian marble and at each corner a small statute of the same here is a velvet and silk manufactory the palace is not large but elegant the kings study is partitioned off by ballustrades of silver and the frames of the lookingglasses and tables are of the same metal the throne in the audience chamber is magnificently adorned with a rich embroidery of the arms of fred ii k of prussia and voltaire the house of brandenburg in one of the apartments are two curious figures in copper of a chinese man sitting and a chinese woman holding an umbrella over him the whole richly gilt standing in an oval niche inlaid with marble these two figures form a very convenient stove the staircase and grand saloon are lined with silesian marble  the person who showed the palace when dr moore was at potsdam in the late kings reign asked him if he had any desire to see the kings wardrobe this consisted of two blue coats faced with red the lining of one a little torn two yellow waistcoats a good deal soiled with spanish snuff three pair of yellow breeches and a suit of velvet embroidered with gold for grand occasions the velvet suit he had had ten years and was in good condition  as i have given a drawing of frederick ii in his study with voltaire and the likeness of both is wonderfully preserved it may not be amiss to describe his dress which is seldom observed it consisted of a blue coat lined and faced with red and yellow waistcoat and breeches he always wore boots with hussar tops which fell in wrinkles about his ancles and were oftener brown than black  his hat would be thought extraordinary large in engand though it is of the size commonly worn by the russian officers of cavalry he generally wore one of the large side corners on his forehead and eyes and the front cock at one side his hair was alway cued behind and dressed on each side with a single curl and seldom was it well dressed he had constantly in his hand a very large gold snuff box ornamented with diamonds and took an immoderate quantity of spanish snuff which was scattered about his waistcoat and breeches and these were often marked with the paws of two or three italian greyhounds which he frequently caressed  in the old chamber where the late king died at the lower part of the window which looks into the garden four panes have been removed and a piece of glass equal in size with the four supplies its place the kings extreme delight through life had been to see his troops exercise and he retained this passion till his last breath when he was confined to his room by his last illness he used to sit and view them through the window which had been thus formed for the purpose becoming gradually weaker by his increasing disorder he could not sit but was obliged to lie on a couch the whole day when at any time he was uncommonly languid his head was raised to the window and a sight of the men under arms was perceived to operate like a cordial and recover his spirits by frequent repetition however even this lost its effect his eyes became dim when his head was raised he could no longer perceive the soldiers and he expired this was feeling the ruling passion as strong in death as any man ever felt it  in the garden are many rich statues of a great size particularly a neptune and amphitrite erected on a seacar in a large basin opposite the east front of the palace the stables are adjoining and are well furnished with good english hunters near the town is a number of vineyards  towns generally are formed by degrees as the inhabitants increase in number and houses are built larger and more commodious as they increase in wealth but here the matter is reversed the houses are built first and beautifully so to entice the people but notwithstanding this few towns are worse inhabited though the houses are let to merchants and tradesmen at low rents the houses here are chiefly uniform all new and of one height several streets have been built at once at the kings expense the streets are regular and well paved and here are some magnificent public buildings thus externally potsdam wears a respectable appearance but it is internally like the houses at berlin the finishing of the buildings furniture and conveniences are poor indeed  at potsdam are quartered the kings guards who are about  000 men of great stature and comeliness well clothed and distinguished by silverlaced hats and black cockades  about an english mile from potsdam is the palace of sanssouci which presents the eye with a remarkable fine prospect it is built on the top of a desolate mountain with great taste both within and without the offices are at a considerable distance and are joined to the body of the palace now completely finished by a double colonade which has a grand effect the front of the palace seems rather crowded by a great number of statues designed to ornament it these are chiefly in groups representing some story from ovid this mountain is cut into six terraces to each of which we ascend by twelve steps and against the walls on each terrace are planted the best vines and are kept under glass cases on the upper part of the mountain which affords an agreeable view of the town and its vicinage stands the palace it is small and only one story high yet on account of its regularity elegance and ornaments consisting of the greatest masterpieces in sculpture painting and other arts is admirable the statues from the cabinet of antiquites formerly in the possession of cardinal polignac are deposited here in the center of this palace is a round hall lined with marble whose magnificent columns excellent paintings and beautiful marblefloor disposed in the form of flowers in the florentine manner strikes the eye very agreeably on the top is a cupola that gives it light terminated by a large crown supported by the three graces one of the apartments in the palace is wainscoted with cedar and ornamented with flowers of gold and here is a small library behind the palace is a semicircular passage adorned on each side with columns and three sides of the whole is surrounded with fine gardens but which have nothing extraordinary except some fine pieces of statuary done by nancie of paris particularly venus drawing a net and diana with game the pedestals of which are in relievo the garden is about half an english mile in length terminated by an egyptian pyramid here is very little turf and no gravel the sandy walks robbing the place of half its beauty what it wants in beauty however is made up in respect for no one in the late kings life was suffered to walk in it with a sword on on any pretense nor did the king himself ever wear one in that retreat  potsdam was the favorite residence of the late king where he avoided the empty ceremonies of a court and where he sat down to table with twelve persons inviting even his ensigns in rotation his bed at sanssouci was in a small niche consisting only of two matrasses under the cover of a down quilt without the least common ornament or mark of grandeur  dantzic is a famous commercial city and sortress situated on the vistula about five miles from the baltic it is a sea port town and has two small rivers running through it it is a large populous and beautiful city one of the hansetowns and built according to the ancient manner of those towns but most of the streets are narrow owing to the galleries of the houses by which we enter them projecting ten or twelve feet into the streets to these galleries there is an ascent by a footstep they stand even with the houses and under most of them are good vaults or cellars  the city has a beautiful harbor carries on a considerable trade especially in corn the ships belonging to this port are very numerous and the privileges of the city are of great importance as the third great city it sends representatives to the prussian senate or council of state who have likewise a seat in the general diet of poland and vote at the election of a king of poland it has also the privilege of coining money gathering amber etc this place was subject to the crown of poland as was also the city of thorn but the late king of prussia by no other right than what a powerful army confers on every tyrant seized upon them with the countries on the vistula the niester and other territories contiguous to his own dominions  the chief burghers of which there are one hundred are styled nobles and the city was anciently the principal of the hansetowns being one of the first that entered into that association it was a considerable place in     it has its own garrison and the fortifications make a good appearance especially toward the south and west which parts are surrounded with mountains and eminences some of these hills being higher than the city towers  according to the bills of mortality in           persons died here in the same year      polish vessels small and great from the vistula and  0   ships from the sea arrived at this port and   0 0 lasts of corn were brought here for exportation this will give some idea of its population and commerce  in this city are twelve lutheran churches two calvinistic churches and one papist church the inhabitants are chiefly protestants yet the city standing in the papist diocese of cujaira is subject to pay pecuniary impositions upon every frivolous pretense one of the churches is a lutheran cathedral and the first preacher is called senior ministerii the rest are equal in dignity but two of them must be doctors in divinity here is also a lutheran academy with seven professors and one teacher of the polish language though this language is but little used the inhabitants chiefly speaking german there is an open library some public buildings and a remarkable watermill on the river radaune with eighteen wheels which is said to bring in the proprietors ten shillings every hour without the walls of the city are a number of small towns belonging to it and a territory between twelve and fifteen miles round one of these towns is that of oliva so celebrated for the peace concluded in it here is an abbey and a convent the peace i allude to was between the emperor and the kings of poland and sweden charles svus king of sweden dying during the ratification all the great conquests made by him were restored to the crown of poland the particulars of this peace which happened in the year      are engraved on a black marble monument the abbots revenues amounted to l 000 a year but the king of prussia besieged the whole and allotted him a pension for life of   0l and about a fourth of that sum to keep his fine garden in order wraxhall tells us on incontestible authority that the king confiscated the estates of a great number of polish nobles and reduced their families from a revenue of  00000 ducats each ducat nine shillings and three pence english to absolute indigence the city was crowded with polish nobility who on that seizure of territory abandoned their torn and bleeding country to take refuge in it but the king of prussia having threatened to seize all their estates unless they returned they were under the necessity of complying  in the great church at dantzic is a vast pillar hollowed which they say was anciently used to immure ecclesiastics guilty of heinous crimes they let persons down into it by a rope and it is forty feet deep the square dimensions within about seven feet  dantzic though much superior to koningsberg is neither elegant nor handsome it very much resembles hamburgh both in the loftiness of the houses the manner of building them and the narrowness of the streets they are however much cleaner than any other in this part of the world but its neatness is not carried to that length it is in holland the principal streets are planted on each side in the dutch way with wild chestnuts about thirty feet high the city is not large not exceeding three miles in circuit but fortified with a wall and double ditch two thousand soldiers would be scarce sufficient to garrison this place but they have not  00 men and those neither in discipline arms or ammunition equal to the same number of any regular european forces  dantzic says marshall has strength to resist no one but the poles they have an arsenal full of useful arms and they talk of possessing two or three hundred pieces of cannon but a great train of artillery may be as insignificant as these at dantzic are and be considered as a magazine of matchlocks  the commerce of this place is the only subject worth attention possessing as they say sixteen parts out of twenty of all the trade of poland owing to the river vistula and all its branches which spread through a vast extent of that kingdom and are navigable almost where ever they go they export wheat some years to the amount says marshall of five six or  00000 pounds and once the amount rose to    0000l but since the troubles of poland the trade has much declined all the corn comes in sloops and flatbottomed barges carrying from thirty to sixty tons and more and wholly on account of the landlords who are all nobles in virtue of their possessing lands it is raised on their estates by their peasants the barges are their own and the watermen are their own vassals it is sold to merchants at dantzic who lodge it in granaries built for the purpose seven or eight stories high their boats carry back to their owners all the commodities and manufactures they have occasion for iron from sweden east india goods supplied by the dutch brandy limes and west india commodities by the french the trade of england with dantzic is very inconsiderable owing to our not taking off any part of her commodities  hanway says the inhabitants of dantzic are much more agreeable than the place itself the women are much like the english in their stature countenance and air they have the reputation of being handsome and indeed are so the bad ones make a market of their beauty in the worst manner in the neighboring empires where they are remarkably eminent in a profession which is apt to convert beauty into deformity and health into disease women of distinction affect the manner of the poles so that the most respectful way of saluting a lady is to kiss her hand unless you choose to stoop as do the poles to the hem of her petticoat  there is an english factory here within the double works which defend the town is a spacious walk and a road for coaches in the outer part is a hillock under which are deposited the bodies of near  000 russians who in one morning fell by an obstinate attack commanded by count munich the dantzickers in      having espoused the cause of stanislaus king of poland in his contest with augustus elector of saxony procued the assistance of  0000 troops the russians under the command of count munich made a desperate and injudicious attack upon the dantzickers and were cut to pieces  the ancient city of magdeburg is situated in    degrees odd min n lat and  0 miles west of berlin it is the capital of the duchy of that name the seat of the provincial regency the consistory the war and demesne office and one of the most principal trading towns in all germany it lies on the river elbe is strongly fortified and among other works has a citadel in the island of the river  magdeburg is well built particularly the broad street which makes a grand appearance though the principal beauty of the town consists in its cathedralsquare ornamented with large elegant houses and its area well paved among the most remarkable edifices here are the kings palace which was anciently the residence of the bishops and is now converted into public offices the lutheran cathedral here is a superb structure in the antique taste it was finished in the year      is two hundred and eight else long the same in height and fiftyfive else broad it is wholly built of freestone and contains many curiosities such as a stone bassorelievo of the wise and foolish virgins the former smiling and the latter disconsolate a number of relics not much regarded an altar with a table of jasper eighteen feet long two thick and eight broad valued at two tons of gold a porphyry font a large stone said to be one of the waterpots in which our savior turned water into wine an old wooden slipper of the virgin marys a piece of wood on which the cock stood that crowed on peters denying our savior the basin pilate washed his hands in and many others  magdeburg has from time immemorial enjoyed the staple in this town is also a variety of manufactures woollen cloths stuffs cottons linens stockings hats beautiful leathergloves tobacco snuff etc being very advantageous to trade from its communication with hamburgh by the elbe and lying on the road between upper and lower germany it is the strongest place belonging to the king of prussia and where his principal magazines and founderies are established in time of war it is the repository of whatever he finds necessary to place out of the reach of sudden attack the country between magdeburg and brandenburg within two leagues of the former is well cultivated and fertile but at a greater distance it is as naked and sandy as the deserts of arabia  places where any extraordinary event has happened even though they should have nothing else to distinguish them interest a philosophical traveller more than the most flourishing country or finest town which has never been the scene of any thing memorable  in this city luther records his education and they still show the remains of his chamber among the ruins of the cloister of the augustinefriars with his bedstead and table and on the door are certain words in high dutch which a modern writer has thus rendered into english rhyme  luther lodged within this little room when first he did into the cloister come etc the ancient city was of a very large circumference but having been destroyed by count tilly the imperial general after a brave defense in the year      it is now scarce half rebuilt of  0000 inhabitants which this town then contained tilly caused every one to be massacred on account of their adhering to the lutheran doctrine to the amount of  0000 citizens four hundred only excepted who saved themselves by swimming across the river nor did he leave a church or house standing except the cathedral and some few fishermens cottages in this act of general massacre such acts of wanton cruelty were exhibited as disgrace human nature  the city of breslaw being the capital of the duchy of silesia i shall reserve till i speak of that part of the prussian dominions  chap iii of the people amusement religion etc when the late king came to the crown his own territories contained at least   00000 inhabitants brandenburg had  00000 prussia  0000 pomerania  00000 magdeburg and halberstadt  00000 and his westphalian dominions at least  00000 his income consisted of at least   000000 of lorins  as the prussian population does not bear any proportion to the size of the country and as that is not yet all cultivated the number of people is susceptible of a great increase the kings own revenue now is about  0 millions of florins that is about   0   l english his civil list is incredibly small and his first ministers appointments are only   000 florins  riesbec says he has observed no where throughout the whole prussian dominions so much poverty as in the two cities of berlin and potsdam the high price of the necessaries of life in these places the great number of idle people the small pay of many civil and military servants the pinching way in which many of the smaller nobility live who must have their servants and the great luxury of dress may be the causes of it the equal distribution of the coin among many people makes the sum not so striking as it is in other places in which a nobleman ruins the property of a hundred of his poor countrymen by his dissipation there are no persons in the prussian dominions some of the large nobles in silesia only excepted who possess above  0000 guilders income in landed estates indeed we cannot find more than three houses which have  0000 florins but still the inhabitants are as remote from extreme poverty as from excessive riches and there are as few beggars here as in any other country in europe  since the year      it is computed that   000 colonists have settled here emigrants from germany france and switzerland and these colonists in little lithuania have erected four hundred villages eleven towns eightysix seats and fifty new churches  the prussian nobility are mostly descended from the ancient germans and most of the peasants are vassals either to the king or the nobles  the customs and manners of the people are so similar to those of the germans in general that as we shall have occasion to speak of them hereafter it will be needless to enter on them here at large i will only mention a few particulars  on entering the prussian garrison towns you are stopped at the gate the officer of the guard asks your name whence you came and where you are going and takes it down in writing when the title of duke is given in as the name the guard is turned out under arms not so for my lord being a title treated with very little ceremony either in france or germany and often assumed by those who have no right to it and given to every englishman of a decent appearance but duke in germany implies a sovereign and is more respectable than prince  the french manners and turn of thinking prevail very little among the prussian officers but the ladies of the court of berlin have greatly the air of the french though the late king could not endure the company of a woman the ladies here are by no means neglected by the men in general many of the married women particularly have a crowd of admirers who attend them upon all occasions are invited with them to all entertainments sit next them at table and whom the master or mistress of the house takes care to place together at the same cardtable when a lady is not provided with an attendant of this kind her husband as well as herself is generally a little out of countenance and both seem rather in an awkward situation  in this country when both parties are willing and there are no children a divorce may be obtained with very little trouble or expense and we are frequently in company where a lady her present and former husband are at table and all parties behave in the most polite and friendly manner to each other  dr moore tells a pleasant story of a gentleman who having lived in a state of domestic jarring with his wife got her persuaded to concur with him in applying for a divorce it was soon obtained he married again a woman with whom he was violently in love and expected as usual endless happiness after marriage this passion cooled rather sooner than common and within a few months he became the professed admirer of his first wife he now saw a thousand charms in her person and conversation which had entirely escaped his notice whilst the bonds of wedlock subsisted he also discerned that certain peculiarities in her manner which he formerly thought exceedingly awkward were in reality graceful he expressed his remorse for his former blindness in the most pathetic terms the lady was softened and at last gave the most perfect marks of forgiveness and it was universally thought that he thus contrived to live in adultery with the very woman to whom he had been lawfully married  here jealousy is held in equal contempt and detestation and scandal is very little known people seem so fully occupied with their own private affairs that they seldom trouble their heads about the business of their neighbors if in the course of conversation an intimacy of a particular kind is hinted at between people of different sexes it is mentioned accidently as a fact of no importance and without the smallest blame or illnatured reflections on either of the parties one reason of this may be that there is scarce such a thing as an old maid throughout all russia  some of the amusements of berlin i have mentioned but none delighted reisbec more than the parkwalks on the south side of the sprey i have never yet says he seen a finer public walk the varied beauties of the woods alleys groves and wilderness beggar all description it is above three miles round and has water sufficient to give more life than there is in the walks of much larger cities  in this park on a sunday you see berlin in all its glory it is to the people of this place what st james park is to london and the thuilleries to paris only the mixture of the company is much more striking as you find all the populace and all the great world here you ride or walk through without any molestation in some parts of the park you see rows of ladies magnificently dressed sitting together and have the freedom of staring them full in the face and comparing them to one another you also meet with most of the literati of the place at stated times and there are refreshments of every kind provided  the opera is open only in winter and it is reckoned one of the best in europe but there is no theater except an indifferent german one the manager seems to have some very singular opinions he places the strength of his company in the number of his actors and appears to distribute the parts among them by lot among fifty performers there is scarce a tolerable one and his wardrobe is of a piece with the rest absurdity upon absurdity the theater is so small that the spectators are obliged to take care that the clouds above them do not entangle with their hair trees are scarce big enough for walking sticks and so povertystruck are the players that they are scarce able to move their hands or arms the salaries paid them not being more than from   or   guilders a week less pay than our strolling companies are not calculated to give them strength their forte consequently consists in fainting away which is only excelled by themselves in their dying dying is the principal excellence of a german actor and when he knows how to give life to his death by beginning the convulsions in his feet he is sure of the applause of a german pit  though the inhabitants of berlin including the german are about    000 persons it is not able to keep up a good company of players this is entirely owing to want of spirit in the manager who suffers half his company to starve and plays in a building which in any other city would be looked on as a barn  the distinction between the prussian and the austrian character is not more manifest than in their theaters two companies of comedians can scarce find existence throughout all the fine cities of prussia whereas in austria there is a theater in every small town this difference is not owing to difference of fortunes for there is much more money in prussia then in austria though no single house in the former has an income of  0 00 or even  00000 guilders there is an appearance of care amid the middle classes of the inhabitants of the prussian towns which is not seen through austria the only difference consists in the greater industry of the prussians and the frugality inseparable from it the knowledge and manners found among the inhabitants of the prussian provinces put them in possession of better pleasures then are to be met with in the theater the dancingbooth and the cellar in the smallest prussian villages more happiness is met with than in many large states in austria and there is much more good done by private persons in the former than in any of the latter  with regard to the sciences and literature of all kinds berlin is doubtless one of the first cities in the world it is obliged to the late king for its preeminence who established a freedom of thinking not to be met with in any other country out of england this king had an academy of men of learning and there is no state where the public ministers and effective counselors are such chosen men that there is hardly one but would be a wonderful writer in his own line there is scarce a single character of eminence but who is well acquainted with the best french english and italian writers an advantage which neither the english french or italians can dispute with them  there is a university at koningsberg under good regulations and in a flourishing state and some provincial schools  the religion of this country is the lutheran but as great numbers of the colonists are calvinists they have also their churches not only in the cities and towns but in many of the villages there are but two or three popish churches throughout prussia indeed the free exercise of every religion is allowed all over the prussian dominions here are no bishoprics but all ecclesiastical matters are referred to the consistories at koningsberg and saalfield which are something like the presbyteries in the kirk of scotland the churches in every hauptamt or district is subject to an archpresbyter or inspector  chap iv of their trade manufactures and government the manufactures in prussia are daily improving and increasing particularly the glass and ironworks paper powder copper and brass mills manufactures of cloth camlet linen silk stockings etc prussia is very conveniently situated for trade a college for commerce and navigation has been erected which has the cognizance of all cases in and settles all disputes relative to trade and commerce  the commodities of prussia and great lithuania sold to foreign merchants and annually exported are all kinds of grain pinetrees for masts deal boards and other timber tar woodashes potash elkskins leather firs amber    00 stone of wax honey grass manna linseedoil flax hemp linseed and hemp seed  000 sacks of the former  00 of the latter yarn hogs bristles stags horns elks horses oatmeal mead dried fish sturgeon caviar lampreys butter and about   00 stone of tallow  the number of foreign ships that resort here for lading annually are about   0 which import wine salt spice linen cloth and other woollen stuffs herrings tin copper lead tobacco sugar rice coffee and other grocery and koningsberg is the great market  the silesia linens are famous all over the world and the silesia forests afford a great deal of wood for shipbuilding the ville de paris taken from the french on the celebrated   th of august was wholly built of silesia wood  so many thousand of french manufacturers having found protection in this country gold and silver lace and wrought silks are hardly to be bought in any place so cheap they talk of prohibiting those of france the environs of berlin produce annually  00lb weight of raw silk the king has indeed taken the manufactory into his own hands with a view of increasing it  the late king having kept his eye on the importation of luxuries into his dominions making it a rule always to lay an excise on rich luxuries in proportion to their increase has always kept down the foreign trade but on the other hand it increased the industry of his subjects a demonstrative proof of this is the astonishing increase of towns and people no country in europe of the same size has doubled its population as prussia has done within the space of  0 years  before i speak of their government i will present my readers with a short abstract of their history they are called porussi or prussians being close neighbors of the russians po signifies neighboring we hear of the prussians in the tenth century but the teutonic knights who made religion a cloak for their ambitious views and committed the most inhuman barbarities under pretense of propagating the gospel of peace extirpated the native prussians in   0  and planted the germans their countrymen in their stead in      one half of prussia revolted from the the teutonic order and declared for cassimir iii king of poland this occasioned fresh effusions of blood till in      it was settled that one part of prussia should continue under the kings protection and that the teutonic knights should retain the other and after fresh commotions it was agreed in      that the margrave grandmaster of the teutonic order should be duke or sovereign of the eastern part of russia as a fief of poland this new duke introduced the reformed religion in       ducal prussia now the kingdom was added to the house of brandenburg by the elector joachim it having been closely connected long before and the elector taking part with the poles against the swedes was acknowledged by poland in      as an independent duke frederick his son in   0  raised the duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself with his own hands frederick ii his grandson the late king annexed to his dominions the greatest part of silesia and east friezland and all polish prussia by the late partition  the royal arms are a displayed eagle and the kings titles are king of prussia margrave of brandenburg duke of silesia archchamberlain and prince elector of the holy roman empire sovereign prince of orange neufchatel etc etc  there are here two orders that of the black eagle instituted by the first king a broad orangecoloured ribbon and a silver star and the order of merit instituted by the late king viz a golden star enamelled with blue worn appendant to a black ribbon edged with silver  the five members of the royal court of regency which superintends the whole kingdom whether political civil or ecclesiastical are all privycounsellors or ministers of state and war and these five have two secretaries there are besides two chambers of war and demesnes one of koningsberg the other of gumbinnen which have the direction of the revenue etc  the late king established a reputation on the surest foundation by that bold and generous stroke in politics in delivering his country from the jaws of lawyers who before his time at least in brandenburg sported with the wretched in prussia the decision of causes cannot be protracted suits in brandenburg are now brought to a speedy issue at an easy expense  exclusive of the crown lands mines manufactures and other royal revenues the finance system rests on the taxes and customs which are forty per cent the land tax is about nine shillings in the pound these taxes are certainly high but such is the regularity of government and so little oppression is met with from revenueofficers that the people are nevertheless happy for they are very industrious and industry will always accumulate wealth  though the kings revenues do not exceed a million and a half sterling apparently a small sum in england yet considering the difference in the value of money and the uncommon exertions of economy unequalled in any other court it is as good as five millions with us the late king by a balance of trade in his favor annually laid by  00000l as much as the new buildings the payment of his troops and the improvements in his country cost  the incomes of the prussian princes are by no means scanty every prince has  0000 rubles each ruble four shillings and sixpence a year settled on him as soon as of age and the kings brother and hereditary prince have estates and incomes to the amount of   0000 livres a year each livre ten pencehalfpenny english at berlin though money is more scarce than at london or paris a stranger will find very little difference in the common expense of living  the spirit of the government is not favorable to great and independent lords for indeed all landlords are prevented from oppressing their peasants as the soldiery are drawn from them care is taken that they shall not be deprived of the chief source of health and vigor and there is no peasantry in europe better fed than the russians  the prussian state considered as a state is the richest in europe and it is absolutely impossible that it ever should be exposed to any inconvenience from the want of money its system of finance being established on such solid foundations that it any future king was to think of introducing a change it would overturn the whole the bankbills of berlin are bought up with avidity no one thinks they will ever lose their credit the dutch are very happy when this bank will take their money the late king and his father solved the three most difficult problems of state that exist and history affords no examples of their having been solved so quickly so happily and so universally as they have been by these princes they made a lazy stupid and prodigal people industrious active and alert they gave to a country which had been entirely neglected by nature a value which many of the most highly favored countries have not and they placed a small nation in a situation not only to vanquish in a favorable moment all the combined forces of europe but to be able at any time to measure swords with the ablest of them singly    chap v of the army prussia has no navy but her military forces especially in the reign of the late king have been no less formidable for their discipline than by their number and it may be asserted with great truth that for a fine appearance military discipline and activity the prussian army has not its equal in the world the corpse of cadets at berlin is a nursery for good officers the number of troops in the pay of the king of prussia is generally computed at   0000 half of which are foreigners he has a body of eighty squadrons of hussars each squadron   0 men fine comely youthful strong and wellshaped figures the arms of these men are a light musket and sabre their clothing a coarse red cloth made close to their bodies and strengthened at the elbows by leather in the shape of a heart their breeches are a welldressed sheep skin their boots short and light but the soles of them durable their caps so stout as to stand a cut  besides these hussars the king has a small body of men called hunters reputed the most faithful couriers in his pay and are often promoted for their fidelity in arduous enterprises these with a single ball are very dextrous marksmen and are employed to pick out the officers from the men when these hunters are taken no quarter is granted on either side  the prussian soldiers are remarkable for their short clothing and their elbows being covered with leather a soldier is never seen the least in rags on the contrary in cleanliness of person they all appear like gentlemen  the kings guards and some few other regiments are clothed yearly but in general the army has new regimentals only twice in three years they wear white linen spatterdashes in summer and black in winter in summer their breeches are dimity and in winter white woollen their hair is pigtailed behind and always powdered when on duty  the hats of the footsoldiers and grenadiers caps are small they carry their cartouchbox higher than other troops but their arms are heavier then common they are kept so remarkable clean that a soldier can hardly find time to be idle or wicked they go through their exercise twice a day and when the weather is bad they are under cover  none but the natives of brandenburg are employed in any other than military duty but these in time of peace may by rotation follow their respective employs in summertime bodies of cavalry are sent into the field which are on the lookout to prevent disertion and robberies on the roads these detachments are computed at  00 men each and a watchguard of two men is placed at certain distances on the roads near their body  the pay of a common soldier is eight grosch a week this is fourteen pence english and his bread of this pay three pence is stopped for washing and materials to clean his arms upon this calculation   0000 men cost but    000l but if we include their bread clothing and the pay of officers it does not much exceed a million sterling in disciplining the men the corporals will let a fellow be ever so thickheaded tell him with patience a thousand times but when once he knows his business if he fails afterward they correct him with a stick  wonderful as the prussian infantry is in point of discipline and exactness the cavalry infinitely surpasses them the english even think that the prussian army goes beyond all that can be conceived of it immense sums are spent upon the cavalry and horses are sent for as far as tartary they ride always full gallop and yet their evolutions are as exact as any of the infantry the cavalry are above  0000 strong and every year are supplied with  000 fresh horses they are accustomed to charge in large bodies and in full speed  but the cuirasiers are the flower of the prussian army these are dressed in buff coats and wear very heavy iron breastplates which cover all the front part of the body and are proof against a musket shot the infantry on every attack are ordered to shout from an opinion that it keeps up the spirits of the men and prevents them from reflecting on their danger for the same reason the prussian regiments have a greater proportion of drummers than those in the service of other states  of the officers no one in  0 is a foreigner and they are all men of high birth and must have served as cadets the subalterns have but small pay but they have the greatest alacrity and the finest martial appearance  chap vi of the duchy of silesia the duchy of silesia is divided between the two crowns that of bohemia and that of prussia but the greatest part of it is in the dominions of prussia taken from the queen of hungary and ceded to the king of prussia in      this territory consists of    principalities and contains about   0 geographical square miles  silesia terminates to the east on poland where the country is level and open on the south it is separated from hungary by a chain of mountains and a wild thicket in some parts a german mile wide which both crowns have claimed but which is still disputed and of course remains as a barrier in the south and west silesia is bounded by a chain of hills for height and extent some of the most remarkable in europe in these mountains and all over that part of upper silesia lying toward moravia and hungary the winter sets in earlier and is of longer continuance and much more severe than in the levels in those very months when at the foot of some of these mountains every thing is covered with ice and snow the trees at breslau in winter are in full verdure the inhabitants of the mountains are not only confined to their houses by the snows though in latitude  0 and    but like the laplanders and people of carniola use a kind of scates by which they travel over the snows with amazing swiftness in the principality of glogau and beyond the oder toward poland there are very extensive lands but the deficiency of good crops there is amply supplied by the fertility of the other and larger parts of silesia which exclusive of wheat rye barley and oats yields maize or barley wheat spelt buckwheat millet linseed peace and beans the culinary herbs about breslau brieg neyze frankenstein and lignitz are excellent and the neighborhood of granberg and lower beuthen affords plenty of fine fruits even in the parts contiguous to poland are many substantial families who live in the most desirable affluence persons of rank purchase estates there that yield from   to    per cent flax hops and madder are grown every where and the latter forms one of their most considerable exports scharte a yellow dye is gathered by cartloads they have also tobaccoplantations and some saffron in many seasons the wine made here may be drank with pleasure in the mountains and upper silesia tar pitch and rosin is extracted from the pine fir and beech the larchtree yields turpentine and from the trunks of the coarser pines the inhabitants of the mountains make a lampblack  in the mountains are found agate jasper and even some gems particularly amethysts of uncommon hardness and beauty and some diamonds here are great plnty of blocks of stone formed into gravestones pillars etc and at neusalz in lower silesia the king has a manufctory of millstones one of which four rhenish eet an a half long will sell for    rixdollars or but    english here are also some coal pits silver min and one of gold and copper and leadmines viriol  found here in many places and at massel and other places are a great many iron sounderies  as they breed but few horned cattle they are chifly supplied from poland and hungary and at the f of brieg breslau and schweidnitz it is usual to see from  fifteen thousand ead of polish and hungarian cate a great quantity of cheese is here made of goats milk and two good goats are held equal to a cow they breed some stout fine horse and the sheep which are shorn twice a year are very profitable for their wool they have plenty of game and some wild animals as lynxes otter foxes etc which are caught for their skins  in the oder which traverses silesia from end to end and is navigable almost all the way are caught salmon and sturgeon the latter sometimes six or seven else long sate from  0 to  0lb each and other rivers and the lakes produce various kinds of fish in great plenty  in silesia there are     cities and    market towns and the villages are so thick as to stand within a cannonshot of each other and the inhabitants of prussian silesia are said to amount to   00000 these consist chiefly of germans and poles exclusive of the clergy in silesia reside dukes princes counts barons gentlemen citizens and peasants its dukes or princes till    0 were only five of whom the bishop of breslau is the first but the late king of prussia added two more to their number  the chief religion of this place is the romancatholic but there is a universal toleration and all parties enjoy a perfect libty of conscience the bishop of breslau is of the romish faith and is vicar general of all the popish clrgy within the russian dominions and this diocese the only one comprehends seven collegiate churches seventyseven archpresbyteries sixteen priries eightysix convents and     parishes all ecclesiastical benefices are in the kings gift  of the reformed religion there are lutherans calvinists hussites and moravians at breslau is a greek church besides which the jews also are permitted their synagogues  the principal manufactures in silesia are those of thread twine linen flax and damask printing of linen here in oil and watercolors is carried to great perfection besides which canvas and buckram of several kinds are made and laces and paper more than they have occasion for besides stockings and hats are here also manufactured linseywoolsey druggets fustians plush callimanco and other stuffs also cotton ginghums leather etc they make a beautiful kind of crystal glass and polish and cut it beyond other countries in silesia also are a number of powder and ironmills  the principal exports are madder millstones thread yarn linen wool woolencloths stuffs and paper their impors are wax honey hides leather furs brought  poland hungary and russia wheat xen horses and rocksalt with wines from hungary moravia and aria the countries about the rhine and france etc  of prussian silesia breslau is the capital it lies on the oder which on the north side runs close by the walls its fortifications are of no great importance it has several large and regular squares the chief streets are also broad it has many stately public edifices and contains numbers of very elegant houses and other private buildings here are a cathedral twentyfour churches of different persuasions with some convents a bishops palace and a popish university the city has a governor a high court of justice a court of exchequer a war a domain and several taxoffices a college of physicians and a mint it is the third city in rank next to berlin and koningsberg in all the russian dominions has two fairs two yearly markets and two markets for wool the bishop is a roman catholic but the magistracy is lutheran it is the center of all the trade in silesia and carries on diverse manufactures several villages in the neighborhood belong to the city several to the bishop and several to the chapters of the cathedral  all the country within thirty miles of the city is rich either in corn meadow or wool the arable land is well cultivated and potatoes are planted for the consumption of breslau in great quantities the king of prussia keeps a garrison of  0000 men who are drawn up in the great square every day and go through their exercise  the manufacture of linen in silesia is very considerable it employs many thousands enriches the whole duchy and brings in a very considerable revenue to the king most of the linens which are bleached at harlaem in holland and afterward are so well known under the name of dutch are made in silesia formerly immense quantities were consumed in england but since the great success which has attended the fabrics of ireland and scotland this impolitic importation has come to nothing  landed property here is much disordered now and then says marshal we see an old barons estate of great extent around an old castle with all the marks of antiquity and grandeur but in general the land belongs to persons enriched by trade and manufactures on these estates the lands are let to farm as in england and the peasants not being vassals to tenants are hired in the manner of under laborers the common rent is from seven to eleven shillings an acre wheat yields two quarters per acre barley three buckwheat four and their flaxgrounds yield a profit of four pounds an acre they lay most of the manure they make on their cabbagegrounds make great use of mud from the oder and plough their land with oxen  a description of bohemia from brown keyser buschin reisbec moore etc chap i of the country climate and productions ohemia in german implies the residence of the lo a pp who with the hlvet inhabited the hercynian forest  were thence expelled in the reign of augustus mon bohemia including part of morava is bounded by saxony and lusatia or the north by prussian silesia and hungary on the east by bavaria and austria towd the south and by the palatinate of bavaria and saxony toward the west it is near  00 english miles from north to south and   0 from east to west  a map of hungary etc map of hungary  bohemia as a country has been run down by travelers but moore says though it is by no means so fertile or so fine a country as saxony it has many very beautiful places and varied with the most agreeable rural objects reisbec says it is a country favored of heaven and its climate excellent so that many foreigners have made prague their constant residence the spring is not so beautiful even at rome as it is here spring and summer are as remarkable as the winter is at vienna where you seldom see a regular spring but the winter and summer almost join the climate is not exposed to any of those sudden and inclement changes which are so fatal to health in other places the winter colds are neither too sharp nor the summer heats too strong the air is dry clear and temperate the country is high and forms a large extent surrounded on all sides by very high hills covered with rich woods the vale in the middle is watered by the elbe the moldaw and the eyer of which an idea may be easily formed by looking on the map that it is protected from the force of the winds though being an inland country remote from any other it is colder than many places in the same latitude  the several hollows in the middle of the vale contribute to let out the waters so that there are neither lakes nor morasses to fill the air with unwholesome vapors some few parts of the country are sandy and some stony but the soil in general is fat and rich  within three miles of trautenau on the borders of silesia is a very wonderful natural curiosity as we approach it a great number of high towers offer to the view several of which in many places are in regular rows and most of them dispersed in an extraordinary manner we walk through them near a mile as in a kind of labyrinth encompassed with these towers on each side most of them are from sixty to seventy feet high and some from  00 to   0 when viewed obliquely their summits form a kind of waving line like the back of a hill which rises and sinks again they are all formed of a hard quarry stone and nature has generally shaped them into more or less regular squares the general opinion is that these rocks are the skeleton of a hill through which the water has made its way washing away the earth and in course of time has left the rocky or stony part of the hill quite bare  in this neighborhood is the famous hill of bohemia called riesenberge considered by the inhabitants of this flat country as a mountain but in fact though it is  000 feet in ascent and requiring three hours time to climb to the top yet it is a mole hill compared with mount st gothard in switzerland whose elevation above the mediterranean sea is more than   000 feet and yet by no means the highest mountain of the alps on the top of riesenberge is a plain with a chapel on it visited by pious people once a year and from its summit the prospect into bohemia and silesia and the great mountains below it is striking and magnificent  the confines of bohemia are distinguished by painted brick posts ten feet high bearing the arms of the country and we no sooner pass them than we meet with a quite different husbandry a different people and a different language that part of bohemia between prague and saxony is infinitely richer and more beautiful than that which lies between prague and austria agriculture like the country itself is more varied the people live closer together and seem to be happier hills woods plains and vales form an agreeable contrast with each other and the vine not to be seen elsewhere but in the road from prague to dresden here covers the sides of the hills  bohemia produces every thing that can contribute to the comfort of life in astonishing abundance wine and salt only excepted but these they have brought to them at a moderate price there have been many successful experiments made to produce wine but the country is scarce able to produce a sufficiency of this article for its consumption bohemian hops are carried as far as the rhine in great quantities and they export a great deal of strong beer the breed of horses is wonderfully improved here within these few years and furnishes a great part of the dragoonhorses for the army any man may get his mare covered in the imperial studs or those of the nobility for a guilder as these studs are furnished with moldavian tartarian and transylvanian stonehorses so that the peasants every where have excellent horses  bohemian tin is superior to all but the english and they carry on a very considerable trade in alum and several precious stones particularly garnets the large woods in which the country abounds furnish materials for their wonderful glassmanufactories which bring a great deal of money into the country and find their way into all parts of europe  muscovy glass and stonecoal are found here also sulphur and vitriolic water gold though not at present sought for has been met with particularly in their rivers they have silver mines at kuttenburg and other places and mines that produce copper lead quicksilver and saltpeter above  00 towns and places may be named where mineworks have been established all kinds of marble are likewise dug in bohemia among the precious stones are some diamonds rubies chrysolies emeralds sapphires etc etc it has also some mineral waters and warm baths at calsbad and teiplitz  the rivers elbe and moldau rise in bohemia unite below prague run through saxony by hamburgh and empty into the german ocean it is navigable at leutmeritz the oder rises in silesia washes the shore of poland brandenburg and pomerania and falls into the baltic there are other towns but these are the principal  there are ten principal highways leading from prague through the whole country they are made in a direct line and in many places secured by masonry the hollow parts bing filled up and deep trenches cut on both sides to carry f the water this useful labor cost some millions of florins though the sougers must give their labor gratis their way of traveling is not different from urs coaches are in use here though the roads except the great ones above mentioned are none of the best the lower ponds are deep in winter and the mountainous parts inconvenient for wheel carriages of course they travel by water where they can and in winter use skate and sledges  in the inns on the road we seldom fail meeting with good provisions as  capons pheasants partridges and hares but the ldging  not agreeable to the other entertainment being general only some clean straw spread on the floor with a boliter or pillow for the head  as they have a good deal of pastureground they abound in oxen sheep and other cattle they have also most other animals wild and tame which are found in europe and great quantities of deer and game in their forests their rivers supply them well with fish and fowl  moravia is a large province on the east of bohemia one half of it so mountainous and woody and so rough as to be almost desolate in the more open parts are many morasses bogs and lakes the inhabitants here can grow sufficient corn for their consumption plenty of hemp and flax good saffron and what is remarkable in some places they dig frankincense and myrrh out of the earth they make white and red wines in the tracts lying toward hungary and austria here are plenty of otters bears and a species of leopard as large as dogs but thicker and also some boars the language of the people is a dialect of the slavonic little differing from bohemian yet the german language is very commonly spoken  the kings of this country were till the  th century powerful and independent poland bohemia and silesia all belonged to muscovy in  0  it became a prey to the germans poles and hungarians and was conquered and united with bohemia in  0   of course we shall speak of it generally as speaking of bohemia it contributes about one third part to the exactions which bohemia pays to the emperor  chap ii of the cities people trade etc bohemia is well peopled but was formerly much more populous than at present but during the intestine religious wars and the succeeding irruption of the swedes many of the towns villages and castles were laid waste so that at present exclusive of moravia it contains only  0  great and small towns and not much above  000 villages in the last century in the course of three or four years  0000 fixed families quitted the country besides others and the greatest part of the nobility on this account an attentive traveller finds the towns boroughs villages and highways very desolate  of    royal towns prague is the chief and the capital of the kingdom it lies almost in the middle and on both sides of the river moldau which is here shallow and not navigable but about  00 paces broad the stone bridge over it is     common paces long and so wide that three carriages may pass abreast it stand on sixteen piers ornamented on the sides with twentyeight statues of saints it was built by charles iv in      the fortifications are not very important for the  may be flanked or raked on all sids the houses are wholly buil of stone and are generally thre stories high it has broader streets but fewer stately palaces than vienna and contains    churches and chapels and about  0 convents the inhabitants are estimated at  0000 christians and     and   000 jews it is a very large city divided into three by the river is above thee miles long two broad but is by no means populous in several parts you seem as in  village near the bridge which stands at the upper part of the city the number of people is very great but the further you go from this the more destitute is the place the royal castle which is a very large irregular building is built on a hill that commands an extensive prospect not far from hence stands the archbishops house a pretty modern building and the old cathedral in which are some pieces of architecture which deserve notice the bohemian nobility who can bear the expense reside at vienna  though the city is in general illbuilt the situation is extremely fine there is a finer prospect from the bridge than in many larger cities the mass of houses rises like an amphitheatre to a considerable height to the right the hill rises above them as far as the imperial palace majestically situated on the top on the left it is covered as far as the middle with beautiful gardens and pleasure houses which have a fine effect and a most extensive and magnificent amphitheatre  from these gardens is a very fine prospect over the opposite part of the city in the midst of the broad but dry moldau there are two small islands called great and little venice where the inhabitants make parties of pleasure  the jews form a considerable part of the inhabitants of this place and live in a quarter by themselves called the jews city it is pleasant to walk through the place and see their tailors and shoemakers at work in the middle of the streets they are distinguished here from the christians by a yellow handkerchief which they are obliged to wear round their arms their industry is wonderful in almost every inn there is a jew who does the business of a houseservant and does every thing but will take no money the only reward they will accept is some cast clothes which they make money of  in whatever degree this city may have dwindled in wealth and magnificence the piety of the inhabitants certainly ourishes as much as ever i do not recollect says moore so many glaring acts of devotion in any place the corners of the streets bridges and public buildings are all ornamented with crucifixes images of the virgin of all sizes and complexions and statues of saints of every country condition age and sex people are to be seen on their knees before these statues in every part of this city but particularly on the bridge where there is the greatest concourse of passengers not contented with kneeling i saw some prostrate on their faces kissing the earth here is a chapel of loretto belonging to the capuchins in imitation of the holy house of lorretto in italy it is so rich with jewels and treasure as to be estimated in value at several tons of gold here is one pyx set with      diamonds representing the sun which cost  00000 guilders and  0000 making  the houses of the nobility are many of them built after the italian model that of the duke of friedland is a stately structure built on the ruins of above  00 houses which were pulled down to make room for it and furnish materials the gardens are exceedingly beautiful in the stables which are very large stands a marble pillar between each horse and to every standing is a rack of steel and a marble manger and over it the picture of the horse that used it as large as life with his name  in the houses of the peasants there is a place walled in to hold the stove or fireplace to which they ascend by a few narrow stone steps as into a cock loft in this warm apartment they sleep away the cold winternights very comfortably  the church of the cross of is an elegant piece of architecture adorned with fine marble pillars and beautiful paintings without the townhouse is a clock made at the end of the   th century exhibiting the revolutions of the sun and moon the day of the month the length of the days nights etc but great part of the movements are out of order the horsemarket is a very large airy place and is adorned with an equestrian statue of king wenceslaus in the center the cathedral church of st vitus is very rich in plate altarfurniture relics etc among other valuable ornaments is a crucifix of hungarian virgingold weighing  0000 ducats a considerable part of st wenceslaus chapel is covered with jasper amethysts and cornelian some as large as a mans fist but irregularly set without order  the prospect from the royal apartments of the palace is quite charming and the hall where the emperor entertains the nobility is well contrived and very splendid within the palace is a museum  the whole town in this city is a stateprison and it is said there was formerly in one of the rooms of this town a curious machine made in the shape of a woman which when any delinquent was brought near it would embrace him and with its arms violently break his back and ribs but no such thing is now to be seen some say it is removed to st peters and that this machine was particularly appropriated for the private execution of ecclesiastical criminals  on the ratschin is the palace of count czernini which in size is inferior to walensteinhouse which stands near it but in the magnificence of the building and richness of the furniture it has few equals in any city in europe about forty years ago when keysler was there the grand hall was not finished though it was  00 years since it was first began and workmen were generally employed upon it the noble gallery of pictures in this palace is     paces long the counts annual income is  00000 guilders each guilder  s  d english and he spared no expense in its embellishment  the credulity and superstition of the bohemians is astonishing here is a pillar in the church of st peter which they say the devil brought from rome and broke by putting it down too hard and it is so universally credited that it would be dangerous to question its truth on the altar of st longinus the officer that pierced the side of christ on the cross is a large stone coffin in which the saint is said to have sailed on the moldau on the bank of this river which is  000 paces broad they have built a chapel to commemorate the leap which a sorcerer took on horseback over the river and they tell you this horse had the talent of conversing with its master on the parapt of the wall where the horse allighted which is of brick they show the print of the horses feet these and such like fables abound throughout bohemia and are not only very frequently related very gravely in common discourse but to obtain greater credit are published in books indeed many of the austrian and bohemian nobility will swallow improbabilities without examination or making use of their reason even beyond any other romancatholics  there is scarce a bridge in all the austrian heredditary states that has not a statue of st nepomac who is the patron of bridges this saint suffered martyrdom by being precipitated from the bridge of prague by order of king wenceslaus in      because he would not reveal what the queen had entrusted him with at confession the canonization of this new patron was a great expense to the bohemians it was in the pontificate of clement xi  prague has been frequently besieged and frequently taken not to mention former times it was taken by the saxons in      by the swedes in      by the elector of bavaria in      by the austrians in      and by the russians in       an hoursride from the city stands the whitehill where the memorable battle on the  th of november    0 was fought between the emperors forces commanded by the duke of bavaria and the troops of the elector palatine the head of the protestant league wherein the electors army being dispersed the protestant interest in germany suffered much and the elector lost both the kingdom of bohemia and the palatinate this was the soninlaw of james i of england from whom the present family on the english throne is descended  prague has neither an extensive commerce nor any manufactory of consequence there has long been a project of rendering the moldau navigable but the expense has hitherto prevented it was it once done prague would certainly gain a great deal by it there is a convent of irish nuns here indeed throughout all germany we meet with english and scotch nuns the women of this place are handsome and strangers may make love much easier here than at vienna because the people here know better how to connect mental enjoyments with sensual pleasures freemasonry flourishes in prague extremely and some persons dote on it to enthusiasm the numerous garrison here lodged contributes not a little to the liveliness of the place there are about  000 men constantly quartered here the six regiments of grenadiers are the finest of infantry and the officers are excellent company and entirely free from those prejudices from which other bodies of men are not totally exempt  the persons of the bohemians like their neighbors the germans are rather of the largest they are all very corpulent of a hale complexion and wonderfully strong built dubravious one of their historians who was bishop of olmutz in the   th century compares them to lions as the land says he according to the writers of those times lies under the influence of leo so does its inhabitants possess all the qualities of that noble animal their high chests sparkling eyes strong thick hair stout bones strength courage and irresistible spirits when opposed all show evidently that the lion is their star which they have likewise in their coat of arms  they are handsome strongbuilt and an active race of people evidently descended from the croats who are some of the handsomest people upon the earth their heads are a little too large but their broad shoulders and stout thickset bodies render the disproportion not so visible as it otherwise would be they are without doubt the best soldiers of all the emperors troops they can bear the inconveniences of a military life longer than any even hunger that deadly fiend to every thing that calls itself an imperial soldier they support for a considerable time  the constitution and manners of the country contribute much to make the bohemians such soldiers as they are the farmers live in a poverty which preserves them from effeminacy and luxury much more an any positive sumptuary law could do besides his the feudal system which obtains here in the exeme accustoms them from their youth upwards to nconditional obedience the great military virtue of ur days their constant labor and scanty food der them ardy and like the spartans they find  life far easier then ploughing the fields of eir sters  this is the first country we come to from the eastward where the people voluntarily quitted the asiatic habit of vests and gowns and clothed themselves in short coats breeches and stockings as with us the women too have left off their drawers and breeches which the eastern ladies never go without and conform themselves to the french dress though some few who live on the confines of poland still continue to cloth themselves like that people  bohemian gentlemen and persons of rank are said to be naturally brave and more inclined to arms than to arts and to be of an open lively conversation their boors on the contrary who are all in a state of vlage to their great men are said to be a brutish kind of people much given to pilfering and intemperance both in eating and drinking they are also called stupid and insensible riesbec say take them all together they have a great deal of feeling and natural bohemians understanding he conversed with several who lamented the horrors of their situation in terms sufficiently expressive and spoke of the cruelty of their tyrants as it ought to be spoken of they love their emperor with a degree of enthusiasm and are confident that he will break their chains in the hussite war they gave proofs of courage which would obscure all the famed deeds of the helvetic one if they were but half as well described or sung as these have been  i could not without the greatest commiseration says riesbec look upon the handsome young farmers who barefooted with torn linen and stockings uncommonly tattered and yet clean clothes without neckcloths often without hats were carrying corn or wood for their masters to market slaves to their employers and yet in the best temper and highest spirits  credulity is another soible the bohemians are remarkable for we every where meet with stories of spirits and apparitions and if we may credit the inhabitants there is not a mine in the country which is not haunted by one or more of them  riesbec tells us he went some way out of his road to a cloister or two to see the manner and way of life of the bohemian ecclesiastics in their own dwellings and he assures us he was richly rewarded they are says he the most determined epicureans particularly the regular bodies of them i ever met with they want nothing in their convents for the accomplishment of all earthly gratifications but a cloister of nuns made up of the maidens who do business at prague by night sub jove pluviis in triviis et quadriviis whatever bad effects it might have in some respect the farmers and manufacturers who live in the neighborhood of their convents and consider their wives as their property would undoubtedly be pleased with the arrangement as things now are the monks and halfnks to whom the villages round belong appear like so many womenhunters  in some convents we met with singing women  the lives of the regular bodies and even of the benedictines who have not given up the pleasures of the world is a perpetual carousal interrupted only by country walks and certain stated belchings in church they look upon chaunting the service as a kind of expectoration good for the lungs one of them for whom i expressed some concern on seeing him at immense quantities of eggs butter etc on a fast day said jestingly pshaw it will all come up again at afternoonservice  with respect to handicrafttrades and ats the bohemins are as much adapted to them as other nations but apply not themselves to the fine manufactures indeed at lpa neuhau and reichnberg a good cloth is made at beraun and leipa good potters work at bensen fine paper and at at other places good knife and swordblades and a fine sort of glass  their commerce is but small corn and malt is exported into saxony and the former into bavaria hops and the spawwaters of egra are also plentifully sent out of the kingdom and a great quantity of their paper pottery and glass and to prevent the importation of such articles as are made in the country a high duty is laid on them  the bohemians travel much some as dealers in glass will go as far as england and italy and some as basket and sevemakers reisbec says he has met with large caravans of them on the upperrhine and in the netherlands these people commonly return home with pretty large sums of money and keep together like brothers whilst in foreign countries they have indeed an uncommon share of patriotism and a kind of confidence in each other which makes them pass in the eyes of strangers for a savage and barbarous people though in reality they are not so  since the days of huss they have a secret hatred to the germans and an unspeakable aversion to whatever is german which does not arise so much from bad temper as from a kind of national pride most of the farmers who live near the roads speak german but as they do not like to talk to a stranger without necessity they pretend not to understand a word of what the traveller says and make their sport of him amongst themselves  chap iii of their language learning government etc their language like that of the poles is a dialect of the ancient sclavonian a language so copious and sure that their ancient laws required the true pronunciation and orthography of it to be strictly observed which was exceedingly difficult having the use of no other letters than the runic characters but afterward when germany came to have a more intimate correspondence with bohemia the roman letters were introduced and their language became more refined the modern bohemians however are very remiss in this particular and the nobility consider it as beneath them to speak their native tongue choosing rather the high dutch or a jargon between the two  learning aries but in fferently here there is a university at prage but it lost its reputation about the middle of the fifteenth century it is under the inspection of the jesuits who have here and there academical collegs and gymnasia  the jesuit have here one of the largest colleges belonging to their order those of go and lisbon excepted  fathers of that order constantly reside here their ools in the ity are very full near   00 their library is worth notice very light and lofty adorned with galleries well contrived in the mathematical cabinet erected here among other instruments are a moving armillary sphere on tycho brahes system and a large sextant made by him a kind of perpetual motion consisting of balls unning in a circular motion various sorts of clockwork etc to the same great man is owing the following ingenious invention by fixing two unequal glasses placed at the die of    feet opposite to each other some tinder and gunpowder laid at the focus of one glass take fire by blowing on a hot coal at the focus of the other these glasses are of a parabolical convexity m du foy in      exhibited this experiment before the academy of sciences at paris and maintained that two spherical glasses would produce the same effect even at a greater distance tycho brahe though a native of denmark retired here was a privy counselor to the emperor ended his days at prague and was here buried with his wife and children a monument in one of the churches is erected to his memory and under it he is represented on a bassorelievo of marble in armor with a long sword by his side a band and whiskers leaning with his right hand on a celestial sphere  prague like vienna abounds in literati who are content to line their rooms with the busts medals prints and profiles of learned men but neither think or write for themselves and are only called literati from belonging to no other association of men whatever it is here says baron reisbec as at vienna whoever has neither military nor civil employment nor is professor nor priest nor merchant nor handicraftsman nor manufacturer nor servant nor daylabourer nor what in the catalogue passes for a man executioner is a man of letters whether he studies or not in the general acceptance a man of letters is only a negative quality i was continues the baron acquainted with a few positive literati at prague but their number in companion of the negative is very inconsiderable  the bohemians however who apply themselves to the arts and sciences are generally speaking successful in them they do not want genius and have uncommon industry their fondness for music is astonishing i have says reisbec heard several orchestras here which equalled those of paris in brilliancy of execution and surpassed them in accuracy and exactness of harmony bohemian players on the horn and harp are to be met with throughout all germany as they always bring home large sums of money you seldom see a musician of this kind who has not traveled most of the students of rome are musicians and begin very early in life to give serenades and concerts in the squares and public places of the city  of the religion of this country i will be more particular christianity was introduced here about the year   0 but about   0  some scholars who had attended richard of englands queen who was a bohemian to london and had conversed with the disciples of wickliffe on their return communicated their doctrine to john huss a doctor of the university of prague who from the hints he thus received began to reflect on the errors of the church of rome and with jerome a master of arts of that university began a reformation by preaching against the popes supremacy and other tenets of the romancatholic church and brought over great part of the bohemians to their way of thinking this brought huss and jerome to the stake and put their adherents under the bar which occasioned a bloody war that continued many years in      the greater part of the moravian or bohemian brethren were banished their country and fled to poland and prussia in the sixteenth century the lutherans increased considerably in bohemia and a toleration was granted in      in      matthias emperor of germany declared his cousin ferdinand king of bohemia and caused him to be crowned and this ferdinand so oppressed the protestants that an insurrection took place the protestants threw the emperors chief justice out of the castlewindow two stories high or    else  keyser says six stories and after him one of the council of state and a secretary of the emperor which window they show to strangers to this day raised an army and offered the crown to frederick v elector palatine who married elizabeth daughter of james i king of england this prince accepted the throne and was crowned in november      ferdinand king of bohemia who had succeeded to the empire proclaimed him as a rebel marched an army against him and on the white hill near prague as i have mentioned defeated frederick and obliged him to fly into silesia and from thence to holland whereby he not only lost bohemia but his whole palainate since which the kingdom of bohemia has been enjoyed by the imperial family in      the protestants were deprived of their privileges and such as would not submit to the romancatholic church were expelled the kingdom from that time popery has been the ruling religion in bohemia the few remaining lutherans were afterward obliged to conceal themselves as much as possible  the archbishop of prague is legate of the holy apostolic see of rome is a prince of the holy roman empire primate of the kingdom and standing chancellor of the university of prague he crowns the king and has two suffragan bishops under him those of leutmeritz and konigingratz the archiepiscopal consistory has the sole supreme jurisdiction over the clergy and from it lies an appeal to the king or pope  the hussites are still very numerous in this country some think that a fourth part of the people are of that sect which has also spread widely in moravia within these ten years more than  0000 farmers made a small stand to recover their freedom of opinion but they were soon quieted huss attacked the whole system of the romancatholic church purgatory fasts monkery etc and it is certain his disciples were only one step behind calvin  how strange is the policy of this country the government of bohemia allows the jews the professed enemies of christianity freedom of thought and liberty to serve god in their own way and refuses it to christians like themselves whilst a hostile dreadful treacherous people are maintained in the full possession of their rights and privileges contracts have been repeatedly violated with the hussites  a word or two of their government shall close our account of this country  bohemia is frequently considered as part of germany but it is one of the emperors hereditary countries and excluded from those privileges which the other circles and electorates enjoy except that the imperial family as kings of bohemia have a voice in the election of a king of the romans for near  00 years the austrian family have claimed the kingdom of bohemia with the incorporate provinces of silesia and moravia as their hereditary dominions governing them by no other laws than their own will and pleasure silesia indeed has been disputed and is divided as i have mentioned between prussia and bohemia the king as elector of bohemia precedes all temporal electors and owns no vicar of the roman empire he is archcupbearer of the holy roman empire and on this office rests the king of bohemias right to elect a king of the romans  the arms of bohemia are a silver lion with a double tail on a field gules  the crown of bohemia was preserved one hundred years elective by the nobility as in poland till it settled in the present austrian family their husbandmen tradesmen and mechanics were and still are in a state of vassalage to their respective lords who have the entire disposal of them and administer justice as they see fit in their several courts nor does the government interfere in their decisions but in some extraordinary cases where it may affect the state or where the life of the subject may be wantonly taken away so that every lord is in effect a monarch in his own territories    silesia chap i austrian as well as prussian silesia was formerly a part of the kingdom of poland but many german colonies having settled there in the   th century gave rise to the separation which was afterward thoroughly effected  the poles having entertained a disgust against the silesian dukes on account of their adopting the german manners soon paved the way for wenzel ii king of bohemia to ascend the throne of poland in      this monarch marched an army through silesia where several princes submitted to him whose example was gradually followed by the rest thus they all came under the bohemian government taking their lands in fief from the crown  this change was ratified by the polish kings for casimir the then reigning king entered into a covenant with john king of bohemia by virtue of which he resigned silesia to him and his successors as the latter also on his part disclaimed all right to poland  by virtue of a golden bull procured by the emperor charles iv in      silesia was solemnly united to the crown of bohemia which constitution lasted till the death of charles vi in    0 but frederick ii king of prussia revived after this the claim of the electoral house of brandenburg to the duchies of jagerndorf lignitz brieg and wohlaw to accomplish which he marched an army into silesia and a war was the consequence with the house of austria in which the former having successfully reduced all the lower silesia together with the greatest part of the upper and the county of glatz to his subjection he was confirmed in it by the treaties of breslau and dresden in      and       since the latter period the king of prussia has ruled this part of silesia independent of the crown of bohemia and the german empire and hence it comes to pass that it is only the residue of silesia the house of austria is now in possession of as a bohemian fief and thus becomes connected with the german empire  the territories of austrian silesia consist of four principalities namely teschen troppau jagerndorf and grotkau  there are no considerable cities in austrian silesia but many small towns and villages however none sufficiently interesting to give the reader a description of the inhabitants are like their neighbors the bohemians and germans tall athletic and robust in stature the people of quality are said to be naturally brave and more inclined to arms than to the milder arts and sciences and of an easy affable conversation on the contrary the lower class of people are brutish and very cruel given to every species of vice particularly those that arise from intemperance in the immoderate use of spirituous liquors for the most part those people are like the highlanders of scotland very much addicted to the idle fancies of a second sight indulging the notions of apparitions and specter so that every cave or solitary abode with which this country greatly abounds is said to be haunted this raises a continual dread and terror in the inhabitants solely from the chimerical operations of a distempered imagination which to a long indulged habit create such lively representations of supernatural objects that the distemper can scarcely ever be eradicated  austrian silesia is subject to bohemian laws for neither the arts or laws of the german diet or empire are of any force here as with the subjects of bohemia they acknowledge only their own princes of the house of austria  the manufactures of the country are linen and woollen in which they are arrived at no great perfection copper tin and iron are also tolerably well performed in their manufactories the imports are very inconsiderable  this country is interspersed with rocks and mountains which are very barren but the valleys are fertile and produce every necessary of life with several mines of copper lead and iron  the cattle are partly of the same denominations of those in england therefore we shall omit their description their fowls and game are very numerous  the buildings are erected in the italian style the usual dwellings are of wood but the churches are of stone their way of traveling is much the same as in germany but the roads are very bad the lower grounds are deep in water and the mountainous part of the country is inconvenient for wheelcarriages which in winter are supplied by sledges on the ice both on the higher and lower parts of the country  in speaking of bohemia we have noticed that this province principally belongs to prussia it is formed of different sects in their religion his late majesty frederick ii king of prussia at the peace of berlin in      permitted the popish religion to continue in statu quo though without detriment to the freedom of conscience of his protestant inhabitants or to his own prerogative as sovereign  the reformation in silesia was first introduced in      by the principality of lignitz under the auspices of frederick ii duke of lignitz breslau and schwednitz soon embraced lutheranism and after these followed almost every principal town of the provinces in silesia the augsburg confession was granted by the emperor as a toleration for its free exercise schools were publicly permitted yet after the death of rodolphus ii emperor of germany great violence was used to bring the protestants into the pale of the romish church  the celebrated charles the xiith king of sweden interfered in behalf of the lutherans in   0  and obtained for them a free exercise of their religion in this famous convention the calvinists were not included consequently the fiery zealots of the romish persuasion soon found means to extirpate them however after some remonstrances and petitions the late great frederick ii king of prussia recalled them and gave them leave to exercise their mode of religious worship publicly in breslau and several other parts of this province the hussites or bohemian reformed have also several congregations here  silesia has ever been famous for producing men of learning of whom not a few have been very eminently distinguished in the republic of letters baron wolfius the celebrated philosopher was a native of this country  the germanic body is obliged to take into its defense and protection the kingdom of bohemia with all its dependencies and of course silesia is included but the king of prussia having obtained the greatest part of it by the partition of      holds it independent of the empire the emperor being guarantee for his quiet possession of it he cannot fail in the sovereignty    a description of hungary from busching brown keysler riesbec moore montagu etc chap i of the country climate and productions hungary with its incorporated countries sclavonia dalmatia bosnia servia and transylvania etc is bounded by the carpathian mountains in the north dividing it from poland by walachia on the west by germany on the east by venetian dalmatia and the adriatic sea on the south east and by european turkey on the south lying between    and    degrees of north latitude and from the   th to the   d degree of longitude from the meridian of london its northern parts are mountainous and barren but its southern level warm and fruitful  the plains of hungary are clear and open and if compared with our english plains as salisbury lincoln and newmarket exceed them in size as a full grown man does a child i have traveled says brown from vienna to belgrade through one continued plain for  00 miles without any eminencies except one inconsiderable wood near bacna beyond dotis upper hungary has good store of woods and hills yet intermingled with large plains hungary with the incorporated provinces contains    0 square english miles  the air is very unwholesome especially to foreigners the days in summer being excessive hot and the nights intolerably cold hungary has been called the german soldiers grave generally producing a fever which first shows itself by nodes and tubercles on the hands and arms the plague comes here from turkey and spreads by contagion the carpathian mountains are overrun at bottom with common trees higher up with larger ones and at a greater interval which makes as it were the third region with brushwood the summit is a chaos of frightful crags and precipices continually covered with snow and lakes of very transparent water lying between them  in rivers this country perhaps excells any other in europe on the east it has that noble river teys or tibiscus rising in the carpathian mountains and joining its current with the danube between waradin and belgrade on the west is the araba which empties into the danube on the south are two considerable rivers the drove and the save which run each a course of  00 miles and empty also into the danube and on the north are two rivers joining likewise the danube  the danube is the greatest of the whole being swelled by the junction of other rivers its runs quite through hungary receiving in its course   0 rivers  0 of which are navigable and discharges itself by several outlets with such violence into the black sea that both the stream and water are perceptible in it for several miles distance it begins to be navigable near ulm in suabia passes by ingolstadt ratisbon shawbing lentz and vienna to presburg and thence continues its course  00 miles through hungary to belgrade  no river has such large and well peopled islands as the danube for example the isle of st andrews betwixt vicegrade and vacia another a little below buda against the west side of which stands adom  0 english miles long and containing many villages another opposite to mohatz another at the confluence of the drove and danube and another new one near belgrade where till within this century there was not the least trace of an island to be seen besides no river at such a distance from its mouth can boast of so many considerable naval engagements as the danube the emperor keeping galleys at vienna presburgh and comorrah as do the turks at strigonum buda belgrade etc in turkish history we are told that at a siege of belgrade there appeared  00 galleys and other armed vessels and that these were so smartly engaged by the christian fleet that besides what were taken the turks were obliged to fire their own ships to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy the christians also had a fleet of    galleys and  0 other armed vessels besides tenders and ships of burden at the siege of buda and when solomon the magnificent lay before vienna the imperial admiral coming out of presburgh sunk the turkish vessels which carried the heavy cannon intended for battering the walls  here are also two remarkable lakes one in the palalatinate of simigen eight german miles long and two broad and another between the palatinates of oldenburg and wiesselburg  these rivers and lakes abound with fish the teys is so well stocked that a thousand carps have been sold for a crown and in some places fish are so plentiful that they feed their hogs with them  whilst speaking of the waters i must not omit to mention the many salutary hot baths with which this country abounds the natural baths of buda are the noblest in europe not only in respect of the largest hot springs but in the magnificence of the buildings i will speak of these when describing buda  in the district of torner in the eastern part of upper hungary at szelitz near torna is a wonderful cavern in a mountain the aperture which fronts the south is    fathoms high and eight broad and of course wide enough to receive the south wind which generally blows here with great violence its subterraneous passages consist entirely of solid rock stretching away further south than has yet been discovered as far as it is practicable to go the height is found to be  0 fathoms and the breadth    but the most unaccountable singularity in this cavern is that in the heart of winter the air is warm in the inside and when the heat of the sun without is scarce supportable freezing cold within when the snow melts in spring the inside of the cavern where its surface is exposed to the sultry sun emits a pellucid water which congeals as it drops by the extreme cold the icicles are of the size of a large cask and spreading into rarifications form very odd figures it is observed also that the greater the heat without the colder it is within and in the dog days all parts are covered with ice the inhabitants use it for cooling the warm springs they thaw it also and drink the water in autumn when the nights grow cold and the diurnal heat abates the ice in the cave begins to dissolve so fast that by winter no more ice is to be seen the cavern then becomes perfectly dry and warm at this time it is surprising to see the swarms of flies and gnats of bats and owls of hares and foxes that make this place their winterretreat till in the beginning of spring it grows too cold for them above the cavern the hill rises to a very great height and on the southern aspect produces plenty of rich grass  the hungarians have many species of wild beasts such as wolves bears lynxes etc vast plenty of game great store of sheep some with spiral horns and long curled wool and such prodigious numbers of oxen that  00000 are sent annually to other countries and they are all ash colored or white they have also plenty of buffalos with which they plough their stiff lands their horses are rather small but swift and in the woods are bred the most active hardy and spirited race for their size in the world they have been found very useful in war and the hussars or light dragoons of the austrian army are mounted on them they are mostly mousecoloured even their poultry is distinguished by their size and shape in short all that breathes here attests either by its growth or agility the wonderful vigor of nature  hungary is without doubt the richest part of the austrian dominions it not only produces every thing that is produced in other countries but feeds them with its overflow and excels them as much in the quality as in the quantity of what it produces it has such a superfluity of the necessaries and enjoyments of life that a traveller has said of it extra hungariam non est vita and si est non est ita that is out of hungary there is no living or if there be living it is not life but here we have great occasion to observe the truth of that axiom that the more nature does for man the less he commonly does for himself the inhabitant of the swiss mountains extracts his sustenance from his nakedness and has changed wildernesses into cultivated and inhabited lands the hollander has turned the muddy sands of the rhine and maese what the sea is constantly disputing with him into a garden whilst the excellent grounds in hungary still lie waste not only a great part of this fruitful land is uncultivated but even that which is is not turned to near the advantage it might be they never dress their lands suffer more than half the ground to lie fallow and their common mode of beating out the grain is by driving oxen as did the ancients among the corn by which half of it is lost in traveling over this country says reisbec you think yourself going over a wild though in fact you are upon a soil which with little trouble would produce  0  0 or even a hundredfold the roads are of an immense breadth and the fields adjoining them of so little value that the postillions drive through them without the least ceremony whenever a little mud or rain in the highway reminds them of its being more convenient  the inhabitants excuse their bad farming by the little value which grain bears every thing indeed is very cheap in this country they say that if their harvests were ten times greater they should gain nothing by them there may be some truth in this but the fault is certainly owing to bad government for the value of grain would undoubtedly increase with an increased population but strange as it is says ricsbec government rather seeks to discourage than promote agriculture  the exportation of hungarian wines one of the richest products of the country and which if it were free would ruin the sale of french wines in the north is clogged with innumerable obstacles left the trade of austrian wines should be hurt their grapes are both large and of a luscious flavor their tokay wine is in high estimation there are near  0 sorts of hungarian wine sold at vienna they improve their lands only by paring and burning and instead of barns or hay and cornstacks they stow their harvest away in deep and spacious caves underground where they retire also with their families in case of invasion by the turks or tartars their bread is very light owing to their kneading it long and very cheap as much may be bought for   d as is sold in england for    d  the artificial appearance of the country is as remarkable as the natural in one place perhaps you see palaces upon which art has exhausted all its magnificence and within a few paces you come to countries where men dwell in caverns like wild beasts at presburg port and ossen which are the largest cities in the country and each of which contains  0000 men you believe yourself in the most enchanted country in the world and within a few miles of their gates you seem to be in mingrelia  the strongest proof possible of the misery of a country is the contrast of extreme poverty with extreme riches and the more striking that contrast is the greater the misery a people may be very poor and yet very happy but when amidst straw huts scarce protecting their inhabitants from wind and weather we see marble palaces towering to the clouds when in the midst of immense wildernesses tenanted by wretched skeletons who barely find roots in the field to keep life and soul together we meet with gardens decorated with fountains and in them grottos parterres terraces statues and costly pictures it is a sure sign that one part of the people live by pilaging the rest  i will now speak of the hungarian mines i mean the gold mines of cremnitz konigsberg schemnitz etc all dependant on austria having been formerly mortgaged to austria by the kings of hungary there are seven of these minetowns to which belong four lordships three days journey in length extending to the borders of poland the supreme officer here is the commissioner of the revenue all moneys pass through his hands and he judges without appeal both in civil and criminal causes he has    officers under him his appointment is  000 guldens a year and   0 for the expense of his table a gulden is   s   d english  these mines are the support of many thousands and the expense of working the whole amounts yearly to  00000 guldens pure gold ore like that of transylvania is here found in the hungarian mines but the latter yields gold ore with a mixture of silver or lead a quintal of the richest ore yields    ounces of silver but some that is refined does not yield more than two ounces in a hundred weight that which yields least silver contains most gold the mine of schemnitz annually produces something above five quintals of gold and with the alloy half an ounce of gold makes five ducats each ducat  s  d english in the general mint from all these towns near  00000 ducats are coined yearly yet some affirm that the annual clear profits of these works amount to  0000 guldens the emperors share only  as a precaution against malpractices or embezzlement all the officers and persons employed here are sworn and excluded from having any share in the mines the workmen labor eight hours and are then relieved one of the mines at schemnitz which is the largest of all the minetowns is well built has three castles and three handsome churches is  0 fathoms deep built and kept open with underwork at a vast expense the greatest part of it being a rocky soil the ore is very rich and generally blue covered with a white clay the ore runs in veins and as they have no certain method of knowing where they lie they proceed by guess and persevere in their labor till they meet with them there is one place where they dug for six successive years and when they at last discovered the vein they found it but two fathoms distant from the place where they first began to dig there is another place where they dug    years before they found the vein but this proved so rich as to pay them well in a short time within the mines they have large wheels    feet in diameter turned by subterranean streams which work engines that pump up the collected water the streams that turn these wheels are not suffered to run into the mines but are carried off by trunks and horizontal passages on the top or outside of the mines are wheels turned by  0 or    horses that pump up the water also  the gold mine at chremnitz has been worked near  000 years and is nine or ten english miles in length it has one cuniculus or horizontal passage  00 fathoms long and its depth is   0 fathoms into which the miners are let down in a kind of leather seat fastened at the end of a cable and the cable turned by a wheel such cables are worth   or  00 guldens each and will not last above eight or ten weeks in these mines the air is sometimes very cold and sometimes so hot that the miners work naked  the gold ore is sometimes white sometimes black some red and some yellow but the white with black spots is accounted the best there have been pieces of pure gold found in this mine as large as the palm of the hand but such pieces are very rare in the emperors museum at vienna is shown a vinestock with a gold wire twining round it which it is said naturally grew thus out of the earth it was found in a vineyard near tokay in the year    0 and presented to the emperor as a most extraordinary curiosity tokay is remarkable for its excellent wine and the spot of land that produces this wine is seven hungarian or    english miles in circumference this tract is interspersed with several towns and as tokay is not a proper liquor for common drinkers if all the waste lands in this district was cultivated no part of europe would be without tokay wine at a moderate price  the occasional damps in these mines have destroyed numbers of miners at a time when they have not been prepared against them the method of preserving the gold is by first grinding and draining the ore then washing it and after all melting the sediment  the number of the several laborers etc employed in the mines of schemnitz amounts to   or  000 men and those without the mines are computed at  000 exclusive of those employed about the carriages   00 horses are usually taken up for these works and a little carriage with two horses is hired for about six or seven guldens per week the emperors expenses in the schemnitz mines alone is yearly near   000l out of     shares the emperor has     the other five are private property some noble families are settled in the minetowns and the greater part of their income arises from the mines at hana near eperiez is dug a whitish ore which yields a great deal of quicksilver extracted per descensum  within six english miles of chremnitz is a warm bath about the heat of the kings bath at bath much frequented and where both sexes bathe promiscuously the men wearing only a kind of drawers and the women a shift wrapped over their heads  chap ii of the cities gran was formerly the capital of hungary till the hungarians lost it thence buda became the capital now presburg is the metropolis it is a regular city situated in a spacious plain on the banks of the danube at the foot of a mountain presburg itself is illbuilt the houses of the town properly so called not much exceeding two hundred and the whole strength of its fortifications consists in a double wall and a moat but the suburbs are large and handsome and contain four universities with churches and two hospitals presburg lies in latitude    degrees   min and is only  0 english miles distant from vienna some of the suburbs rise on a steep hill and the citadel or castle stands on the top of it it is a grand quadrangular gothic building with four towers at the corners exactly alike and is the usual residence of prince albert of saxony from this citadel is a very extensive prospect commanding the vast and fertile plains of hungary toward belgrade the crown and other regalia of hungary are left in one of the abovementioned towers but as the entrance to this castle is through three iron doors the guards posted between the two first doors by means of a grate can see every one that comes up the steps leading to the entrance in the lower suburbs is a hill where the king of hungary at his coronation goes in great state on horseback and brandishes his sword toward the four cardinal points to signify that he is determined to protect his frontiers from enemies on all sides in this city the states of hungary hold their assemblies and in the cathedral church the sovereign is crowned the regalia consisting of the crown and scepter of st stephen their first king are here carefully secured by seven locks the keys of which are kept by the same number of hungarian noblemen no prince is legally their sovereign till he is crowned with the diadem of king stephen and they have a notion that the fate of their nation depends on the crowns remaining in their possession it has therefore been moved in times of danger to places of the greatest safety  old buda is in    degrees  0 minutes north latitude lying on the south side of the danube ninety miles from presburg it stands in a plain extending itself from the suburbs of new buda to the pellis mountains at present it is a poor mean place belonging to the zichy family in and about it are many ruins with several roman monuments new buda is situated on a mountain on the danube was formerly the capital of the kingdom the residence of the king and the largest and finest of all the hungarian towns but having been often besieged taken and destroyed it is now very much reduced the city lies on the declivity of the mountain and its castle stands on the top of it the jesuits here have an academical college and a seminary the carmelite nuns have convents and the franciscans have churches the city is surrounded with walls and moats and well fortified on the opposite side of the river stands the town of pesth in a plain the river being crossed by a bridge of boats here is the supreme court of appeal and a large military hospital built with stone  00 paces square and three stories high the town is surrounded with a wall and moat contains six convents and several churches  at buda are some natural warm baths which when the turks possessed the place from      to      were the noblest in europe not only in respect to the size and heat of the springs but in the magnificence of the buildings these baths are seven in number the emperors bath is built in the manner of the rotunda at rome with a large aperture in the center of the cupola besides several small holes or windows for admitting more light into the dome the emperors bath with a pond of mineral water has this surprising property that when the water is wholly turned off the warm springs cease flowing but when the pond is filled a little above half full they return again the heat is nearly that of the water at bath in england the exhalation of the emperors baths says dr brown reverberated by the cupola form long stones like icicles which hang down from the capitals of the pillars and irons which extend from one column to another as is observed in some other subterraneous grottos for the cupola is supported with large columns and though there are many openings to let out the steam yet the whole seems like a hot stove in the great bath the antichamber is very large the bathingroom spacious high arched and adorned with five cupolas one over the round bath in the middle and one less at each of the four corners where are bathing rooms for private uses twelve pillars support the great cupola between eight of which are fountains of hot water and between the others are places to sit down where the barber and servants of the bath attends and in each of these places are two cisterns of freestone into which they let hot and cold water as the company like in the large bath both sexes publicly bathe together the men wearing only a kind of drawers and the women what they call a fine shift but the common people for whom the raizen bath is appointed look even upon this slight clothing as superfluous keysler tells us a wide subterraneous passage leading from old buda to the citadel has been lately discovered and that it was a way wellknown to the turks the wine of this place has a good flavor is red and much resembles french wine besides grapes buda is famous for fine melons which sell for one penny english each  the mode of bathing according to dr brown is as follows being brought into the antichamber the bather is furnished with a cloth and apron when stripped he puts on the apron goes into the bathroom where sitting down between the pillars near a fountain he is well rubbed and his hands and arms stretched out by the barber who next shaves his head and beard except the upper lip and then proceeds to rub his breast back arms and legs with a hair cloth the bather either sitting or lying on his belly then the barber having washed the head with soap and thrown cold water over the body the bather walks in the steam of the bath for some time and afterward bathes  the nobility here have their villas as in england the following description of one is taken from moore who went to visit a nobleman about four miles from presburg his house is delightfully situated but his gardens laid out a little too methodically the park however and fields where less art had been used display a vast luxuriancy of natural beauties whilst wandering over these we entered a little wood in a very retired place where was a figure of painted wood dressed in a hermits garb to deceive passengers and well executed stretching out his hand as if to invite people to his hermitage hard by over the door was this inscription from horace but which for the ladies is englished odi profanum vulgus how i hate the profane vulgar on the inside of the door within fata volentes ducunt nolentes fate leads the willing but drags the unwilling   and in another part within the hermitage  omnes eodem cogimur omnium versatur urna serius ocius sors exitura et nos in aeternum exilium impositura cymbae thus all must tread the path of fate thus even shakes the mortal urn whose lot embarks us soon or late on charons boat ah never to return francis with several more inscriptions taken from cicero in favor of the souls immortality  but of all the rural residences that of estherhasie is the first being the palace of the prince of that name he is the first in rank of all the hungarian nobility and one of the most magnificent subjects in europe he has bodyguards of his own all genteel looking men richly dressed in the hungarian manner  estherhasie is about  0 miles from vienna the palace is a noble building lately finished and situated near a fine lake the apartments are grand and convenient containing a greater variety of splendid furniture than most royal palaces can boast of in the princes private apartments are some musical clocks and one in the form of a bird that whistles a tune every hour  adjoining the palace is an operahouse small but neat and elegant and in the gardens a large saloon and a commodious suite of rooms for masquerades and balls in this operahouse the performers of venice are often engaged by the prince to perform italian operas if any strangers are at that time in the town he sends to them and invites them to the exhibition and the doors are open to all the country people around about the celebrated haydn is his composer at an annual salary  he has also another theater for puppetshows much larger and more commodious than most country playhouses and dr moore tells us it is the most splendid of its kind he ever saw he did not see any piece performed but was assured they were the best comedians in hungary i had says he the curiosity to peep behind the curtain and saw kings emperors turks and christians all ranged very sociably together king solomon was in a corner in a very suspicious teteatete with the queen of sheba  among other curiosities at this palace is a wooden house in the garden built upon wheels it contains a room with a table chairs a looking glass chimney and fireplace with closets and many necessary accommodations twelve persons may sit round this table and the prince has often entertained a company at dinner whilst they have taken an airing round the garden and many parts of his park which are as level as a bowling green the vehicle thus loaded is drawn easily by six or eight horses  the gardens are of vast extent and beautiful beyond description being diversified with woods hills valleys walks fountains and arbours and the description of alcinas enchanted island will give says moore a very good idea of the romantic fields of estherhasie and which are inhabited by the same kind of animals  while midst the roses red and lilies fair for ever nursed by kindly zephyrs care the nimble hares in wanton mazes played and stately stags with branching antlers strayed without the fear of hostile hand they stood to crop or ruminate their grassy food baron riesbech tells us that this princes estate does not amount to more than  00000 guldens a year and yet there is no place in france except versailles equal to estherhasie in magnificence the castle is immensely large and the garden and grounds contain every thing that human invention could contrive for its improvement or rather for the preservation of nature the pavillions of all kinds appear to be the habitations of so many fairies and every thing is so much above what you meet with in general that when we behold it we are led to think we are dreaming but what renders the magnificence of this place more striking still is the very extraordinary contrast of the country round it the lake of neusredler which is not far from the castle forms a large morass extending several miles and threatening in time to lay this great edifice under water as it has already done great part of the country the inhabitants of the places around are afflicted annually with a fever and look like so many specter and within a days journey of the castle we meet with calmucks cherokees hottentots and the inhabitants of terra del fuego in all their several occupations and situations all the country between the danube and lower austria says dr brown and keysler is one extensive plain and in some places so sandy that the peasants have their habitations under ground like the troglodytes and the subterranean nations about egypt and have wells from whence they draw their water as we do ourselves in england their houses are tolerably well contrived within divided by partitions with wooden chimnies and a window at one end a little above ground all the rest buried in the sand all things within are neatly kept but betray a poverty indeed some houses are so hungarians at ovids tomb poor that  s  d sterling is reckoned a good price for one the people here are very shy and retire to their dwellings when they see any strangers and their dogs by barking give notice of any such approaching we have given a print of such a scene and have taken the opportunity of introducing a sketch of a monument said to be that of the famous latin poet ovid who being recalled from his banishment at tomos near the euxine sea died at sabaria in hungary in his return home and where they say this tomb was found with the following epitaph made by himself  hic situs est vates quem divi caesaris ira augusti patria cedere jussit humo saepe miser voluit patriis succumbere terris sed frustra hunc illa fata dedere locum in english thus here lies one whom the wrath of caesar banished from his native country often has the wretched wished to be buried with his fathers but in vain fate has laid this man here  chap iii of the people manners customs trade etc there is no country in the world which has a greater variety of inhabitants than hungary the ancient possessors of the country were tartars and sclavonians amongst the former we may reckon the hungarians now properly so called for their manners and appearance plainly show that they are of kin to the calmucks and descendants of the old scythians their deep eyes angular cheekbones and yellow skins distinguish them from the sclavonians who besides are whiter more fleshy and stronger built there are several parts of the country in which both races are continued pure and unmixed and besides all these there are germans walachians bulgarians turks greeks armenians jews and gypsies which last are the richest of all foreigners  all these people a few of the german colonists and the higher nobility excepted who are modelled after the fashion of the court of vienna are still in a barbarous state indeed it must be owned that the court instead of succeeding in improving them as it has done the rest of its subjects has rather done them harm than good by the attempts it has made for the purpose whilst they were left to themselves they were warlike and like the children of nature whom a false policy had not spoiled openhearted hospitable frank and steady to their purposes experience as well as true philosophy teach us that partly by religion any state may be successful in civilizing a barbarian any other attempt any other restriction which tends to cure him of his vices without showing him the advantage of virtue to himself only makes a motley composition of the faults of the two states  on the very aspect of things one sees that the government of this country is insidious the interests of the higher nobility are different from those of the rest of the country their undertenants which make the greatest part of the people are not feudal subjects neither have they any real property they are farmers who may be turned out of their farms upon the least dissatisfaction  the nobility contributes nothing but free gifts to the necessities of the state though it is in possession of half the property of the country it is almost the only order in the state for from the higher orders of these the priesthood is chosen so that the interest of these two orders is one in short the boasted freedom of hungary is only a privilege of the nobility and clergy to live at the expense of the whole country  in general the hungarians are of a good stature and well proportioned the men are of a martial appearance but the women are exceedingly fair and some very beautiful the dress of the men consists of a fur cap a closebodied coat girt about with a sash and over this a cloak or mantle which comes no lower than the hips and is so contrived as to be buckled under one arm so that the right hand is always at liberty  the colors they affect in their clothes are red blue or green young gentlemen have usually feathers in their caps the women of fashion as well as the men imitate the french mode of dress but neither sex will leave off the short cloak or toga the ladies are generally veiled when they go abroad the men shave their beards but leave whiskers on the upper lip  beside a broad sword the usual arms of an hungarian are an iron mace with a round head furrowed and the balta made in the form of a hatchet with fire arms the womens dress in the mine towns is not unbecoming they wear knots of ribbons at their shift sleeves and others likewise hanging down their backs but the peasants and lower sort of people amongst the miners dress very meanly among the latter the men are very proud of a furred mantle most of the women wear boots and many of them a long furred gown and have a kind of shift of a very coarse linen next their skin with a girdle round it at their waist their head dress is a piece of white linen with two lappets hanging down behind  in this part of the kingdom skyblue is the most usual color worn by both sexes the predilection of the people here for this color is that it is an emblem of a celestial or exalted mind  the hungarians pique themselves on being descended from those heroes who formed the bulwark of christiandom against the infidels in the minetowns both sexes amongst the lower classes wear sheepskin garments the natives in general are an indolent people and leave trade and manufactures to the greeks and other strangers settled in their country their diversions are of the warlike and athletic kind  the inhabitants of temeswar a province lately incorporated into the kingdom of hungary are computed at about   0000 there are in this country many faraons or gypsies supposed to be real descendants of the ancient egyptians they are said to resemble the ancient egyptians in their features in their propensity to melancholy and in many of their manners and customs and it is asserted that the lascivious dances of isis the worship of onions many famous egyptian superstitions and specifics and the egyptian method of hatching of eggs by means of dung are still in use among the female gypsies in temeswar  hungary being plentifully watered with fine rivers the usual way of traveling in summer is by water and where they have not this convenience an open chariot drawn by three or four horses abreast carries the traveller over this flat country with great expedition they have also a very fleet breed of horses for riding but never trim them long tails and manes being considered as great ornaments the hussars or hungarian troopers whose pay is small are very troublesome to travelers robbing all they meet where they can do it with security  nor are those numbers of the sturdy gypsies that swarm in this country less dangerous though they live in towns and generally profess some handicraft trade the wolves too are another great disturbance on the road in the nightime especially where it happens to be through a wood  the reader may readily conceive by the plenitude of these voracious animals that hungary is not well inhabited otherwise this troublesome race of quadrupeds would be extirpated from off the face of the land the great extent of uncultivated plains agreeably diversified with thickets and limpid springs and meandring brooks as well as the dark recesses of the numerous forests bespeak the safe retreat of these truly formidable race of quadrupeds who when pressed by the wants of nature and the inclemency of the element are as ravenous probably as the lions were in the den wherein the prophet daniel was immerged  the roads are sometimes only the direction of a mount a grove or a post as few footsteps mark the beaten track so well known in more populous states the lonely woods know few of the human race to walk within their shelter the solitary groves and still more pleasing landscapes have no admirers to paint the beauties of the golden west when the planet of the day sinks beneath the towering hill the luxuriant sense wants no artificial coloring to delineate its beauties every object conspires to heighten the beauty of the horizontal boundary on every hand the prospect varies yet none to be rejected as less worthy of mental enjoyment and agreeable perspective all are equally novel beautiful and picturesque  in the mountains near the town of schemnitz the hardness of the water produces wens of a great size these excrescences are almost universal amongst the inhabitants but the water in the valleys near that town is said to be an efficacious remedy for them  as we are under the head of traveling we cannot omit the noble bridges that are to be met with in this country particularly the bridge at esseck built over the river drove and the marshy grounds beyond it being five miles long and railed in with towers at every quarter of a miles distance  this has been a pass much contended for in the turkish wars and occasioned many smart engagements to gain the possession of it there lies also a bridge of boats half a mile long between buda and pesth and a third over the danube between gran and barcan but the bridge built over the danube  0 hungarian miles from belgrade far surpassed all the rest some of the ruins being visible at this day it consisted of  0 piles of square stone an  00 feet in height the basis whereof contained  0 feet on every side of the square the distance between every one of these piles or pillars was   0 feet and joined together by arches and to perpetuate the memory of this bridge many silver coins were stamped with this inscription danubius  the manufactories of hungary are very inconsiderable as hardware and copper are the chief articles of this description their exports are wine oil metals minerals cattle leather wool tallow and wax and their imports are spices tin silk and a few other foreign commodities  that their trade is no greater may be ascribed to several causes as first theirs being an inland country at a distance from the sea by the danube indeed a very profitable navigation might be carried on to the coast of the black sea and even to the mediterranean but as the turks are masters of the mouth of that river nothing of that kind can now be attempted  if we may rely on the veracity of baron riesbec the exports amount to    millions a year and the imports to    consequently there is a balance of six millions annually in favor of the country  with respect to the exports and imports if compared we shall find it impossible but that the former is stated too high for with a balance of trade as hungary must by this means have it ought to be one of the richest countries in europe whereas nothing is scarcer than money in this country  if we consider a little the variety of commodities which hungary must import from abroad it is impossible it should have an equal trade it is obliged to purchase all the products of art besides an astonishing number of those of nature the quantity of the natural produce on the other hand given by hungary to the stranger is very great but that there remains a surplus we scout the idea as an improbability  the negligence of the police in not straining the torrent of luxury is inconceivable i have often been tempted to believe says riesbec that government did not think it worth its while to attend to the trade and commercial interests of this country either because it did not yield in proportion to its greatness or that the impetuous temper of the court was such as not to allow of any establishments that were to produce advantage to after ages be this as it may whether the court is all for present enjoyment or has not political wisdom enough to erect for futurity the instances of its neglect are most glaring for notwithstanding the extreme poverty of the country they allow the jews to go about with coffee sugar tobacco oil and quack medicines of all kinds from village to village where they sell them in small quantities and much adulterated  with the power which the present emperor leopold possesses he might at once cut off all the privileges of the hungarian nobles which are contrary to the good of the whole and which it has for so many years been endeavoring to undermine a few families would murmur for a while but the thing would not go beyond murmurs the inhabitants of the towns and the peasants would stand up for the interests of the court which are their own the religious animosities which served formerly as a pretense for an insurrection would no longer blind the people to their real good it would open a liberality of sentiment that would soon win over the nobility whom the artifices now in use only alienate and corrupt  if once that part of their privileges which militates against the good of the whole was well defined and suppressed by one single act of authority they would then be susceptible of patriotic virtues whereas at present they look upon the government to be hostile to them and do nothing but what they are compelled to by power or bribes  in that case the multitude or the inferior orders of the people would not be the abject slaves they now are establishments for polite accomplishments would become general and the gloom of despotism and ignorance would soon be removed by the lights of liberty and knowledge and hungary would ere long be one of the most flourishing countries in europe  the natives would be no longer poor in the midst of a country abounding with every necessary of life the poverty of the people and the excessive luxury and riches of the nobility would no longer offend the eyes of the humane by the shocking disproportion between them then the lively native animated by the love of his country and a sense of his duty would no longer refuse to submit to proper discipline but gladly lay down his life in defense of his natural rights his liberty and property and like a briton serve his king because he is the father of his people and guardian of their privileges  there is hardly a hungarian of rank at this day says riesbec that is either free from debt or that does not like the austrian man of fashion look upon his debts as an honor the court of vienna has consequently little to fear from the commotions of the higher ranks here as all of them are so strongly attached to the modes of the capital of the german empire that nothing short of a german lady and a german equipage is the ton for a noble hungarian therefore notwithstanding the discontent which reigns in the breasts of the lower class of hungarians yet the want of a leader with power and consequence will always prohibit their risings from being any ways dangerous  the dissipation of the hungarians has bound them to the court of vienna by an indissoluble tie namely their necessities which will no longer allow them to serve for nothing but make the pay of the court an object to them the austrian nobility by privilege take a most unfair advantage whenever they find a proper opportunity and purchase hungarian estates in proportion as the owners are obliged to raise supplies for the redemption of their honor in discharging their debts hence the german influence in hungary is very great nor is the national court at liberty to shake off the yoke which their own irregularities has obliged them to be burdened with  now it may be said of hungary that it is a mixed nation at least so far as appertains to the first class of people for the nobility both laity and ecclesiastics are nearly equally divided between natives and austrians  besides what has been already stated the court uses several other means that depend upon time and circumstances one of the most efficacious is the loading the produce of hungary with very heavy taxes these oppressions indeed immediately affect the nobility only to whom the exports properly belong as the rest of the people have no property but they hurt the whole country and particularly the manufacturers and merchants in great towns by the diminution of the coin in circulation  the duties on the exports of hungarian wines are so considerable that the croats who inhabit the mountains are obliged to buy the wine which but for these duties they might have very cheap from their fellow subjects in venetian dalmatia the fact is says the honest baron the court of vienna had rather let the country lose money than suffer hungary to be rich  almost all the employments of the country which the constitution does not require to be given to natives are possessed by germans who often prove the most dreadful despots thus in the cities of illyria which depend entirely on the council of war and are all under military government almost all the employments are held by foreigners  the germans have made themselves so odious here by their tyranny that the croat knows no worse epithet than that of a swabian under which is comprehended every thing that is detestable and contemptible by the name of a swabian the croat defines all the inhabitants of germany not excepting the austrian for the natives of austria who get footing in this country behave there like turkish pachas or east indian nabobs their pride leads them to make the hungarians feel that they are the ruling nation their dissipation compels them to use every extortion to procure money and they are made still worse than they otherwise would be by the difference of their manners and religion thus it is from the oppression of foreigners that the native illyrian has taken the dishonest and stubborn part of his character which otherwise is very unnatural to him  notwithstanding the principal places are generally occupied by great men it is impossible to be more worthless than the greater number of the public servants are generally speaking there is not a grain of patriotism a grain of knowledge a grain of good will or a grain of activity amongst them pride vanity self interest and hardheartedness distinguish them all the only thing they look up to continues the same author are pay and titles and treat business as a matter of indifference  the native hungarians who have a share in the government of their own country have infinitely better understanding of the business and duties of their places and more delight in discharging them than the austrians and yet these possess almost all the places and the others are exposed to their tyranny the austrians look upon it as indispensibly necessary to bind them in court chains and take away every feeling of liberty and true honor from them they do all they can to stifle their national spirit they have no idea of ruling over a free and sentimental people but conceive they must make slaves of the whole nation in order to govern it the most cruel violations of the national contract and the liberty of mankind have been those which have arisen on a religious account it may therefore with safety be affirmed that it will take two centuries to come to undo the mischief which this court has done itself during the last hundred and fifty years by the religious persecutions in hungary it is indeed one of those contradictions which most seemingly bespeaks the debility of the human mind that whilst the court of vienna on the one hand does all it can to promote the population and industry of this kingdom on the other it persecutes in every possible way the industrious part of its subjects and that part whose religious opinions are the most favorable to population  the great fault of this government is that they banish the protestants who are the most useful part of the subjects but the want of freedom in religion explains it it is greatly owing to this cause that all the useful men emigrate and leave hungay only to the worthless ones for it must be owned the former can have but little desire to settle in a country in which they must often go journies of several days to see a priest of their own persuasion where they are not allowed to build a church and where the hatred toward them and their religion effectually and perpetually excludes them from all civil employments  all these hindrances are removed under the gentle government of the english and dutch who of course take all the useful emigrants and leave austria the most inferior order those that settle in hungary reisbec affirms to be the most abandoned people who emigrate from bavaria swabia franconia and the country about the rhine these upon their arrival generally squander away the small sums of money they have raised at home  hence their excesses occasion many to die suddenly and have given the name of an unwholesome climate to hungary without any truth for no country has a more salubrious air and wholesome mode of diet  these however such as they are would still be a considerable gain to so poor a country as hungary is if government was sufficiently interested in their fate to provide for the excesses they must be exposed to from the danger of the climate and their own inexperience and to give them some assistance in their first settlement hungary is in itself not more unwholesome than italy spain the south of france or any other warm country only as there are morasses all over it the difference between the heat of the day and the cold of the night must be very sensibly felt by a german  the rich wines and delicious fruits here to be met with are equally pernicious to the stranger who must guard against their dangerous influence the regimen of the emigrant should be carefully copied from that of the native for from the usage of the inhabitant the favorable diet and exercise of any country may be easily acquired    chap iv religion learning ecclesiastical jurisdiction etc the ancient inhabitants of this kingdom had scarce any devotion but what they paid to their sword which they look upon as the great preserver of their country and the terror of their enemies  the christian religion was introduced here about the year  000 by king stephen the hussites of bohemia propagated their opinions here in the   th century and in the   th luthers doctrine prevailed but like their neighbors the bohemians they were divided into a multitude of sects and some of them not easily defensible having various singularities not essential to the cause they espoused however all were known under the denomination of protestants  at present about one fourth of the inhabitants of hungary are romancatholics one fourth greeks jews and anabaptists and the other half lutherans and calvinists the latter it must be confessed are far behind their brethren in other countries in knowledge and discipline  from the circumstance of the religion of the country being formerly catholic it is natural to expect that this religion should be the established one of the state with this no sensible man can be offended notwithstanding the comparative diminution of its members to that of the reformed church but to take away the  00 churches from the protestants whilst the jews are indulged with building as many synagogues as they please is a very impolitic and unchristianlike distribution of justice in the liberty of conscience  by the restless disposition of the jesuits the protestants were not only deprived of the public use of churches but their schools were prohibited so that they were obliged to send their youth to foreign seminaries for education thus the court of vienna was influenced till within a few months back to encourage the idle and profligate calmucks and gypsies rather than laborious and moral protestants this mode may be termed with a good deal of propriety a destruction of the national character without improving the external circumstances of the people  it is now well known and the example of the english fully proves it that the only way out of barbarism is through real religion judge then what it must be to tread this road backwards and to substitute the superstitious spirit of monkery for the mild and industrious spirit of protestantism it is strange to relate that the late emperor joseph ii gave sanction to this and ordered its execution at the very time when he was endeavoring to curb the power of the priests by dismantling their religious retirements both convents and monasteries in various parts of the german empire and forming such establishments of education as must ultimately lead to protestant principles  the greek priests in hungary arid illyria are exactly in the same state of ignorance and semibarbarism as the romancatholic priests were in the reign of charlemagne the great who laid the first foundation for national improvement and first began with an illumination of the priesthood by knowledge and polish  there are at this time says ricsbec many of the spiritual pastors of the greek church who know not how to read tolerably and to write or calculate is above their knowledge for if engaged in any manner where numbers are requisite their fingers serve as a tally  one of these pious shepherds of souls continues the same author a macedonian by birth who valued himself much on his classical erudition of the greek and the reputation of his countryman alexander the great took it into his head to instruct a young gentleman in the history of the trojan war he said that a prince of the trojans having run away with a french princess the greek and roman emperors the king of france and the seven electors went to troy and took the city after an astonishing long siege by means of a wooden horse filled with armed men notwithstanding their gross ignorance yet these priests are the idols of the still more ignorant congregations the catholic priests who live at any distance from the large towns are little behind the greeks in being illiterate and vulgar in manners their whole library consists of their breviary and the only thing they study is the latin language  the public seminaries or universities for cultivating literature are those of firnan buda raab and cascham all the professors are jesuits so that the lutherans calvinists and other protestants are obliged to go to the german colleges to complete their academical studies  notwithstanding the hungarians do not want parts yet it is observed that this country produces but few learned men the only reason that can be assigned for this is the poverty of the knowledge of the professors who neither improve in the sciences themselves nor admit those from other countries who are adequate to the task to become public members  the church by law established is governed by two archbishops and nine bishops the archbishop of gran is primate of all hungary and chief secretary and chancellor legatus natus of the papal see and prince of the holy roman empire he alone crowns the king and is a perpetual count in right of his spiritual dignity he can create peers confer titles and orders of knighthood etc next to him is the archbishop of kolacza who has eight suffragans the bishops are of a double character and are temporal lords as well as spiritual ones  the abbots are ten in number and have voices in the estates of the kingdom and are reckoned after the bishops in precedence  the spiritual courts appointed for the discussion of ecclesiastical affairs are held in every diocese and chapter but with a power of appealing to the archbishop and afterward to the popes legate and may at last be carried to the papal court at rome  the pure language of the huns resembles that of the hebrew as it is wholly governed by points and accents but busing says that it is really a dialect of the ancient scythia without the least affinity to any of the european tongues and of one unvaried dialect  in writing the hungarians use the roman characters the germans have their different dialects according to their nations which are settled here there are also dialects of the sclavonian and wallachian tongues used here the latin is not only spoken by the literati and gentry but also by the commonality however the latter are not very correct yet it may be said that the ancient roman language is still a living one in hungary though dead to all the world besides  were systems of religion not shackled with penalties by romancatholic princes it is certain the sunshine of science would chase away the vapors of superstition and gross ignorance which carry such absurd and frequently fantastic characters on the face of them that more polished nations with great reason laugh at can the minds of men be confined to any particular mode of thinking or shall their ideas be reducible to any peculiar form surely every moral agent who is possessed of common understanding and impressed by the laws of civil society will readily acquiesce in the happy plan of universal toleration britain has been long famed for this excellent rule of faith and leaves open her church doors for all who are willing to come in and also to accommodate those that go out of her pales for certain it is free privilege gives life to the name of a christian and a body to the established church of this our favored land and all its dependencies  it appears from the writings of the best modern authors that this crown has been sometimes hereditary and at others elective that sometimes their princes have acted arbitrarily and at others been limited and restrained by the states that there have been innumerable struggles between the crown and the states the former for exercise of prerogative and the latter for limiting the sovereign power in history it is surprising to find so many kings deposed or murdered either by factious subjects or ambitious rivals and as their kings could not by their constitution legally oppress their subjects and invade their properties therefore regicide was less pardonable here than in any other nation in christendom  if the people indeed are vested with the supreme power and the kings are but their officers and accountable to them they will have some pretense for resisting and dethroning them when they act contrary to the good of the community and may without imputation of paricide do justice upon them in the language of our regicides with oliver cromwell at their head that the rest of the kings of the earth may hear and fear and do no more so wickedly but as our republicans go upon that mistake that kings can have no legal authority but what is conferred on them by the majority of the people their princes are always accountable to the majority of the people and since there is scarce any instance in the world that the majority of the people the multitude were ever consulted in the election of a monarch or supreme magistrate their fancied power over their monarchs must be a mere chimera  the elegant pamphlet lately published by the right hon edmund burke m p relative to the divine right of kings proclaims a new sort of doctrine as far as it touches on the authority and unlimited control of potentates which gives a new species of reasoning far beyond any thing we have had the perusal of for many years and in several particulars may be said to be truly original this author in discussing the political crisis of france endeavors to overturn the new modelled constitution of that country merely because the government of it has assigned the king but a nominal situation instead of the unbounded field of prerogative he formerly partook of  this curious address would be more applicable when we come to speak of france but a short abstract of its leading features we presume will here be consonant to the subject  notwithstanding the specious pretenses of maintaining the peoples rights and privileges by attempts upon the throne as if they had jure divino an unalienable and a feazible right to call their sovereign to account depose and condemn him as their wisdoms conceive to be the criterion to promote the public good for should it be admitted that they have such an authority surely it is equally perceptible to an enlightened mind how inadequate the major part of mankind are to a discrimination of the upright acts of their prince ambition is at the botton of these combinations and only flatters the public with the notion of their unbounded right to make and unmake kings till by their assistance the new modellers have got the reigns of government and then these noble patriots commonly laugh at the manyheaded beast that has advanced them leaving the people to labor under greater difficulties than they did before or perhaps loading them with insupportable taxes to maintain their own possession pretending that their establishment and the peoples happiness are inseparable here we leave the digression and in the genuine spirit of the authors reasoning cannot but concur yet at the same time we must observe much may be said on both sides the question as circumstances may tend to vary right and wrong very materially  but on all hands it must be acknowledged that no nation has ever suffered more in these struggles between the crown and the states than the hungarians for while one side called in the emperor the other called in the grand signor to their assistance and made the country a scene of wars and bloodshed for upwards of  00 years together till in the end the german emperor has become master of the country and has driven the turks entirely out of hungary and reduced it to the form of a province they have contended with their princes about their rights and privileges till the imperial eagle has decided the controversy by devouring both and left them only the shadow of their ancient constitution  the ceremony of the coronation of the kings of hungary is attended with rather curious formulae  the general assembly of the states appoint a place usually presburg or buda here the bishops the nobility and the representatives of the several countries and cities unanimously approve of the new monarch who is always the next in succession notwithstanding the necessary form of election previous to his being crowned then the palatinate whose office we shall presently describe demands with a loud voice three times whether the assembly approves of the new elected king and having expressed their consent by loud acclamations he delivers a naked sword into the kings hand which the sovereign brandishes e w n and s after which he is attended by the states to the great cathedral church where the archbishop of gran holding the regal robes in his hand again demands of the people whether they are satisfied with the king elect and are willing to become his subjects and on receiving an answer in the affirmative he proceeds to perform the usual rites observed at the coronation of their kings after which the prelates and nobility carry the arms and relics of king stephen i before the new king in a splendid procession to the palace  the crown of stephen i is still preserved at presburg with great veneration if not superstition and no prince is allowed to be duly crowned with another crown the romancatholics do not hesitate to declare openly that the fate of the nation depends on the careful preservation of it and in all their calamities took great care to preserve it in a place of safety the legend of this crown runs thus when stephen i began to propagate the christian religion in his dominions he sent a trusty person to pope benedict vii desiring his holiness to confirm him in his kingdom and send him a crown and other regal ornaments myscha duke of poland having sent an embassy to rome at this time on the same account and a crown being provided for him but an angel appearing to the pope the night before it was to be sent away desired that the crown designed for the pole should be sent to stephen which was done accordingly the catholic hungarians believe this tradition equally with any article of their faith and give this antique relic almost divine adoration  the person of greatest authority next to the king is the palatine or guardian of the kingdom and is elected by the states this officer has the first voice in the election of a king and is always the guardian to the infant princes of the blood and has authority to assemble the states during an interregnum and administer justice in every particular the same as the monarch himself  the fate of the new edition of the bible in the hungarian language is a recent proof of the bigotry of the established religion of this country in the confusions of the late wars and by other calamities bibles were grown so scarce that many communities had not above one or two at most upon this several of the most opulent of the societies of protestants apprehending that this scarcity of the word of god would necessarily be attended with the total abolition of true christianity generously undertook to publish a new edition  the work was printed in holland new types were cast and persons well qualified were sent to superintend the press every thing went on prosperously so that the impression was happily finished both with accuracy and beauty and the only difficulty remaining was how to convey the copies to hungary before the romancatholics should by false representations influence the emperor to prohibit their importation  the usual application was made to court for a royal license which was readily granted but the jesuits party found means to ingratiate themselves with some of the leading men of the romish religion so that the books were not permitted to come within the territories of the kingdom under a wicked suggestion that it was an erroneous translation by this false assertion the bibles were only suffered to reach the city of dantzic where many of them are to be found at the present period  since the demise of joseph ii the archbishop of gran has summoned the clergy of hungary in the romancatholic interest and in convocation have deliberated on a requisition to the new king leopold the present emperor of germany in which they conclusively addressed the throne very uncharitably making it an act which should carry the penalty of death with it as well as forfeiture of temporalities to any one who should embrace the protestant religion and again endeavored to revive the frendlike spirit of persecution with all its concomitant train of cruelties but the mildness of the monarch stemmed the torrent of these zealots and in a style becoming the dignity of a leopold his imperial majesty tempered the sharpness of the religious votaries  what a mistaken notion is it in the breast of man to conceive that the god of all purity peace and mercy should be honored by the cruel butcheries of his creatures merely because their notions of outward forms or inward systems were not exactly the same with those of some peculiar mode of their king is the outward trappings of woe a proof of the internal sorrow or is the shape and air of the man a token of his truth or falsehood certainly none of these things carry evidence sufficient to take it for granted that truths are appendages that may be taken conclusively as matters of fact for the contrary frequently proves the insufficiency of all human systems to arrange the works of providence and much less to attempt a regulation of the state of spiritual communion with the creator  in the ear of a moderate protestant how unharmonious must it grate when he is told that the holy office of the inquisition condemns not only the unhappy victims of their cruelty and malice to the flames but also assigns them over to a particular species of torment in a world of miserable spirits  if this mode of serving the deity can be reconciled to the gentle aspect of the gospel where says must accompany good works and charity be clothed with mercy and an universal benevolence not only to do good to our friends but also to our enemies and even to pray for their happiness both here and hereafter what is the office of catholic love    chap v of government army establishment and laws the king of hungary is styled catholic to which is added the title of apostolic on account of the zeal which stephen i showed in the conversion of the king the regalia namely the golden crown made in the eleventh century the scepter sword mantle and shoes with the silver cross the mark of the apostolic function are kept in the castle of presburg and used always at the coronation of all the kings since the above period  the states are divided into four classes which in the laws of the land are called collectively the people the first are the prelates who have the direction of religious matters and have precedence of all others except the governor of the kingdom the second class is called the great barons of the kingdom and officers of the court according to their precedence and the counts and inferior barons the third are styled gentry and the fourth are citizens and burgesses  the king and these states through the channels of the diet royal councils exchequer and senates of towns govern the kingdom the diet is summoned every three years for the dispatch of public business  justice is administered in civil affairs in the kings name after the manner prescribed by the laws and customs of the kingdom in the royal free cities the first hearing is before the judge of the town and the second before the council from which they may appeal to the treasurer  the minetowns have a court peculiar to themselves and all disputes between the nobility and their vassals may be removed by writ of error to the grand court of the archbishop of gran  in public affairs we may reduce their constitution and law to similar situations in our own government their diet like our parliament is a sort of check on the regal power of the prince the hungary office which is established at vienna resembles our chancery the stadholders council answers pretty much to a british privy council the gaspan chafts are like our justices of the peace  in criminal matters the judge of the town is with his council fully authorized to exercise his power and life and death are in his hands but few cases except those of murder witchcraft or herey are punished with death the rest of our catalogue the hungarians consider a temporary punishment to be adequate to the commission of the crime and these exactions are generally confined to money or articles of use and value  the military strength of this kingdom is ascertained to be  0000 hungarians but the emperor seldom draws out more than  0000 and these generally are light horse and are well known to modern times by the name of hussars they are not near so large as the german horse and therefore stand on their tiptoes in the stirrups when they strike  their expedition and alertness have been found so serviceable in war that the greatest powers in europe have troops that go by the same name their foot are called heydukes and wear feathers in their caps according to the number of enemies they pretend to have killed both horse and foot are very good at ravaging and plundering an enemys country but not equal to regular troops in a pitched battle however they make together an excellent national militia  it is remarkable enough that whilst in imitation of the hungarian soldiers the hussar has become an essential part of the prussian army and has also been received into the french regular troops the true original is lo in his own country not one of the    or    regiments of hussars in the emperors service is made up entirely of hungarians experienced officers have it seems thought such regiments could no longer be of any service it may be so but it is certain that the hungarians have lost their spirit by their discipline for like other wild men they detest the artificial arms against which their strength and courage are of no avail and if ever they show themselves in their native fierceness it is only when the firing is over and they come to close engagement then each opposes himself to the armed enemy here indeed the hero sometimes starts out again  a whole army of these men drawn up in battle array unpowdered from the general to the common soldier half their faces covered with long whiskers a sort of round beaver upon their heads instead of hats without ruffles or frills to their shirts all clad in rough skins monstrous crooked sabres ready drawn and uplifted their eyes darting flashes of rage sharper than the beams of the naked sabre would be sufficient to dismay the hardiest troops and terrify even veterans but now the polished face of war puts on a more elegant appearance and the rough terrors of the warrior are allayed by the becoming habit of fashion the military man knows his season of changes to the mode of times as well as the fop of the day  the english plan is of all others the most sound and well adapted to national policy their principles is to keep up the spirit of the troops from an idea that the interests of government are the same as those of the people and that they have nothing to fear from a mutiny upon this ground honest john bull reduces his people to a common standard namely to defend liberty and property generally as well as particularly  there cannot be a doubt but in obedient and strong subordination the principal strength of an army consists but it is impossible to unite them with an idea of feeling for self in the subaltern and underling can sentiments of personal honor bravery and patriotism be prejudicial to an army surely every sensible man will answer in the negative and were it only to meliorate the condition of the poor soldier were it only to make his hard fate less severe it should be the policy of princes to promote those feelings which can sweeten so many bitter hours and alone enable them to meet death  the hungarians in general are extremely proper for a military life they want nothing to be perfect soldiers but a kind of education which good government might give them the croats particularly have all the requisites for service their usual height is six feet they are boney fleshy quick and lively and can bear the extremes of cold and hunger in a word there are no better made men in europe notwithstanding which they are the most miserable part of the imperial army a sure sign that government either neglects them or does not know how to discipline them properly  sometimes it has been proposed to incorporate them with other corpse but this would be only to take away their natural advantages and furnish them with artificial ones in their stead such a change would put an end to their usual way of life to which they are indebted for their hardiness they commonly dwell six or seven under the same roof as their frugality enables them to bring up many children they marry early in the vigor of their youth and their children are the produce of their unimpaired manhood  their juices are still incorrupt and the destructive distempers which poison the sources of life are not yet introduced amongst them the patriarchical government still subsists here and the grandfather who has grown old amidst his children and grandchildren still retains an authority over them as by this means their manners are preserved uncorrupted and uncontaminated with any species of vice nothing more is requisite than to humanize their priests this would render them good subjects to the state without commerce manufactures or arts which the emperor joseph ii lately endeavored to introduce amongst them and which must be allowed was not to their advantage  an education more suitable to the nature of their country and their peculiar constitution would by degrees deprive them of their native ferocity and they would become the more tractable in proportion as they acquired better notions of religion and agriculture their uncouth manners the natural consequence of their barbarity is the true reason why they are so averse to discipline and the only way of getting the better of this and making them like the other subjects of the house of austria fit for military service is domestic education this alone can bring them out of their barbarity without depriving them of their other advantages  were the hungarians to be removed from their own prejudices in a military capacity the cure might probably be worse than the disease to effect which no alternative beside that of incorporating them with other troops remains supposing this was to be effected and to make slaves of them in the best years of their lives and when the voice of nature cries most aloud what would be the consequence accustomed to all their vices i mean those of a standing army they would consume the vigor of their lives in pernicious indulgencies they would return to their native country corrupted with a variety of wants they did not know before  having acquired a taste for pleases of forbidden love they would either not marry  all or marry later than their ancestors all the domestic ordiances would be abolished nor wld their wives be any longer distinguished for the hastity their children would imitate them i their vices and the consequence of all would be that in the second generation one would be hardly able to distinguish them and in the third or at most the fourth not know them at all from the other subjects of the empire so totally would they have lost the size strength frugality and fine form which now so eminently distinguish them  to attempt any change that may be proposed would be taking a dangerous leap from barbarous to civil life and all that could be expected from it would be a broken limb if not a broken neck  thus to attempt pruning or lopping off the exuberant branches which spring from the stock of nature would reduce the subject to less than half its pristine vigor serving no other purpose than that of degenerating the noble acquisition of inbred virtues of hereditary possession to the frailties of an artificial form to serve no good purpose whatever nor indulge any other passion than that of caprice and then view the reduction of the noble structure in its ruins without being ever able to erect the edifice so as to answer the end which the native hungarian in his present uncultivated state happily fulfils in the most unlimited sense of the word  this nation was formerly remarkable for its coinage as the cabinets of the curious in all countries clearly show even medals of the exactest arrangement have been produced here in a historical series which show the regularity of this kingdom in former times  the emperor as king of hungary for armorial ensigns bears quarterly barwise argent and gules of eight pieces    view of belgrade view of belgrade  chap vi belgrade belgrade albagraecorum or greek weissenburg having been recently the seat of war in the turkish dominions and before whose walls so many imperialists have fallen it must be a gratification to the reader although an innovation in the regularity of our plan to introduce it here so sans ceremony we shall give a minute description of this celebrated fortress which at this period is a topic of conversation in every polite circle  the city and important fortress of belgrade is situate at the conflux of the rivers save and danube and consists of three parts of which one is the citadel erected on an eminence in the middle of the city  it is the capital of the province of servia or rascia and previous to the late siege it was considered as a strong populous trading city it was formerly accounted the barrier and key of hungary to which it was at first annexed by the german emperor in    0 but besieged and taken by the turks in      and till      it remained in their possession when the huns again became masters of it and in      it was ceded to the turks who have since been the possessors of it till taken by the imperialists in the late war  this city lies in latitude    degrees  0 min n and longitude    degrees   min e the many vicissitudes of fortune which it has experienced induces us to give a brief account of some of them solomon the magnificent laid siege to it in      as before observed and it was retaken by the imperialists in      under the conduct of the duke of bavaria the turks laid siege again to it in the year      and the magazine of the town being blown up by one of the enemys bombs with part of the walls the turks then took it by storm and put all the garrison to the sword consisting of upwards of  000 men except the governor and about  00 soldiers who escaped out of one of the gates while the enemy was busy in plundering the town  about the beginning of june      the imperialists under the command of prince eugene of savoy invested belgrade again and the place being of the last importance to the turks the grand vizir was commanded to relieve it at all hazards which he attempted to do in august following this brought on a general engagement wherein the imperial troops obtained a complete victory  it is remarked by the ablest historians that there never were so many ottomans in the field at one time as at this memorable battle the fire was well sustained on the part of the turks and from the number of the killed and wounded it stands on record to be the most bloody of any battle that ever was fought between infidels and christians  the turks lost about   0 pieces of cannon  0 mortars and their whole camp and what is worthy of remark the imperialists did not enter the enemys camp to plunder till the general gave permission nor till the whole army was rallied and put in order  the loss of this battle was attended with the surrender of belgrade which capitulated two days afterward it was computed on a moderate calculation that there were not less than  0000 mahometans within the walls of belgrade amongst which near  0000 were soldiers and by an exact list of the artillery taken in the town and in the battle that it consisted of   0 pieces of brass cannon   0 of iron and  0  brass mortars from all of which the reader may readily conceive what a large and important city this must at that time have been  we need not give any further history of the sieges of this place having already observed that it fell to the turks in      the hungarians were then obliged to evacuate it though not before they had demolished its outworks leaving nothing standing but its old walls and some fortifications inseparable from them the two castles hereafter described were built since that period  the horrors of a siege are easier conceived than described the dire necessities of war obliges the contending parties to the exercise of their inventive faculties to form schemes of destruction by all possible modes of artifice so as to weaken the opposing power every hour is applied to havoc devastation and carnage death stalks abroad in all shapes the pining citizen though in no wise busied in the scenes of war but active to remove his merchandise to subterraneous stores on his return perhaps beholds his dwelling blazing fiercely by the hostile heated ball that falls within its attic story his family all in tears lament not for the conflagrating scene but in sobbing accents grieve for the untimely fate of the hapless mother of the mourning children now mark the dangers that await the whole a deadly shot bereaves the group of life of hope and care and mingles them with the flying dust or filthy earth unpitied and without notice of their fate thus war levels all distinctions in age sex and rank all are liable to the call of fate  by the elegant perspective view of the city which we have with great pains procured the reader may perceive that the save which is a large river runs on the west side of the city and the great river the danube on the north side  the danube is very broad here and its current so rapid that it seems to cut off that of the save just as the rhone does that of the seine near lions in france  the water of the danube seems to be yellow and troubled and that of the save greenish and clear at the mouth of the save is an isle made there of the settling of the sands of both streams and is now covered over with a kind of a wood  on the entrance into the town is the water castle which is a strong piece of fortification well constructed for defense and on a further entrance is the upper castle which is flanked with diverse towns and forms an irregular fortification of great strength also  the chiefest trading streets are covered with a sort of penthouses to keep off the sun and rain the shops are no bigger than taylors shopboards and very low the shopkeepers sitting in them as our tailors do crosslegged which have a singular appearance to an inhabitant of any of the christian states of this quarter of the globe  the chapmen or buyers never enter into these little shops or stalls but view the goods at the door and make their lagas under the cover of the projecting pehous but besides these there are two large bezastans or places where the best commodities are sold they are built in the form of a cross like the old cathedrals with walks within like the royal exchange at london  they have two exchanges for merchandise which are solely occupied by wholesale venders these buildings are elegantly erected on two rows of pilars the one over the other  the turks have built since their last possession of the town a very stately caravanse or the entertainment of poor travelers of the musselmen it has a noble fountain and a spacious court at the top of which is a grand mosque to this is annexed a kind of a college for students in the mohammedan divinity these students as well as the heads of the seminary wear green gowns and square caps differing little in the forms of dress from our universities of oxford and cambridge  the sepulchers for the dead are all very properly without the town a practice highly commendable in all large cities as the contaminated air which receives its infection from the putrefaction of the dead is in its nature very prejudicial to the living for the saline particles of the efiluviae are observed by every one who walks out either at an early hour in the morning or in the cool approach of night  but it is to be observed that the trading people and merchants are confined very nearly to the sect of armenians which are very numerous and have the privilege of a large church for public worship here indeed their dealings are far more impartial and fair than either the greeks or jews  the situation of belgrade makes it a place of extensive trade being so well furnished with water conveyances for the navigable river teyse falls into the danube near the town and the drove and the merish are also disembogued into the danube a little below the fortress all which advantages contribute not a little to the traffic of this place added to which the adjacent country through which these rivers pass particularly the danube in its fall toward the euxine sea is so fruitful and well supplied with every production of nature that these advantages are sufficient to make it one of the most flourishing cities in europe was it in the possession of such an industrious nation as the english or dutch but whilst it remains in the hands of the turks it will never exceed its present state of being far below its meridian  this city was formerly the main bulwark of hungary which has several times stemmed the torrent of the turkish victories even mahomet the great and all his numerous forces  it is a remarkable epoch in      when mahomet appeared upon the danube near this city with  00 galleys and other armed vessels which were so smartly engaged by the christian sleet that besides what was taken the turks were forced to set their own vessels on fire to prevent them from falling into the hands of the christians  though the distance from belgrade to vienna is about  00 miles yet it is one continued plain without a hill or forest so that it seems to be a post designed by nature of the utmost importance to the house of austria it is about the same distance from constantinople but by no means so easily approached to from thence as from vienna indeed the germanic court should exert itself to retain the possession of this key of the empire for by it the trade of hungary bohemia and germany with all their dependancies might be considerably increased  this great fortress was with the loss of several thousands of the flower of the austrian troops besieged for nearly two years by the late emperor joseph ii and at length taken but not before a loss of at least  0000 men by pestilence and extreme hardships owing to the severity of the different seasons in which the imperialists were before the walls it may therefore with confidence be said that this ancient city cost the victors an effusion of blood for though the turks who were in possession of the town made a vigorous resistance yet the troops that fell by the fortune of war in actual service were few when compared with those that fell victims to the sickness that raged in the camp for the fatigues which joseph ii suffered were so excessive that the colds he contracted in the raining season and the night air were the causes of his severe illness which at last terminated in a painful death  we shall not animadvert on the conduct of the deceased emperor further than to say that he acted his part before this town with extreme heat and at one time great duplicity by which means the poor inhabitants of the greek and armenian churches were cut to pieces by the enraged turks as they falsely supposed those christian citizens had a design to betray them into the hands of the ausrians  this massacre will cast a gloom over the memory of a potentate who under pretense of a flag of truce could be so mean as to endeavor to deceive the governor and take the place by surprise but in this point he was himself deceived and the christians butchered through his treachery  by the late treaty with the turks the austrians have consented to abandon this garrison but not before the walls are erased and the fortifications utterly destroyed so that it will in future in all probability be reckoned a frontier city of the turks and a mart for european and asiatic goods but be this as it may it will always be subject to the inroads of the imperial subjects in case of a war with the port  indeed the only advantages which the turks reap from this place is to keep the hungarians and bohemians from making incursions into the turkish dominions and protecting their trade on the danube as almost the whole of the merchants as was before observed of belgrade have always been christians and jews therefore the mahometans could not be said to be the principal gainers by the trade of this great city  before we dismiss this article we cannot help observing that were the germans or hungarians a maritime people this situation would be highly beneficial to them but as they are too much like the turks in point of indolence the city of belgrade will derive but little benefit from the masters of it whether turks or germans  the end of the eighth volume errata
