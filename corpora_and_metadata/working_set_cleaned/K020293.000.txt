the dramatic puffers a prelude as performed at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed for g kearsley fleet street and e macklew in the haymarket mdcclxxxii  characters zephyr mr edwin breeze mr robson author mr lee jews the dramatic puffers scene the stage enter zephyr and breeze meeting zephyr by this light but it is  what bill breeze   breeze ah my gentle zephyr shaking hands why where have you hid yourself  but i beg pardon    zephyr oh i make no secret of my situations i have been obliged to lodge for a few weeks on the other side of the water it was forcibly recommended to me by a doctor well skilled in consumptive cases quaintly   breeze and you find yourself the better for it   zephyr amazingly for i have now got rid of all those lurking symptoms which are the too frequent attendants on genius and letters  so i find they have had some flogging work over both courses in my absence the different studs have been run hard eh   breeze hard  puffed all round  scarce a leg to stand on   zephyr as the knowing ones have been taken in you touched a little breeze i hope   breeze not a ducat  no zephyr all my prospects fell with the coalition  at the beginning of the season indeed i offered my services here  but i was delicately told  that authors nowadays took upon themselves the disagreeable task of criticizing their own pieces and at as to the ordinary business of the theater a gentleman of established reputation had undertaken to do the whole upon a standing contract   zephyr ay i suppose i should have met with similar neglect on the other side of the way if it had not been for my new invented playhouse machine   breeze playhouse machine a kind of theatrical buzaglo i suppose occasionally to keep the house warm   zephyr conceitedly oh no you will never guess it  will you promise me the most profound secrecy   breeze pon my honor    zephyr half whispering why then you must know i call it and i think rather aptly  i call it  an applauder   breeze an applauder   zephyr yes an applauder a mechanical improvement on the vulgar art of manucussion by which one man with the simple winch of a barrelorgan shall give a more marked and judicious applause than can possibly be derived from any stationary band of hireling clappers   breeze egad that is a happy invention  but pray zephyr wont it tend in some measure to counteract the real plaudits of an impartial audience   zephyr oh quite the contrary for as clapping like gaping is nothing more than an involuntary accordance of muscular motion i will engage my dear breeze  barring rheumatic and gouty cases  to carry every hand on any particular occasion in unison with my applauder   breeze a very capital idea upon my soul   zephyr besides i dont see why the benefit of it may not be extended to the performers then you know the actors and actresses of a certain natural diffidence need not so often be laid up by the chilling damps of silent admiration   breeze certainly my dear friend  but when will it come out zephyr   zephyr almost immediately the first essay was to have been made on a late musical occasion but the author and composer not being able to settle which of the parts deserved the  most decisive bursts of universal applause the machine was laid by and the matter left as usual to the decision of hands   breeze and so you are come here i suppose to offer it also to this house   zephyr oh no i have conveyed away the copyright and the managers of both theaters are now contending for an exclusive patent   breeze ha ha ha do you do any thing in the parliatary way now zephyr   zephyr not a metaphor that branch fell to nothing when gentlemen first submitted to the fatigue of carrying their own flowers to market  no having a little leisure upon my hands the prompter said he would recommend me as diurnal colourist to the young author of this nights piece   breeze that is droll enough why i am waiting here myself in hopes of procuring a similar employ   zephyr indeed why then if that is the case suppose we conduct the matter jointly and share the profits   breeze with all my heart  so if you will undertake to waft him through the pacific ocean of the mininisterial prints i will engage  but soft here i fancy comes the young author  and a martial one i see by his appearance   enter author in an officers uniform looking round author it is strange i should never be able to catch those scenepainting gentry  wild said they would meet me here at half past five looking at his watch i fear we shall not arrange the scene for the last act before the piece begins  they advance oh gentlemen i am glad we have met at last   zephyr mr wild sir i take it for granted    author yes but he says we have not a moment to lose   breeze true sir i thought you would be in a hurry so we took care to be prepared   author i am glad of it and how do you intend    zephyr why sir as it is a first attempt and times are ticklish i dont think it advisable to give any thing too highly colored at present and therefore i have sketchd something in the oblique way which i conceive however will have a fine effect   author i understand you in the side wing way but in that case how shall we display the performers to advantage   zephyr oh dear sir never fear them they are able and willing enough to take care of themselves   breeze well for my part i think there is nothing like a good bold outline at once to take in the flats   author well gentlemen i am indifferent whether the scene be a flat or an oblique one provided its effect be strikingly conveyed to the galleries   breeze oh lud sir make yourself perfectly easy on that score  my designs pulling out his papers are calculated for all classes gives him one there sir just run your eye over that i think that will reach the gods or the devils in it   author reads a new constellation of resplendent brilliancy illumined the theatrical hemisphere last night the dramatic magi  in amazement what am i to understand by this   zephyr giving one of his papers probably sir you will like that better from the delicacy of the keeping   author reads the genius of comedy perhaps never was so illustriously displayed  why what the devil is all this gentlemen   breeze lud sir dont you know why puffs to be sure  puffs and as good as any home made ones  that you will find in the circle of your dramatic friends depend on it   author puffs    zephyr yes puffs sir an airy insinuating kind of system which though generally despised is more generally practiced that has the address to baffle the whole five senses and carry all its points in spite of conviction   author indeed is that the case   breeze to be sure sir   zephyr no doubt sir  it is what may be emphatically termed the foilstone of fame which like the mock jewel of the stage never fails to outglare the modest sparkling diamond    author and pray gentlemen to whom am i indebted for these singular obligations  your name if you please   breeze my name breeze sir i am not ashamed of my name pertly  billy breeze no  00 at the brass knocker airstreet piccadilly   author and yours worthy sir   zephyr zephyr sir at your service   author and are not you messrs zephyr and breeze a cogenial couple of pitiful parasites   breeze lud sir   author fly hence ye rascally retailers of ill founded reputation and by that means save your bones  howhowever humble my genius may prove know that it scorns to soar upon the wretched pinion of grubstreet prostitution   zephyr sir this is no place sir  no place  but well find one depend on it    breeze yes sir  well tickle   he drives them out enter prompters boy boy the scene for the last act is settled so if you please sir well ring in   author by all means  exit boy the author steps forward to speak the prologue the prologue the prologue spoken by mr lee jews called forth thalias standard to display and here maintain her sovereign comic sway as chief  i will reconnoitre well the ground to learn what hostile lines are drawn around surveys the house with a glass that is not a dark defile in yonder glade  for should it prove a treacherous ambuscade no puffing miners have i here in pay to sap their works or turn their covertway no mercenary band who have been wont to hack and hew like pioneers in front with flying shells our engineers shall try that well manned battlement which towers so high pointing to the upper gallery beneath our pointblankshot will surely reach and in yon half moon battry make a breach to the second gallery those lovely breastworks that adorn the field to natures gentle summons soon must yield side boxes etc this post advanced the piquet guard to keep and that reserve who are entrenched chindeep we hope to carry by a bold exertion at least amuse with some well planned diversion to the pit my troops are vetrans  it has been their lot to form in front of service hissing hot who when their ranks are galled or put to flight are sure to rally and renew the fight unless  and then no light dragoons scour fleeter  their powder fails for want of true saltpeter our plans avowed it is from this firm station to gain the heights of public approbation the end
