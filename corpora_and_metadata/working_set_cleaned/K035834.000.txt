your voice a little for to speak so very loud is really not wellbred   old testy i will speak as loud as i like and say what i like damn your fine breeding  an ounce of honesty is worth an hundred weight of it   sir simon flourish there now  ounce and hundred weight cannot you contrive to think and talk a little like a man of fashion when you quitted business you should have disposed of your vulgarity with your stock in trade copy me do you find any thing vulgar about me   old testy psha you and i lived too long together to think of cajoling each other you are as vulgar as i am  i wish you were half as honest   sir simon flourish my good friend if we are not to attempt cajoling each other the less you say about your honesty the better   old testy why what have you to say against my honesty   sir simon flourish nothing i am too well bred beside i was your partner in trade for twentyfive years  i reaped half the profits of your ingenuity and had you been honester i might be poorer but my dear friend let us settle our business a little quietly if you will be so kind your son you say is come to town  good you insist he may be introduced to our ward miss hartley  he shall   old testy that is fair   sir simon flourish i thought you would say so because it is very unfair to my own son who being absent from england ought not to have a rival introduced to the lady i wish to be his wife but remember as she cannot marry without our joint consent we must agree that which ever she prefers shall have our mutual approbation   old testy why yes   sir simon flourish ah mine is the boy that will win her educated with every advantage now receiving the last polish the finishing stroke to his accomplishments in a tour through europe  oh he is a    old testy yes he is a pretty boy that youth will put foreign ingenuity to the test if they can send him away more dissipated than they find him i will give them credit for one miracle   sir simon flourish leave your growling good mr bear and look after your own unlickd cub his country breeding will render him vastly pleasing to a young lady   old testy he is a model of perfection innocent himself he will never suspect that evil exists that may make him liable to imposition but i have adopted a remedy in my choice of a profession for him   sir simon flourish as how pray   old testy to render him in some degree a match for the roguery of the world i shall make him a lawyer   sir simon flourish and i dare say his yorkshire simplicity will qualify him admirably for the profession   old testy well flourish the only thing we were ever in one mind about was parting and i conclude you have no objection to it now   sir simon flourish none in the least   old testy i shall send my son and mind fair plays the word   sir simon flourish certainly testy going let me see you out   old testy oh damn your civility stay where you are  exit old testy sir simon flourish alone oh you pretty behaved accomplished creature is it not strange that in so many years acquaintance the polish of my manners should not have induced him to rub off his vulgar rust   enter servant servant captain oneill sir   sir simon flourish show the captain in exit servant   enter captain oniell i rejoice to see you captain oniell you are welcome to town  captain oniell sir simon flourish your most obedient  permit me to enquire after her ladyship and your lovely ward miss hartley   sir simon flourish both in fine health and spirits and they will very much regret not being at home to receive you   captain oniell proud as i am always to pay them my profound respects at this moment my business lies entirely with you sir simon   sir simon flourish oh lord i hope he dont want to borrow money of me aside your commands if you please captain   captain oniell an affair of honor compels me to be troublesome to you   sir simon flourish an affair of honor compels him to be troublesome to me oh that is worse than borrowing money aside   captain oniell my wounded reputation must be healed   sir simon flourish oh lord oh lord how have i offended him aside   captain oniell slander can only be washed out with blood   sir simon flourish oh my precious blood oh dear oh dear i suppose i have said some ill natured thing of him behind his back for i am sure i never durst affront him to his face aside   captain oniell a little after your leaving bath    sir simon flourish a little after my leaving bath repeats falteringly oh yes some damned goodnatured friend blabbd when my back was turned aside why really captain i dont recollect what can have given you offense at bath   captain oniell that i readily believe for it would be hard to expect you to recollect what you never heard   sir simon flourish eh   captain oniell i say sir simon you cannot be expected to know the insult offered me by a man who did not arrive till you were gone   sir simon flourish oh the man that insulted you did not arrive till i was gone lord what a load is off my mind aside and so captain a villain had the audacity to insult you   captain oniell i was insulted sir simon   sir simon flourish you will not let him live you will tear him to atoms  i know you will  blood and thunder if it were my case    captain oniell be cool sir simon  you are too desperate   sir simon flourish i am  i know it is my fault but fire and fury  can i assist you in this business   captain oniell that is the very cause of my visit to you  will you honor me so far as to deliver a bit of a message for me   sir simon flourish what carry a challenge for you eagerly   captain oniell exactly   sir simon flourish what and be your second   captain oniell if i may take the liberty to ask such a favor   sir simon flourish my dear captain give me your hand i am the happiest man alive to serve a friend i will see you through this affair i will take care of you where am i to go what am i to do first   captain oniell why first of all there is a little preparatory business before i can receive satisfaction for the injury done me i must put it in the power of my adversary to give it me   sir simon flourish as how pray   captain oniell you must know the young man is unluckily in prison for debt and as he has friends who are able to release him i thought it would be taking a liberty to rob them of a pleasure they have the best right to  but they scorn to be outdone in politeness and i believe would let him remain till doomsday before they would dispute the point with me   sir simon flourish and so you mean to pay his debts on purpose to fight him   captain oniell i do and i wish i had a better motive for though injured honor demands atonement i would rather do one little bit of a kindness than revenge a thousand injuries   sir simon flourish will it cost you much   captain oniell more than is quite convenient and therefore i must trespass on your goodness in a second instance   sir simon flourish eh what how   captain oniell i shall be under the necessity of troubling you for three hundred pounds   sir simon flourish lord it is a vast deal of money i think you had better not fight him till there is an act of insolvency or couldnt you get a snug little room in the prison and fight him at his own home that would be more genteel and accommodating no no  plague take it that will not do for if you kill him they will keep us there i should like to see you fight amazingly but then to pay three hundred pounds for it it is very dear i only paid a guinea to see johnson and big ben and their way of fighting is quite as fashionable nowa days   captain oniell understand me sir simon i dont intend to be under an obligation to you or any man i have brought my commission as security for the sum   sir simon flourish security my dear friend do you think i want security that is like a trader there is no security with people of fashion yet i may as well take it by way of memorandum takes the commission well tell me who he is and where he is to be found i will carry him the money and the challenge   captain oniell oh by no means he must not know the money comes from me he may feel it unpleasant to be under an obligation to a man he has wronged and to know that i had injured his feelings would not be the way to satisfy mine   sir simon flourish you are a very strange man there is the money manage it your own way  gives him notes captain oniell i thank you and as soon as he has got the miseries of a prison a little out of his mind you shall wait on him   sir simon flourish as soon as you please the sooner the better   captain oneill you are too impetuous you fiery little fellow we must not be in a hurry for misfortune is apt to lower a mans spirit and i scorn to meet a foe in a state of degradation   sir simon flourish well you must act as you choose only fight soon for i shall think of nothing else i know i am a desperate dog when i was at school they used to call me the little gamecock you are to do as you like but were it my own affair i should stand close muzzle to muzzle toe to toe  damme i would fight him in a sawpit i wonder i have not fought yet i never was even asked to be a second till now but i believe i know pretty well from the newspapers what a second has to do  to load the pistols measure the ground take care they stand near enough and let them fire as long as they like i believe that is all oh no if the parties are wounded he is to leave them on the ground to the mercy of chance and take care of himself   captain oneill i am not to dictate your conduct sir simon only it might be well if every second would consider that his office is that of a friend to adjust an affair of honor not of a sheriff to witness an execution good morning sir simon  exit sir simon flourish alone what a lucky dog i am to be concerned in a duel was the only thing wanting to complete me as a man of fashion i shall state the case next day in the newspapers with my name at full length then a glorious confusion always takes place people just remember the names but forget whether they were principals or seconds oh my character will be up i shall be a man of fashion indeed   enter lady flourish and miss hartley lady flourish my dear sir simon how glad i am youre at home if i am ever so little a while away from you my darling it appears a long tedious age how does my lovy do do look tender it is so becoming to you and beside if you dont you know you break my heart   sir simon flourish now really lady flourish you are too fond before company indeed you are it is your only fault my dear but you ought to consider that to be fond of a husband at all is very unfashionable and therefore when a wife feels that amiable weakness she ought never to expose it before people   lady flourish but i cannot help exposing it miss hartly knows i have been talking of nothing else but my dearest the whole time i have been out all the while i was buying my china and my gold muslins and my lace i was longing to be at home with my darling   sir simon flourish lord my dear i wish you had indulged your longing and then you would nt have laid out so much money and how is my dear miss hartley you dont seem in spirits   miss hartley indeed i am not but the cause of my want of spirits must remain a secret to you aside they sir who like me never knew misfortune are apt to trifle with their felicity   song miss hartley the heart that has never tasted sorrow even happiness often will cloy and we ever from misery borrow our knowledge of exquisite joy to those who all anguish would smother the best use of life is unknown to feel for the woes of another or value the bliss that is their own  sir simon flourish old testys stupid bumpkin of a son is to be introduced to you this morning but there is no fear of his rivalling my boy jack how i long to see the rogue again where is he now i wonder may be eating macaroni with the grand duke or having the honor of kissing the toe of his holinesss the pope oh what high fellows my son is living with   lady flourish where ever he is my dearest he can meet nobody so fine a gentleman as his papa   sir simon flourish oh you are too partial lady flourish  a great deal a great deal too partial i have news for you  captain oneill has been here   lady flourish captain oneill in town earnestly   sir simon flourish i should like to tell them of his engaging me to be his second aside you know the captain is a man of great bravery and knowing me to be of the same turn  hum hum we have had a good deal of conversation on the subject of duelling   lady flourish i hope the captain is not going to fight a duel greatly alarmed   sir simon flourish oh dear no   lady flourish i am glad to hear you say so i was quite agitated at the thought of any friend of yours being engaged in so horrid a business   sir simon flourish i must not blab i find she would lay an information and destroy my renown were i a principal instead of a second i should be vastly obliged to her aside i wonder how many duels jack has fought abroad  that is fought or been second in it is just the same thing the credit is the same and so is the danger pretty nearly for the principals are often so cursedly frightened that it is an even chance whether they hit their antagonist or their own second   miss hartley though i abhor the practice yet when men deem such trials necessary i hope they conduct themselves with proper courage   sir simon flourish that is mighty well of you you dont know what it is to receive a mans fire or you would not talk so lightly about it   enter servant servant young mr testy sir   sir simon flourish very well   lady flourish come my dear rest yourself a little before you encounter the fatigue of this bumpkins

see to westminster old hall is  both then since we agree so easy to be let us marry as soon as we can for not to demur whatever may occur is surely the very best plan  scene iii the kings bench harcourt solus harcourt was ever man more miserably circumstanced bred up as heir to a splendid fortune and all my hopes destroyed by the caprice of a splenetic old uncle shut up here in the kings

resemble the phiz of a gentleman blacklegs who by a little trick or two in the way of his trade disburthend our friend of his cash he thought when he met me in the rooms at bath and the place to be sure was not much in my favor that he had nicked his man and accosted me accordingly we lost one another in the crowd and he departed in his error i learnt his name and followed him to london where if i had not had wisdom enough to ask an explanation i might have been sent out of the world for the misfortune of resembling a scoundrel   harcourt how much i must ever feel bound to you   capt oneil ah

be so unkind you didnt look so cross at me the last time i saw you   old testy eh what   kitty dont you remember how goodhumored you looked just before you got under the sopha   sir simon flourish oh now the murder is out i say testy you had better give hushmoney for if we old fellows let the girls tell all they know about us it may not be for our credit besides the world may be spiteful enough to say you are angry with your son because you wanted to marry the girl yourself   kitty i dont know sir as to marrying but i have a little bit of paper here which    old testy hold your tongue  say no more i believe you are quite good enough for the blockhead you have got and so he may pack into yorkshire again and carry you with him as a sample of a london fine lady   sir simon flourish but this gentlemans taking the liberty of marrying our ward without our consent is a thing which    captain oneil oh it is a very great insult  and a word in your ear my little gamecock  if you mean to call him to account for it i will be your second   sir simon flourish i dont want to have any thing to do with seconds   captain oneil when i was going to fight him you were to have been my second and i only offer to return the obligation   sir simon flourish what is this the gentleman you redeemed out of prison to have the pleasure of fighting   harcourt is it to you then i owe my liberty generous man   captain oneil oh it was very generous to be sure to release you out of prison that i might have the satisfaction of sending you out of the world but sir simon this gentleman in fortune is equal to the lady he has wedded   harcourt captain oneil i am not conscious of what you are asserting   captain oneil but i am or i would not assert it understanding that your uncle had taken it into his head to be angry with you for nothing at all i called on the old gentleman to talk with him a little about it  if your nephew had been guilty of a dishonorable action said i devil a word would oneil offer in his behalf but as he has been a dupe to the villainy of others restore him to your favor and launch him into the world again with experience for his pilot  so the old gentleman shook hands with me and swore he was ready to do the same with you as soon as you pleased   harcourt thanks are too poor for such nobleness of soul   captain oneil nobleness of soul for walking a few steps out of my common road for the pleasure of reconciling a discarded nephew to a rich old uncle oh if people would but just lengthen their mornings walk to do a few good natured actions they can scarcely conceive what health and spirits such exercise would give them and how much sweeter they would rest for it at night   young flourish harcourt i give you joy   sir simon flourish give him joy  why you part with your mistress very easily   young flourish it is the fashion father   sir simon flourish well i think we may all adjourn we have staid in this dismal place long enough   young flourish i have for one i am sure   sir simon flourish then let us be gone directly   young flourish that is sooner said than done   enter dicky dicky master flourish here is the man from monmouth street he knows you are come home and he must and will have his clothes he has got mine   sir simon flourish must have his clothes  knows you are come home why that is the count i smell powder   captain oneil and that is a scent i know youre not fond of   sir simon flourish hush  knows you are come home what this is your home then   young flourish why father the  the  the    sir simon flourish the  the  i thought there was something damned odd about that emperor of morocos jailer and i suppose you will tell me now the count is the emperor himself   young flourish come father the truth must out  the two different systems of education have at last been completed in the same college and though i dont think keeping terms here absolutely necessary for the finish of every young gentlemans education yet as a school of adversity it has taught me this lesson  never by folly and extravagance to run the chance of returning when once you do me the honor to take my name out of the books   captain oneil come you must forgive him you know the brave are always compassionate   sir simon flourish very true besides it is useless to repine at what is past especially as you acknowledge you have learned some good which i am not quite sure you wou d have done by traveling  and if your friends here will be but indulgent you may possess all the credit of going abroad with the advantage of having remained at home   finale captain oneil now put an end to silly strife malice is but folly let us wisely pass a merry life waste no jot in care  sir simon flourish why that is well said come let us away with hearts good humored faces gay and sing fall lal etc  harcourt possessing all i prize on earth farewell melancholy each hour will give new pleasure birth blessed with thee my fair  miss hartley then tune to joy the dulcet note on harmony let pleasure float and sing fall lal etc  young testy to harmony i dont object while i have luck to meet it in home duets i cannot expect much of harmony  kitty come let us be wise and from this day with hearts good humored faces gay well sing fall lal etc  young flourish our mirth and joy may all partake humbly i entreat it and let your cheering plaudits make our poet full of glee  old testy then tune to joy the dulcet note on harmony let pleasure float and sing fall lal etc  the end
