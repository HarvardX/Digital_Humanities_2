exchange j gardener in charlesstreet westminster and j almon in piccadilly  mdcclxiii  the author accursed the man whom fate ordains in spite and cruel parents teach to read and write what need of letters wherefore should we spell why write our names a mark will do as well much are the precious hours of youth misspent in climbing learnings rugged steep ascent when to the top the bold adventrers got he reigns vain monarch over a barren spot whilst in the vale of ignorance below folly and vice to rank luxuriance grow honors and wealth pour in on every side and proud preferment rolls her golden tide over crabbed authors lifes gay prime to waste to cramp wild genius in the chains of taste to bear the slavish drudgery of schools and tamely stoop to every pedants rules for seven long years debarred of liberal ease to plod in college trammels to degrees beneath the weight of solemn toys to groan sleep over books and leave mankind unknown to praise each senior blockheads threadbare tale and laugh till reason blush and spirits fail manhood with vile submission to disgrace and cap the fool whose merit is his place vice chancellors whose knowledge is but small and chancellors who nothing know at all illbrookd the generous spirit in those days when learning was the certain road to praise when nobles with a love of science blessed approved in others what themselves possessed but now when dullness rears aloft her throne when lordly vassals her wide empire own when wit seduced by envy starts aside and basely leagues with ignorance and pride what now should tempt us by false hopes misled learnings unfashionable paths to tread to bear those labors which our fathers bore that crown withheld which they in triumph wore when with much pains this boasted learnings got it is an affront to those who have it not in some it causes hate in others fear instructs our foes to rail our friends to sneer with prudent haste the worldlyminded fool forgets the little which he learned at school the elder brother to vast fortunes born looks on all science with an eye of scorn dependent brethren the same features wear and younger sons are stupid as the heir in senates at the bar in church and state genius is vile and learning out of date is this  o death to think is this the land where merit and reward went hand in hand where heroes parentlike the poet viewed  by whom they saw their glorious deeds renewed where poets true to honor tuned their lays and by their patrons sanctified their praise is this the land where on our spencers tongue enamored of his voice description hung where johnson rigid gravity beguiled whilst reason through her critic fences smiled where nature listening stood whilst shakespeare played and wondered at the work herself had made is this the land where mindful of her charge and office high fair freedom walked at large where finding in our laws a sure defense she mocked at all restraints but those of sense where health and honor trooping by her side she spread her sacred empire far and wide pointed the way affliction to beguile and bade the face of sorrow wear a smile bade those who dare obey the generous call enjoy her blessings which god meant for all is this the land where in some tyrants reign when a weak wicked ministerial train the tools of power the slaves of interest planned their countrys ruin and with bribes unmanned those wretches who ordained in freedoms cause gave up our liberties and sold our laws when power was taught by meanness where to go nor dared to love the virtue of a foe when like a leprous plague from the foul head to the foul heart her sores corruption spread her iron arm when stern oppression reared and virtue from her broad base shaken feared the scourge of vice when impotent and vain poor freedom bowed the neck to slavrys chain is this the land where in those worst of times the hardy poet raised his honest rimes to dread rebuke and bade controulment speak in guilty blushes on the villains cheek bade power turn pale kept mighty rogues in awe and made them fear the muse who feared not law how do i laugh when men of narrow souls whom folly guides and prejudice controuls who one dull drowsy track of business trod worship their mammon and neglect their god who breathing by one musty set of rules dote from the birth and are by system fools who formed to dullness from their very youth lies of the day prefer to gospel truth pick up their little knowledge from reviews and lay out all their stock of faith in news how do i laugh when creatures formed like these whom reason scorns and i should blush to please rail at all liberal arts deem verse a crime and hold not truth as truth if told in rhyme how do i laugh when publius hoary grown in zeal for scotlands welfare and his own by slow degrees and course of office drawn in mood and figure at the helm to yawn too mean the worst of curses heaven can send to have a foe too proud to have a friend erring by form which blockheads sacred hold never making new faults and never mending old rebukes my spirit bids the daring muse subjects more equal to her weakness choose bids her frequent the haunts of humble swains nor dare to traffic in ambitious strains bids her indulging the poetic whim in quaintwrought ode or sonnet pertly trim along the church way path complain with gray or dance with mason on the first of may all sacred is the name and power of kings all states and statesmen are those mighty things which howsoeer they out of course may roll were never made for poets to control peace peace thou dotard nor thus vilely deem of sacred numbers and their power blaspheme i tell thee wretch search all creation round in earth in heaven no subject can be found our god alone except above whose weight the poet cannot rise and hold his state the blessed saints above in numbers speak the praise of god though there all praise is weak in numbers here below the bard shall teach virtue to soar beyond the villains reach shall tear his laboring lungs strain his hoarse throat and raise his voice beyond the trumpets note should an afflicted country awed by men of slavish principles demand his pen this is a great a glorious point of view fit for an english poet to pursue undaunted to pursue though in return his writings by the common hangman burn how do i laugh when men by fortune placed above their betters and by rank disgraced who found their pride on titles which they stain and mean themselves are of their fathers vain who would a bill of privilege prefer and treat a poet like a creditor the generous ardour of the muse condemn and curse the storm they know must break on them what shall a reptile bard a wretch unknown without one badge of merit but his own great nobles lash and lords like common men smart from the vengeance of a scribblers pen what is in this name of lord that we should fear to bring their vices to the public ear flows not the honest blood of humble swains quick as the tide which swells a monarchs veins monarchs who wealth and titles can bestow cannot make virtues in succession flow would thou proud man be safely placed above the censure of the muse deserve her love act as thy birth demands as nobles ought look back and by thy worthy father taught who earned those honors thou were born to wear follow his steps and be his virtues heir but if regardless of the road to fame you start aside and tread the paths of shame if such thy life that should thy sire arise the sight of such a son would blast his eyes would make him curse the hour which gave thee birth would drive him shuddring from the face of earth once more with shame and sorrow amongst the dead in endless night to hide his reverend head if such thy life though kings had made thee more than ever king a scoundrel made before nay to allow thy pride a deeper spring though god in vengeance had made thee a king taking on virtues wing her daring flight the muse should drag thee trembling to the light probe thy foul wounds and lay thy bosom bare to the keen question of the searching air gods with what pride i see the titled slave who smarts beneath the stroke which satire gave aiming at ease and with dishonest art striving to hide the feelings of his heart how do i laugh when with affected air scarce able through despite to keep his chair whilst on his trembling lip pale anger speaks and the chafed blood flies mounting to his cheeks he talks of conscience which good men secures from all those evil moments guilt endures and seems to laugh at those who pay regard to the wild ravings of a frantic bard satire whilst envy and illhumour sway the mind of man must always make her way nor to a bosom with discretion fraught is all her malice worth a single thought the wise have not the will nor fools the power to stop her headstrong course within the hour left to herself she dies opposing strife gives her fresh vigor and prolongs her life all things her prey and every man her aim i can no patent for exemption claim nor would i wish to stop that harmless dart which plays around but cannot wound my heart though pointed at myself be satire free to her it is pleasure and no pain to me dissembling wretch hence to the stoic school and there amongst thy brethren play the fool there unrebukd these wild vain doctrines preach lives there a man whom satire cannot reach lives there a man who calmly can stand by and see his conscience rippd with steady eye when satire flies abroad on falshoods wing short is her life indeed and dull her sting but when to truth allied the wound she gives sinks deep and to remotest ages lives when in the tomb thy pampered flesh shall rot and even by friends thy memory be forgot still shall thou live recorded for thy crimes live in her page and stink to aftertimes have thou no feeling yet come throw off pride and own those passions which thou shall not hide s  who from the moment of his birth made human nature a reproach on earth who never dared nor wished behind to stay when folly vice and meanness led the way would blush should he be told by truth and wit those actions which he blushed not to commit men the most infamous are fond of fame and those who fear not guilt yet start at shame but whither runs my zeal whose rapid force turning the brain bears reason from her course carries me back to times when poets blessed with courage graced the science they professed when they in honor rooted firmly stood the bad to punish and reward the good when to a flame by public virtue wrought the foes of feedom they to justice brought and dared expose those slaves who dared support a tyrant plan and called themselves a court ah what are poets now as slavish those who deal in verse as those who deal in prose is there an author search the kingdom round in whom true worth and real spirits found the slaves of booksellers or doomed by fate to baser chains vile pensioners of state some dead to shame and of those shackles proud which honor scorns for slavery roar aloud others halfpalsied only mutes become and what makes smollet write makes johnson dumb why turns you villain pale why bends his eye inward abashed when murphy passes by do thou sage murphy for a blockhead take who wages war with vice for virtues sake no no  like other worldlings you will find he shifts his sails and catches every wind his soul the shock of interest cannot endure give him a pension then and sin secure with laurelld wreaths the flattrers brows adorn bid virtue crouch bid vice exalt her horn bid cowards thrive put honesty to flight murphy shall prove or try to prove it right try thou statejuggler every paltry art ransack the inmost closet of my heart swear you are my friend by that base oath make way into my breast and flatter to betray or if those tricks are vain if wholesome doubt detects the fraud and points the villain out bribe those who daily at my board are fed and make them take my life who eat my bread on authors for defense for praise depend pay him but well and murphy is thy friend he he shall ready stand with venal rimes to varnish guilt and consecrate thy crimes to make corruption in false colors shine and damn his own good name to rescue thine but if thy niggard hands their gifts withold and vice no longer rains down showers of gold expect no mercy facts well grounded teach murphy if not rewarded will impeach what though each man of nice and juster thought shunning his steps decrees by honor taught he never can be a friend who stoops so low to be the base betrayer of a foe what though with thine together linked his name must be with thine transmitted down to shame to every manly feeling callous grown rather than not blast thine he will blast his own to open the fountain whence sedition springs to slander government and libel kings with freedoms name to serve a present hour though born and bred to arbitrary power to talk of williams with insidious art whilst a vile stuarts lurking in his heart and whilst mean envy rears her loathsome head flattering the living to abuse the dead where is shebbeare o let not foul reproach traveling thither in a citycoach the pillry dare to name the whole intent of that parade was fame not punishment and that old staunch whig beardmore standing by can in full court give that report the lie with rude unnatral jargon to support half scotch half english a declining court to make most glaring contraries unite and prove beyond dispute that black is white to make firm honor tamely league with shame make vice and virtue differ but in name to prove that chains and freedom are but one that to be saved must mean to be undone is there not guthrie who like him can call all opposites to proof and conquer all he calls forth living waters from the rock he calls forth children from the barren stock he far beyond the springs of nature led makes women bring forth after they are dead he on a curious new and happy plan in wedlocks sacred bands joins man to man and to complete the whole most strange but true by some rare magic makes them fruitful too whilst from their loins in the due course of years flows the rich blood of guthries english peers do thou contrive some blacker deed of shame something which nature shudders but to name something which makes the soul of man retreat and the lifeblood run backward to her seat do thou contrive for some base private end some selfish view to hang a trusting friend to lure him on even to his parting breath and promise life to work him surer death grown old in villainy and dead to grace hell in his heart and tyburne in his face behold a parson at thy elbow stands lowering damnation and with open hands ripe to betray his savior for reward the atheist chaplain of an atheist lord bred to the church and for the gown decreed ere it was known that i should learn to read though that was nothing for my friends who knew what mighty dullness of itself could do never designed me for a working priest but hoped i should have been a dean at least condemned like many more and worthier men to whom i pledge the service of my pen condemned whilst proud and pampered sons of lawn crammed to the throat in lazy plenty yawn in pomp of reverend beggry to appear to pray and starve on forty pounds a year my friends who never felt the galling load lament that i forsook the packhorse road whilst virtue to my conduct witness bears in throwing off that gown which francis wears what creatures that so very pert and prim so very full of foppery and whim so gentle yet so brisk so wondrous sweet so fit to prattle at a ladys feet who looks as he the lords rich vineyard trod and by his garb appears a man of god trust not to looks nor credit outward show the villain lurks beneath the cassockd beau that is an informer what avails the name suffice it that the wretch from sodom came his tongue is deadly  from his presence run unless thy rage would wish to be undone no ties can hold him no affection bind and fear alone restrains his coward mind free him from that no monster is so fell nor is so sure a bloodhound found in hell his silken smiles his hypocritic air his meek demeanor plausible and fair are only worn to pave frauds easier way and make gulled virtue fall a surer prey attend his church  his plan of doctrine view  the preacher is a christian dull but true but when the hallowed hour of preachings over that plan of doctrines never thought of more christ is laid by neglected on the shelf and the vile priest is gospel to himself by cleland tutored and with blacow bred blacow whom by a brave resentment led oxford if oxford had not sunk in same ere this had damned to everlasting shame their steps he follows and their crimes partakes to virtue lost to vice alone he wakes most lusciously declaims against luscious themes and whilst he rails at blasphemy blasphemes are these the arts which policy supplies are these the steps by which grave churchmen rise forbid it heaven or should it turn out so let me and mine continue mean and low such be their arts whom interest controuls kidgell and i have free and honest souls we scorn preferment which is gained by sin and will though poor without have peace within the end
