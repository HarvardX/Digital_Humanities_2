indian zoology  second edition    london  printed by henry hughs for robert faulder  mdccxc  advertisement this work or rather fragment was begun in the year      the descriptive part fell to my share the expense of the plates was divided between mr banks now sir joseph banks baronet john gideon loten esquire a governor in ceylon and myself twelve only were engraved and published soon after which the undertaking appeared so arduous that the design was given over it would be injustice to mr loten not to say that the etchings are taken from his fine collection of drawings made in india for he alleviated the cares of life with the delicious pursuits of the study of nature i prevaled on my two friends to unite with me in presenting the learned john reinhold forster with the plates i also bestowed on him three others engraven at my own expense before the work was dropped these were never published in england but when dr forster left our island he took the whole with him and in      printed at halle in saxony an edition very highly improved and translated into latin and german he prefixed to it a most elaborate lucubration de finibus et indole aeris soli marisque indici described the subjects of the three additional plates and inserted after the description of the fifteenth plate a most learned dissertation on the genus of the birds of paradise and on the phoenix he added several notes and at the end presented his readers with a faunula of the quadrupeds and birds of the extensive region of india and its islands  the last year mr robert faulder at new bondstreet bookseller applied to me for permission to reprint this very imperfect performance i consented but advised him by all means to get the additions by dr forster translated and an improved faunula to be formed from the best authorities which could be procured but having myself abjured all future publications referred him for that labor to any gentlemen willing and able to do justice to the performance i took the liberty of pointing out three friends of indisputable abilities and of whose tind services i had long and useful experience  dr aikin of yarmouth in norfolk with great cheerfulness undertook the translations mr john latham of dartford kent justly celebrated for extending the study of ornithology far beyond any naturalist of our days and the rev mr hugh davies rector of aber in caernarvonshire underwent the task of arranging the very numerous subjects of the indian faunula the more laborious part relative to the insects fell to the share of mr latham the rest to that of mr davies a more complete enumeration was never formed considering the extent of the country and the materials imported into our islands science has of late years found its way into our most distant possessions and we gather its fruits the faunula is a suffcient proof of the richness of the harvest collectors at home or in the distant indostan will find considerable benefit from this part of the work it will direct their researches or instruct them in the arrangement of the new acquisitions if my past labors can in any shape contribute in the left to the amusement of the individual or to the public in general the reflection cannot fail bestowing on me the most pleasing sensation  thomas pennant downing march        contents essay on india page   indian zoology p    i sciurus

boundaries climate soil and sea translated from the latin of john reinhold forster by john aikin m d the name of india is probably derived from hind or hindu the appellation of the people inhabiting it which the spaniards and portuguese the first navigators to india were accustomed to write gentu the greeks who penetrated through persia into india received from the persians the name of hind as that of the nation but they also improperly called indus the river named by the inhabitants sind or sindo in a later age the romans termed the country india the people indians but the river also indus yet they were not unacquainted with the name of sindi the arabians and persians again employed the names of sind and hind which occur frequently in their writings after the portuguese began to navigate for the purpose of exploring new regions many of them suspected that if they were to steer directly westward they would at length arrive at the farthest islands in the vicinity of india and because they conceived these islands to lie before those indian regions ante illas they gave them in the geographical charts made before the discovery of america the name of antilles and that india which they supposed situated behind the antilles they named the west indies because it might be reached by sailing westward hence appears the reason why in our age the name of indies is so widely extended  that india whence the animals now to be described are taken is east india but even here there is much variation as to the countries to which this name is proper and peculiar in the first place it is maintained that india is only wherever the hindu nation inhabits or the country called by the persians hindostan which is comprehended between the rivers sind and ganges closed to the north by the ridge of imaus or caucasus and on the south surrounded by the ocean so that the whole peninsula on this side the ganges belongs to hindostan  but in a more extended sense the peninsula beyond the ganges also is a part of india and its limits are much more extensive if under this second signification of india are reckoned all the islands of the indian sea from the east and north of madagascar as far as new holland and thence eastward to the philippine islands together with new guinea and it is principally with this meaning that the english and dutch sailors use the word india and mr pennant seems to have adopted it in his account of the animals of india  from what has been said it will be evident that a disquisition concerning the climate soil and seas of india thus largely understood will be a matter of much difficulty  mount imaus mountains arising in the very borders of persia and whose northern ridge separates india from bokara or bactria from cashimire or caspatyrus from the kingdom of tibet and from the chinese province of yunnan terminates at length in the kingdom of tonquin and runs out into other branches at the root of this mountain the temperature of the air is very various for in the winter season the country is buried in snow and frost not however for a long time those summits alone from which the sind and ganges are principally fed are covered with perpetual snow yet even the plain tract at the mouths of the ganges is not entirely free from frost during winter since the inhabitants collect ice artificially prepared for cooling liquors in the heat of summer great heats although fahrenbeits thermometer never sinks below    but in the summer season the inhabitants undergo the most intense heats arising to the    th nay even to the   0th degree of fahrenbeits thermometer so that men are scarcely able to breathe plunge into water up to the chin and ascend the higher trees that they may inhale a somewhat cooler breeze whilst they whose occupations oblige them to endure the hot air abroad not unfrequently fall suddenly dead the birds too are often killed by the heat while flying or sitting on trees and fall to the ground  then as the flat country is inundated about the solstice by the swollen waters of the ganges which returning into their channel leave many stagnant pools the exhalations raised by the suns heat form a body of intensely hot vapor extremely noxious so as to occasion putrid fevers of the highest malignity which frequently prove fatal within three hours  let us now pass into the peninsula of india on this side the ganges and examine the nature of its climate and soil this part of india is divided into two parts by the ridge of mountains called gatte and while summer reigns on one side winter prevails on the other this chiefly proceeds from the winds which from october to april blow constantly from the north and from april to october from the south for the space of some weeks before this change there is generally scarcely any wind but at the commencement of the change such tempests arise as to cause great damage to mariners on the eastern side of the peninsula called the coast of coromandel the sky from april to october is constantly serene without a shower but from october to april is the rainy season on the western or malabar coast on the contrary there is no rain from october to april but very heavy rains fall from may to september during the fair season intense heat infests the whole coast but in the rainy season the temperature is at intervals more moderate and at that time all the rivers swell and their streams are partly distributed through the fields for the purpose of fertilising them and partly are received into ponds or great receptacles where the water is preserved with care to be let into the fields at proper periods  the region of india beyond the ganges has nearly the same climate with the peninsula on this side rivers but it is particularly well watered by large rivers of these we shall first mention the bahramputter burrampooter which flows through the whole country of tibet from the very confines of cashimire and after it has crossed the kingdom of assam enters that of bengal at rangamatty and at length just upon the coast of the indian sea mixes its waters with those of the ganges in an equally copious stream and thus enters the sea in a common channel next the rivers ava pegu and tenasserim rising in the tibet mountains after watering the kingdoms whose names they bear enter the bay of bengal on the western side of the peninsula  the menam and menamkom or siam and cambodia rivers flow down from the mountains which part the province of yunnan in china from india all the above rivers the bahramputter excepted take their course through large valleys enclosed on each side by ridges of hills on the approach of the sun to the tropic of cancer the snow on these mountains is dissolved and all these valleys are overflowed like egypt by the nile when the rivers return into their channel the moistened countries are sown chiefly with rice which yields a very rich increase the kingdoms of cochinchina and tonquin are bounded to the east by the sea and to the west by a ridge of mountains separating them from the kingdoms of cambodia and laos from this ridge many rivers descend which after they have watered the country for a short tract mingle with the sea  the soil of all india hitherto described is rich and soil by the cultivation of the populous nations which from the remotest ages have inhabited these regions and addicted themselves to agriculture is rendered extremely fertile and by reason that so many nations and such various species of animals have for such a course of ages putrefied with the vegetables of this fruitful land the soil lixiviated with water and mixed with ashes affords to europe a great quantity of nitre the principal ingredient of its gunpowder rice is chiefly sown in moist situations and supplies these people who live a pythagorean life with a food of easy preparation and extremely cheap there is another kind of rice which grows even on the hills and spares the cultivators the labor of watering  the marshes are covered with thick beds of reeds and marshes near the mouths of the largest rivers overgrown with impenetrable groves of mangles among the cultivated tracts here and there dry spots are observed covered with briars and thickets the parts neglected by human culture are full of woods which abound with the most beautiful and singular birds especially parrots peacocks pigeons and others infinitely diversified with the gayest and most varied plumage together with herds of antelopes tribes of monkeys and numbers of lions and tigers the elephant and rhinoceros also inhabit these forests which scarcely ever lose their leaves but are always verdant and perpetually loaded with fruits of one kind or another  nature wears a different form in the islands of the indian sea islands but that we may the better understand the nature of the climate and the temperature of the atmosphere it will be of particular use to consider the course of the winds which prevail in these seas winds between both tropics the wind almost constantly blows from the east and at the equinoxes about the line the course of the wind is directly from east to west for the sun in the daytime heats the air and about noon when it is vertical the atmosphere glows with heat and therefore is rarefied at the same time the sun seeming rapidly to move from east to west on account of the diurnal revolution of the earth causes noon successively in different regions toward evening when the sun is in the west the air from both sides of the globe as likewise from the east rushes toward the west and follows the sun in order to balance the rarefaction of the heated atmosphere this current of air is the east wind the greater the distance from the equinoctial line in each hemisphere the more the wind inclines to the north or south now when the sun arrives at the tropic of cancer the east wind follows it but the eastnortheast and northeast extend beyond the tropic of cancer into the northern hemisphere whilst on the contrary the eastsoutheast and southeast scarcely reach farther than the equinoctial line and when the sun recedes to the tropic of capricorn the east wind follows it there too but the eastnortheast and northeast scarcely reach beyond the line rarely to the tropic while the eastsoutheast and southeast spread far into the southern hemisphere these observations are generally true concerning the winds within the tropics and especially in the great atlantic and pacific oceans  every where within the tropics on approaching within three or four leagues of land a breeze is met with blowing from sea to land from nine in the morning to sunset and from land to sea from about ten at night to sunrise these observations also hold in general with respect to the winds in the vicinity of lands within the tropics  in the indian sea from october to april the eastnortheast and northnortheast winds prevail as far as the line but during the same season from the line southwards to about the   th degree the west westsouthwest and southwest are the prevailing winds and beyond this space the eastsoutheast and southeast from april to october in the northern hemisphere the west westsouthwest and southwest winds reign to the south of the equinoctial as far as about the   th degree the east and eastsoutheast and beyond that point the eastsoutheast and southeast these prevailing winds are by sailors termed the monsoons and from them some inferences may be drawn as to the temperature of the air the winds which blow across great tracts of land heated by the suns rays acquire a great degree of heat and the greater space they pass over the more scorching they prove but wherever winds blow over the sea they are cooled by the evaporation of the water hence all shores and islands though situated under the hottest sun enjoy the benefit of temperate sea breezes  if we mean to consider too nature of the soil in the indian islands origin of the islands we must attend to their twofold form and origin some are lofty and if of moderate size they have generally a conical shape on examination of the mountain and strata in this case it will presently be obvious that the whole island has emerged from the bottom of the sea through the force of subterranean fire for all parts are full of volcanic remains actually burning mountains are likewise not uncommon in these islands all the high islands which i have surveyed between the tropics in the atlantic and pacific oceans were found to contain scoriae eructated ashes and liquefied matter the manifest vestiges of intestine fires and that the same takes place with regard to the islands of the indian sea is rendered probable by so many volcanoes yet to be seen among them by the testimony of various navigators and eyewitnesses and by the stones evidently resembling scoriae and melted rock brought from thence it is wonderful that ashes thrown up from volcanoes and other scoriaceous matters comminuted and mixed with the earth should constitute a soil inferior to none in fertility but it is certain that most plants thrive most luxuriantly in this soil and that trees of all kinds grow in it to a stupendous magnitude  there are within the tropics other islands low and little elevated above the surface of the sea all of this kind are the workmanship of zoophyte vermes which raise on all sides from the bottom of the sea their mansions of a calcareous matter whence at length are formed rocks and stony shallows very dangerous to navigators since for the most part easterly winds are frequent in these seas these animalcules as if actuated by instinct endeavor to exclude the waves driven by the winds by means of their stupendous works and therefore carrying on the artful structure of their calcareous or stony habitations they extend them in long arms which at last unite in a circle within which they include a portion of calm untroubled sea on the opposite or windward side the waves continually throw up fragments of corals which accumulating by degrees form a mound against the force of the billows and on that part the sea is rendered gradually shallower whilst on the other side immediately under the arms raised by the zoophytes the sea is of astonishing depth and not unfrequently a part of the work remains open for the ingress and egress of the tide in the coral banks themselves sand is collected by the waves which afford soil and aliment for the seeds of shore plants brought thither by the sea and these plants at length perishing gradually create and accumulate a vegetable mould if by chance a cocoanut be carried by the sea to these spots it germinates and grows into a tall tree bearing and disseminating many nuts some of which again germinating soon form a palmgrove affording shade to birds and other animals and supplying navigators driven to the place by stress of weather with a grateful food and liquor the bay included within the arms constructed by the zoophytes is a receptacle for fishes which require a calm unagitated sea and thus another food from the animal kingdom is presented to strangers the shallows too afford quiet and desirable situations to molluscae and shellfish of all kinds and contribute much toward supplying the inhabitants of the islands with a variety of food  the greater islands of the indian sea ceylon borneo java sumatra celebes luconia mindanao ceram gilolo waighen and the isle of papua or new guinea are all mountainous and full of burning or extingushed volcanoes they are covered with evergreen woods and reedgrounds luxuriant in various tropical fruits productive of all kinds of spices useful trees etc and of many drugs valuable in medicine and the arts especially camphor benzoin gamboge sanders the amomums costus zedoary galangal the peppers snakeroot dragonsblood and many others which need not here be enumerated these islands enriched with so many and great advantages are everywhere inhabited by various animals their woods and thickets are thronged with innumerable birds their seas abound in fishes of all kinds the greatest part of which have never been examined by naturalists and what vast treasures of shellfish their shores marine rocks and the bottom of their seas contain may be gathered from hence that for at lest a century that these seas have been frequented by europeans they have continually been offering somewhat new to the curiosity of men whose avarice or vanity has prompted them to collect such stores from all parts nor are these regions destitute of inhabitants differing from each other in color shape manners dress religion and language for some tribes in the interior recesses of the woods and mountains preserve their ancient savage state treat all strangers as enemies and devour the slain others adopting gender manners and formed to commerce and even to submission become daily more civilized  thus much concerning the limits climate soil and seas of india i thought necessary to prefix in order to render what follows more perspicuous  on the birds of paradise and the phoenix the birds of paradise are a genus of birds scarcely as yet sufficiently known to the ornithologists because few of them are imported into europe and those too mutilated in their feet wings and other parts or distorted by having a stick thrust within their skins and thus too much lengthened no real naturalist ever had the fortune to see a live bird of paradise or to have observed their manners and economy sir joseph banks did me the favor of communicating the drawing of the common bird of paradise brought alive to england drawn from the life t p  for they inhabit a region visited by very few europeans since scarcely any but sailors and merchants are permitted to penetrate into the remotest east the country of the paradisebirds the history of this genus is therefore still full of falsities or rather buried in such darkness that we can scarcely hope to gain more and truer information concerning them till some person by a journey into these parts is enabled by his own observations and experiments to give the public some accounts more ample and exact than we hitherto possess  it is most certain that these birds were never known to the ancients and whatever the egyptian priests delivered concerning their phoenix has little agreement with the bird of paradise but that there may not be the left doubt remaining on these points we shll collect what has been said by the ancients concerning the phoenix and after the passages are brought in view briefly examine them herodotus the father of history relates   ii    that the phoenix is a bird of the shape and size of an eagle decorated with goldcoloured and purple wings but he frankly confesses that he had never seen the bird but knew it only by its picture pliny   x c   confirms that the phoenix is of the size of an eagle with the splendor of gold around his neck the rest of the body purple having a blue tail spotted with rosecolored feathers combs adorning his face and a crest of feathers his head this was the ancient opinion concerning the form and colors of the phoenix but the same pliny relates from manilius that the conversion of the great year corresponds with the life of this bird from which period the same course of seasons and position of the heavenly bodies is renewed and that this takes place about noon on the day that the sun enters taurus horapollo delivers the same notion respecting the phoenix they the egyptian priests meaning to signify the conversion of the great year paint the phoenix these notions are then to be explained from the theology of egypt  the sun which produces the seasons is the egyptian osiris a deity whose name has the same signification for oeischiri in the egyptian tongue is the maker of seasons but almost all the male gods especially of the egyptians expressed the virtues and powers of the sun hence the vernal sun when it is peculiarly vigorous and operates with most power according to the discipline of the egyptian priests was hercules whom they therefore called dsemmenuti the virtue of god or of the gods the same hercules according to athenagoras pro christianis p    or as damascus has it  ap wolff anecdot iii p     that principle was named time void of old age and likewise hercules nor is it to be omitted that in the obelisk of king ramesses the sun is called the lord of seasons which in the egyptian language is sesoeisch or sesoosis  the annual revolution of the sun makes a year of twelve months but the egyptian year long was only     days whence every fourth year four true solar years exceeded as many egyptian years a single day which they were not accustomed to intercalate hence the seasons of the year wandered through the whole egyptian year and hence of the solar years as first fixed by julius ceasar the dictator    0 equal      vague egyptian years on this account the egyptian priests were accustomed to call four years with the day of intercalation the year of god and      vague egyptian years made the great year of god that is of the sun and they taught that at this great period the conversion of the great year took place at which also the phoenix regenerated  flew from arabia to the city of the sun and deposited his fathers body on the altar  it will now appear why the orphics in hymn xi to hercules   address him by the title of variousformed father of time and plutarch in his treadle on isis and osiris asserts that the egyptians fable hercules to be placed in the sun and to revolve with it for from these premises it might justly be said with nonnus of panopolis   xl p     that hercules rolls round the whole earth in the glittering orb of the sun and carries round with him the year the son of time every common year therefore is a year of god and the great year the son of time which in the egyptian language would be dsphenoeisch and on account of the harshness of the first letter the creels would make it  phoenix this origin of the name adds strength to my opinion since it is perfectly agreeable to the doctrine of the egyptians concerning these things and at the same time exactly expresses all the sacred fables of their priests relative to the phoenix  that the fabulous phoenix of the egyptians has nothing in common with the birds of paradise will be sufficiently manifest from what has been said yet it is not altogether without reason that we have here treated on the phoenix for the first portuguese navigators to the indian islands called the birds of paradise passaros da sol birds of the sun in the same manner as the egyptians had regarded the phoenix as a symbol of the annual revolution of the sun and the conversion of the great year the inhabitants of the isle of ternate call these birds manucodewata birds of god the french english and germans have adopted the name of birds of paradise all these names seem to attribute somewhat of a celestial origin to the birds the name manucodewata has induced some writers of natural history to call the bird manucodiata edwards t   0 marograv brasil  0  raii synops av    n   brisson ornithol ii p   0 and the illustrious count de busson by cutting off part of the name has made from it his manucode valentyne vol iii p  0      has treated at length of the birds of paradise the portuguese first saw them in gilolo papua and new guinea many idle fables have been propagated concerning these birds among which are to be reckoned that they have no feet are always on the wing pass their lives in the air and feed on this element on which account the inhabitants of these countries are accustomed to cut off their feet but the people of the aru islands have taught the dutch in banda better and it is sound that the feet are cut off in order that the birds may be more easily preserved dry the indians too pay little regard to the feet because they use the skins of the birds of paradise only to adorn their helmets in their games and mock combats but the aruans  0 or  0 years ago brought these birds with their feet pigasette who accompanied ferdinand magalhaens in his voyage testified from ocular demonstration about      that they were not without feet but the length and peculiar structure of the scapular feathers prevent them from sitting on trees in windy weather and if they are once blown down to the ground they are utterly unable to raise themselves again by their wings when taken by the natives they are immediately killed because their food is unknown and they defend themselves courageously with their very strong beaks  of the birds of paradise there are about six species the faumla will produce many more    the great paradisebird of aru   the lesser paradisebird of papua   and   two black species   the white paradisebird   the unknown paradisebird   the lesser kingbird which is also to be reckoned among the paradisebirds  i paradisea apoda greater bird of paradise latham syn ii     index i     the greater paradisebird is generally about two feet in length head small beak the length of the head hard palecoloured head and nape of the neck yellow space round the eyes black neck beautifully resplendent with very soft shining emeraldcoloured feathers those of the breast equally soft of a pale yellowishgrey large chesnutcoloured wings back covered with the scapulars elongated stiff narrow pale brown very much resembling the loose feathers of the ostrich these expand while the bird flies and therefore it is easy for him to remain in the air on the sides of the breast and belly are bundles of feathers much shorter than the anterior ones stiff goldcoloured from the rump arise two stiff feathers of great length naked in the shafts terminated with radiated plumes several birds of these countries are furnished with such long feathers as the belurus pylstaart of amboyna the alcedo sariwak and a species of papuan parroquet in size it little exceeds the blackbird feet short with four strong toes the inhabitants of ternate call this species burong papua papua birds and sometimes manucodewata and also soffu or sioffu the amboynese call them manukeyaru birds of the islands key and aru because the people of these islands bring them to banda and amboyna for sale the aruans give them the name of fanaan in fact these birds are not found in the island key which is about  0 miles eastward of banda but are met with in the aru islands which are    miles further to the east than key at the dry season of the western monsoon and return to new guinea at the commencement of the rainy season as soon as the east wind begins to blow they fly in flocks of about  0 or  0 led by a bird which the aruans call king but which is altogether distinct from the lesser bird of paradise this leader is black with red spots and constantly flies higher than the rest which never separate from it but immediately when it settles settle too whence they frequently perish for if the leader settles on the ground they are not able to rise on account of the peculiar structure of their feathers nor can they fly with the wind for in that case their very long loose feathers would be totally disordered they therefore always fly against the wind and carefully abstain from flight in a storm which often throws them to the ground  while flying they are noisy like starlings but their cry rather resembles the croaking of ravens and is particularly audible when in windy weather the encumbrance of their feathers brings them into imminent danger of falling to the ground in the aru islands they perch on the highest trees especially on those of the smallleaved waringha with red fruit on which they chiefly subsist  ficus benjamina hort malab iii f    rumph amboin iii f  0 they are taken by the inhabitants with birdlime snares or blunt arrows but though many fall alive into the fowlers hands they are immediately killed and after embowelling and generally cutting off their feet they are fumigated with sulphur and dried in which state they are sold for half a dollar in banda but in aru they may be purchased for a large nail or piece of iron the dutch ships frequenting the sea between new guinea and aru a distance of    or  0 miles not unfrequently see flocks of paradisebirds crossing the sea from one to the other of these places but always against the wind if a more tempestuous gale than usual rises during their flight they seek the upper and calmer regions of the air and thus continue their course the natives fasten these birds to their helmets in place of crests in real and mock sights and often tie the whole or part of the skins to their swords during the eastern monsoon their very long feathers fall and in the western monsoon within the space of four months as the aruans report they are replaced by new ones  ii paradisea apoda lesser latham syn ii     index i     b the lesser paradisebird of papua this species is about twenty inches in length beak leadcolored paler toward the apex eyes small and surrounded with black neck emeraldcolored head and back of the neck duskyyellowish wings small and chesnutcolored breast and belly brown back yellowishgrey long scapulars about a foot in length and paler than in the former species which is in general to be observed of all the splendid colors in this species the long bare feathers of the tail are constantly rejected by the inhabitants in other respects this species has every thing in common with the former these birds also follow a leader which however has more of a dark purple in his wings but this leader is distinguished from the  d and  th black kinds the papuan inhabitants of the island missowal mixoal maysel relate that these paradisebirds never migrate but build nests in the highest trees where they are found by the alfubris the beak and neck are longer in the male than in the female by the people of ternate and tidore this bird is called toffu or burong papuwa papuabird by the papuans it is named shag or shague the people of east ceram give it the name of samaleik but in the isle of sorghile in new guinea it is called tshakke it was formerly believed that these birds were found in gilolo or halamahera and the adjacent islands to the south and southeast but it is now certain that they are peculiar to the papuan isles these extend from the southern extremity of gilolo and northern coast of ceram as far as the western part of new guinea the largest of them are missowal maysol lying to the north of ceram and salawatti or salawat situated near the country or island of serghile in new guinea this last in the earliest portuguese maps is improperly called ceram and is separated from new guinea these paradisebirds perch on the highest trees of the mountainous region and are killed with blunt arrows by the people of missowal others relate that the natives medicate the water of which the birds are used to drink with the indiaberries menisperman cocculus linn whereby they are rendered so stupid as to be taken by the hand these birds commonly feed on the fruit of the tshampedatree which they persorate with their bills and thus extract the kernels it is fabled by some that when these birds become weak with age they fly a great height toward the sun till they fall down dead the papuans after killing and embowelling them dry the cavity with a hot iron and enclose them in a joint of bamboo in order the better to preserve them  iii and iv the black paradisebirds the larger variety of
