the economy of health or a medical essay  price two shillings  the economy of health or a medical essay containing new and familiar instructions for the attainment of health happiness and longevity in which the nature of the human mind is accurately investigated and its union and connection with the body systematically explained  by andrew harper late surgeon to his majestys garrison in the bahama isands   medio tutissimus ibis  ovid printed for the author and sold by c stalker stationerscourt ludgate hill  to the public any attempt to instruct the bulk of mankind in the science of medicine by endeavoring to discuss the nature and cure of diseases must at first view appear equally absurd and impossible but to explain the principal causes which affect health and induce disease to illustrate so much of the animal economy as this intention requires and by these means to render people less strangers to themselves and more capable of preserving health and life as i believe there is no other treatise of the same kind seems to me a laudable endeavor and consistent with every purpose of benevolence and humanity such is the design of this essay and such the motives for its publication in this little production i have particularly studied to be concise and to convey without entering into detail as much practical information as possible on a small easy scale i have taken care not to introduce any groundless theoretical speculation nor have i even hazarded a single assertion but what my own inquiry and observation have repeatedly proved and confirmed to my satisfaction if my analysis and explanation of the mind be more compatible with fair reason and sound philosophy if it be a more accurate investtigation of physical and moral analogy and more clearly demonstrative of

imagination page    influence of imagination page    volition or the will page    the diseases incidental to the human body are correspondent to the number of external and internal causes which are capable of affecting it and to the nature and state of the animal structure  all those things which act immediately upon the body or make impression on it at a distance through the medium of the senses the changes that happen in the atmosphere which surrounds us and in the air we breathe constitute the general external causes that affect health  the principal internal causes may be reckoned sleep and the quantity quality and modification of such things as are received into the stomach  the particular causes of diseases depend upon the state of the animal economy  first then i shall make some general observations for the purpose of elucidation and afterward consider the subject as it naturally arises from these three heads  the proper standard of health is that state in which all the component parts of the body as a machine are equally firm to resist pliant to yield and proportionable to be regular this constitutes an equilibrium or proper balance to preserve or restore this balance is health and every considerable degree of variation from it is an equal degree of disease  the human fabric may be divided into two different systems the one is the system of vessels or tubes which performs the circulation of the fluids and is conducted on plain mechanical principles and the other is the nervous system which consists of all those parts that have sensibility and motion and whose properties are more difficult to explain  when these two systems are happily balanced and proportioned all the powers and functions of the body as well as of the mind come nearest to a state of regularity and perfection  in all my researches into the nature and principles of the human mind i must confess that i can discern no one single operation of it distinct from and unconnected with the body  that there most certainly is a prime movement general sensory or a concentrated power which is the origin of all the faculties and offices of the body and that this power resides or begins within the brain anatomical dissections and the observations of common sense unquestionably demonstrate to define the magnitude quantity or proportion of this power is utterly impossible and to say that it is immaterial or that it is something which has no parts is positively to say that it is nothing at all  this power is best known and i think most happily described by the common terms mind life or soul now although i profess and indeed must treat of this power or mind as an essential and organic part of the human structure i am ready at the same time to declare least i should mislead the weak or ignorant that this doctrine ought not nor by any means can be deemed repugnant to the belief of immortality or a future state of existence on the contrary it places human nature in a rational light and will be found to obviate and reconcile those difficulties which occur in considering this nice point  for where is the objection in respect of reason or philosophy against the opinion that this power soul mind or animating essence of the body immutable in its properties may at the final hour sublime as it were from the caputmortuum that is soar aloft and survive the grosser materials which the laws of specific gravity fix to the earth and the texture of parts subjects to separation and dissolution  the first and leading feature in the physiognomy of the mind is a quality capability or inherent necessity of perceiving all manner of impressions whatever  from this simple power of perception first similitude or resemblance of things then memory comparison reflection deliberation and in short all the regular and progressive operations of the mind by means of an intrinsic or unceasing movement may be easily conceived to proceed  the passions so called form another class of operations more energetic than the former because in them the impressions are external immediate and impetuous and the perceptions therefore reciprocally more vigorous  thus anger proceeds from violent agitations fear is produced by such as are strong and quick joy arises from vivid and grief from deep impressions hope is the result of soft and agreeable emotions which circumstance proves in the clearest manner that the enjoyments of life infinitely surpass the miseries of it since hope by being constantly in exercise becomes habitual and never leaves the mind except for very short and almost imperceptible intervals this argument yields a good lesson for patience and contentment in every possible situation love the mistress of the mind differs from all the rest it is closely interwoven with the animal frame and draws its impulse of all others the most irresistible from springs which act within as well as from objects that excite without  images which present to the mind beauty harmony and symmetry produce pleasing emotions those which convey the contrary qualities are accompanied with painful sensations the former of these give a free and full motion to the nervous power a short quick and contracted movement is the consequence of the latter  this observation may be applied with more force and conviction than all the elaborate and ingenious arguments that can be adduced either in favor or in opposition to the doctrine in testimony of the natural ascendency of moral virtue in the human mind  it shows that beauty order dignity and happiness are amiable to the mind of man and illuminate with congenial rays the elevated faculties of the soul while deformity turpitude vice and misery compose the horrid contrast that disgraces society degrades the mind and brutalizes the species  none of the mental affections or operations as long as they continue to create regular and pleasing sensations by any means injure but on the contrary promote health the passions or affections of the mind therefore affect health and disorder the system in consequence of and in proportion to the impetuosity pain and duration of the impressions or images which actuate or excite them and in no other way  anger fear hatred shame grief anxiety jealousy envy pride malice and revenge to which i may add study possesses each of them a certain modification of the characteristic marks above described and all of them produce similar effects upon the animal system different only in degree and in point of continuation love hope and joy must rank differently from the other passions as their effects are injurious to the system only when they are violent and excessive  the passions of the mind then agreeable to the limitations pointed out irritate the nervous system whose tubes serve as conductors from the brain throughout the whole body in such a manner as to produce spasm now spasm is a motion or oscillation whether in the vascular or muscular parts it makes no difference so extremely quick in point of succession or alternation that the intermissions or intervals become imperceptible to the senses this is a seeming paradox an excess and at the same time an interruption of the nervous influence  the spasmodic stimulus or effort thus produced by the passions particularly affects the head the lungs and the womb hence madness fainting convulsions hysterics asthma etc it disorders the stomach and intestinal canal occasioning colics flatulency and indigestion it constringes the surface of the skin and all the nervous parts and tubes and thus blocks up the perspiration and the other secretions and by these means brings fevers obstructions scurvy nervous disorders melancholy etc  vehement and sudden passions by means of spasm sometimes retard and check for a moment the progressive motion of the nervous influence in the brain itself hence a general relaxation and involuntary discharge of the faeces and urine a circumstance which happens not seldom in cases of extreme fright or terror  the same law paints the inward feelings upon the muscles of the face by various contractions and relaxations it gives the pencil its finest stroke and fullest expression in the genuine language of the eyes and thus confirms the face the index or proxy of the mind  the immoderate or inordinate passions and agitations of the mind are most effectually prevented by avoiding as much as possible every exciting cause and cultivating habits of equanimity and firmness which with every other valuable accomplishment of the mind are chiefly to be acquired from education or in other words an extensive and well chosen fund of ideas  this is a resource which invigorates and exalts the mind expands the reason furnishes the aids of philosophy and supplies an inexhaustible store of different thoughts and various imagery  but no particular management nor any mode of access or immediate application whatever to the mind can counteract the disadvantages of an unhealthy and infirm habit of body pain must necessarily sour the temper and make it hasty morose and irascible relaxation creates peevishness and imbecility and renders the mind irritable timid too susceptible of every impression and liable to misconception and obstruction which is generally the companion of relaxation adds gloom melancholy anxiety and a disordered imagination to the baneful catalogue  on the other hand in those habits or temperatures in which the powers and functions of the system rise above the line of mediocrity or standard of health and occasion irregularity only on that account the disposition of the mind receives the stamp and wears the colors of pride restlessness vanity and desire these moreover have not so sad a complexion nor so sickly an aspect as the former and besides are much more easily reduced to the proper equilibrium  in all cases where the passions are once excited the best antidote is the creation of new and opposite impressions  change the objects shift the scene sooth the mind and compose the body and if need be fortify it also  these rules are applicable in sudden emotions as anger fear etc and are equally apposite in the passions of suspended love grief jealousy etc where there is always some image permanently represented and in a manner settled upon the mind but to conquer the latter will require time and perservance  grief ought to be amused and supplanted by hope fidelity and consolation must soften the edge of jealousy and love should certainly be gratified if possible or if that cannot be done since as i said before it has a double claim it must be allowed every reasonable indulgence and should undoubtedly meet returns of sympathy and tenderness somewhere  none of the passions will admit of too sudden a check it is much better to endeavor to supersede them by means of other pleasant sensations than to attempt all at once to stifle and restrain them the irritation on the nerves when once excited must have some play it seeks a vent through one channel or another and if it burst out in a flood of tears a fit of laughter or a flow of words it may be reckoned a very favorable termination  the air is an invisible elastic fluid which covers and encloses the earth and presses upon the surface of all bodies with an amazing weight  the air acts upon the animal system in various ways it stimulates more or less in all circumstances it relaxes or braces according to the degree of heat or cold which pervades it the lungs are inflated and expanded with a greater or lesser force adequate to its elasticity or purity and it absorbs and receives the diaphoretic vapor from the surface of the skin as well as of the lungs in proportion to its dryness and warmth  the air in general is most salubrious in high situations in those places where it has a free circulation and also near the seacoast and in the vicinity of rivers and flowing water air impregnated with foreign particles overcharged with moist or phlogistated by the heat of the sun the action of fire by sulphurous vapors the breath of animals and suchlike is most unwholesome  in asthmas consumptions and nervous complaints the temperature of the air is a material consideration and of great importance a light dry and warm air is best for weak and diseased lungs and a dry and cold or temperate air is fittest for relaxed and nervous people  the benefit of change of air is known to every body and many people find by experience that a change even to a more indifferent air is sometimes attended with advantage the reason of which is manifest from what has been already said concerning the qualities and effects of air the changes of air ought not in any case to be too sudden or too much in the extreme the more gradual they are the less danger is incurred  in all fevers but especially those of the putrid kind ventilation or the admission of fresh air is highly necessary in putrid fevers the patient should be removed and the apartments well washed with plenty of warm water and dried with a quick and strong fire keeping the windows open at the same time this is a very safe and effectual method of purifying noxious air  in the advanced as well as in the earlier stages of phthisical and consumptive diseases it cannot he improper after other means have failed to try a sea voyage and a warmer climate  the reaching and vomiting occasioned by sea sickness which has been generally accounted hazardous ought not by any means to intimidate if the disease be seated in the glandular parts of the lungs if it be of the scrophulous kind or of an hydropic nature or if a general infarction or local plenitude of the lungs give rise to it and thus circumstanced indeed from one or more of these causes the disease is most frequently to be met with in either of these cases i say sea sickness and vomiting must be undeniably useful if even a suppuration or abcess be forming or already formed the case is then so exceedingly dangerous that there still remain more chances in favor of than against the patient besides there is a peculiar kind of relaxation prevailing in the system from the vertiginous nature of that sickness so that the action of vomiting is performed with less danger of rupturing any vessels and the ejections from the stomach are more abundant than in vomiting produced from any other cause  it may likewise deserve notice in this place that aged people who may happen to be more solicitous to prolong their existence than concerned in what latitude their ashes are to rest certainly have it in their power coeteris paribus to add a few years to the period of their natural lives by removing in the decline of life to a hot tropical climate  the necessities of nature and the general order of things demand action in the human species and the mechanism of the body plainly shows that it is not only well calculated for that purpose but also demonstrates that exercise is even indispensibly requisite to preserve regularity in the wheels of motion and to fit them for the due performance of their several offices  exercise is like a main spring to the machinery it promotes the digestion prepares the blood for its various destinations distributes it through all the channels of circulation throws off the imperfect and offensive parts of the fluids braces the nerves gives a firm tone to the solids and carries an even flow of spirits throughout the whole system  exercise is hurtful immediately after a full meal and in the morning when the stomach is quite empty much exercise is injurious  frequent walking relieves the head abates rheumatic pains keeps the bowels open is favorable to all the descending evacuations and has a tendency to prevent the gout it contributes to general health and by increasing the circulation and secretion in the legs and feet since the extremities are the original seat of the gout it may perhaps hinder the formation and assimilation of those morbid particles which are found to exist in a concreted state in a fixed or settled gout  riding on horseback is an excellent exercise and essentially beneficial in obstructed and nervous habits and in all affections of the lungs but when the nerves or bowels are very weak the best substitute is riding in an open carriage  those who labor under obstructions and nervous disorders should try the effects of some mechanical or domestic work and particularly such as requires flexion of the body as that attitude tends in some measure to give motion to the stagnant fluids in the viscera but when this is the customary posture in peoples common occupation an alteration in that case is equally necessary as obstructions and other complaints may arise from and be much aggravated by daily contortion or stooping  ploughing and gardening are also very beneficial exercises for those who are in a cachectic nervous or valitudinary state as there can be no doubt but the fresh opened bosom of the prolific earth must very copiously diffuse salubrious exhalations  moderate dancing occasionally is a valuable kind of exercise to the powers of music and elevated festivity it unites the charms of refined sociability and attraction and inspires an animation which moves the system in a more pleasing and effectual manner and with happier effects than the other common exercises can boast  there are two prevailing errors in regard of exercise which i must remark people of relaxed delicate and nervous habits who should always avoid too much action at one time often hurt themselves by over exertion because they judge it advisable to take plenty of exercise there are others again who being confined within doors and leading a sedentary life think to compensate for the want of regular exercise by a hard ride or walk once a week but this is a mistaken notion the nerves of such people unaccustomed to bear so great a degree of agitation are overstrained and relaxed by it while the circulation of their fluids which is in general very slow and languid is thrown into disorder from the same cause and thus a foundation is laid for those very complaints which it was meant to prevent  hard labor and constant exertion evaporates the nervous power distends and relaxes the nerves and vessels unless when labor is habitual and then indeed it has a contrary effect upon the solids throws off the nutritious part of the blood and thereby wastes and weakens the system  in all cases whatever let this be an invariable rule that real weariness and fatigue should mark the precise limits of every species of exercise and labor  cleanliness is accompanied with as much utility as comfort and should therefore be practiced as far as circumstances will admit by every one it is a matter of no small importance to keep the skin clear and clean both because it is the most copious excretory passage of the whole body for the superfluous diathesis of the blood and also on account of its being a fine sensible nervous expansion holding a high degree of sympathy with all the principal organs of the system hence the skin is the principal drain whereby the circulation maintains an equal distribution and the nervous system preserves its equilibrium  the feet should be particularly attended to the bathing of them in warm water helps to relieve the headache all sorts of colics and nephritic pains and is serviceable in fevers and recent colds  as to clothes it is always better especially in this climate to wear too many than too few emaciated people recovering from illness should have clothes made to fit close these would help to brace and restore them whereas their old loose clothes tend to keep them relaxed and at the same time admit too much air  it is really extraordinary that any person yet one may meet such every day either from vanity or ignorance should fall into a custom so repugnant to common sense and his own private feelings as that of girding the neck till the eyes start or of wearing apparel so very tight and fashionable that he can neither bend walk breathe nor speak  heat relaxes the nerves and solids and rarifies and volatilizes the fluids it also generates bile and prepares the body for fluxes intermittent putrid and epidemic fevers  those who are much exposed to strong fires or to intense heat of any kind should wear coarse linen or cotton next the skin should shift often and wash the face and hands with cold water and a little common salt dissolved in it twice a day  in the heat of summer a moderate portion of wine or spirits is quite necessary both to supply the consumption occasioned by the increase of perspiration and to recruit the exhausted strength and also to sharpen the greater quantities of diluting liquors which thirst naturally requires therefore one way with another there ought to be consumed nearly as much strong liquor in the summer as in the winter season  cold gives tension or firmness to the fibers condenses the fluids compacts the texture of the blood and predisposes to inflammatory diseases  warm clothes motion and sufficient nourishment are the most proper and effectual preservatives against excessive cold and nothing is more preposterous or more dangerous than the use of too much spirituous liquors in cold severe weather  there is hardly any thing more common than to hear people express their surprise at having got cold because they are altogether at a loss to account for the cause of it they are not ignorant that damp air wet clothes the drinking cold liquors when the body is very hot or too warm liquors when it is cold and such like are the chief causes but do not consider that all sudden transitions from one temperature and one extreme to another are equally conducive to the same effect though the circumstances of it may not be so obvious to them  colds bring on fevers inflammations of the throat and lungs pleurisies consumptions rheumatisms colics diarrhoeas piles palsy etc and are often so serious in their consequences that no body should venture to trifle with colds even in a slight degree  in severe recent colds that affect the breast bleeding should be almost invariably resorted to and the perspiration restored by every means except such as are of too heating a nature in colds which attack the head the regimen ought not be too low least the complaint should descend upon the lungs  to wear soft flannel next the skin cannot be too strongly recommended to those who labor under any affection of the lungs or weakness of the bowels the same expedient will be found serviceable in the rheumatism and in all scorbutic dropsical hypocondriac and melancholic complaints  in each of the above cases strong friction upon the skin especially the region of the stomach and bowels and along the spine may be employed with considerable effect  the custom of seabathing and of drinking the mineral waters on every occasion derives more support i doubt from the powerful sanction of fashion than from any decided testimony of their being always salutary and efficacious  this much i may venture to say that they should be either seldom recurred to or administered with much discretion many of the mineral waters are impregnated with very active ingredients and by too frequent use impair and wear out the constitution and coldbathing is inimical to the lungs and in many instances has paved the way for bilious complaints and obstructions of the viscera  to dip regularly in cold water in infancy is highly proper it checks redundant growth strengthens the soft fibers and confirms the stamina  sound sleep continued for seven or eight hours is in general quite sufficient for the purpose of restoration yet female and delicate constitutions require rather more  too much sleep weakens the nerves renders the temper peevish and predisposes to apoplexy and palsy it likewise creates a lethargic and indolent disposition disqualifies for action and blunts the energy both of the intellectual and corporeal faculties on the other hand nothing can be more pernicious than the loss of sleep and want of due rest watching by exciting an artificial fever and by stimulating the nervous system when its powers are already exhausted effectually wastes the strength debilitates the body and lays it open to every attack especially to nervous and phrenitic fevers  the duration of sleep must be proportioned rather to the nature of the constitution than to the degree of exercise or labor in lax and tender habits the natural motion and attrition in the system exhaust and dissipate the vital strength much sooner than in those constiutions which are hardy and robust consequently the former require longer sleep to repair the waste and consumption than what is necessary for the latter besides in those who have much exercise or labor the powers of circulation being more complete and the sleep more mature the business of nature is sooner performed  a life of labor and constant action is commonly accompanied with vigor and good spirits but it must be considered that from the same cause the fibers grow rigid and the fine tubes become impervious and unfit for motion and circulation in a shorter space of time hence the period of existence is shortened and yet the same existence deprived of the salutary effects of continued exercise might have been prematurely terminated by the invasion of some disease generated from ease indolence or retirement  study or intense thought of any kind especially if fixed on some individual and interesting object very speedily consumes the nervous power within the brain while the rest of the system is destitute of its influence and therefore requires as long and indeed longer sleep to recruit the strength and replenish the spirits than hard labor does  i have noticed that animals of the opposite gender thrive better when they rest or sleep near each other than those of the same gender do i shall not make any application but only say that whatever that circumstance may be owing to it is surely better to sleep alone than with an unhealthy and disagreeable companion  heavy suppers much reading study or any considerable agitation or application of mind near the hour of going to bed all tend to prevent sound sleep and to occasion dreams the drinking of tea coffee or any other thin weak liquor will also retard sleep  sound sleep properly speaking is that state of perfect quiet in the mind which does not admit or rather is not accompanied with any perception whatever  dreams therefore may be termed a kind of half sleep and may be occasioned by any irritation that excites the smallest degree of motion in the system beyond that point of tranquillity which constitutes real or sound sleep if there be any such thing as preternatural dreams i confess myself entirely unable to account for them  fullness and flatulency in the stomach together with lying on the back in persons of relaxed nerves are the causes of the nightmare those accordingly who are troubled with this unwelcome guest should strengthen the nervous system lie upon the side and drink a glass of wine or strong spirits and water going to bed  an appetite for food or nourishment is an almost infallible sign of health but if the digestion be not at the same time regular and perfect it is a false appetite arising either from some preternatural stimulus or from luxurious living hence the stomach craves more than is necessary the simplicity of food has numerous advocates and there is no doubt but the more variety the stomach is accustomed to the more dainties and perhaps the larger quantities are needful the manner of living should therefore be regulated from the earliest period the children of poor people who are likely to live hard should from the first be accustomed to plain and substantial food and seldom allowed many rarities they should learn to take whatever is offered them to prevent their stomachs from being too nice but nothing to which they seem to have a fixed dislike should be forced upon them it is as dangerous as it is unnatural  the practice of cramming children with materials of every kind countenanced by some gentlemen of the faculty with a view to strengthen and corroborate their stomachs is too absurd in my opinion to challenge animadversion such treatment must load them with noxious and superfluous humors train them up for epicureans and by over distension of the stomach and pressure upon the lungs and the adjacent bowels it cannot but sow the seeds of a multiplicity of disorders particularly of the nervous kind it must also contribute to weaken their intellects and incur the future danger of apoplectic epileptic and paralytic attacks  gormandizing or immoderate eating in grown people is productive of similar consequences consequences proportionably more immediate and destructive as the effects of repletion in maturity are always more violent and fatal than in infancy  those who eat plentifully should drink liberally too as that will promote the digestion and accelerate chylification and exretion  sleep may in some measure supply the place of food and strong liquor compensate for a cnty meal but the last alternative is by far the worst it is a substitute that should on no account be employed especially as it always does most mischief when the stomach is most empty  the intemperate use of spirituous liquors maintains a continual fever destroys the tone of the nerves and solids and at length makes them callous it inflames the blood carries it through the lungs and toward the brain with great rapidity ruptures the mouths of the small vessels indurates the viscera or bowels and erodes the kidneys hence a train of complicated maladies too tedious to describe or enumerate  if liquor be recurred to with a view to keep up the spirits it soon evaporates with the increased flow occasioned by it if it be used to relieve anxiety of mind the transient serenity is quickly succeeded by a still deeper gloom and if it be admitted to exhilarate the social hour of convivial enjoyment moderation should always fill the cup and not suffer one to affront his friend destroy his health or stupify his senses  animal food is certainly too freely used in this country the usual proportion stimulates too much gives a dense or a putrescent crasis to the blood according as the habit is strong or weak and induces acrimony and thus it ultimately propagates the causes of obstructions of putrid and nervous diseases it generates bile is the leading cause of the scurvy and fosters the gout and rheumatism at the same time it must be admitted that the state of the air is such in england as demands a diet rather warm and stimulating to counteract the moist relaxing quality of it  low and abstemious living and a thin watery vegetable diet robs the body of competent nourishment unbraces the stomach and nerves dissolves the blood diminishes the action of the vessels and reduces the system below the standard of health hence a predisposition to all the diseases which arise from debility and relaxation yet a very slender diet if the habit has been accustomed to such will preserve the balance give spirits and vivacity and supply all the springs of health in short it is quantity rather than quality that replenishes the waste and affords the true nutrition of animal life simple food in sufficient quantity digests circulates and repairs gradually smoothly and with certainty whereas the rich high seasoned repast occasions perturbation heat and excitement and thus very frequently dissipates and carries off by the different discharges a considerable portion of nutritious juices and leaves the body weak enervated and collapsed instead of nourishing and recruiting the system by its own addition hence it is that high living demands luxury to screw up the nerves to their usual pitch and hence it is also that being overstrained they soon wear out and break  a diet consisting chiefly of milk and vegetables has been found in several instances to renovate the constitution remove sterility and eradicate some of the most obstinate chronic complaints  regimen i am convinced can produce the most salutary effects but it needs particular skill to direct it a patient in passing from a higher to a lower or from a lower to a higher regimen must be carried step by step as circumstances will admit with great circumspection  tea and coffee have long been subjects of reprobation with the faculty but i am apprehensive that these articles of living have been too rashly condemned without proper investigation or good grounds i look upon them rather as medicinal than dietetic and would therefore advise to use them sparingly  coffee is a warm stimulating cordial and increases all the secretions  tea seems in general to be rather irritating on an empty stomach but is very suitable at a proper interval after dinner it then dilutes assists digestion quenches thirst and exhilarates the spirits   porter fortunately for this metropolis is a good nutritious wholesome liquor yet i doubt there is something of a narcotic quality added to it which ought not to be it requires exercise and should not i think be drank too new it is doubtless more perfect and more digestible when moderately stale  the excessive use of tobacco in whatever manner it may be exhibited heats the blood hurts digestion wastes the finer part of the fluids and relaxes the nerves it is most beneficial to people of gross and corpulent habits who have but little exercise and breathe foul air  nothing can be more ridiculous or more pernicious than the practice of eating and drinking things very hot it spoils the teeth brings on the toothache weakens the head and eyes ruins the stomach and does abundance of mischief  it is at all times hurtful to fast too long but more particularly in the morning it admits a redundancy of air into the stomach and the whole body suffers by it  it would be better in my opinion if breakfast were to become a more solid refreshment than it is in this country an addition would afford a more durable support through the fatiguing part of the day and whether it were to supersede the custom of a luncheon or not an equivalent deduction would be very properly subtracted from dinner which is generally more plentiful than it ought to be among those who are not limited by economy  supper should be light and proportionable to the degree of exercise that is to succeed the quantity of supper ought just to be sufficient to replenish the waste which the different functions necessarily make if any more be received into the stomach too great a portion of the nervous power is determined to that organ and expended there in the work of digestion while at the same time the superfluity continues to excite an unseasonable stimulus in the system which should remain as much as possible in a quiescent state during sleep and leaves an unnecessary quantity of materials in the stomach next morning which ought then to be nearly empty and to contain little more besides the gastric or common liquor of the stomach  water as being a vehicle particularly connected with all the departments of nourishment deserves proper attention pure cold water acts as a tonic or corroborant internally in the stomach as well as applied externally it passes off gently by the different excretions it dilutes the saline and corrects the bilious part of the blood bad water must be inimical to health according to the manner and degree in which it happens to be impregnated with heterogenous matter snow water and water that freezes most readily into ice are found to be the purest of all the next in purity is rain water which falls in moderate weather and then river water which runs with a brisk current spring water in passing through the strata of the earth often imbibes mineral and other ingredients and accordingly becomes more objectionable nevertheless it is commonly and very properly used because it is more readily obtained in a pure state than any of the former generally are the purest water is that which has neither taste color nor smell that which is lightest and most limpid that which easily lathers with soap and that which does not effervesce or bubble nor form any sediment when good vinegar or spirits of sal ammoniac is put into it the most certain method of purifying water is by distillation and the most commodious and easy is by boiling the influence of fire destroys animalculae and by diffusing the component parts of water it affords an opportunity for the fixed air and the too volatile particles to evaporate and by the same means decomposes the combinations so that the earthy and foreign ingredients fall to the bottom filtration the mixture of chalk or sand exposure to the open air and allowing it due time to settle are individually conducive toward the purification of water  the influence of the moon in her different phases upon the earth is a matter well known and authentic observations seem to confirm the opinion that commotions in the animal system and the attack of febrile epileptic and other diseases as well as periodical alterations are in a certain degree coincident with the returns of the new and full moon for my own part although i have no doubt about the certainty of this doctrine yet my own observations have not been so accurate on this point as to establish any invariable rules which i could presume to offer as a guide  a pendulum of any kind suspended in such a manner as to receive no other motion except that conveyed to it by the pulsation of some of the large arteries of a person in health makes a certain number of stronger vibrations than ordinary corresponding to the hour of the day if the position be true which i have often proved by resting the right arm over a cup or common beer glass holding one end of a piece of thread between the thumb and finger with a ring or such like fastened to the other end which reached toward the center of the cavity the inference must be that there is a certain number of extraordinary pulsations in the arterial system within the space of every hour varying with the suns distance from the meridian this experiment i only mention as deserving further investigation as it might lead to the discovery of those periods when the paroxysms of fevers etc may be expected and thus ascertain the most proper time for the exhibition of medicines  i have known in instances where music afforded effectual relief in the most violent pain and believe that its powers might be so managed as to be serviceable in some acute and nervous cases  no virulent infectious or contagious disease can possibly be communicated but by means of some of the morbific particles coming in contact with and finding admission into the body which must also be at the same time in a state adapted for the reception and nourishment or assimulation of the invading particles  therefore the general plan of defense against every species of infection must be to avoid the contact of its effluvia or to repel and dissipate them when in contact  in the lues venerea and itch where the infectious matter is palpably deposited washing and cleansing the parts will often destroy the infection  in all infectious diseases such as the small pox measles putrid pestilential and epidemic fevers the air is the medidium except when they are communicated by means of infected clothes and such like and consequently the skin and the internal surface of the mouth nose lungs and stomach are the points of contact and all these parts have pores of admission  the best method then in these cases will be to chew aromatic and pungent substances in the mouth to impregnate the ambient air with volatile and correcting particles and to brace the stomach with such things as are stimulating and antisceptic  almost every year and often at different seasons of the same year there happen prevailing fevers which are very perplexing to the relatives of such as labor under them the natural duties of humanity constrain their attendance their appre hensions of danger to themselves and families excite their solicitude and the answers given by the attending faculty to their anxious enquiries whether or not the disease be infectious are seldom satisfactory and perhaps not always quite judicious  let me then in regard of this matter observe in few words that almost all the fevers that occur between the months of april and november if they do not proceed from what is termed catching cold if they be not regular intermittent if they seem different from any of the known class of common fevers and if they be attended with peculiar symptoms such as an extraordinary quick pulse extreme debility excessive sickness at stomach violent pain in the head sleepiness deafness and delirium if circumstances and appearances be such i say there is too much reason to believe that the fevers in question are more or less of an infectious and epidemic kind indeed it is to be remembered that morbid effluvium of any sort whether infectious or not when it comes in contact frequently and in considerable quantities always carries danger with it it has a procreative power or power of generating something similar to itself no wonder then that those who are much exposed to the breath and perspiration of diseased persons should lose their health neither is it strange that those fevers which have just been described should spread gradually from one individual and from one family to another  besides the principal causes already enumerated there are many others which affect health and occasion diseases all the different situations and employments in life especially of the mechanical kind are more or less productive of diseases peculiar to the nature and circumstances of each but as the discussion of these would exceed my plan and perhaps be more tedious than desirable i shall satisfy myself with adding some promiscuous observations on the animal economy  the laxity of the fibers and the quickness of the circulation in children render them extremely susceptible of irritation and disorder from whatever is heating or stimulating the chief business therefore must be to keep them cool and easy they should undergo those especially who are weak or ricketty the coldbath be exposed to the open air and live upon a light cool diet how pernicious then must it be to habituate them to spirituous liquors which is too frequently offered to children and to pamper them with whatever their fancy prompts them to ask  the first impression on the human system in all cases has the greatest effect and the more it has been accustomed to impressions of every kind the less liable will it be to agitation and disorder in future the advantage then of carrying children through the smallpox measles and all the other infectious and endemical diseases which await them as early as possible cannot but appear evident they undergo these complaints with less danger before their fluids are contaminated and also become less subject to the attack of other accidental disorders in consequence of their habit being rather meliorated and their constitution in some measure confirmed by emorbification or the abatement of morbid tendency  if the first juvenile sensations be so impressive of what infinite importance must not prudent and judicious management be toward forming the temper inspiring the genius bending the propensities and directing the tender impulsive movements during the soft flexible period of dawning years it is true the miniature of the frame is modelled by the process of nature and receives the texture lines and proportion which particularize it from the same original hand this basis or ground work it must ever be impossible to alter with regard to its first principles of structure and organization nevertheless the ductile fibers are easily capable of inflexion and modulation therefore the brightest springs of the system may be moved cherished and augmented and also the exuberancy and disproportion of parts suppressed fashioned and amended i do not conceive that the rudiments of a fool can be refined into the luster of a philosopher nor that the natural endowments of parts and abilities can be debased and adulterated down to the level of the most common materials or the meanest capacity but i am very certain that much good or harm may be done to the tender plant of human life when it first begins to vegetate  in the same path of investigation may be traced the laws of physiognomy so far as they concord with solid reason and the test of physical knowledge  it is sufficiently evident to common understanding that the shape of the head of indeed every animal corresponds with the nature of the intellect hence it must follow that a certain conformation proportion or extension of parts or lines as well as texture and principles is indispensibly requisite for the performance of the faculty of perception and the several progressive and combined operations that arise from it for the same reason it is that a square or angular form of the brain will not answer the purpose and that a circular or globular figure is consequently necessary the face and head are the principal physiognomical parts as they immediately show the true mould and measure which circumscribe the prime movement or the brain  a flat face or features most probably will not admit or carry on a motion in the mind competently full and distinct this therefore may be the indication of deficiency or weakness of intellect pointed prominent and acute lines may no doubt portend excess depth and narrowness of intellectual motion accordingly ferocity and obstinacy may result from the former cunning and sagacity from the next and malevolence and peevishness from the latter  elevation of lines may bespeak pride and irascibility and depression may intimate inequality or fickleness of temper protuberance of lines i would also hope may indicate an extent of talents and depth of judgment as well as strength of impulse and propensity  it is further obvious enough that the faculties of the mind cannot possess a full perfection and congruity of powers unless there be a concomitant proportion and symmetry in the corporal organs therefore any great inequality or irregularity of external parts must in some measure diminish the uniformity and harmony of the whole it must cramp and confine the concordance of motion if the disparity of parts be defective and render the movement awkward and ungraceful if the disparity be superfluous  there is also observed a conformity and alliance between different parts of the body considerably distant from one another consequently the different parts must originally be proportioned to each other and likewise to the whole but it is charitable to believe at the same time that a happy internal compages may sometimes take place and counterbalance the disadvantages of unfavourable outward signs  nevertheless all these congruities and disparities must often be variable and fallacious if it were for no other reason but because magnitude and energy are not always though generally correspondent  thus physiognomical relation may be marked and carried to a considerable extent with tolerable precision but if one fancy be built upon another which has nothing better than fancy to support it the airy phantom may be raised to a prodigious height and the bubble suspended till at last it burst invisible in the romantic wilds of metaphysical delusion  the female constitution being of a more delicate conformation and having a finer texture of nerves than the other sex gives women a quickness of sensibility and great promptitude of expression it softens their manners refines their ideas and produces a lively sensation of pleasure and pain but while they enjoy these advantages and are deservedly objects of affection and esteem the softness and peculiar construction of their frame subject them to many painful and critical vicissitudes which as they affect both their health and temper fully entitle them to all possible lenity and indulgence  when the important period of menstruation arrives much depends upon proper management a sedentary life restraint and confinement about that time are very unfavourable while moderate exercise the open air cheerful society and indulgence are highly requisite hard work and exposure to much cold and to damp air are too dangerous to be hazarded even among the poorest people  equal care and similar means must be employed toward that critical time of life when the tide of circulation begins to ebb the more slowly and gradually this salutary evacuation is diminished the less is the constitution exposed to disorder on its final termination it is therefore always advisable unless it be in some relaxed habits where the discharge has been too copious to take due pains and proper steps to prolong its continuance and thus secure the system from the bad consequences of an abrupt and hasty departure  it is a just observation that those who grow up very fast are generally sickly and seldom live to a great age the prime of their life draws very soon toward the verge of declension which stage like their youth is equally rapid in its progress the case is this quick growth draws out and elongates the fibers and vessels to a greater extension than the gradual increase of the vital powers can nourish and support hence the constitution becomes weakly and relaxed this error in the procedure of nature should be remedied if practicable by the cold bath and tonic medicines  the premature indulgence of amorous desires in the early bloom of youth is productive of the most ruinous consequences at this period the mind grows warm and well adapted to imbibe a proper fund and connection of ideas through the favorable disposition of the nerves and the body begins to germinate and gather firmness and vigor from the maturation of its juices especially those of the glands which now unfold and afford a repository for the lymphatic and nutritious part of the fluids to answer the emergencies of nature but the unseasonable pursuit of unripe enjoyment blasts these promising fruits draws off health and genius from the system through the channel of pleasure and inevitably shortens life  when the constitution approaches its zenith or confirmed state if the social impulse occasion disorder and reject control its effects are too important to be neglected as they often have the greatest influence upon the whole frame an exquisite sensibility in the nervous system united with sufficient powers in the circulation on the one hand and a full and cold phlegmatic constitution on the other are the two extremes of temperament which particularly require indulgence the former in order to diminish that plenitude and irritation which if not removed might produce frenzy fevers inflammations etc and the latter on purpose to create that excitement and action in the nerves and vessels which are necessary to prevent obstructions consumptions hypocondria etc  continued celibacy generally loads the glands retards the circulation and occasions fullness and stagnation in the vessels in this state the mind unexpanded by the soft fire of mutual rapture often becomes gloomy selfish and contracted and all its faculties being confined within the narrow compass of ordinary gratifications are devoted to habits of parsimonious care and contemplative amusement  temperance is the best pledge for longevity nevertheless young people should by all means inure themselves to the hardships and asperities of life without some share of these to temper the lethargic effects of indolence the body sinks into a state of effeminacy and imbecility and the mind soon becomes as feeble and insignificant as the body  little irregularities may now and then be committed with impunity perhaps with benefit but frequent shocks of revelry and debauch overstrain the system indurate the solids block up the fine vital channels and hasten the approach of rigid old age  the animal machine from the nature of its organization possesses a power of regulating itself and is constantly exercising this power therefore all diseases if fully understood are curable in the beginning the most robust constitution cannot at all times be equally healthy but is rather in a state of continual variation and when the efforts of nature are inadequate to the purpose of regulation disorder in a corresponding degree must ensue nature then resists every species of disease and it is at those times when the nervous system is relaxed and exhausted by heat fatigue watching excess etc or irritated by any of the assons that the body is particularly susceptible of the cause of diseases fear and dread of any infectious distemper accordingly never fail to render a person more liable to receive it  in incipient as well as in confirmed diseases the calls of nature should be assiduously watched and regarded since her dictates and indications are hardly ever erroneous or improper whether they point to warmth coolness sleep excitement abstinence nourishment etc  any part of the system that is either naturally infirm or has suffered any kind of injury is always most liable to the invasion of disease and pain and should on that account be more particularly guarded and defended  the approach of all febrile diseases is marked with some extraordinary agitation in the system languor loss of strength flying pains hideous dreams etc indicate somewhat morbid acting on the nerves but if these be attended with nausea at the stomach chills and alternate glows or sweats some acute malady is much to be apprehended indeed chills except after meals and evacuations as they come by a constriction of the skin and a general spasm through the system from debility or irritation always import some degree of danger from these symptoms of acute diseases caution ought to take the alarm and as it is ever easier to prevent than cure it would be most advisable to arm and oppose their first advances  the habit is that state of body peculiar to each and according as it varies from the standard of health is in an equal measure subject to disease  a strong and full habit which is generally indicated by a full and hard pulse in which the quantity of blood and force of circulation are greater than ordinary though it has a tendency toward inflammatory complaints is still infinitely less dangerous than the opposite extreme where the habit is relaxed and all the vital powers languid and imperfect under such circumstances the body is open to all the train of nervous disorders to obstructions dropsy and scurvy and exposed to the attack of intermittent nervous bilious and putrid fevers and if there be a superfluous quantity of half stagnant in active fluids in the system at the same time the danger is in all respects augmented by it  a fat and gross habit is always nearly allied to disease the contrary or rather the middle temperament is by far the most healthy it shows that the offices of digestion circulation and secretion are regular and effective  if the common exercises of life the cold bath and moderate living will not prevent nor reduce corpulency it would be better to try the help of medicine than be obliged to carry about so unpleasant a burden as some people do  it may not be improper here to give a caution against frequent and unnecessary bloodletting as being a very absurd and pernicious practice some think it diminishes fatness but i must assure them it has the contrary effect and that corpulency is increased by it others imagine that it corrects bad humors but that is likewise impossible and many have recourse to it as sovereign remedy whenever they are any wise indisposed but they should remember that they are bringing themselves into a very bad habit a habit which wastes the vital fluid impoverishes the blood and debilitates the constitution  the force or power of habit is strikingly exhibited to such as accurately watch its influence i have observed it as an almost invariable rule that all perceptions whether of a pleasing or painful nature return pretty exactly at stated or equal intervals i mean that anxiety desire fancy levity and pensiveness as well as sleep hunger and the other common solicitations of nature make their approaches nearly about the same time that they have been usually gratified and indulged  now as the influence of such perceptions must operate on the mental faculties in the way of coincidence and recollection and on the corporal organs agreeable to the laws of the system it must follow that the surest method when resolution is inadequate to the task to subdue any habit or custom is to present new objects to the mind and provide different impressions for the body yet however proper this remedy may be it must be conducted with discretion for fear it should imperceptibly degenerate into a course of dissipation a most pitiable and unhappy course in which the restless mind warm in the pursuit of new gratification becomes intoxicated with pleasure and missing the path of rational enjoyment loses itself inextricable in a labyrinth of folly madness and vexation wisdom should ever prescribe bounds to desire and still keep some resource to satisfy the various wants of feeble old age if youth and maturity be spent in excess and dissipation if all the richest stores of human bliss be lavishly and prematurely exhausted and the constitution shatered in the wild career what new expedients can be devised what possible means can be found to prop the tottering fabric or cheer the dull winter of declining years  the regularity and proportion which is essential to health will not suffer much deviation in any respect from the track of established custom hence a diminution or alteration in any of the common and habitual evacuations secretions or even perceptions changes the equilibrium of the system and very materially affects the health and constitution  when disorder is the result of such circumstances the balance must be restored by promoting the excretions which are retarded or have ceased by inviting the defective circulation to the parts which it has deserted or toward the extremities in general by means of warmth friction exercise or fomentation and by renewing those sensations and incentives which the nerves stand in need of to increase their energy and to give free scope and previous impulse to their nice progressive motions  but when the customary evacuations and emotions cannot be exactly restored they should be substituted by others as similar in their nature and effects as possible  the nerves being the medium of communication between the different parts of the body those parts which possess the greatest nervosity or sensibility as the head lungs stomach womb and the skin have the closest connection and sympathy with each other  those therefore who labor under nervous and hysteric affections should carefully avoid whatever produces disagreeable impressions on the mind and every kind of irritation that may occasion unpleasant sensations on any of these susceptible organs and should particularly refrain from flatulent and indigestible food  intellectual sympathy is one of the most refined emotions of the human mind it originates in some striking congruity and mutual harmony and is excited by fine concording impressions made by some object which creates partiality and esteem and is only perfect when accompanied with an idea that the attractive impression is reciprocal this sympathetic endowment ever deserves cultivation and improvement it renders one capable of all the enjoyments of sincere friendship and can give and receive consolation in the hour of anxiety and of pain  antipathy proceeds from something that shocks the imagination or offends the senses and when this happens to take place in the tender years of infancy and the impression has been forcibly received the antipathy frequently continues through life such antipathies are extremely unpleasant and i should think might be corrected by gradually familiarizing the offending cause but if the antipathetic matter affect the sense of smell it will probably be more difficult to reconcile it  antipathy furnishes an exception to the general law of the system which it was stated did always receive secondary impressions with less effect than primary ones it is therefore necessary to remark that when anger terror violent fevers deep intoxication or any other cause have once thrown the system into vehement and excessive agitations whereby the nerves are irrecoverably strained the same or nearly the same cause in but a very small degree will produce similar effects in the highest degree and these effects will more easily take place in proportion to the frequency and repetition of the impelling cause from which consideration may be perceived the necessity of guarding against all violent shocks and of obviating their consequences as soon and effectually as possible children and people of weak nerves and delicate constitutions should be particularly careful in this respect  nervous and hysteric complaints fainting fits convulsions madness and such like frequently spring from this source and in time become fixed habitually or periodically  the same advice must also be extended to pregnant women whose imagination or passions when violently excited sometimes mark and injure the foetus there are so many incontrovertible proofs of this kind of influence that it is impossible to doubt the certainty of it which appears to me nowise questionable since i can see no difficulty to account for it in a clear and rational manner  imitation is a very operative faculty in the animal system it is a natural and spontaneous action whereby without volition or even consciousness one person imitates and resembles the motions gestures or perceptions of another silence singing coughing laughter speaking singing walking and credulity which communicate and pass from one person to another like electricity are obvious proofs that similitude or the imitative faculty is one of the primary leading motions in the human mind and bring no small evidence in confirmation of what has been already said on that subject  stammering and other bad habits and even convulsions may be contracted from this cause which consideration suggests a caution sufficient to induce people to pay due regard to such companions and objects as are suffered to have intercourse with children and persons in a weak nervous and irritable state  imagination is the exercise of primary perception or perception of the first forms and colors in which images strike the mind unaccompanied with and consequently unaltered by the deliberative or reasoning operations imagination therefore considers objects in the light they first appear which appearance does not always correspond with intrinsicness or reality though very frequently the first view of the mind is as accurate and comprehensive as several reviews or comparisons are when memory or uncompounded reflection represents images to the mind these images arise merely from the power of recollection which is only the operation of the first class of similitudes but images which proceed from judgment are fashioned with all the rays and shades of nice and minute analogy and these are often created without any assistance from memory hence versatility or quickness of imagination is often found to be a superficial quality and on a level only with the depth of memory but if a warm and teeming imagination be united with solidity of judgment and profound penetration it bespeaks the happiest and noblest composition of the human system  the mind is exceedingly susceptible of the two opposite perceptions hope and fear they are the quickborn offspring of imagination begotten by the idea of pleasure or pain whose familiarity and intimacy always afford them easy access to her embraces  it will then manifestly appear that the influence of imagination so far as regards the cause and cure of diseases is nothing but the effect of hope or fear but these effects have been already explained in treating of the passions it must therefore be obvious whence a healthy man may be frightened into a fever and a dying person in a manner quickened into life by the instillation and continuation of either of these influences upon the mind hence the effect of animal magnetism and of nostrums charms and enchantments in sometimes curing agues fits and other disorders which in truth have no value nor utility but what they derive from this source  volition or the will purpose or design is either intentional or actual that is design intended or design executed of which neither the one nor the other is instantaneous or immediately performed they require both of them several of the progressive operations of the mind for no man ever had an inclination or will to do an act before he had first reasoned upon it and considered the end or purport of such an act the mind cannot pssibly direct the nervous influence into the right arm in preference to the left except in the common and habitual motions of walking and gesticulation till it has first poised itself or deliberated and then it can give the voluntary impulse hence it is manifest beyond contradiction that every person of a sound state of body is absolutely a free agent and may either commit or not commit any particular act but still the exercise of common sense must be present in order to constitute criminality if a person err from passion it is madness if from ignorance or wrong ideas it is mistake both cases are entitled to alleviation and compassion and should be weighed in the scales of humanity with the fair balance of candor placed in the medium of excitement to ascertain the intrinsic quality and compute the true degree of right or wrong  finis
