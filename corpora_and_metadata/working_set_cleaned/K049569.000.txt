a new theory of continual fevers  wherein besides the appearances of such fevers and the method of their cure occasionally the structure of the glands and the manner of secretion the operation of purgative vomitive and mercurial medicines are mechanically explained   si propius stes te capiet magis horat de art poet london printed and sold by h newman at the grasshopper in the poultrey and j nutt near stationers hall   0   the preface to write any thing tolerable about fevers or any thing worse than what has already been advanced by some one or other on the head is perhaps no easy matter the ridiculous manner of accounting for their causes and symptoms used by some pretenders to medicine and philosophy has perhaps contributed in its way to that contempt to which with such expense of satyr and wit they and their art have been exposed  i have not the arrogance to think the few following sheets will conduce any thing to wipe it off but of this i am sure if this theory prove false the choices behind are fewer by one of the true kind which endeavors to account from their appearances from mechanic principles  the wiser part of mankind are now persuaded that this machine we carry about is nothing but an infinity of branching and winding canals filled with liquors of different natures and i am mightily out in my conjunctures if for the future any be heard about theories of diseases or the manner of the operation of medicines who do not reason from these data and their necessary consequences and seeing continual fevers are only a complication of symptoms which naturally follow upon a general obstruction of these canals or the glands which they constitute and the necessary effects thereof as i reckon none i hope will be angry i have called such a manner of accounting for them new seeing for any thing i know as to the main thereof it is really so  for the structure of the glands and the business of secretion the foundation is bellinis but i hope it has lost nothing in my hands i have added somethings extended others and made all plain and consequential  as to the other things here occasionally explained which adding what bellini had advanced about bloodletting make up the great and principal operations performed by medicines on animal bodies i have very frankly borrowed what of them i found for my purpose from borelli the foresaid bellini and another gentleman whom i reckon the ornament of his profession and our country but for the most part pointing at place and person and i shall reckon my self no more a plagiary for this than a lawyer is to be accounted one for quoting his code or pandects  the occasion of entering upon those thoughts was the noise and bustle has been made among us about vomiting in fevers about a year ago i endeavored to satisfy my self so as you may see and had the vanity to think there might be some as great fools as i if i be mistaken it is not the first time  i have not been over nice in ranging the particulars here contained those who read the whole will see their dependence and for others i was not at the pains to lay in  the language is that which most easily dropped from my pen at first writing the roughness of some terms of art i could not avoid and the purity of the english tongue is neither the growth of our country nor of my occasions if it be intelligible it is all and perhaps some may say more than i designed  i neither expect nor desire any reputation from these papers for i sufficiently know how few such things oblige besides i am dreadfully afraid few will read them and not over many understand them for want of the necessary qualifications of a moderate attention and a smattering of the mathematics the first is absolutely necessary but for the latter they may even have a strong faith tho both for them and my self i could wish it were joined with knowledge  as for censure i am in no great dread of it for i shall lie secure because concealed and see its adversaries if it have the honor to provoke any shoot at rovers if any shall take the pains to confute what i have here advanced he may do it very safely for his humble servant if he bungle it he will do me an honor by showing it is not such as every body is able to disprove if he do it to purpose he will do me a kindness by freeing me from my errors i design for the future to meddle no more with it than if it had dropped from the clouds  in fine all my present concern is for the bookseller if he bent a loser which misfortune would be the most effectual confutation it is indifferent to me whether it perish by a particular or the general conflagration  a new theory of continual fevers postulata   that the whole body is nothing but a congeries of canals the greatest at least a considerable part of which is glands properly so called designed for the separation of some fluid  this is evident when any part of the body is swelled so that the inconspicuous ones become visible and has been clearly demonstrated by malpigius leuvenhoeck and oothers    that when a machine is disordered if we should see it righted by adjusting such a particular part we might without scruple affirm that it was some injury done to that part which had disordered the machine especially if after the whole was taken to pieces we should find them all sound save that particular one  thus if we should see a watchmaker by adjusting only the balance of a watch make her go right we might say the distortion of the axe thereof had occasioned her going wrong especially if all the other parts be found as they should be  lemma   let there be a greater distractile cylindrical canal whose orifice is abcd through which a given quantity of liquor passes in a given time and a lesser one efgh through which a proportionable quantity of the same liquor passes with the same celerity as in the former let now the greater abcd be increased or diminished by the lesser efgh so as that in the increased or diminished cylindrical canals the same quantities only pass which passed in the same time in the first supposed canal abcd to find the quantity of the same fluid which will distract and produce the other effects of increasing the quantity of the passing fluid and consequently its celerity the canal by increasing it is diameter first supposed abcd after the same manner only that the increased abcdefgh or diminished abcdefgh canals are now distracted  let the quantity which in the first supposition passes through the canal abcd be called a and the quantity which passes through the canal efgh be called b since in the first supposition the celerities are the same in both their orifices will be as a and b respectively likewise the increased and diminished canals seeing their altitude is supposed the same will be as their orifices a b and ab and the quantities passing through them in the same time with the same celerity would be likewise as a b and a b but in the second supposition the same quantity is supposed to pass in the increased canal  a b and diminished one  a b which passd in the first supposed canal abc or  therefore now the quantities passing through the canals increased or diminished will be as a wherefore as a b the quantity passing through the increased or diminished canals in the first supposition is to a the quantity passing through them in the second supposition so is b the quantity passing through the lesser canal efgh in the first supposition to  the proportional quantity which passes through and will distract the lesser canal efgh after the same manner that the increased or diminished canals are distracted in the second position adding or substracting this quantity from a which is as the quantity passing through or distracting the increased or diminished canals the sum or difference  will be as the quantity which will distract the first supposed canal abcd after the same manner etc q e i  scholium  the whole canals of the body save the intestines and lacteals may be considered as a concave cylinder whose base is the orifice of the aorta at its exit from the heart and whose length is a mean arithmetic proportional betwixt the longest and shortest artery i mean the whole length of the artery till it degenerat into a vein for the length of the veins are of no consideration here it being their splitting into branches which makes them not cylindrical now by postul   the vessels which make up the glands may have any proportion of minority to the whole of the canals supposing then an obstruction or dilatation of the glandular vessels it is evident the foresaid concave cylinder will be thereby diminished or encreasd in any given proportion suppose e g the diameter of the cylinder so obstructed is to that of the whole as  is to the    their orifices will be as   to   suppose again there are twenty pounds of blood in a man seeing at the beginning of the arterial vessels which constitute the glands the velocity is near the same as proceeding from the same cause the compression of the heart therefore divide  0 into two parts which may be in this case as   is to   which done by this general rule x y putting d for the  0 pounds x for the greater and y for the lesser proportional part m to n their ratio the parts will be here   and    which are the proportional parts of  0 pounds of blood which would naturaly pass in the obstructcanal and in the remainder thereof which is passable but if all the  0 pounds must now pass in the passable canals then it shall be distracted as much as if the whole canals were passable but that  0 pounds of blood were forced through it in the same time by the preceding lemma for in this case a 0 b  a l   and therefore  0 if the orifices were as   to   then b  a b   and    this supposing an obstruction if there be a dilatation supposed in the same proportions then  will be in the first case    in the second    the same may be applied to the liquidum nervorum which passes in the nervous canals for the gland consists of a complicated nerve as well as artery and in an obstruction or dilatation of the same both artery and nerve are supposed to be obstructed or dilated  the design of all this is to show that in an obstruction or dilatation of the vessels it is the same thing as if the liquors therein contained were augmented or diminished in a certain proportion as in the case of the bloodvessels supposing  0 pounds of blood which is the ordinary quantity in a man and supposing one half of the whole by an obstruction in any place of the said vessels were rendered impassable it is the same thing quam proxime as if the whole blood vessels were passable but that one half more of blood were forced through them in the same time in which the  0 pounds passed of the same nature is  lemma   the blood being so corrupted that the strength is impaired or increased it is the same thing as if it were in its natural estate but that the quantity thereof were diminished or increased in such a proportion as is necessary for producing this increase or decrease of strength  this is    th prop of bellinis book de motu cordis etc and its converse the proposition it self is there demonstrated and its converse may be demonstrated after the same manner exactly  what is here said of increasing or diminishing the strength is likewise true of all the necessary effects of lessening or increasing the quantity of the blood these things premised i come to  the general proposition the general and most effectual cause of all fevers is the obstruction or dilatation of the complicated nerve and artery the excretory duct and conservatory one or rather all these which as shall be afterward shown make up the glands and they receive their denomination as these or those glands are more or less obstructed or dilated  other things may concur but these are the most powerful causes  it were a work of more time and pains than i can at present bestow to apply this proposition to all particular kinds of fevers though i am sufficiently satisfied it will account for all i shall here only as an earnest of the rest show how to apply it to continual fevers and therefore contract the general into  the particular proposition the most effectual cause of continual fevers is an obstrution of the glands which will necessarily augment the quantity of the blood and liquidum nervorum in the passable canals and perhaps by the stagnation of the fluids contained in these so vitiate their nature as that they may be reckoned to concur as a partial cause of these fevers but i rely most on the first to wit the augmentation of these fluids for a demonstration of this i shall first show how it accounts for all the appearances of such fevers and then subjoyn several arguments to confirm the same  supposing the glands obstructed the quantity of the blood in the arteries and the liquidum nervorum in the nerves may thereby be supposed augmented in any given proportion of minority to the whole mass of these liquors per lemma   and its scholium wherefore it will hence follow    that the pulses must be stronger and more frequent than ordinary upon these accounts  seeing there is a greater quantity than ordinary of blood in the arteries the lateral pression will be stronger and seeing the arteries are distractile they will be driven outward with greater force and make a stronger ictus upon any thing applied to them   seeing the quantity of the blood is augmented i e the quantity of the matter whence the liquidum nervorum is generated there must be a greater plenty thereof  per poster part lemm   generated and consequently it will flow more plentifully and more quickly into the heart and make it contract oftener and more violently   by the obstruction of the gland the influence of the liquidum nervorum thereinto is likewise obstructed and therefore per lemm   there will be a greater quantity thereof left to flow in the passable nerves and it must flow qua data porta   lastly the arteries on every siderunning upon and touching the medullar substance and fiber of the brain will they being more than ordinarily distended press them more than ordinarily and make a more powerful and plentiful derivation of the liquidum nervorum into the places whither it can flow    from the same cause the inequality or interruption of the puises is evident for if the foresaid pressions upon the nervous fibers of the brain be so strong that it either partly or totally occludes the passage of the liquidum nervorum there must be a stop in the derivation till there be such a quantity thereof collected as shall be sufficient to overpower the impedimentum occasioned by this pression and so make an inequality or stop in the contraction of the heart moreover when the blood flows in such plenty and with such violence from the auricles into the ventricles of the heart it may force it is way before the ventricle be entirely contracted and thereby cause an irregularity in the pulse add to these what may proceed from the thickness of the blood it being contracted into a less space and evaporation of its humidity all these either singly or compounded will account for the irregularities of the pulses which have hitherto been observed    great pains in the head must ensue from the violent distractions of the tender vessels of the brain and from the great pressure of the extended arteries upon the fibers and membranes thereof all the canals of every kind being bowldned with their respective liquors and that being the most sensible place    a violent and burning heat must be felt upon these accounts   because there is a greater quantity than ordinary running in the passable canals there must be a greater motion than ordinary and consequently a greater heat   merely upon the account of the increased quantity without considering the thereby produced greater velocity there must be felt a greater heat for supposing the heat in each single particle to be the same as before yet since the particles are more numerous in the same place the heat must be greater there too as in rays contracted by a concave speculum   the glands being obstructed i e the passages of perspiration the natural heat must thereby be kept in and consequently the whole augmented per lemm   hence proceeds our unquenchable thirst the humidity  i e the thinnest parts being more ready to evaporate since now the ordinary passages are obstructed the rest must be proportionally dryer    the difficulty and frequency of respiration and the violence of expiration is hence easily accounted for the quantity of blood being augmented there must a proportional greater quantity thereof be derived into the arteries of the lungs and since every one of the little vesicles of the bronchi lie betwixt two arteries thus inflated it will be harder to explicate these vesicles and therefore one in such a state will naturally with all his force endeavor to suck in the air which will be forced out again both by these inflated arteries and by the force of the muscles of the breast diaphragm and lungs which is vastly augmented both by the greater quantity of blood and of the liquidum nervorum and its more plentiful derivation as has been shown in   about the frequency and strength of the pulses    the tongue is rough and discolored because by the violent motion of the blood and the obstruction of the common passages the humidity is evaporated and the extraordinary heat stiffens the fibers thereof for it is evident that only heat and dryness discolor the tongue vide      want of sleep must follow both because there is such plenty of blood and consequently of the liquidum nervorum as is shown   that there is no need of sleep to generate more which is one principal use thereof and because of diverse disorders of the head accounted for   which will not allow that tranquillity which is necessary to bring it on but most of all because by the plenty of the liquidum nervorum all the muscles both involuntary and voluntary especially those who want antagonists are in continual violent motions which must necessarily hinder sleep    ravings proceed from the disorders in the head accounted for   the nerves being distracted by the abundance of their liquor the heat and dryness of their parts cannot perform these reciprocations which are necessary in sound persons    the clear and flamecolourd urine proceeds from the velocity of the blood which seperates thereby only the thinest of the mixed fluid as shall be shown when we come to speak about secretion   0 the vast increase of strength in persons laboring under high fevers is evident from lemm       lastly the ceasing and dissolution of fevers by purging sweating vomiting and abscesses is wonderfully accounted for from this theory for if they go off by the strength of nature then seeing the greater quantity and velocity of the blood produce a greater momentum by the frequent concussions and force of this the obstructions are shattered and washed away till the last strokes carry away all together and thereby go off in these or those according as these or those glands were most obstructed this will be better understood when we come to speak of mercurial medicines if by the assistance of medicines then the medicines must be such as are most proper for removing these obstructions as shall be afterward shown    thus i think i have accounted for all the appearances of continual fevers which i reckon one considerable argument for our theory    all we see done in the dissolution or ceasing of such fevers is the opening the glands the driving out the stagnated fluids therein contained which per postul   is another argument and indeed one would hardly keep himself from thinking that if the removing these obstructions removed the disease then the putting them caused it quo posito ponitur and quo sublato tollitur    all that is observable upon opening persons cut off by fevers is the rest being sound and entire an extraordinary swelling and lividity in the internal glands particularly of the lungs the liver the spleen and the mesentery as has been observed by borelli and others vide borelli de motu animal part   prop     this is one ocular demonstration of our theory and if the other glands were as conspicuous i doubt not we should see the same in them    a fourth argument for our theory is from what dr pitoairne has demonstrated in his treatise of the cure of fevers for since in fevers the glands are obstructed i e the conduits of insensible perspiration then by removing this obstruction i e by increasing the insensible perspiration fevers will be more probably cured than by increasing all the sensible evacuations and that in the proportion the number of the glands of the whole body has to the number of the glands of the primae viae or as the whole outward and inward surfaces have to the surfaces of the primae viae proxime    a fifth argument is from what bellini has demonstrated in his third and last prop in his section de febribus he there shows continued fevers may arise from a vitiation in the quantity quality or motion of the blood from all or either of these moreover from an increase or diminution of the quantity of the blood there will necessarly arise an augmentation or diminution of its velocity the motion depends upon the quantity multiplied iuto the velocity and the quality arises for the most part from a combination or the necessary effects of these hence you see all that necessarily follows upon the whole three may be accounted for from the first of these to wit the encreass or diminution of the quantity of the blood    amputations wounds fractures and the like wonderfully confirm this doctrine for there a considerable number of the bloodvessels are stopped and cannot make their circle and consequently increase the quantity of blood in the rest so that generaly fevers ensue if the quantity be not lessened by letting it is true the violent pain may concur since all pain is a stimulus and all stimulations occasion a more plentiful derivation of the liquidum nervorum but if the quantity of blood be not supposed to be augmented that liquor must necessarily fail in a short time    we may see visibly in fevers from cold there is a violent obstruction of the glands of the skin the mouth larynx stomach in a word of all these glands to which the cold air is contiguous and we can tell whence this obstruction proceeds besides this fever may be increased to such a degree as to differ little in its symptoms violence or duration from other more dangerous continual fevers which is a clear demonstration of our doctrine for since an evident obstruction of the glands produces fevers so very like the most dangerous ones why may we not conclude that some latent and unknown cause may produce so general and strong an obstruction as is able to occasion all the several more dangerous fevers of this kind    but that which i take to be alone without any other proofs a demonstration of our theory is that in all conntrys betwixt the tropicks their continual or hot fevers arise from a severe cold wind suddenly blowing after excessive gleams of heat this is so true that all travelers assign this as the cause having constantly observed their fevers to succeed such sudden changes of the air a pregnant instance of which we have in phil trans for december      n     in a letter from mr hugh jones to dr woodroof concerning some observables in maryland his words are these the northwest wind is very sharp in winter and even in the heat of summer it mightily cools the air and too often at that time a sudden northwestern wind strikes our laborers into a fever when they are not caresul to provide for it and put on their garments while they are at work thus he and indeed the genuin account of the matter is this the excessive heat must necessarily dilate the glands to which it is contiguous i e all the cutaneous glands the glands of the trachea bronchi osophragus stomach and of the intetines and it will not only dilate them but by the assistance of the natural action of these which is secretion exhale their respective liquors making them still flow so long as the excessive heat continues and as there is blood which may supply them now they being thus dilated and by the efflux of their liquors softned and made spungy a sudden excessive cold supervening must strongly contract their orifices and congeal their owing liquors and the greatness of their contraction will be always in proportion to the violence of the former heat and supervening cold conjunctly as is known from the nature of cold and this contraction of their orifices and congelation of their fluids will obstruct the motion of the blood almost up to the heart at least to the next division of the artery which constitutes this gland whereby both the blood will be increased as to its quantity and perhaps by this stagnation of a part of the same as to the quality thereof likewise all which is but a corollary of our theory   0 hence we evidently see the reason of the frequency of our last years fevers for we were then exactly in proportion to our climats in the state of those betwixt the tropicks our summerday heats were more violent than had been observed among us in the memory of men and our nights had no ways the heat proportionate to our days besides we had often sudden changes which though not so violent as in these warmer countries yet had the same though a slower effect as among them and therefore it was that frequent vomitings were found so useful which at least in such a degree as was found then necessary is not always so safe the practice was entirely agreeable to that of these southern countries and the necessity thereof will be understood when we come to speak of vomiting the same practice obtains in fevers occasioned by surfeiting or drunkenness which is still to be suspected as a considerable part of the cause of fevers in adult persons in great cities  and generally i should think either the above mentioned sudden changes which may happen a thousand other ways different from the season or a direct continued fit of violent cold or excesses in eating or drinking one or all of these have a large share in most of our continal fevers     lastly it is no ways accountable from any other theory as i think how these liquors which are secreted from the glands at the dissolution of fevers could be so different from the ordinary fluids which are there excernd from ours it is evident for an obstruction of the glands must necessarily make their respective liquors to stagnate which will many ways alter their nature but from any other hypothesis i do not see how this can come to pass which will lead me to consider one or two of the commonest opinions about continual fevers  the most common and generally obtaining opinion about fevers is that they are more immediately produced by some morbifick matter like a poison which mixing and circulating with the mass of the blood produces all those frightful symtoms which we feel this opinion is sufficiently confuted prop               dae part of borellis book de mot animal whither i refer the reader only adding to what he has there adduced this one argument  when any corrupt matter is mixed with the blood so as to vitiate the whole mass as vinegar among water the way of curing such a vitiation is either by forming new glands to derive the vicious part of the mixture or by draining the whole mixture good and bad and substituting new pure blood in it is place or lastly by disposing the already formed glands to secern the corrupted part  the first of these is ridiculous  some thing like the second is done when the blood is really vitiate in the whole as inveterate poxes but that cure cannot here have a place as shall be afterward shown  as to the third way let us consider    how hard it is to think when the whole mass is supposed corrupted that the vicious part all at once or in the space of a few hours in which time we know after a crise fevers commonly leave people should be entirely evacuated this is not like the actions of nature which works leisurely and by degrees    let us consider whence all the glands at least the greater part of them should be so altered seeing their configurations are so different and naturally they secern so different liquors as all at one time to separate the same morbifick matter and    how at the crise only and at no other time they should be so disposed  it will be very hard in any other theory in this more particularly save ours to account for these things without recurring to miracles or the absurd metaphorick terms of sympathy antipathy and the like these then with what borelli has brought against this opinion in the forecited places are abundantly sufficient to show the ridiculousness thereof  but there are several physicians who observing that in fevers there was by a vomit a tough viscid matter thrown out of the stomach have thought this matter generated there and mixing with the mass of the blood might be a considerable part of the cause of fevers at least might considerably augment the same and have from thence brought arguments for the necessity of vomiting in fevers  this opinion supposes these things    that the quantity of the morbifick matter excernd by a vomit before the administration thereof was existent in the cavity of the stomach after the same manner that other things are which are derived into the mass of the blood else it could never get thither this i shall consider when i come to speak of the operation and effects of vomiting    that it is at least possible this morbifick matter may be derived into the mass of blood let us at present consider this  i know no way any thing of any tolerable consistence can get into the mass of the blood but by the lacteal veins it is true from the sudden effects of some spirits medicines and strong meats we are certain that the more refined parts of these may get into the brain without going the tedious circle of the lacteals but this is done by the reciprocal motion of the nerves the necessity and mechanical operation of which borelli has demonstrated prop           0   dae part de motu animalium however i think none will pretend such a course for this viscuous morbifick matter and therefore if it gets into the mass of the blood it must go the common road of the lacteals  to decide the matter i must suppose my reader to have considered the   last prop  ex ijs quae ad separationes which beilini has in his preface to his book de vrinis and pulsibus etc and the       and  0 of his last book de motu cordis etc where the construction of the glands and the manner of separations are demonstratively unfolded which i take to be the noblest discovery in these matters of this age from these places it is clear that  prop   a gland is nothing but a great many complications and circumvolutions of the artery all over the coats of which little branchings of nerves pass designed principally for the spiral contortion thereof that the blood may be the more easily propogated through the same but this is common to all the arteries and veins whereby without any interruption of the same spire the propagation of the blood in the former from the heart to the extremities of the body and from the extremities to the heart back again in the latter is assisted which sends out from the sides thereof little secretory canals which terminate in one common conduit and is called the emissary of the gland or perhaps in a common pelvis as in the kidneys and the same artery after these windings degenerates into a vein  prop   that separation or secretion is performed by the composition of two motions in the fluid one propagated through the length of the canal another transversly through its sides for it is demonstrable that all fluids press undiquaque and that the direction of their pression is perpendicular in every point to the sides of the containing vessel the composition of which two is the motion or rather direction of the separated fluid  prop   that in a mixed fluid consisting of greater and lesser cohesion of parts of greater and lesser fluidity that which has the least cohesion and greatest fluidity is first separated  i e is separated in the glands whose compounding artery is shortest or at least distance from the heart or fountain of motion and these of the next cohesion and next greatest fluidity is next separated and so on the distances from the heart being in a compounded proportion of these  prop   that the intestines are really such a gland and the most visible one in the body whose secretory vessels are the lacteals and whose common conservatory or pelvis is the recepaculum chyli  to these i shall add because of its affinity the following  prop   the quantity separated in every gland is in a compounded proportion of the celerity of the fluid at the respective orifices and of the orifices themselves of the separating canals  i shall here subjoyn the demonstration of this proposition referring that of the rest to their author  demonstration  the orifices being given the quantity separated is as the celerities of the fluid for in a greater celerity there is a greater quantity separated in a less celerity a lesser quantity the celerities being given the quantity separated is as the orifices directly for at a great orifice there is greater quantity separated at a less orifice a lesser quantity and therefore neither being given the quantity separated is as the celerities and the orifices conjuctly q e d  from all these i draw the following  corollaria    the separated fluids differ only in their degrees of cohesion and fluidity per prop      the reason why fluids of different degrees of cohesion and fluidity are separated in such and such glands is the different degrees of the velocity of the fluid at the respective orifices of the separating vessels and the differences of the orifices themselves per prop      the glands themselves differ only in the length of the artery the difference and number of its complications and convolutions per prop      each gland naturally and equally working separates only the fluid proper to it self i e peculiar to such lengths and complications of such degrees of fluidity or cohesion to such bigness or smallness of the orifices of the separating canals per prop   and   but this last is of small consideration    that secretion may be performed the most easily that may be the insertion of the separating canal ought to be at an angle of    degrees with the artery per prop   for let ab represent the artery if it make a right line or its tangent if it make a curve and let the motion of the fluid be from a to b the right line ab will likewise represent its direction propogated from the heart erect at a the perpendicular ac this will represent the direction of the lateral pression of the fluid complete the parallelogram abcd the direction of the composition of these two motions will be the diagonal ad as is known which in the present case makes an angle of    degrees with the artery ab this were well worth the observing if it be possible in animals but it must be in live ones before their parts have altered their positions and here it were worth the examing likewise whither what mr newton has demonstrated  scol prop    lib   princip phil mathem about the resistance of conical figures obtains in animal bodies for tho his demonstration be only concerning unequal cones yet the same obtains in concave ones wherefore seeing the artery betwixt any two branchings is a conus truncatus it may be represented by the figure cebgf now seeing the diameter cb of the base of this conus truncatus and the diameter fg of the base fdg of the conus abscissus fdgs as likewise their distance o d may all be had it is evident that the entire cone cbgsh may be had likewise wherefore bisect the distance od in q and if it be found having drawn cq that qs is equal to qc then the conus truncatus ce bgf among all of the same base and altitude gives the least resistance to the blood flowing from o to d i am inclined to think this may obtain in the truncks of the great arteries  branchings for no further  considered this i recommend to be examined for the honor of that great man who has crowded up in this scholium not to mention the rest of his admirable book a vast number if retaild of most charming and useful truths  to come now to the business the testiculi humani are granted by every one to be glands and bellini has found the length of the complicated artery in one of them to be  00 else and the altitude of one of these glands when freed of its integuments to be     ell whence i conclude there must be   00 plications or circumvolutions in one of these proxime he likewise asserts that  caeteris paribus if two fluids of the same nature with equal velocities the one be forced into a canal of the same number and lengths of complications as are in the foresaid gland and the other into a straight canal of the same length the velocity in or about their exits of the first fluid to that of the second will be as   to   00 he has not indeed subjoined the demonstration but if we suppose the artery to lie in plicae or solds of such number and lengths as we have just now determined which is perhaps not far from truth and if we suppose the turnings of the plicae to be circular which perhaps may follow from this that seeing a circle is the only ordinate figure of an infinite number of equal sides and equal angles it must be the only curve which can make in all its parts the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection and consequently the only curve in which a fluid would most easily turn and likewise the arch in which they turn to be a semicircle which it must be if the sides run parallel after the turning and universally if the sides producd make any angle from the quantity thereof the quantity of the arch in which they turn may be determined i say from these data the former proportion may be by calculation examined or perhaps more briefly by experiment thus  take a pipe of metal of any diameter and old it into any determined number of plicae whose sides may run parallel and whose lengths may be     ell then by a weight force a liquor through it and observe the time betwixt the first entry of the liquor into the complicated canal and its first appearance at the other orifice then take another straight one of the same length with the former and with the same weight force the fluid through it observing the same way the time of its passage the lengths being the same the velocities shall be as the time of passing reciprocally as is known having thus got the proportion of their velocities in any one determined number of plicae we may by the rule of three have their proportions in any assigned number thereof supposing then that this great man has found the truth of the foresaid proportion from some such way as one of these follows that in every turning the volicity must be abated    00 of the whole proxime for   00   00  00  00   now let us suppose the proportion of the cohesion and fluidity of the fluid separated in the testiculi humani to the cohesion and fluidity in our morbifick matter now derived from the stomach into the small intestines to be as   to   i mean the cohesion and fulidity of the fluid separated in the testiculi humani as it is when immediately separated for when it has lodged any time in the vesiculae spermaticae we know by its ebullitions and the evaporation of its thiner parts it loses a great deal of its fluidity and that this is a liberal allowance is evident from leuvenhoeks experiments scattered up and down the phil trans and printed all together at amsterdam where we may see from the microscopial observations he has made on this fluid its fluidity is little less than that of common water and consequently at least ten times more than that of our morbifick matter  and here i hope it will not be impertinent to set down a proposition to compare the viscidities of different liquors  proposition  let two drops of two different liquors fall into a pair of fine scales a drop of the one liquor into the one scale and a drop of the other liquor into the other scale so that there fall no more than just their own gravities carry down thus you shall have what i here call their comparative gravities and by the ordinary method you may likewise have their specific gravities these being given i say their viscidity and cohesion shall be in a compounded proportion of their specific gravities reciprocally and their comparative gravities directly the demonstration is easy from the nature of fluids  let us again suppose the length of the small guts for it is there only where any thing is separated from the intestines to be   yards and that in every     of a yard there is a plication and that these are likewise liberal allowances any who have ever seen a dissection will know then there will be    plications in the whole and consequently the fluid in these intestines will lose but    parts of the whole celerity it had at its entry  lastly let us suppose that celerity to be equal to the celerity of the blood when it first enters the plications of the testiculus humanus which all will readily grant who consider that there is never any thing found in these small guts but a thin liquor in wide canal thrust forward by the force of the fibers of the stomach and intestines let us call this celerity a  now from corol     and   about separation if a viscidity as   give   00 plications then a viscidity as   will give   00 such and therefore that such a viscid liquor should be separated it is requisite it should lose   00 parts of the whole celerity but as has been just now shown by the ilicae of the intestines the fluid will lose but    parts of the celerity a whence it is absolutely impossible that the intestines should separate this viscid matter unless they were a hundred times longer than they are for     00  00 if the viscidity of the fluid separated in the testiculus humanus were to that of our morbifick as   to  0 then the small intestines ought to be five hundred times longer than they are and indeed i believe the proportion really not to be under   to  0 and then they ought to be at least    hundred times longer than they are  thus we see the second thing this opinion supposes is false and indeed it hardly could be otherwise for in my opinion the faeces themselves might more probably get into the mass of the blood than this viscid matter the parts of these being only united by a simple contact whereas the parts of this are joined by a very strong nisus and i remember dr lister some where in the phil trans relates how he tried to get in a very fine tinged spirit into the lacteals of a live dog by cuting the small guts and injecting the liquor then sewing all up again but he could never get it done to his satisfaction and here it is to be observed that people may be deceived with blue tinctures for this is the natural color of these lacteals when they are almost or altogether empty  if it be objected   that the concoction of the stomach and intestines may fit this morbifick matter to be separated by the lacteals   that the peristaltick motion and the valves of the intestines may hinder the quick motion of the compounded chylous matter   that there are some medicaments as turpentine etc which we know by their effects get into the mass of the blood and yet are more viscid than our morbifick matter   that there is rereally as viscid matter separated in some other glands as the bile and the phlegm  to these i answer    as to the first seeing triture is the only effect of the stomach and intestines there is no advantage to be reaped thence for no beating nor gating will dissolve the union of this morbifick matter besides where it is in any plenty the effects of concoction are very small or none    as to the second the peritaltik motion being reciprocal it adds as much to the motion of the chylous matter in it is descent toward the rectum as it takes away in its ascent toward the stomach and so cannot serve that end the plicae and circumvolutions of these intestines which we have considered being only to be relied on for this purpose as to the valvs we know they all open toward the rectum and serve only to stop the ascent of the faeces in the peristaltick motion and so cannot retard the motion of the chylous matter    as to the third we likewise know that all these medicaments are dissolved into a thin liquor by heat as turpentine butter etc besides that only the most spritious and least viscid parts enter the blood which is not said of our morbifick matter    as to the last there is a great difference betwixt a liquor immediately after it is separated and when it has stagnated sometime in the conservatory of the gland for then the aqueous and more humid parts evaporate and by its stagnation it acquires an ineptitude to motion and tho the blood flows very easily in the arterys and veins yet i defy any to cause extravasat blood enter its vessels again but more particularly we must consider the liver to be a very large vessel and if it were evolvd to make an artery many thousand times longer than that of the canal of the small intestines or testiculus humanus either and so it is no wonder it separate a viscid matter the motion of the blood there being very small but still i assert it is not near so vicid as our morbifick matter as to the phlegm we know it is not naturally produced and the morbifick matter it self against which we dispute might be as well objected for it is only the stagnation corruption and evaporation of the humidity which occasions both the same might be said of the purulent matter which passes by urine but that we know it proceeds from an ulcer in the kidney or neck of the bladder and is not discerned with the urine  having dwelt thus long on the opinions of others i come now to consider the proper remedies of fevers which i reduce to   blood letting   vomiting   purging and   the medicaments which increase the less sensible evacuations under which head i comprehend sweating perspiration and the like  i do not here consider blistering and outward applications seeing in my opinion they are only useful to remove the accidental effects and not the cause of fevers without which they cannot be said to be truly cured    as for blood letting the subject is so fully and learnedly treated by bellini in his forementioned books together that it were equally impossible as impudent to offer at any additions and therefore for entire satisfaction on this head i shall refer my reader to these books    as to vomiting i shall comprehend all i have designed to say about it in these particulars   i shall show that vomiting is partly produced by the vis stimulans vomitorii but   that it is mostly occasioned by the vis stimulans of the morbifick matter excernd from the glands of the stomach   i shall prove that this morbifick matter is not in the cavity of the stomach at least in such plenty as it is excernd by a forced vomit before the ingestion of the said vomit   i shall give the whole destruction and connection of this operation and   shall consider the advantages of the same in the cure of fevers  before i come to handle these it is necessary i first explain what i here mean by a vis stimulans  by a vis stimulans i understand such a quality in a fluid whereby the particles thereof are disposed to make a real division or a violent inflexion of the nervous and membranous fibers of the body which occasions frequent and forceable reciprocations successions and derivations of the liquidum nervorum into the muscles and contractile fibers of the canals whereby all the involuntary muscles are brought into violent contractions and the emissaries of the glands are squeezed  those who desire a fuller account of the nature and mechanical operations of this vis stimulans may see it page     and seq of bellinis book de vrinis and pulls and prop    of his last book de motu cordis i say then    vomiting is partly produced by this vis stimulans vomitorij this is evident from these considerations   because sometimes we immediately vomit upon the ingestion of the vomitory before the morbifick matter excernd from the glands of the stomach could have time to concur   we throw up very often the same we had taken in with little or no mixture which could not happen if the morbifick matter had concurred to produce the fit   sound persons in whose stomachs there is little or none of this morbifick matter often vomit upon a too plentiful ingestion of an otherwise inoffensive liquor the only reason of which must be that the stomach not being able to derive into the mass of the blood the said liquor so fast as it is poured in it must sour on the stomach and thereby acquire this vis stimulans whereby it is thrown out or perhaps it may still have a vis stimulans tho not when it is in a small quantity sufficient to bring the stomach into that violent contraction which is necessary in vomiting but this small vis stimulans being multiplied by the too great quantity of the liquor may acquire sufficient force to produce the effect as we see several things lose the quality to produce their visible effects when in small which they had when in great but    i say vomiting is mostly accasiond by this vis stimulans of the morbifick matter excernd from the glands of the stomach and that for these reasons   the action of the vis stimulans vomitorij being terminated at or near the internal surface of the stomach after one or two plentiful fits of vomiting there being produced thereby such a succussion and compression of the sides of the stomach these particulae stimulantes must necessarily be disentangled and so there could be no more fits of vomiting which is contrary to experience   we evidently see in seavomits and in those produced by the joltings of a coach in some people there is no vis stimulans vomitorij to which we can attribute this effect and therefore it must necessarily be produced by the vellications of the morbifick matter excernd by this particular motion the manner of which may be thus explained every particular body has a determined degree of tension and a determined length and if a like reciprocation of motion by whatsomever cause be produced in the ambient medium which would necessarily be produced by another body when moved of the same degree of tension and of length commensurable to the length of the first body there must be of necessity a motion produced in that first body especially if the motion of the medium be violent and the commensurable lengths be as the first numbers of the ordinary arithmetical progression   to   or   to   or   to   etc this is evident in the unisone or concordant strings of greater musical instruments and the reason is because thereby the oscillations of such bodies become commensurable now i suppose this particular motion of jolting coaches and ships to be such as would be produced by another body having the just now mentioned analogy to the nerves of the glands of the stomach whereby they are brought into motion and consequently derive great plenty of their liquidum into the places which makes such contractions as squeez these glands of the matter which produces these fits of vomiting besides that the same cause may upon other fibers produce the antecedent sickness which we feel in seavomits   by a vomit of warm water for example there are often produced several fits of vomiting and yet we all know there is no vis stimulans in it so that all it can do is that by its warmth which is a kind of a fotus it elicits the matter from the glands of the stomach which occasions this vomiting i could add a great deal more to confirm this proposition but i think this sufficient i say    ly that the morbifick matter excernd by vomiting is not existent in the cavity of the stomach at least in such plenty at it is excernd by a forced vomit before the administration thereof   this is an evident corollary from the former prop the vomit does not act at least after the first one or two fits by it is own vis ctimulans there is in vomiting produced a violent contraction of the fibers of the stomach the muscles of the addomen and diaphragm which must be occasioned someway there is nothing in vomiting which can occasion this but either the vis timulans vomitorii or of the excernd morbifick matter and since as has been already proved it can not be the former it must of necessity be the latter wherefore if the morbifick matter were already existent in the cavity of the stomach the vomit were of little use after one or two fits which is contrary to experience   if this morbifick matter were already in the cavity of the stomach it is not possible but that one or two plentiful fits of vomiting would eject all that is there so that afterward there should none be thrown out however violent the consequent fits were which is likewise contrary to experience the force of the muscular fibers of the stomach the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm which two last monsieur chirac professor of medicine at montpellier by an easy experiment has shown to concur principally in vomiting vide the preface of tournforts histoire des plants qui naissent aux environs de paris is at least equal to   0000 lib weight the force of the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm being more than that of    000 libs and of the stomach not inferior to that of   000 pounds which force if it be not sufficient to drive out all that is existent in the cavity of the stomach however viscid the matter be i leave every one to judge   supposing the morbifick matter already in the cavity of the stomach it is impossible to give an account of the different effects of different vomits for example why an antimonial vomit does excern this morbifick matter more plentifully than whey or warm water for if before the ingestion of either the morbifick matter is already in the stomach then the only thing left for them to do is to excite the act of vomiting but it is certain they may be both brought to be equal in that i e they may be both brough to excite an equal unmber of fits of vomiting and that with equal violence by taking their quantitys in a reciprocal proportion to their vomitive faculties and yet their effects be very different otherwise i omit for avoiding tendiousness the other arguments i can aduce to confirm this proposition    ly the whole deduction and connection of this operation is thus the particles of the vomitory by their incuncation into the orifics of the emisaries of the glands adjacent to the surface of the stomach do dilate the same which by some extrinsick cause had been contracted and after the same manner do dissolve at least in some degree the cohesion of the stagnant morbifick matter and render it more fluid and consequently its resistance less now the natural and constant action of the glands being secretion and the impedimentum by the dilatation of the orifice and attenuation of the fluid being totally taken away or at least made less than the natural momentum of the glands the matter must necessarly flow into the cavity of the stomach till it be accumulated in such a quantity which not being to be done in an instant must require some time as is sufficient by the united loathsomeness and the vis stimulans of it and the vomitory to vellicate and force the fibers of the stomach abdomen and diaphragm by the communication of the nerves of the first with the two last into a violent contraction and thereby throw all out by the osophagus which brings all to quiet again till there be a new a sufficient quantity exerned from these glands to reproduce the foresaid contraction and thus there happens a fit of vomiting and quiet alternately till either all the morbifick matter be thrown out or the force of the vomit so diluted that it is no longer able to elicit the morbifick matter from the glands besides these primary effects of vomiting there are two others which ought not tho less principal to be omitted the first is that in a strong vomit or in one which requires some considerable time before it operate there often passes some part thereof from the stomach into the intestines and occasions a gentle purge by dissolving the faeces and vellicating the fibers of the intestines as shall be more particularly shown when we speak of purging however the effects of this purge very seldom or never go beyond the primae viae for all gentle purges of which this is one are confined within these the second is that the strong contraction in so many muscles and muscular canals which are at work in vomiting and the violent concussion which is produced over the whole body by a power as has been said which is not inferior to that of two hundred and sixty thousand weight may and often does take away the obstructions in many other canals than those which are more immediately concerned about the stomach and osophagus as we evidently see by that vast sweat which always breaks out after plentiful fits of vomiting from these i deduce    thly the advantages of vomiting in the cure of fevers which are   the taking away the obstructions of the glands of the stomach and sometimes of the intestines which is the principal use of vomiting and how great a step this is toward the cure of fevers every one will see who considers that in fevers occasioned by intemperance the stomach is the scene where this great mischief is both contrived and put into execution the obstruction of the glands thereof being the first and principal cause of these fevers and in fevers occasioned by cold the stomach and intestines being most exposed and least defended from the cold air receives its first and strongest impressions which two as formerly was said have the most considerable share in the cause of our continual fevers and therefore it is that vomiting being timeously and plentifully used very often prevents such fevers   another advantage of vomiting is that by the strong contraction of the muscles and muscular canals and the violent concussions of the whole body thereby produced the obstructions of many other glands are removed as has been just now shown so that this with the former removing so considerable a part of the cause enables nature to perform the rest very easily   a third convenience if not advantage of vomiting is that it is less dangerous than many of the medicaments that are taken inwardly the effects of this is confined to the primae viae by which i always mean that winding canal which is continued from the mouth to the sphincter any and is consequently less dangerous than those which run the circle of the blood for it is not to be doubted that all alterative medicines have more or less danger in them from the effect of their stimulations upon the nerves their fermentations with the blood their separating or promoting the natural cohesions of the liquors of the body and their many other unknown productions that which goes the least way must therefore have the least danger now since it is certain that vomiting does not go out of the stomach and intestines where the canals are strong and wide and the fluids are viscid and gross there must of necessity be less danger in it than in these which enter into narrower and weaker canals filled with more fluid and finer liquors it is true indeed there is some hazard from the bursting of the capillary vessels of the internal surfaces by the violent concussions of the body occasioned by vomiting but this is easily prevented by bloodletting which ought always to preceed the plentiful use of vomitories in all diseases besides sometimes the violence of vomit is too great for the strength of the patient but this is rather the fault of the physician than the physic for the strength and consequently the violence of vomits as of all other medicines ought to be adjusted by this proportion viz they ought to be in a compounded proportion of the strength of the patient and the danger of the continuance of the disease if this were observed none could ever err in the administration of medicines  iii come we now to that which we called the third proper remedy of fevers to wit purging in explaining of which i shall   show that vomitive and purgative medicines differ only in degrees of the same quality   i shall give a short account of the several steps and of the manner of this operation and   consider its use in the cure of fevers i say then    that vomitive and purgative medicines differ only in the degrees of the same quality i e purgative medicines by increasing their force vastly and confining it to a lesser quantity either of a fluid or solid body become vomitive and vomitive medicines if diluted become purgative this will be evident from these considerations   we find by experience a strong purge never misses if either it be very strong or the patient not very strong to vomit and the weaker part of a vomit which escapes into the intestines does frequently purge us   the same medicines for example vinum emeticum taken by the mouth will provoke vomiting which given by way of glister will purge the same obtains in all strong emeticks in short all strong medicines of either kind constantly produce both these effects the reason of all which is this if the medicament of either kind be so strong as immediately to vellicate and stimulate the fibers of the stomach to dilate the orifice and attenuate the matter contained in the glands thereof it produces vomiting if it act but gently so as only to assist the natural motion of digestion it goes by the intestines and dissolves the cohesion of the faeces and finding there more sensible fibers is able to bring them into violent motions which produce purging as shall be just now shown   it is impossible in any other theory to account how these two different medicines should upon the same parts produce different effects for both these medicines are taken by the mouth go down the osophagus and enter into the stomach either in the form of a liquid or are there by it reduced into a liquid and consequently are brought in to contact with and operate on the same fibers glands and membranes and yet produce by their assistance two different effects it is simply impossible to explain the manner of this without saying the one acts more powerfully and forceably and makes more violent contractions and consequently is thrown up the most patent way the other more gently and softly and has thereby time to seek out the less obvious passages    dly the account of the several steps and of the manner of this operation is thus purgative medicines being received into the mouth and admitted into the stomach their particles vellicate and stimulate the fibers thereof and thereby increase the digestive faculties i e bring the muscular fibers of the stomach the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm into more frequent contractions than ordinary till they are admited into the intestines the fibers and glands of which being more sensible than those of the stomach whose parts by the frequent rough contacts of one against another and of the gross bodies which are often thrown into it are as it were deadned they easily move and bring into frequent and forceable contractions whereby these glands are squeezed of a fluid which lubricates the passages and mixing with the feculent matter of the intestines which is rendered fluid by the same active and stimulating quality of the purgative medicine renders it yet more fluid by which and by the more than ordinary contractions of the intestines it passes more plentifully and easily into the rectum and is thence ejected this is the use of the more gentle purges which only cleanse the intestines but those of more force besides all these do as to the greater and more spirituous part enter into the mass of the blood by the lacteals and mixing therewith produce many unnatural fermentations therein separating or promoting the natural cohesions of the liquors of the body and accasioning many other unknown effects as has been formerly said and likewise there vellicating the spiral fibers of the arteries and veins bring these into more forceable contractions and thereby promote the circulation of the blood and make it run with greater velocity and force and by this means in a short time wash away any obstructions that either happen to be in the more direct arteries or the more complicated ones which constitute the glands increase the insensible perspiration and purify the blood of all the grosser and more noxious parts by the ductus cholodochus and pancreaticus which void themselves into the intestines all these effects of the more powerful purgatives are visible for sometime after one has taken such a strong purge we find the pulse mightily increased the perspiration augmented the spirits or liquidum nervorum spent spent the visible excretions by siege and urine much greater and the body weakned especially after a few days of such a course whereby it is evident these medicines must operate after the manner w explained from hence it is clear    dly that the advantages of purging in the cure of fevers are very great upon these two considerations   if the purge be more gentle so that it only serve to cleanse the intestines it partly takes away the obstruction of the glands of the stomach and totally that of the glands of the intestines which is a considerable step toward the cure but   if the purge be more violent so that it enter in any plenty into the mass of the blood it conduces so much toward the removal of the obstructions of most of the other glands that nature is able to perform the rest very easily her self but alas this last case has so much danger and so many inconveniences in it as render it as unsafe as otherwise if these could be removed it would be useful bellini in his book de vrinis and pulsibus page     has demonstrated that in violent purges there is a greater danger by far than in bloodletting his words are quia vero quicquid est suspicionis in missione sanguinis ad solum fermentationem non naturalem quae possibilis per ipsam est in reliquo sanguine redigitur and hoc uno de nomine periculo non vacat si igitur hujus mali suspicione careret purgatio illa potius adhibenda quam venae sectio cum purgatio ejus loco caetroquin esse possit sed res e converso se habet suspicio enim ejus mali a missione sanguinis est suspicio rei possibilis non tamen necessario prevenientis aut necessario conjunctae cum qualibet missione sanguinis in purgatione autem necessarium semper est sanguinem solvi a naturalibus cohesionibus seu recedere and dimoveri a sua compositione in purgatione igitur periculum erit certum in venae sectione dubium hoc est erit purgatio venae sectione periculosior etc and therehe goes on to show how muchmore dangerous purging is than bloodletting from this and a great deal more he has there adducd it is evident   that violent purges have a great deal of real danger in them absolutely without respect to other remedies and indeed these unatural fermentations and changes of the cohesion of the fluids instead of promoting the cure often increases the cause of fevers to wit the obstruction of the arteries which constitute the glands   that violent purges are respectively much more dangerous than bloodletting wherefore this last is a more safe and consequently a more useful expedient in the cure of fevers than the former and i say   that violent purges are a much more dangerous remedy in fevers than vomitings are for vomits extend no further than the primae viae where the canals are strong and wide the fluid viscid and gross but violent purges reach all the slender vessels and noble liquors of the body where the danger of any considerable alteration is extremely great wherefore upon this account i say that the danger of violent purges is to that of vomiting as the length of the canals of the whole circuit of the blood is to the length of the canals of the primae viae and how much longer the first is than the latter i leave the reader to consider besides all these there are so many other known and evident dangers in violent purges that the only part of purging which is safe in curing fevers is glistering  the lotiones alvi or rather  either of these only that gentle purge which is the concomitant of every plentiful vomiting  iv we are come now to the last proper remedy of fevers which was the medicaments which increase the less sensible evacuations but all that can be pertinently said on this head is so learnedly and accurately already handled in a treatise entitled archibaldi pucarnij dissertatio de curatione febrium quae per evacuationes instituitur that thither i shall refer the reader only adding the reason why such medicaments administered in the beginning of fevers do rather increase than cure them which is this in an obstruction of the glands the blood in the complicated arteries which constitutes the same stagnates up to the next branching thereof nearest the heart and thereby a considerable length thereof becomes obstructed and unpassable the only way this obstruction can be removed is by the force of the blood which in every pulse or contraction of the heart washes off a particle of the same till the whole be digd away as shall be shown now the arteries which constitute the glands whereby the insensible evacuations are naturally secernd being in the beginning of the fever so much obstructed it is simply impossible for such medicaments to carry these obstructions off as they are just now they must rather force through the superficial arteries and those few other glands that are perhaps left passable the natural humidity only i e the thinest parts of the blood and consequently make it more viscid and thereby the obstruction more firm i e will increase the fever whereas when a great deal of these obstructions in the arteries are washed away by the force of the blood i e in or near the decline of these fevers such medicaments will be able to force the small remainder of these obstructions either through the orifice of the gland or into the continued vein till by frequent circulations it be either lost or thrown out of the body  from all that has hitherto been said about the cure of these fevers it is evident  corollaria   that the first thing incumbent upon a physician in the case of these fevers is to let a considerable quantity of blood both in order to remove the cause of these fevers and to prevent the inconveniences of the subsequent vomiting bellini in prop   and   de febribus has demonstrated that vena in omni morbo est secanda in quo minuenda quantitas aut augenda velocitas aut refriger andum aut humectandum aut aliquid adhoerens vasis dimovendum aut abripiendum than which there could be nothing more pat to our theory    the second step in the cure of these fevers is vomiting for it at least removes the obstructions of the stomach and intestines and goes a great length to take away the obstructions of the most of the other glands likewise this especially obtains in fevers occasioned by intemperance or cold as is evident from what we have said about vomiting but as for purging in fevers there is very little more safe than what is the necessary concomitant of all such vomitings    the last but most universal and surest step is the increasing the less sensible evacuations but this must be used only in the decline of these fevers as has been just now shown  i have in this place only determined the order and the several degrees of the efficacy of these remedies in the cure of fevers with respect to one another their kinds and quantities being to be adjusted by a former analogy i have given when i was speaking about the advantages of vomiting  but here it may be very fairly asked why since i make the obstructions of the artery and nerve which constitute the glands the principal cause of fevers do not i allow mercurial medicines which all grant to be one of the most proper and perhaps specific remedies of obstructions to be one of the steps of the cure of these fevers  before i answer this question i shall   explain the nature of mercury   i shall show the manner of the operation of these medicines and   the advantages and usefulness of them  i as to the first i suppose    that pure mercury or quicksilver consists of parts i mean those of the first composition by which i understand an aggregate of the smallest and last constituent particles of any body and an aggregate of these aggregates i call of the second composition and so on exceedingly small equal and perfectly sepherical  this has been supposed by all who have written any thing tolerable about the nature of this mineral it is true indeed some have supposed it so because they saw that dividing mercury upon a plain even by the assistance of a microscope still the upper part retained its sphericity which they could not so easily observe in other fluids but the true reason of this is the great gravity of the mercury in respect of other fluids and the uniform pressure of the medium for all fluids will retain their sphericity till their quantity be so diminished either by their being another heterogeneous specifically lighter body included in them or by their gravity decreasing at a greater rate than their surfaces that they are of equal gravity with unequal portion of the medium they are in and then they will receive any figure the motion of the medium can imprint on them however the divisions of mercury must be very small before it can be reduced to this state but that it can at last be brought to it is evident from the mixing and pounding of quicksilver among common water in which we know a part of the quicksilver is lost by the diminution of its weight and the discoloring and effects of this water  but the true reason why the former supposition is to be made is because from it some of the phenomena of mercury may be accounted for  for from thence it is evident why mercury though the heaviest known fluid rises with fewer degrees of heat in an alembick than any other   it is parts of the first composition being exceedingly small i e smaller than such parts of any other fluid it must rise sooner than they because the gravity of its particles has a lesser proportion to their surfaces than the gravity of the particles of any other fluid has to their surfaces for the gravities of bodies decrease in a triplicate proportion whereas their surfaces decrease only in a duplicate one thus supposing for example the diameter of a particle of mercury of the first composition to be to the diameter of a particle of water of the same composition as   to  00 and we may justly suppose the odds infinitely greater their surfaces will be as   to  0000 and their solidities i e their gravities as   to   000000 this upon supposition their specific gravities were equal but supposing at the largest the specific gravity of mercury to that of water as    to   the real gravities of such particles will be to one another as   0 to   000000 whence it is evident that not only the ratio of   to   or   to   is much less than that of   000000 to  0000 or  00 to   and therefore upon such supposition it will follow that the gravities of such particles of mercury would be much less than that of such particles of water and that the surfaces of these particles of mercury would be much larger in respect of their gravities than that of the like particles of water in respect of their gravities and consequently the mercury would rise in the alembick with much fewer degrees of heat than the water upon this account but   the particles of mercury are perfectly spherical and equal for all homogeneous bodies must consist of particles similes and aequales in the euclidean sense vide def     and      euclid and consequently can only touch in points and thereby their sublimation will become more easy a sphere can be touched but by    other equal spheres and that too but in so many points and if we suppose the superficial particles of the mercury to be first raised in the alembick they can be touched only by   other now the force and value of such a contact as this of   points is less  caeteris paribus than that of other solid bodies generated by the circumrotation of what ever figure regular or irregular rightlind or curvelind for the contacts of circles is the measure of the contacts of all other figures whatsoever and tho in some curves their contacts in some points may be less than that of circles  vide scholium lem    princip phil mathem newtoni yet in all their other points they will be proportionally greater and consequently the value of the whole contacts greater than that of circles wherefore it is evident that spherical bodies will be more easily separated than any other and consequently will rise in the alembick with fewer degrees of heat than any other i suppose    dly that the only effect of the sublimations and other preparations of mercury is the dividing it into these parts of the first composition which are spherical per suppos   or into parts of a more complicated composition which by reason of the vast gravity of mercury in respect of other fluids and the uniform pressure of the medium may be still spherical for if the mercury be pure and no heterogeneous lighter body be mixed with it it will still retain its sphericity till the ratio of the surface of a particle of mercury to its gravity be to the ratio of the surface of a particle of air to its gravity as is the specific gravity of mercury to the specific gravity of the air i e putting the specific gravity of mercury to that of air as m to n and the diameter of a particle of mercury x and that of a particle of air a till m u  x  a then x will be equal to na m that is supposing a equal to unity as the standard m to n as  0 00 to   proxime as all know the diameter of a particle of mercury must be  0 00 times less than that of a particle of air or the particles of mercury themselves        000000 times less than these of air before they lose their sphericity now besides these divisions into spherical particles the saline bodies which are mixed with the mercury in these preparations keep these asunder and disjoined like so many congealed little bullets separated by the fixation of some liquor this is as i suppose the whole effect of these preparations as is evident from what mr boil and all other chemists have found to wit that from all the transmutations and preparations of mercury they could elicite the same uniform heavy fluid which could never happen if there were any other besides the now mentioned effect produced by these preparations for by what means soever you dissolve this congealed separation the greater gravity of mercury brings its particles into their former union and thereby reduces them into the same fluid quicksilver besides these two suppositions it is to be observed    that the chief ingredients in mercurial preparations are besides it self common and armoniack salts and their spirits the spirit and oil of niter vitriol and its spirit and the like which afterward we shall call by the general name of saline bodies all which we know are endued with a vast power to vellicate and stimulate the more sensible parts of animal bodies and consequently to produce vomitings and purging of themselves according to their quantity and the degrees of their natural force    that the only effect of repeated sublimations in these preparations is the division of the mercury into smaller particles and the freeing of these from the grosser and more noxious parts of these saline bodies for mercury sublimating more quickly and easily than these other saline bodies must in repeated sublimations have a greater proportion to the saline mixture than in the first sublimations and consequently the subsequent sublimations must have less of those saline bodies than the antecedent whereby the preparation will become sweeter and less vellicating this is evident from the aquila alba and panacea mercurialis which are all much heavier specially than any other preparations of mercury  these things premised i come to explain  ii the manner of the operation of mercurial medicines in performing which i distinguish two cases   either the medicine is taken inwardly or   it is applied outwardly under which head i comprehend both mercurial inunctions and plasterings as to the   after the medicine is taken by the mouth it desends into the stomach and there the saline parts of the composition vellicat the fibers thereof which occasion those gripes are felt upon the taking these medicines and if the salin particles have a considerable share in the composition they so powerfully stimulat the fibers of the stomach as to bring it into these contractions which produce vomiting as has been formerly explained the mercury it self with some of the remainder of the saline particles sliping into the intestines do likewise vellicat these and occasion a gentle purge which effect though it be constant in the first days after taking these medicines yet it is never so violent as that of other purgatives because most of it is force is spent in the stomach now that both the vomiting and purging produced by these medicines are owing to the saline parts of the composition is evident from the nature of mercury and the effect produced in it by the chemical preparations thereof just now explained for mercury consisting of spherical particles and by such preparations being only divided into these of themselves as being spherical these particles could never occasion the stimulatitions which as has been formerly shown are necessary to produce these effects the only thing they can contribute toward them is that by their excessive gravity and smallness they are capable to dissolve the cohesion of the more viscuous fluids of the stomach and intestines and consequently make them flow more easily when the muscular fibers of these parts are otherwise brought into contractions besides we see that the forementioned effects are mostly produced by those compositions in which most of these saline bodies enter as in the corrosive sublimate the white and yellow precipitate but in the others which pass many sublimations as the sweet sublimate and the panacea mercurialis we judge of their goodness as they produce least of these effects i ascribe the sweating produced by a dose of some of these compositions partly to the violence of the vomitting and partly to the saline particles which enter the composition and that small salivation to the imediate action of these saline bodies upon the salivary glands and not to the mercury it self all these will be evident to any who have seen the sudden effects of these medicines which have not had sufficient time neither to enter nor circulate with the blood so as to be able to produce the mentioned sweating or salivation after the ordinary manner thus i have endeavored to explain the effects of these medicines while they are in the primae viae i shall now show the manner of their operation in producing a flux de bouche that thereby the lesser effects of this kind may be understood  the mercury being freed by the action of the stomach and the heat of the liquors contained in the same and in the intestines of most of the saline part of the composition enters the blood by the lacteals and is with it carried about through the canals where either it or any liquor of the body generated by it flows the small remainder of these saline particles which adheres to the mercury after the action of the stomach and intestines assisting the propagation of the motion by the velicating the sides of the canals and having the same celerity but a much greater weight it has consequently a greater force and produces a stronger ictus and thereby when once any considerable quantity thereof has entered the blood it by it is great force and the smallness of its particles disolves the unatural cohesions of all the liquors renders them more fluid and active and likewise digs out all the obstructions of the impassable canals like so many little bullets shot against a mud wall every little bullet breaks down a part till the whole be levelled and this it is the more able to perform both because it is exceeding weighty and makes therefore a greater and more forceable ictus and because it is particles are exceeding small and are therefore to be considered as so many exceeding sharp wedges or cunei besides by the smallness of it is particles it is able to enter into these slender canals in which the blood cannot freely pass and thereby to scour all the passages be they never so small and that there are canals through which the globules of the blood cannot freely pass we are convinced from microscopial experiments thus all the liquors of the body being attenuated and consequently their celerity and force rendered greater and all the canals scoured and rendered passable the whole glands of the body are set a work and throw out the more noxious and less fluid parts of their liquors by reason the particles of the mercury either dissolve or carry before them all the gross particles which resist them and thereby the perspiration urine salivation are increased the quantity of the fluids lessened and the whole body emaciated till there be nothing left but pure and useful liquors and clear and passable canals those who can only be convinced by occular demonstration may see a kind thereof in phil trans for jan   00 where leuvenhoeck from microscopial experiments on tadpoles confirms the main of this doctrine as to the manner of the taking away obstructions  but there is another effect of mercurial medicines which is noways to be forgotten for besides these mentioned effects it distroys that corrosive faculty of the liquors which bursts the superficial vessels and produces those constant pains scabs ulcers and the like which we feel for supposing an obstruction in any vessel either by the corrosiveness or viscidity of the liquor or from some extrinsick cause the liquor stagnates and coagulates there and by the force of the fluent part of that liquor and by the corrosiveness of the stagnated part the vessels are miserably distended and their parts dilacerated which occasions constant pain in that part or they burst and the liquor putrefying occasions a botch scab or ulcer more or less dangerous and painful as the corrosiveness of the stangnated and putrefying fluid is greater or lesser now this corrosive faculty must proceed from the pointedness of the particles perhaps these particles may consist of four equilateral triangled plains for such have the greatest equal degree of acuteness on all their points which seems necessary to make them equable in their actions and homogeneous in their natures of the stagnated fluid now the mercury will not only remove the obstruction and make the vessel passable by its weight but likewise by the same will break off and plain the points and angles of these particles and so render them harmless and innocent for sublata causa etc  but here it may be objected that the grand effect as most people believe of mercurial medicines is salivation and that really the salivary glands secern more of their fluid proportionally than any other glands of the body which is contrary to the   prop about secretion to this i answer    that the principal effect of mercury is the attenuating the fluids the clearing the canals and the destroying the corrosiveness of the obstructions and that salivation has no more title to be the principal effect of mercury than insensible perspiration for all the glands notwithstanding the objection secret their respective liquors in the proportion mentioned in prop   about secretion   it is evident that salivation is not the main effect of mercury from this that many persons are cured of very dangerous poxes ulcers and rheumrtisms without ever salivating at least at the ordinary rate of salivation but   the reason why we seem to secern more by the salivary glands proportionally than by any or most others are these   the salivary glands are more in number than any of those which separate visible fluids and consequently it is but reasonable they should secern more than any other it is true the glands of insensible perspiration are more in number than those and it is not to be doubted but they secern more likewise and it will be found so when ever the thing is examined after sanctoriuss method but that secretion not being visible makes the matter doubted   the canals which constitute the glands of salivation are evidently wider than these of others as is clear from their spungy and soft contexture and so it is very accountable from the mentioned prop why they secern more plentifully   the fluid lecernd in the salivary glands is ropy and viscid and one part draws forward another which does not happen in most other glands and upon this account it is no wonder that those secern more than these   the salivary glands in some people have not so good a contexture and so obvious a course as in others and this is the reason why some salivat little or none and others too much but   the true account of the matter is this the saliva being a tough ropy substance cannot be thrust out so fast as the mercury carries it forward especially seeing it seperates only the most glutinous parts of this saliva whence all the salivary glands begin to swell until there be such a quantity accumulated as together with the force of the mercury and of the succeeding fluid is able to burst the orifices of the glands and it is observable the salivation continues only so long as any of the glands are found swelled whence it is evident that this plentiful salivation depends upon this that the fluid is as it were laid up in store to be derived more plentifully afterward whereas in the other glands the fluid being thiner is secerndas fast as it is driven forward and hence it comes to pass that we think the saliva secernd is much greater in quantity than what is derived from the other glands if we take in all these considerations together they will account for the plentiful salivation by mercury    as to the second case in mercurial inunctions the viscid matter in which the quicksilver is wrought and pounded serves only to keep the small particles thereof separated and asunder and to apply them to the skin till by frequent rough frictions the smallest particles of the mercury are forced through the sides of the cuticular arteries into the blood and when once they are got thither they are in the estate just now mentioned and operate after the manner already explained and indeed this were the shortest and easiest course of raising a flux de bouche if mercury could be adjusted to the strength and constition of the patient for the quantity of mercury which will kill one will not produce the designed effect of salivation in another by this method as exactly as by administering it gradually in doses by the mouth but it cannot be done so and therefore the latter course is the more safe  mercurial plasters applied outwardly to heal scabs or inveterate ulcers operate thus the corosive saline mixture if there by any part thereof in the composition eats away and corrodes the putrid matter which sears up the mouths of the vessels so that the mercurial particles get easily into them where they both clear the vessel of the obstructions and destroy the pointedness of the particles of the fluid which two things did concur to make the ulcer sore if there be no saline body in the application then the mercury must be forced in by friction into the mass of the blood to produce the designed effect  thus from a few easy and evident postulates i have given an intelligible account of the manner of the operation and of the effects of mercurial medicines when the mercury enters in any quantity into the mass of the blood and from thence it will be easily understood that when the quantity is less the effects will be proportionally lesser sore that it will be needless to explain all the several degrees thereof by detail but seeing it is evident from leuvenhoecks observations in the last mentioned phil trans that the force of the blood is able to wash away some obstructions let us take a gross estimat of the proportion of the efficacy of the blood assisted by mercury to the efficacy of the blood of it self and unassisted to take away obstructions first then we must consider if instead of the ordinary liquors there passed nothing but mercury in the canals of the body the weight of blood being to that of mercury as  0   to       or as   to    at least and their velocities being the same mercury would at least be    times more able to remove the obstruction than the blood of self but it is certain if the obstruction renders the canal impassible there can no particle of the mercury get away and when there is any quantity thereof got into the blood there are still some new particles thereof coming up so that after some time they having a greater momentum than the globules of the blood and thereby getting through it up to the obstruction we may consider there will be little or nothing save mercurial particles at or near the obstruction driven against it by the whole force of the blood so that as to the obstruction it self it is very near the same as if the whole canals run mercury however let us take the proportion only as   to  0 so that upon this account the blood assisted by any considerable quantity of mercury will be  0 times more able to remove the obstruction than the blood unassisted    dly let us consider the globules of the blood are elastick for they often lose their figure in strait canals and recover it again as leuvenhoeck has shown which is the definition of elasticity and those of mercury are not or very little so and consequently upon this account the efficacy of the globules of blood will be hugely diminished let us suppose it looses of its efficacy which is a liberal allowance and then the proportion will be to  0 or   to  0    dly let us observe that the globules of the blood and mercury driven against the obstruction and at every pulse digging away a part of the same may be considered as cunei now caeteris paribus the force or efficacy of cunei is reciprocally proportional to the angles their edges make but in spheres the lesser or greater degree of curvity is to be considered as these angles when these spheres are considered as cunei and the degrees of curvity in spheres as in circles are reciprocally as their radii supposing then the diameter or radius of a particle of mercury is to that of a globule of blood as   to  00 and there can be reasons given some of which i have formerly hinted why the odds may be supposed much greater then the force of the mercury and the blood to that of the blood unassisted to remove obstructions will be as  000 to   lastly let us consider that by the force of the mercury the liquors of the body are exceedingly attenuated and rendered more moveable and are thereby capacitated to receive a stronger impression so that they both move more quickly and with greater force as is evident from the pulse of those who are under a flux de bouche whose pulse is little less frequent and strong than the pulse of those in a fever let us suppose the proportion both of the frequency of their pulse and of its strength to that of an ordinary one as   to   and this is certainly much less than the truth then it will be as   to   upon the account of its greater force and again as   to   upon the account of its greater frequency that is as   to   so that now upon this last and all the former accounts the proportion of the efficacy of the blood assisted by any considerable quantity of mercury to that of the blood unassisted to remove an obstruction will be as   000 to    or as  000 to   so that the first will be  000 times more effectual for that end than the latter but if any should still think we have made too liberal allowances for the mercury let us rebate the proportion one third part yet still the blood assisted by any considerable quantity of mercury will be able to do as much toward the removal of an obstruction in one day as the blood unassisted in three years almost  besides there are a great many cases in which the blood unassisted is so far from being able to remove the obstruction that it will continually increase the same for if the obstruction proceed from a depravation of the liquors of the body as in rheumatisms or if some corroding matter be forced into the liquors so as to be able to vitiate the same as in poxes pests and poisons it is demonstrable that without some external assistance either by diet or medicines the malady instead of mending by length of time will increase but if the obstruction proceed from some external injury as in bruises wounds colds and perhaps all continual fevers the liquors still persisting in their natural and wholesome estate may do much to drive away the same by length of time but still the sooner and more safely if they be assisted by convenient medicines i come to  iii the advantage and usefulness of mercurial medicines  and   they are useful for destroying the viscidity and thickness the corrosiveness and pointedness of the particles of the whole liquors of the body rendering them fluid and moveable innocent and harmless if before they were otherwise    they are evidently useful for removing all obstructions ulcers scabs botches swellings constant pains all which are but the effects of some kind of obstruction or other of whatever nature or kind by adjusting only their quantities rightly but that is the work of an able physician  now for answer to the question which gave occasion to this discourse mercurial medicines were exceedingly useful and would answer the whole design in curing fevers were it not upon these two accounts   before they could be effectual for this purpose they ought to be administered in a large quantity which never misses by the violence and force of the motion of the blood thereby occasioned to induce a new fever in the patient of self so that instead of curing the former fever it would double it and make the danger double which by no means is to be done the patient having enough a do to wrestle with one but   it requires so long time to bring the effects of mercurial remedies to any height that the patient in so long a space would be cured by the force of nature or killed by the violence of the disease so that upon this account they are rendered useless besides there are a thousand other inconveniences which render this method in its full force altogether impracticable  after all i remember to have been told some time ago by that eminent physician of our country whom i have thrice already mentioned that people who have been severely fluxd seldom fall into dangerous fevers and that in fevers of children occasioned by worms mercury if discreetly used is always and in some fevers of riper years is often very successful the reason of both which is very evident from our doctrine  for in those who have been severely fluxd the blood is so purified and rendered so fluid and all the canals are so cleansd and scoured that if at any time there should happen such obstructions as occasion fevers nature is able in a short time to drive them away seeing they must rather happen from some external cause than from within where all is clear and passable  as for fevers occasioned by worms among the fluids in the bodies of young persons which by the way is an argument omitted for our theory of continual fervers as is likewise the febris variolarum both which are occasioned by obstructions as is evident from the botches which break out upon the latter and as shall be just now shown of the former for here a little worm being forced into some of the capillary arteries where it can neither get back nor forward totally occludes the passage of the blood and thereby occasions a fever after the manner already explained now the reason why the natural force of the blood is not able to remove such an obstruction is because a living creature makes it which will not be mouldred away after the manner of coagulated blood but will require the greater weight and force the mercury to kill it first and then both the mercury and blood concuring wash it away  finis
