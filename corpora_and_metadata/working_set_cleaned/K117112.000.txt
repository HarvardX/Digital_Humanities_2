sop in the pan for peter pindar esquire or a late invitation to cheltenham a burlesque poem  by pindaromastix  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternosterrow  mdcclxxxviii  to the public some apology may be required for my making so free with an old favorite of yours so many of you as are in the habit of admiring the sublime performances of our english pindar will do doubt exclaim against me for assigning a post at court the most humiliating of all others to your darling poet but this is the very thing i intended for this favorite of yours like many other favorites has been spoiled by too much indulgence and is grown so intolerably saucy that he ought to be taken down a little but there may be others among you who will acknowledge p pindar to be fair game and who may say that this gentle castigation is not half so much as he deserves for that impudent mockery and caricature which he has so often pointed at his s  n to all such it may not be amiss to intimate that i have another birch in soak for master peter which i think will give him a smart flagellation the few lines which i now hazard the publication of are only meant as preparatory to the introduction of this other labor of my sportive muse provided that i find this my first essay is tolerably well received and that it is acknowledged to be of sufficient merit to entitle me in some small degree to the signature of  pindaromastix  sop in the pan etc hail funny bard of neverceasing lay to cheltnhams favorite fountain speed thy way wherever thy commons be and mimic joke whether with guzzling cits midst london

soon exalt thee to be court buffoon with title and with pension and all that thou can wish or mention no more pindaric ballads shall thou sing which poor precarious scanty dinner bring to meagre poetaster but pampered courtly songster shall thou be of jolly plight and full of heartfelt glee the darling of thy master thus when the k  g from cheltnham spring to cloacinas temple shall repair to

dire affray i buttoned up and ran away now peter if thou wilt not believe this true then peter you are an unbelieving jew but if thou art a jew it may be proved from hence that thou art circumcised by plainest consequence this thou know best and it is thy own affair for circumcised or not i very little care but what i say is true as true can be and if thou wilt not believe then hear and see now

fit to fill this pretty post as thou act well thy part in this and by and by in other points thy talents i may try but for the present this will suit thee best twill give thee scope for many a merry jest for well i know that every thing thou wilt tell to make the people laugh at c  m well but peter in this fun of thine there are some things in which thy jokes are pushed too far my r  l speech to make the ridicule of every little silly grinning fool  my words of majesty for thee to play with are liberties i neither can nor will away with i fear thou wilt turn out one of that vile sort of varlets which infest each monarchs court who wear our livery suits and spite us who eat our pudding and backbite us  peter o good my liege let me your slave in humblest wise your pardon crave perish that rhyme and doggrel jest if aught offends your r  l breast but sire if you will believe me you widely misconceive me or else some courtiers envious tongue has done your slave this mighty wrong wherever your sacred speech i quoted and in pindarics fondly noted my sole intention was to prove my zeal my loyalty and love of friends and lovers it is the usual way to speak of all their favorites do and say of every little pleasing anecdote to tell on every customd word and syllable to dwell my liege i longed to let your people know how wondrous wise and quick your questions flow to make your loving subjects all rejoice to hear the pleasing echo of your voice for which believe me there is such demand from folks of all degrees throughout the land that kearsleys presses groan both night and day and his poor devls have neither rest nor play even subterraneous tinners club their groats and hungry scotchmen sell their very oats to purchase this delicious treat for which they gladly forfeit drink and meat o if you knew how well your subjects love you i am sure it would with joy and transport move you it glads the cockles of my heart to tell how rapidly my odes pindaric sell sure never monarchs words went off so well  g  e peter i fear in coming to this water thou wilt void thy wit and only learn to flatter already i perceive thoust got thy cue i guess from some of my st j  ss crew but think not thou to obtain my favor by words of such insipid favor think thou i am hither for palaver come with which thou know i am surfeited at home twas not for this thou heardst me say funny peter haste and come away for thee my bowels yearn at c  m spring o come to meet thy loved and loving k  g whilst here i live in vacant ease and do and say just what i please now take my ride now take my walk now with my c  m subjects talk exempt from cabinets and public toils released from th  w ptt and council broils whilst here i purge away my gout and bile thy merry jests shall tickle me the while i know thou art a clever dog a witty and facetious rogue so full of humor and of comic matter thy fun promotes the passage of this water besides i find thy witty folly a sovereign cure for melancholy now whilst my couriers evil tiding bring of p  as slippery oscillating k  g whenever thou see my r  l breast oerchargd with sorrow and with grief let off some pun or witty jest so shall thou give me sure relief then cease thy fawning and grimace suit thy demeanor to thy place further  it is thine to tell me public rumor and bolt out truth whenever it is thy humor this privlege rare all jesters hold allowed from merry times of old but peter like thou such a birth as this  peter o yes yes yes my liege  o yes yes yes  g  e peter leave off that hasty way of speaking habits indulged are very hard of breaking i cannot divine where thou this trick have got for sure i am from me thou had it not  peter this trick my liege i caught in mockery and play and trust me now i cannot leave off this apish way  g  e aye very like for mockings catching i have heard say but let us digress no farther lest we lose our way now peter know it is our r  l will that thou this merry office shall fulfill in rhyme or prose display thy future jest but rhyme thoust used me to and so i like that best mark well my words i charge thee speak thy mind so shall thou prove thy master ever kind whenever i ask thee for advice be sure to give it in a trice and now i will try thy honesty and skill to see how well thy duty thou wilt fulfill i long to put thy talents to the test and from thy answers now i will judge of all the rest now peter truths there are i hear deep lodged in courtly well which seldom come to princes ear and none but friends like thee will tell then speak out peter in thy own blunt way what do the people of my measures say  peter why truly sire they say it is a sad disaster that servants should rebel against so good a master  g  e true peter true it is even so but in this case what can i do that th  w looks so grim and talks so big when he gets on that awful c  y wig with fist upreard he gives me such a frown as if he really meant to knock me down then b  y ptt that stubborn headstrong boy is doomed no less my quiet to annoy what would they more they have all the loaves and fishes they taste of all my store of sugarplums and dishes and yet they quarrel all the while like thieves dividing stolen spoil they are just like all my former friends nor k  g nor commonweal they mind but their own ends now peter tell me what is thy advice  peter o yes i will my liege and in a trice when saucy servants give themselves such airs exert your r  l foot and kick the knaves down stairs naught like a sudden tumble to make proud spirits humble  g  e why peter thy advice is full and round but whether altogether safe and sound i must consider on it when i have slept upon it but peter say have thou no private end no favorite of thy own to recommend  peter not i my liege upon my troth on this i will take my bible oath all one to peter whether whig or tory i only wish your happiness and glory to me it matters not who guides the helm so but prosperity attend the realm yet if these thankless fellows were turned out there is a man or two i could point out what says my liege of c  s f  x  g  e on him and all his crew a p  x  peter but then my liege there is p  ds honest duke  g  e o name him name him not twill make me puke peter methinks i smell a rat and shrewdly guess what thou would be at but play me none of these dogs tricks i relish not thy politics but now i feel another motion from this same c  ms watery potion peter attend me thou know where and do thy proper office there so shall thou merit my regard and all thy service meet a full reward  dialogue between g  e and peter ends now brother craft in doggrel rhyme i hope thou wilt take my word another time no lying bard thou see i was for all i sung is come to pass o peter it is a goodly thing to be manmidwife to a laboring k  g at c  m spring such office to a t will fit thee sure nothing better could have hit thee thy work so easy thou wilt think naught not thy birth so sweet i am glad thy master thought on it now breed no more pindaric riot but eat and drink and sleep in quiet no longer tittle tattles tell of what what what and well well well henceforth forbear poor laureat warton and birthday song to be so smart on whatever toms model and design for future ode even pass it by it is neither flesh nor fish of thine thoust other fish to fry a truce with all both great and small with every brother courtier thou can name us from b  y ptt quite down to b  y ramus birds alike of courtly feather flock and fatten all together now peter hold thy blabbing tongue and tell no tales be it right or wrong if curious gossips want to pry make irish paddys short reply by jasus honey now i see and dont see and many a thing my dear i see and will not see peter i know you are given to tattling once more i charge thee curb thy prattling i really wish with all my heart thou may not fail in this weak part if counsel good thou wilt not remember and steadily pursue it and govern thy unruly member i tell thee thou shall rue it disgraced at court what can thou do or where for food and raiment go both ins and outs will flout thee even printers devils will scout thee those printers peter are a wicked race all authors know it without remorse they will grind the very face of friendless poet to cope with them there was but one of all our corpse and he is gone athletic johnson with an angry frown could clinch his fist and knock these fellows down he kept them all in awe so well though soundly drubbd they durst not tell but now our champion is no more and long may we his loss deplore for cracking printers crowns with fist or cane we never shall see the like of sam again and now of his support bereft and friendless and defenseless left they will wreak their spite upon us all the weakest still must go to the wall it is true in fair and prosperous times and eager call for poets rhymes these printers can be civil but when pindarics will not sell they will d  n both them and thee to hll headlong to serve the d  l o peter printers are a broken reed for bards to rest uupon in time of need thrice happy thou whom fortunes golden shower has kindly placed beyond their griping power then if thou know when thou art well thy courtly pudding eat and nothing tell but if thy saucy gibe must needs break out search out for game among that rebel rout which thwarts thy masters pleasure on b  ke and sh  dn and wicked fx thou may pour forth pindaric jokes sans number and sans measure what though thy quondam cronies mouth and bellow and call thee turncoat knave and shttn fellow tell them that thou have done no more than patriots often have done before tell them it is aye the patriots way to snarl and grin till they get in ask where is the man of all their clan since time began or reivers ran whom sop in pan say what they can did not trepan come then my buck cheer up thy pluck as brother w  d says a fig for all the patriot clan enjoy thy goodly sop in pan
