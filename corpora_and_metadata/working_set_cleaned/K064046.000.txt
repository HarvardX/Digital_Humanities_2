a dissertation on ancient tragedy  whilst the taste genius and knowledge of the ancients have been universally felt and acknowledged in every other part of polite literature it is matter of admiration to consider that the greek theater should so long have remained in neglect and obscurity in philosophy morals oratory and heroic poetry in every art and science we look back to greece as the standard and model of perfection the ruins of athens afford even to this day fresh pleasure and delight and nothing but her stage seems to be forgotten by us homer xenophon demosthenes and many other eminent greek writers have of late years put on an english habit and gained admission even into what is called polite company whilst aeschylus sophocles and euripides still lurk in schools and colleges and very seldom make their appearance at least with dirty leaves in the libraries of the great to what shall we attribute a judgment so capricious and so unaccountable partly perhaps to the hasty severity of ignorant foes and partly to the outrageous zeal of the remarks which are handed down to us on ancient tragedy have hitherto for the most part consisted of mere verbal criticisms various readings or general and trite exclamations of undistinguishing applause made by dull and phlegmatic commentators totally void of taste and judgment add to this that the old tragedians have been shamefully disguised and misrepresented to the unlearned by the false medium of bad translations mistaken friendship the fate of ancient tragedy has indeed been singularly unfortunate some painters have drawn a too flattering likeness of her whilst others have presented us with nothing but a caricature some exalt the greek drama as the most perfect of all human compositions without the least spot or blemish whilst others affect to call it the infant state of the stage weak infirm and imperfect and as such treat it with the highest degree of negligence and contempt exaggerated thus on the one hand by the extravagant encomiums of injudicious learning and debased on the other by the rash censures of modern petulance it is real and intrinsic merit has never been thoroughly known or heartily enquired into the best method however in this as in every other disputed point is to set aside all prejudice and authority and determine the cause by our own reason and judgment from a fair full and impartial view of it  that the spectator may be able to form a proper and complete idea of any object presented to him it is necessary to place him in such a situation as that his eye may at once comprehend the whole and every part of it for this purpose i have collected and ranged in order a few materials which in the hands of some abler writer may possibly lay the foundation for a complete history of the ancient drama in the mean time the following sheets confine themselves to and pretend to no more than a brief account of the origin and progress of the greek tragedy it is end and purport the several parts properties and conduct of it the construction scenery and decorations of the theater to which is added a transient but necessary view of the genius character and situation religion morals and politics of the people before whom it was represented together with a short sketch of the lives and characters of the three great tragedians  on the origin of tragedy nothing is more agreeable to the inquisitive mind than to trace the gradual improvement of any art or science to mark the causes of it is growth and culture and pursue it through it is various stages of perfection it is much to be lamented therefore that neither aristotle nor any other writer on ancient tragedy has given us an exact or regular account of it is progress and advancement from the time of it is birth to that of it is maturity and splendour the few scattered anecdotes which remain concerning it rather serving to awaken our curiosity than to afford us any full and satisfactory information  tragedy was in it is infancy like every other production of human art extremely weak low and contemptible that wide and deep stream which flows with such strength and rapidity through cultivated greece took it is rise from a small and inconsiderable fountain which hides itself in the recesses of antiquity and is almost buried in oblivion the name alone remains to give us some light into it is original nature and to inform us that tragedy like every other species of poetry owed it is birth to religion  tragedy or the from  a goat and  a song the commentators not content with this most natural and obvious interpretation have given us several others some of them turn  into  and so derive it from  the lees of wine with which we are told the actors smeared their faces others inform us that  signifies new wine a skin of which was it seems usually given to the poet like the butt of sack to our laureats as a reward for his labors but i shall not trouble my reader with the enumeration of their whimsical conjectures song of the goat was only a sacred hymn bacchus we are told the first cultivator of vines imparted his secret to a petty prince in attica named icarius who happening one day to espy a goat browzing on his plantations immediately seized and offered him up as a sacrifice to his divine benefactor the peasants assembled round their master assisted in the ceremony and expressed their joy and gratitude in songs and dances on the occasion the this story is told by brumoy and by twenty others with little variation it seems notwithstanding to carry with it the air of a fiction so far as it regards icarius who seems only to have been introduced because icaria was famous for vines and as spon tells us in his voyage to italy was the first place where they sacrificed a goat to bacchus and also where tragedies and comedies were first exhibited but surely the song of the goat might be accounted for without application to any particular person bacchus being the acknowledged inventor and cultivator of the vine it was most natural that the first planters should sacrifice to him the destroyers of it the goat being a creature as remarkably fond of the leaves of the vine as his sacrificer was of the juice of the grape we shall find that he fell a victim not to bacchus alone and that the poet as well as the god came in for a share of him sacrifice grew into a festival and the festival into an annual solemnity attended most probably every year with additional circumstances when the countrymen flocked together in crowds and sung in rustic strains the praises of their favorite deity the rural sacrifice became in process of time a solemn feast and assumed all the pomp and splendour of a religious ceremony poets were employed by the magistrate to compose hymns or songs for the occasion such was the rudeness and simplicity of the age that their bards contended for a prize which as vilem certavit ob hircum art poet horace intimates was scarce worth contending for being no more than a goat or skin of wine which was given to the happy poet who acquitted himself best in the task assigned to him  this was probably the period when thespis first pointed out the tragic path by his introduction of a new personage who relieved the chorus or troop of singers by reciting part of some wellknown history or fable which gave time for the chorus to rest all that the actor when tragedy assumed a regular form these recitations which during it is imperfect state were only adventitious ornaments became the principal and constituent parts of the drama the subject of them drawn from one and the same action retaining their first name of episode repeated between the songs of the chorus was called an episode or additional part consisting often of different adventures which had no connection with each other thus the chorus or song which was at first the only and afterward the principal performance became gradually and insensibly but an inconsiderable though as we shall see hereafter a necessary and ornamental part of the drama  from this time we may imagine the actor or reciter was more attended to than the chorus however his part was executed it had the powerful charms of novelty to recommend it and quickly obscured the luster of the chorus whose songs were now of a different nature insomuch that the original subject of them the praise of bacchus was by degrees either slightly mentioned or totally passed over and forgotten the priests who we may suppose for a long time presided over the whole were alarmed at so open a contempt of the deity and unanimously exclaimed that all this  was nothing to bacchus the complaint grew into a kind of proverbial saying and as such is handed down to us  from the origin of tragedy to the days of thespis and from his time to that of aeschylus all is doubt conjecture and obscurity neither aristotle nor any other ancient writer give us the least insight into the state and progress of the greek drama if his treatise called this treatise contained an exact account of the names times and authors of all the plays that were ever acted  had reached posterity it would probably have afforded us much pleasure and instruction the names of a few and but a few tragedians during this dark period are handed down to us such were the bacchae a tragedy of his is cited by athenaeus epigenes the sicyonian and pratinas who wrote fifty plays thirtytwo of which are said to have been satirical after thespis came his scholar phrynicus who wrote nine tragedies for see strabo herodotus and plutarch one of which we are told he was fined fifty drachmas because he had made it an odd reason too deep and too affecting there was also another phrynicus author of called andromeda and erigone two tragedies to these we must add mentioned by macrobius and pollux alcaeus phormus and choerilus is said to have written no less than a hundred and twenty tragedies choerilus together with cephisodorus an athenian who wrote the amazons and apollophanes supposed to have been the author of a tragedy named daulis though suidas is of another opinion  tragedy during the lives of these writers had in all probability made but a slow progress and received very little culture or improvement when at length the great aeschylus arose who from this rude and undigested chaos created as it were a new world in the system of letters poets and even epic poets there might perhaps have been before homer dramatic writers there certainly were before aeschylus the former notwithstanding we may with the utmost propriety style the inventor and father of heroic poetry and the latter of the ancient drama which before his time does not appear to have had any form shape or beauty he first introduced dialogue that most essential part of tragedy by the addition of a second personage threw the whole fable into action and restored the chorus to it is ancient dignity  aeschylus having like a tender parent endowed his darling child with every mental accomplishment seemed resolved that no external ornaments should be wanting to render her universally amiable he clothed her therefore in the most splendid habit and bestowed on her every thing that art could procure to heighthen and improve her charms we know from good authority that fifty years before his time thespis exhibited his rude performances in a cart and besmeared the faces of his actors with the lees of wine probably to disguise their persons and give them the appearance of those whom they represented but aeschylus who as being himself author actor and manager took upon him the whole conduct of the drama did not neglect any part of it he improved the scenery and decorations brought his actors into a regular and wellconstructed theater raised his heroes on the cothurnus or buskin invented the masks and introduced splendid  personae pallaeque repertor honestae aeschylus and modicis instravit pulpita tignis et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurno hor habits with long trains that gave an air of majesty and dignity to the performers  from the time when tragedy began to assume a regular form we find her closely following the steps of epic poetry all the parts of the epopee or heroic poem may be traced in tragedy though as aristotle observes all the parts of tragedy are not to be found in the epopee whence the partisans of the stage with some reason conclude that perfection in the former is more difficult to be attained than in the latter without entering into this dispute we may venture however to style homer says aristotle was the first who  invented dramatic imitations there was no more left for tragedy says lord shaftsbury than to erect a stage and draw his dialogues and characters into scenes turning in the same manner upon one principal action or event with regard to place and time which was suitable to a real spectacle see characterist vol ii homer the source and fountain of the ancient drama from him the tragedians drew the plan construction and conduct of their fables and not unfrequently the fable itself to him they applied for propriety of manners character sentiment and diction  from this era then we are to consider tragedy as an elegant and noble structure built according to the rules of art symmetry and proportion whose every part was in itself fair firm and compact and at the same time contributed to the beauty usefulness and duration of the whole edifice sophocles and euripides carefully studied the plan laid down by aeschylus and by their superior genius and judgment improved it in a short time to it is highest state of perfection from which it gradually declined to the introduction of the roman drama  on the parts of ancient tragedy amongst many other erroneous opinions concerning the greek tragedy adopted by modern editors and commentators the unwarrantable division which they have made of it into see a dissertation on this subject by mons vatry in the hist de lacad vol   p     acts is perhaps the most remarkable as there does not seem to be the least ground or foundation for it in the first place neither athenaeus nor any of the ancient writers who have given us quotations from the greek plays mention the act where the several passages are to be found which they would most naturally have done had any such division ever taken place it may be likewise observed that the word the word  which we translate an act signifies the whole performance or drama and could not possibly therefore mean any one particular part of it act does not once occur in that treatise of aristotle which gives us so exact a definition of every part of the greek drama add to this that the tragedies themselves carry with them sufficient proof that no such thing was ever thought on by the authors of them notwithstanding which chorus says vossius pars fabulae post actum vel inter actum and actum see inst poet l   vossius barnes and several other editors have discovered an office of the chorus which the poet never assigned them namely their use in dividing the acts the intervals of which were supplied by their songs though it is evident that the business of the chorus as will sufficiently appear in the following account of it was on the other hand to prevent any such unnatural pause or vacancy in the drama as the division into acts must necessarily produce besides that if we take the word act in that sense which the modern use of it demands we shall find it in the greek tragedies composed sometimes of a single scene and sometimes of half a dozen and on looking into the chorusses of sophocles as they stand in the original we find that the ajax besides the  which will be explained hereafter has five which are thus unequally divided to the first act two the second one the third one the fourth one the fifth none at all the trachiniae has six the electra but three and the philoctetes but one regular song or intermede in the whole play if it be granted therefore as i think it is on all hands that wherever we meet with strophe and antistrophe and there only we are to conceive that the chorus sung nothing can be more absurd than to make those songs dividers of the acts when it is evident that the chorus sung only as occasion offered and the circumstances of the drama required which accounts for the irregularity and difference in the numbers of them if the reader will take the trouble to examine the ancient tragedies he will find what i have said confirmed in every one of them if the songs or intermedes of the chorus are to determine the number of acts the play will consist not always of five according to our own custom but at one time of only three and at another of seven or eight neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu horace has indeed told us that there should be but five acts but it does not from thence follow that it always was so the truth after all is that this mistake as well as many others arose from an error common to almost the whole race of writers and critics on ancient tragedy who have unanimously agreed to confound the greek and roman drama concluding them both to be governed by the same laws though they are in many parts essentially different they never allow for the time between aristotle and horace but leap from one to the other with the utmost agility it is plain however from many other reasons equally forcible might be alleged some of which the reader will find scattered about in the notes to my translation of sophocles i shall only observe here that the old editions of the greek tragedies so far from dividing them into acts do not so much as make the least separation of the scenes even the names of the persons are not always properly affixed to the speeches no notice is taken of the entrances and exits of the actors the asides are never marked nor any of the gestures or actions which frequently occur pointed out to us in the margin defects which however inconsiderable may mislead the young and injudicious reader and which ought therefore to be carefully supplied by the critic or translator the reasons here mentioned that the ancient greek tragedy was one continued representation from beginning to end  the division into acts therefore is undoubtedly a piece of modern refinement which as much may be said on both sides i shall not stop either to condemn or approve but proceed to the only division which the ancients ever made a division which nature points out to this and every other composition viz a the cause and design of undertaking any action are the beginning the effects of those causes and the difficulties we find in the execution of that design are the middle the unravelling and resolving those difficulties are the end see bossus treatise on epic poetry beginning a middle and an end or in the words of aristotle the prologue the episode and the exode  the prologue of ancient tragedy was not unlike the  or overture in music or the prooemium in oratory containing all that part of the drama which aristotle must certainly be understood to mean not the first entrance but the first song or intermede of the chorus because as dacier and other writers have observed there are tragedies as the persae and suppliants of aeschylus where the chorus enters first on the stage and opens the play to such therefore if aristotle meant the speaking and not the song there would be no prologue a contradiction which is avoided by understanding what is here said of the  or first song which never begins till the prologue is over and matter furnished to the chorus for the intermede preceded the first song or intermede of the chorus  what aristotle calls the prologue should contain according to the ancient critics all those circumstances which are necessary to be known for the better understanding and comprehension of the whole drama as the place of the scene the time when the action commences the names and characters of the persons concerned together with such an insight into the plot as might awaken the curiosity of the spectator without letting him too far into the design and conduct of it this however easy it may seem at first view is so difficult that it has scarce ever been performed to any degree of perfection of the greek tragedians sophocles alone seems to have succeeded in this particular the prologues of according to this rule the prologues of aeschylus and euripides will by no means stand the test of examination that part of the tragedy which precedes the first song of the chorus being often employed by those writers either in absurd addresses to the spectators or in the relation of things extremely foreign to the purpose of the drama frequently anticipating the incidents and circumstances of the play and even sometimes acquainting the audience beforehand with the catastrophe all of them capital errors which the superior judgment of sophocles taught him carefully to avoid aeschylus being quite rude and inartificial and those of euripides for the most part tedious and confused  the episode is all that part of the tragedy which is between the songs or intermedes of the chorus this answers to our second third and fourth act and comprehends all the intrigue or plot to the unravelling or catastrophe which in the sophocles who was certainly the most correct of the three great tragedians has i think observed this rule in all his plays but two viz ajax and oedipus tyrannus for if the death of ajax is the catastrophe of that tragedy it is over long before the last song of the chorus if the leave granted to bury him be the catastrophe as some critics contend the episode is confined within it is proper limits but this cannot be allowed without attributing to this piece what is a still greater blemish a duplicity of action a dramatic crime of which sophocles in that play i am afraid cannot easily be acquitted in the oedipus tyrannus it is observable that the total discovery of oedipuss guilt is made before the last song of the chorus and becomes the subject of the intermede best ancient writers is not made till after the last song of the chorus the conduct and disposition of the episode may be considered as the surest test of the poets abilities as it generally determines the merit and decides the fate of the drama here all the art of the writer is necessary to stop the otherwise too rapid progress of his fable by the intervention of some brumoy compares the fable of a good tragedy to a large and beautiful temple which the skill of the architect has so contrived as to make it appear at first view of much less extent than it really is wherein the farther you advance the more you are surprised at the vast intervening space which the extraordinary symmetry and proportion of it is parts had concealed from the eye new circumstance that involves the persons concerned in fresh difficulties awakens the attention of the spectators and leads them as it were insensibly to the most natural conclusion and unravelling of the whole  the exode is all that part of the tragedy which is recited after the chorus has left off singing it answers to our fifth act and contains the unravelling or catastrophe of the piece after which it is remarked by the critics any song of the chorus would only be tedious and unnecessary because what is said when the action is finished cannot be too short  on the chorus we come now to an essential aristotle ranks the chorus amongst what he calls parts of quantity and places it after the exode part of ancient tragedy peculiar to itself whilst every other member of the building is universally admired and industriously copied by modern architects this alone has been rejected and contemned as ungraceful and unnecessary the chorus as i before observed gave the first hint to the formation of tragedy and was as it were the cornerstone of the whole edifice as a religious ceremony it was considered by the multitude with a kind of superstitious veneration it is not therefore improbable that the first authors of the regular drama willingly gave way to popular prejudices and for this among many other reasons incorporated it into the body of the tragedy accordingly we find the chorus of aeschylus resuming it is original office reciting the praises of the local deities demigods and heroes taking the part of distressed virtue and abounding throughout in all those moral precepts and religious sentiments by which the writings of the ancients are so eminently and so honorably distinguished  various are the arguments that have from time to time been produced by the zealous partisans of antiquity in favor of the tragic chorus the principal of which i shall briefly recapitulate and lay before my readers begging leave at the same time to premise that whether a chorus is defensible with regard to the ancient theater and whether it should be adopted by the modern are two very different questions though generally blended and confused by writers on this subject the former may perhaps be easily proved though the latter be left totally undetermined the ancients thought it highly improbable that any great interesting and important action should be performed without witnesses their chorusses were therefore composed of a chorus interposing and bearing a part in the progress of the action gives the representation that probability and striking resemblance of real life which every man of sense perceives and feels the want of upon our stage a want which nothing but such an expedient as the chorus can possibly relieve  this is the remark of one of the most ingenious and judicious critics which our own age or perhaps any other ever produced the reader will find it with many others equally just p     of the first volume of a commentary and notes on horaces art of poetry and epistle to augustus   such persons as most naturally might be supposed present on the occasion thus in the ajax of sophocles the chorus is composed of the men of salamis his countrymen and companions in the electra of the principal ladies of mycenae her friends and attendants in the philoctetes of the companions of ulysses and neoptolemus the only persons who could with any propriety be introduced the rest of this writers plays and his only will stand the test of examination by the rule here mentioned persons whose situation might so far interest them in the events of the fable as to render their presence useful and necessary and yet not so deeply concerned as to make them incapable of performing that office to which they were more particularly appointed the giving proper advice and making proper reflections on every thing that occurred in the course of the drama for this purpose a choriphaeus or leader superintended and directed all the rest spoke for the whole body in the dialogue part and led the songs and dances in the intermede by the introduction of a chorus which bore a part in the action the ancients avoided the absurdity of monologues and soliloquies an error which the moderns have imperceptibly and necessarily fallen into from their omission of it they avoided also that miserable resource of distressed poets the insipid and uninteresting race of confidentes a refinement for which we were indebted to the french theater who only appear to ask a foolish question listen to the secrets of their superiors and laugh or cry as they are commanded  but the great use and advantage of the chorus will best appear when we come to consider it in it is moral capacity in that illustrious period which may be called the golden age of tragedy the stage was not only the principal but almost the only vehicle of instruction philosophy applied to the liberal arts for their influence and assistance she appeared in the theater even before she dictated in the academy and socrates is supposed to have delivered many of his excellent precepts by the mouth of his hence euripides was called  the philosopher of the theater in iis says quintilian quae a sapientibus tradita sunt ipsis paene par with regard to socrates his friendship with this poet is universally known  says diogenes laertius the comic poets of that time did not scruple to ascribe several of euripidess plays to socrates as they afterward did those of terence to laelius and scipio favorite poet this sufficiently accounts for the sententious and didactic part of the ancient drama for all that profusion of moral and religious sentiments which tires the patience and disgusts the delicacy of modern readers the critics of those times were of opinion however they may differ from our own in this particular that the first and principal characters of the piece were too deeply interested in their own concerns and too busy in the prosecution of their several designs and purposes to be at leisure to make moral or political reflections such therefore they very judiciously for the most part put into the mouth of the chorus this at the same time euripides being obliged to put some bold and impious sentiments into the mouth of a wicked character the audience were angry with the poet and looked upon him as the real villain whom his actor represented the story is told by seneca now if such an audience says the ingenious writer whom i quoted above could so easily misinterpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet and this too when a chorus was at hand to correct and disabuse their judgments what must be the case when the whole is left to the sagacity and penetration of the people prevented the illiterate and undistinguishing part of the audience from mistaking the characters or drawing hasty and false conclusions from the incidents and circumstances of the drama the poet by this means leading them as it were insensibly into such sentiments and affections as he had intended to excite and a conviction of those moral and religious truths which he meant to inculcate  but the chorus had likewise another the office of the chorus is divided by aristotle into three parts which he calls  and  the parodos is the first song of the chorus the stasimon is all that which the chorus sings after it has taken possession of the stage and is incorporated into the action and the commoi are those lamentations so frequent in the greek writers which the chorus and the actors make together see the second scene of the second act of ajax in my translation philoctetes act one scene three the beginning of the oedipus coloneus together with many other parts of sophocless tragedies where the commoi are easily distinguishable from the regular songs of the chorus office which was to relieve the spectator during the pauses and intervals of the action by an ode or song adapted to the occasion naturally arising from the incidents and  neu quid medios intercinat actus quod non proposito conducat and haereat apt hor this connection with the subject of the drama so essentially necessary to a good chorus is not always to be found in the tragedies of aeschylus and euripides the latter of which is greatly blamed by aristotle for his carelessness in this important particular the correct sophocles alone has strictly observed it connected with the subject of the drama here the author generally gave a loose to his imagination displayed his poetical abilities and sometimes perhaps too often wandered from the scene of action into the regions of fancy the audience notwithstanding were pleased with this short relaxation and agreeable variety soothed by the power of numbers and the excellency of the composition they easily forgave the writer and returned as it were with double attention to his prosecution of the main subject to this part of the ancient chorus we are indebted for some of the noblest flights of poetry as well as the finest sentiments that adorn the writing of the greek tragedians the number of persons composing the chorus was probably at first indeterminate varying according to the circumstances and plot of the drama aeschylus we are told brought no less than fifty into his in the eumenides of aeschylus the chorus consisted of fifty furies whose habits gesture and whole appearance was by the art of the poet rendered so formidable as to frighten the whole audience an accident which so alarmed the public that a decree was immediately issued to limit the number of the chorus eumenides but was obliged to reduce them to twelve sophocles was afterward permitted to add three a limitation which we have reason to imagine became a rule to succeeding poets  when the chorus consisted of fifteen the persons composing it ranged themselves in three rows of five each or five rows of three and in this order advanced or retreated from the right hand to the left which is called it does not appear that the old tragedians confined themselves to any strict rules with regard to the division of strophe antistrophe and epode as we find the choral songs consisting sometimes of a strophe only sometimes of strophe and antistrophe without the epode the observing reader will find many other irregularities of this kind in a perusal of the greek tragedies strophe and then back from the left to the right which we call antistrophe after which they stood still in the midst of the stage and sung the epode le choeur says brumoy alloit de droite a gauche pour exprimer le course journalier du firmament dorient en occident ce tour sappelloit strophe il declinoit ensuite de gauche a droite par egard aux planettes qui outre le mouvement commun ont encore le leur particulier doccident verse lorient cetoit lantistrophe ou le retour enfin le choeur sarretoit au milieu du theater pour y chanter un morceau quon nommoit epode and pour marquer par cette situation la stabilite de la terre some writers attribute the original of these evolutions to a mysterious imitation of the motion of the heavens stars and planets but the conjecture seems rather whimsical the dance we may imagine if so we may venture to call it was slow and solemn or quick and lively according to the words sentiments and occasion and in so spacious a theater as that of athens might admit of such grace and variety in it is motions as would render it extremely agreeable to the spectators the petulancy of modern criticism has frequently made bold to ridicule the use of song and dance in ancient tragedy not considering as brumoy observes that dancing is in reality only a more graceful way of moving and music but a more agreeable manner of expression nor indeed can any good reason be assigned why they should not be admitted if properly introduced and carefully managed into the most serious compositions to say the truth nothing is more astonishing than the prejudices we entertain and the partiality we show with regard to our own modes and customs we condemn the chorusses of the ancients which supplied with decency and propriety the vacant parts of the drama and how do we fill up our own to be convinced of our injustice and absurdity let us suppose sophocles or euripides transported from the shades of elysium and entering one of our noisy theaters between the acts the audience engaged in bowing or talking to each other and the music entertaining them with a jig of vivaldi or the roast beef of old england how would they be surprised in a few minutes to find that all this disorder riot and confusion was in the midst of a most pathetic and interesting tragedy and that the warmest passions of the human heart were broken in upon and enfeebled by this strange and unnatural interruption  the chorus continued on the stage during the whole representation of the piece unless when some very as in the ajax of sophocles where the chorus leave the stage in search of that hero and by that means give him an opportunity of killing himself in the very spot which they had quitted and which could not have been done with any propriety whilst they were present and able to prevent it on these occasions the chorus frequently divided itself into two parts or semichorusses and sung alternately extraordinary circumstance required their absence this obliged the poet to a continuity of action as the chorus could not have any excuse for remaining on the spot when the affair which called them together was at an end it preserved also the unity of time for if the poet as see his whole art of the stage page     of the english translation hedelin observes had comprehended in his play a week a month or a year how could the spectators be made to believe that the people who were before them could have passed so long a time without eating drinking or sleeping thus we find that the chorus preserved all the unities of action time and place that it prepared the incidents and inculcated the moral of the piece relieved and amused the spectators presided over and directed the music made a part of the decoration and in short pervaded and animated the whole it rendered the poem more regular more probable more pathetic more noble and magnificent it was indeed the great chain which held together and strengthened the several parts of the drama which without it could only have exhibited a lifeless and uninteresting scene of irregularity darkness and confusion  the ancient chorus notwithstanding with all it is advantages is not agreeable to every taste it has been attacked with great severity and treated with the utmost contempt it has been called arrant pedantry an excrescency of the drama a mob of confidents even writers of approved genius and judgment have said that it is absurd to imagine the ancients would ever have trusted their secrets especially those of a criminal nature to all their domestics that it is impossible to imagine that fifty or even fifteen people can keep a secret fifteen people of the same mind thought voice and expression  it must be acknowledged that these critics have selected that part of the office of the chorus which is most liable to censure but even if we allow the objection it is full force it will not suffice to condemn the chorus itself which in the judicious sophocles who avoided the errors and absurdities of his cotemporaries is unexceptionable in that noble author nothing is entrusted to the chorus which ought to be concealed nor any thing concealed which ought to be imparted to them we might therefore perhaps with equal justice banish from our own stage the general practice of soliloquies because shakespeare has frequently drawn them out to an immoderate length as utterly condemn the whole ancient chorus because euripides has in two or three of his plays made an improper use of it  who shall decide when doctors disagree some applaud the chorus with a kind of enthusiastic rapture whilst others endeavor to sink it into universal contempt for my own part i cannot but think it absolutely necessary on the ancient stage and that it might be rendered useful and ornamental even on our own i am notwithstanding far from being of opinion that it should be admitted constantly and indiscriminately into the modern theater the use of it must depend entirely on the subject certain it is that there are many in our own history as well as in that of other nations where a chorus might be introduced with the utmost propriety but if after all fashion and prejudice will not suffer them to appear on the stage they may at least gain admission to the closet thither let the reader of true taste and judgment carry elfrida and caractacus written on the ancient model and compare them with athelstan barbarossa the a bombast and spiritless performance written by one murphy formerly a wretched actor now a still more wretched dramatic author orphan of china or any of those tinsel flimsy performances that have lately assumed the name of tragedies which have owed all their success to the false taste of the age joined to the real merit of the actors in the representation of them  on the verse recitation and music of ancient tragedy the art of poetry was considered by the ancients as a part of that general system which they termed the  or melody and was in reality the art of making verses proper to be sung they looked upon words not only as signs of particular ideas but as sounds also enabled by the assistance of music to express all the passions of the human mind when in the descriptive parts of the drama a dreadful or disagreeable object was to be represented the words were formed of such harsh and jarring syllables as by grating on the ear might best impress the exactest representation of it and in like manner when the grand the beautiful or the tender was to be set before the eyes of the spectator the language was carefully and even painfully adapted to it the greeks who were extremely solicitous to cultivate and improve their language to the highest degree of perfection took more than ordinary care in the formation of their verse the quantity of every syllable was carefully ascertained different words different dialects and different feet were appropriated to different species of poetry and none infringed on the rights and privileges of another tragedy indeed as the sovereign assumed a kind of peculiar title to them all every species of verse was occasionally introduced to adorn and beautify the drama the iambic was generally made use of in the body of the piece as approaching according to the judgment of aristotle nearest to common discourse and therefore most naturally adapted to the dialogue this rule however is not constantly and invariably observed but sometimes departed from with judgment the meter is frequently changed not only in the songs of the chorus but in other places and that generally in the most interesting and impassioned parts of the drama where it may here be observed it is most probable that the music and instruments accompanying the verse were changed also a happy circumstance for the poet as it must have afforded an agreeable relief to the audience who would naturally be fatigued by the repetition of the same sounds be they ever so harmonious since the expulsion of tragedies in rhyme of all things doubtless the most absurd some of our best poets have introduced what is called a tag consisting of three or four couplets at the end of every act to relieve the ear from the monotony of blank verse but even this is now exploded and we are confined to the repetition of the same continued meter from beginning to end if our own times manners and taste would admit of such variations what additional beauties would they reflect on the british theater but such a change of meter in serious dramatic performances is rendered absolutely impossible as well from many other obstacles as from the it must be confessed says a very judicious writer that all the modern languages fall infinitely short of the ancients in this point both the greek and latin tongues assigned for the pronunciation of each syllable an exact measure of time in some longer in some shorter and so variously intermixed those two different measures in the same word as furnished means for that variety of versification to which we are altogether strangers see a book entitled observations on poetry printed for dodsley in      p  0  in the chapter on versification where the reader will meet with many sensible remarks on this subject poverty of our language when put in comparison with those of antiquity particularly that of greece whose superiority over us in this respect is so remarkably visible on the ancient stage the length or shortness of every syllable was as it were fixed and determined either by nature or by use hence the song had a necessary and agreeable conformity with common discourse which rendered it more intelligible our our different cadences says the elegant author of elfrida our divisions variations repetitions without which modern music cannot subsist are entirely improper for the expression of poetry and were scarce known to the ancients musicians in the composition of their songs make short syllables long and long short as it suits the air or recitative and whilst the music pleases the ear the words frequently offend it if the poet and musician were always united in one person which very seldom happens this inconvenience might with all the disadvantages of our language be in a great measure lessened if not entirely removed  it is more than probable and nearly demonstrable that the theatrical declamation of the ancients was composed and wrote in notes and that the whole play from beginning to end except the commoi and chorusses were in a kind of it is the opinion of p menestrier and several other learned men that the custom of chanting in churches was originally taken from the ancient stage as the theaters were open at the commencement of the christian era it is not improbable but that the common people might recite our saviors passion after the manner of the tragedians certain however it is that in our own nation as well as in many others the first tragedies exhibited were on religious subjects and in some places continue so even to this day recitative like our modern operas that it was the  or melody is mentioned by aristotle as one of the six essential parts of tragedy and consequently must have been considered by him not as confined to the chorus but diffusing itself through the whole drama in the   th chapter of his problems he asks why the tragic chorusses never sing in the hypodorian or hypophrygian mood which are both employed in the scenes from which passage as well as many others that might be quoted it is evident that they sung both in the scenes or dialogue part and in the chorus also accompanied with music throughout and that the reciter had little else to do than carefully to observe the directions of the poet the quantity of every word was ascertained the time duration and rhythmus of every syllable fixed by the musician so that he could not easily mistake or offend the actor was not as on our stage left at liberty to murder fine sentiment and language by wrong accents and false pronunciation by hurrying over some parts with precipitancy and drawling out others into a tedious monotony a good voice and a tolerable ear were all that the poet required of him  music is ranked by aristotle amongst the essential parts of tragedy nor is there the least reason to doubt but that it was considered by the ancients both as useful and ornamental it was most probably diffused throughout the whole piece accompanying the recitation in the dialogue directing the voice and even perhaps the in the third volume of labbe du boss critical reflections on poetry painting and music the whole eleventh chapter is employed in proving or rather endeavoring to prove that amongst the romans the theatrical declamation was divided between two actors one of whom pronounced whilst the other executed the gesticulation  i refer my readers to the book itself where they will find many ingenious remarks on the theatrical representations of the ancients action and gesture of the performers varying it is movements according to the different passions to be excited in the breasts of the audience it is different measures were always carefully st austin has written a treatise expressly to reconcile the various measures of ancient verse with the principles of music adapted to the meter and took their names from the different feet made use of in the verse as the dactylic the ionic poeonic and the rest the principal exertion of it is powers must we may imagine have been reserved for the songs or intermedes of the chorus where both the poetry and music admitted of much greater freedom and variety than in the other parts of the drama thus we see in the ancient theater music always accompanied her sister science assisted animated and supported her was in short in all respects her friend and fellow laborer qualem decet esse sororem the office of a dramatic poet in the time of ancient tragedy required we may observe a wider circle of knowledge and far more extensive abilities than the present age demands or expects from him for besides all the other requisites it was necessary that he should be master of every kind of verse completely skilled in music and able to direct all the evolutions movements or if so we choose to call them the dances of the chorus euripides we are told instructed his singers in the grave and solemn airs which accompanied all his pieces and plutarch informs us that the people of susae and the persians by the command of alexander sung the tragedies of sophocles and his successors in the drama according to the measures which those writers had themselves prescribed at the first representation of them  tragedy was in it is infancy what aristotle calls it  made up of music and dancing and the old tragedians thespis pratinas cratinus and phrynicus according to athenaeus bore the name of  dancers because they used so much dancing in their chorusses tetrameters were therefore for a long time made use of in the verse as that foot was most proper for motion though it was afterward changed to the iambic when the dance or this movement was probably as an excellent critic observes becoming graceful and majestic as appears from the name usually given it  this word says he cannot well be translated into our language but expresses all that grace and concinnity of motion which the dignity of the choral song required see notes on the art of poetry v   p     movement was confined to the songs or intermedes of the chorus which in the more perfect state of tragedy became as i before observed but a small part of the whole drama what instruments the ancients made use of in their theatrical music and in what it is principal merit consisted it is perhaps at this distance of time not easy to determine if any of my readers are desirous of prying into a subject so dark and intricate i must refer them to plutarchs dialogue on this subject together with mons burettes observations on it in the tenth volume of the hist de lacad to which may be added p menestriers dissertation on ancient and modern music where they will meet with as much information as i believe can be given them on this head  the use of music in tragedy has been matter of much doubt and contention with modern critics m dacier thinks it by no means essential and greatly condemns aristotle for his approbation of it it is notwithstanding indisputable that on the antitient stage music was a most beautiful adjunct to poetry and contributed in a great measure to the high finishing and perfection of the greek drama we cannot perhaps so easily resolve how far it may be reconcilable to modern manners though from some late experiments on in the representation of merope the solemnity of the sacrifice scene is greatly heightened by the music and song the judicious manager of drury lane theater has introduced it into several other tragedies with success one of our theaters we have reason to think that when introduced with propriety it might be attended with it is desired effect  on the construction of the greek theater the greek theater is amongst those superb monuments of ancient taste genius and magnificence which would probably have survived the depredations even of time itself if ignorance and barbarism had not conspired to ruin and destroy it of all those noble and costly structures which athens and sparta dedicated to the muses we have now scarce any thing but a few inconsiderable remains sufficiently striking to raise our curiosity but at the same time too mutilated and imperfect to satisfy it those writers of antiquity who have occasionally mentioned the construction of the theater as they treated a subject universally known by their cotemporaries did not think themselves obliged to handle it with that degree of accuracy and precision which were so necessary for the information of posterity in consequence of which they frequently gave names to one part of the building that more properly belonged to another and by a confusion of terms which could not mislead the readers of their own times involved their successors in a labyrinth of error and obscurity add to this that the same fate has attended the description of the building which had before happened to the several constituent parts of the drama modern critics too often confound together the greek and roman theater though they differ most essentially in many parts we find terms frequently appropriated to one which belong only to the other and the whole so imperfectly delineated by almost every one of them as to render it throughout a matter of doubt and uncertainty some lights however have from time to time been thrown on this dark and intricate subject whose scattered rays when united and drawn to a point will exhibit to us the following tolerably accurate though still imperfect representation of it  the ancient greek theater in it is highest state of perfection was a most spacious noble and magnificent structure built with the most the theater at athens was originally built with wood but being one day remarkably crowded on the exhibition of a tragedy written by pratinas the benches fell in many of the spectators were killed and the whole fabric buried in ruins this melancholy accident induced the athenians naturally fond of spectacles to set about the construction of those superb edifices which they afterward made use of built with the most costly marble and adorned with every thing that could render them solid noble splendid and magnificent solid and durable materials and capable we are told of holding thirty thousand spectators to give my readers a proper idea of it is form i shall divide it into three principal departments one for the actors which they called the scene another for the spectators under the general denomination of the theater and a third called the orchestra allotted to the music mimes and dancers to determine the situation of these three parts and consequently the disposition of the whole it is necessary to observe that the plan here annexed consists on one side of two semicircles drawn from the same center but of different diameters and on the other of a square of the same length but less by one half the space between the two semicircles was allotted for the spectators the square at the end to the actors and the intervening area in the middle to the orchestra thus we see the theater was circular on one side and square on the other round the whole were ranges of porticos see letters a and b more or less according to the number of stories the most magnificent theaters always having three one raised above another to these porticos which might properly be said to form the body of the edifice the women were diagram of greek theater plan of a greek theater a lower portico b upper or third portico c the scene d the proscenium e the hyposcenium f the thymele g the parascenium h the orchestra i the seats k the staircases l triangular machines for the scenery  admitted being the only places covered from rain and heat the rest were entirely the amphitheatres in spain were formerly built something in this manner having no roof so that the spectators were often exposed to rain heat and all the inclemency of the seasons open above and all the representations in the in many cities of the two lombardies as riccoboni informs us the spring of the year is allotted for comedies which are represented in the daytime without any lights the play houses being built in such a manner as to be sufficiently enlightened by the sun and in the year   0  a regulation was made in france by the civil magistrate by which the players were ordered to open their doors at one oclock to begin the entertainment at two and to put an end to it at half an hour after four daytime  the seats for the spectators letter i extended from the upper portico down quite to the orchestra letter h differing in their width and number with the size of the theater and were always so formed that a line drawn from the top to the bottom would touch the extremities of every one of them between each story was a wide passage leading to the seats every one of which for the better accommodation of the audience was at such a distance from the seat placed over it that the feet of the persons above could not touch those who were below  the magistrates were separated from the populace by a place appropriated to them called  the  or seat of the youths was assigned to the young men of quality and distinction there were also some  or first seats allotted to persons of extraordinary merit where all those were placed who had distinguished themselves by any signal services to the commonwealth such in process of time became hereditary and were appointed for particular families all these were very near to or sometimes in the orchestra and as close as the structure of the theater would admit to the scene or place of representation  the orchestra being between the two parts of the building one of which was circular and the other square partook of the shape of both varying in it is size according to that of the theater though it is width was always double it is length and that width always the semidiameter of the whole edifice to this they entered by passages under the seats of the spectators the whole being entirely on a in the roman theater the senators and chief magistrates frequently sat in the orchestra where finding the inconveniency of the level it was remedied by raising the seats a little above each other level with the ground this led also to the staircases letter k by mons boindin reckons up very accurately the number of the staircases and of the seats together with many other minute particulars what i have extracted from him may suffice to give the reader a general idea of the whole structure if the curious in architecture are desirous of farther information i must refer them to the discourse itself which they will find in the first volume of the hist de le acad quarto edition p     which they ascended to the different stories of the theater some leading to the seats others to the porticos of course turned different ways but all equally wide disengaged from each other and so commodious as to give sufficient room for the spectators to go in and out without the least crowding or inconvenience  between the orchestra and the stage was the  hyposcenium letter e so called because it was close to the scene or place of representation here it is most probable were placed the instruments that accompanied the actors throughout the drama  between this part and the proscenium mr boindin places the greek  or thymele letter f so called because in shape it resembled an altar here he imagines the chorus was placed and performed their songs and dances but this place with all due deference to that ingenious critic could by no means be allotted to the chorus being much too distant from the stage where we know from the tragedies themselves the chorus must always be as besides the songs or intermedes it bears a part in the dialogue throughout the piece and consequently must stand close to the other actors beyond this was the large and vacant space called  proscenium or  letter d representing the scene of action which was always some public place as a road a grove a courtyard adjoining to some temple or palace the length and breadth of this area or stage varied according to the size of the theater but always of the same height and in the greek theater never more or less than ten foot  at the extremity of the whole building was the  or postscenium letter g that place behind the scenes where the actors dressed themselves and prepared the habits scenes machines and every thing necessary to the representation  at the back of the stage letter l were the triangular machines for the scenery called by the greeks utrimque aliae interdum portae quarum in postibus affixae machinae  dictae quae pro re ac tempore circumagebantur suid to these virgil is supposed to allude in the third book of the georgics vel scena ut versis discedat frontibus  which is thus explained by servius scena says he quae fiebat aut versilis aut ductilis versilis tunc erat cum subito tota machinis convertebatur and aliam picturae faciem ostendebat ductilis tunc cum tractis tabulatis hac atque illac species picturae nudabatur interior what virgil mentions was probably an improvement on the  as practiced in the roman theater  which as they turned on their own axis might be shifted on any occasion and exhibited three different views or changes of scene these were not made use of in tragedy which required but one scene throughout but most probably at the end of it to prepare the exhibition of the comedy or mime which in the ancient theater frequently succeeded each other perhaps two or three times on the same day  amongst the many peculiarities of the greek theater with regard to it is construction there is not perhaps any thing so remarkable and which we can so difficultly form any idea of as the echoea or brazen vessels which according to vasa aerea says vitruvius quae in cellis sub gradibus mathematica ratione collocantur ad symphonias musicas sive concentus ita componuntur uti vox scenici sonitus conveniens in dispositionibus tactu cum offenderit aucta cum incremento clarior ac suavior ad spectatorum perveniat aures  to these echoea it is supposed cassiodorus alludes where he says tragaedia concavis repercussionibus roborata talem sonum videtur efficere ut paene ab homine non credatur  cass ep    lib   vitruvius were made use of by the greeks to render the articulation distinct and give a more extensive power to the voice an expedient doubtless extremely necessary in so large a theater for this purpose we are told that they had recourse to several round concave plates of brass placed under the seats of the spectators so disposed and contrived by the most exact geometrical and harmonic proportions as to reverberate the voice and carry the words of the actor to the farthest part of the building the manner in which this was performed is i must confess to me utterly incomprehensible certain it is that no idea can be formed of it without the most profound knowledge of ancient music and ancient architecture i shall not therefore trouble my readers with an explication of what few i believe would be able to comprehend but if any of them are desirous of a more intimate acquaintance with these brazen echos i must refer them to the sixth book of the learned vitruvius and mons burettes treatise on ancient music  on the scenes machines and decorations though we have no genuine or regular account now extant of the machines and decorations of the greek theater we have sufficient reason to conclude from the tragedies themselves still remaining that such things were made use of in the representation as we find in almost every one of them gods ascending and descending ghosts and furies frequently appearing on the stage with divinities celestial and terrestrial for all these we need not doubt but that the ancients had machines of various kinds according to the various exigencies and circumstances that required them and as we learn from the scattered remains of hesychius pollux and other writers were no strangers to  sunt rudentes scenici quibus per tractoria organa latentes personae sustollebantur in scenam  rudentes qui ex alto suspensi sunt ut sustineant eos qui aere ferri videntur pollux trapdoors flying chariots magnificent arches flights ropes pullies and in short all the mechanical apparatus of the stage as to the scenery we know that the strict regard paid by the greek tragedians to the unity of place confined the whole representation of their pieces to one particular spot this however we find was sumptuously adorned with all the embellishments which art or nature could furnish magnificent scenae tragicae says vitruvius deformantur columnis fastigiis and signis reliquisque regalibus rebus columns porticos statues paintings bassorelievos every thing which the elegant taste and genius of greece could produce was added to enrich the scene even so early as in the time of aeschylus we are tum athenis agatarchus aeschylo docente tragediam primus scenam fecit and de eo commentarium reliquit ex quo moniti democritus and anaxagoras de eadem re scripserunt quemadmodum oporteat ad aciem oculorum radiorumque extensionem centro constituto ad lineas ratione naturali respondere uti de re incerta certae imagines aedificiorum in scenarum picturis redderent speciem and quae in directis planisque frontibus sint figurata alia absidentia alia prominentia esse videantur vitruvius lib viii told that the decorations of the theater were made according to the exactest rules of perspective the whole theater porticos excepted being as i before observed uncovered and consequently exposed to the heat of the sun and inclemency of the weather a kind of thin curtain fastened probably to a large pillar or pole in the center of the building was extended over the whole as the heat notwithstanding which is always the case in our modern tents frequently penetrated through them and the breaths of so numerous an assembly must have been offensive they had recourse to artificial showers of rain which they conveyed from the top of the porticos through the statues that were dispersed over the different parts of the building as i do not remember that we have any authority from ancient greek writers for this anecdote i should rather be inclined to consider the perfumed water as a refinement of modern luxury and ascribe it to the improvements of the roman theater mr boindin adds that the water on these occasions was always scented so that the spectators were not only refreshed by this gentle dew falling upon them but at the same time regaled with the most exquisite perfume  on the masks it appears from the united testimonies of several ancient writers that the actors of greece never appeared on the stage in tragedy or any other species of the drama without masks it is most probable that before the time of aeschylus to whom suidas and athenaeus attribute the invention of masks to the poet choerilus horace gives the honor to aeschylus but aristotle who we may suppose was as well acquainted with this matter as any of them fairly acknowledges himself entirely ignorant of it  says he  horace ascribes this invention they disguised their features either as in the days of thespis by daubing them with the lees of wine or by painting false hair and other artifices of the same kind with those which are practiced in the modern theater masks however were soon introduced and looked on we may imagine in those days as a most ingenious device that which they made use of in tragedy was according to the best information we can gather concerning it a kind of casque or helmet which covered the whole head representing not only the face but the beard hair ears and even in the womens masks all the ornaments of the coif or cap being made of the first masks were made of the leaves of a plant to which the greeks on this account gave the name of  quidam says pliny arcion personatam vocant cujus folio nullum est latius virgil mentions them as composed of the barks of trees oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis and pollux tells us that they were made of leather lined with cloth or stuff  different materials according to the several improvements which it received from time to time the most perfect and durable were of wood executed with the greatest care by sculptors of the first rank and eminence who received their directions from the poet it seems to have been an established opinion amongst the ancients that their heroes and demigods who were generally the subject of their tragedies were of an extraordinary size far surpassing that of common mortals we must not be surprised therefore to find their tragic poets in compliance with this popular prejudice raising them upon the cothurnus or buskin was a kind of large and high shoe the sole of which being made of very thick wood raised the actors to an extraordinary size juvenal tells us that it made them appear extremely tall and compares an actress without her cothurnus to a pygmy   breviorque videtur virgin pygmaea nullis adjuta cothurnis the cothurnus was probably of the same form as the high shoe or piece of cork bound about with tin or silver worn by the spanish women called a chioppine and which it should seem by a passage in shakespeare was used on our own stage your ladyship is nearer heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chioppine hamlet act   scene   the cothurnus swelling them to an immense magnitude and by the assistance of a the tragic masks had large and expanded mouths as if says the humorous lucian they were about to devour the spectators  large and frightful masque endeavoring to fill the minds of the spectators with a religious awe and veneration of them the tragic masks were generally copied from the busts or statues of the principal personages and consequently conveyed the most exact idea and resemblance of them which must have given an air of probability to the whole those which represented the masque commonly used was called simply  the others  and  ghosts and furies were made still more terrible and frightful but the masks of the  says lucian   dancers or persons who formed the body of the chorus had nothing disagreeable  as in the infancy of tragedy there were probably but few actors the use of masks gave each of them an opportunity of playing several parts wherein the character age and sex were different without being discovered the large opening of the mouth was so contrived as to increase the sound of the voice and send it to the farthest part of the theater which was so extremely large and spacious that without some such assistance we cannot easily conceive how the actor could be well heard or seen in all theatrical painting scenery and decoration the objects we know must be magnified beyond the life and reality to produce their proper effect and in the same manner we may imagine that in so extensive an area as the greek theater it might be necessary to exaggerate the features and enlarge the form of the actor add to this that at such a distance as most of the spectators were the natural expression of the eyes and countenance must be entirely lost the sanguine admirers of every thing that is ancient bring many more arguments to defend the tragic masks have had their admirers in modern as well as in ancient times and been used on more stages than that of greece even toward the middle of the last century the actors both in tragedy and comedy on the french theater wore masks the english is doubtless in this respect as well as in many others infinitely superior to the athenian stage notwithstanding which i will promise to join the  and vote for the restoration of the ancient masque whenever they will show me one that can represent the happy features of quin in the character of falstaff or give us an idea of a frantic lear like the look and face of the inimitable garrick masque but after all that can be said in it is favor it is perhaps scarce defensible the face is certainly the best index of the mind and the passions are as forcibly expressed by the features as by the words and gesture of the performer the greeks in this as in many other particulars sacrificed propriety truth and reason to magnificence and vanity  all the expenses of the theater were defrayed by the state and were indeed so considerable that nothing but the purse of an opulent republic could possibly have supported them as it is confidently affirmed by this assertion which seems rather hyperbolical is notwithstanding supported by the grave plutarch who speaking of the athenians assures us that the representation of the bacchanals phoenissae oedipus antigone medea and electra cost them more money than the defense of their own liberties in the field or all their contests with the barbarians historians that athens spent more in dramatic representations than in all her wars  of the time when tragedy flourished in greece it was not my design in this short dissertation nor could indeed be comprehended within the limits of it to point out with aristotle what tragedy ought to be but simply to show what it was during the lives of the great triumvirate as far as we can judge from the remains now extant in my account of it is several parts therefore i have not followed the steps of the great critic but principally confined myself to those particulars which distinguish the ancient from the modern drama and which may best enable us to form a proper and adequate idea of the greek tragedy but even the most perfect knowledge of all the essential and constituent parts will be found insufficient for this purpose unless we take into our view also the time when and the very spot where every piece was exhibited dramatic as well as every other species of poetry is best known and distinguished by the place of it is birth it will take it is form color and complexion from it is native soil as naturally as water derives it is taste and qualities from the different kinds of earth through which it flows it is absolutely necessary before we can judge impartially of the greek tragedies to transport ourselves to the scene where they were represented to shake off the englishman for a time and put on the athenian  it has been with great truth remarked that there is allotted to every nation upon earth a particular period which may be called their zenith of perfection to which they approach by slow degrees and from which they gradually and insensibly recede in this happy age of power and prosperity the arts and sciences taste genius and literature have always shone with distinguished luster such was the time when athens gave laws to all greece whilst the glorious victories of marathon and salamis animated every tongue with eloquence and filled every breast with exultation that haughty and successful people maintained for a long time her sovereignty over the neighboring nations her councils were influenced by prudence and her battles crowned with conquest the treasure which she had seized in the temple at delphos enabled her not only to carry on her wars with success but left her a plentiful reserve also to supply her luxuries this was the age of heroes philosophers and poets when architecture painting and sculpture fostered by the genial warmth of power and protection so conspicuously displayed their several beauties and produced all those superb monuments of ancient taste and genius which united to distinguish this illustrious era during this happy period tragedy appeared in her meridian splendour when the great triumvirate exhibited before the most polite and refined nation then upon earth those excellent pieces which extorted applause honors and rewards from their cotemporaries and ensured to them the deserved admiration of all posterity it may indeed with great truth be asserted that the same remarkable love of order and simplicity the same justness of symmetry and proportion the same elegance truth and sublimity which appeared in the buildings pictures and statues of that age are conspicuous also in the ancient drama  in the time of the greek tragedy the athenians dictated as it were to all mankind proud by nature and elated by riches and prosperity they looked down with the utmost contempt on the neighboring nations whom they styled and treated as barbarians as a republic the avowed enemies of monarchy and dependence as a free people bold and impatient of restraint or contradiction strongly attached to their own laws and customs lively and active but inconstant and superstitious their manners plain and simple but their taste at the same time elegant and refined as the theater was supported entirely at the expense of the public the public directed all it is operations we might naturally expect therefore that the poet would for his own sake take care to adapt his compositions to the public taste to fall in with national prejudices and superstitions to sooth the pride flatter the selflove and adopt the opinions of his fellowcitizens we must not wonder to hear as we constantly do in the tragedies that remain the praises of athens perpetually resounded the superiority of her laws and constitution extolled and her form of government preferred to every other oblique hints or direct accusations of folly and weakness in her enemies public facts frequently alluded to and public events recorded their own festivals sacrifices see amongst many other instances the noble description of the pythian games in the second act of electra v   p     of my translation of sophocles and the sacred grove of the eumenides in the oedipus coloneus v   p     religious rites and ceremonies carefully and accurately described sparta and thebes as rival states occasionally satyrized and condemned and above all every opportunity taken to point out the evils of monarchy and engrave their favorite democratical principles on the hearts of the people it is not improbable but that many of those moral sentences and political apothegms which at this distance of time appear cold and insipid to us had besides their general tendency some double meaning some allusion to particular facts and circumstances which gave them an additional luster without this key to the greek theater it is impossible to form a right idea of ancient tragedy which was not like our own mere matter of amusement but the channel of public instruction and the instrument of public policy those readers therefore who are utterly unacquainted with the religion laws and customs of athens are by no means adequate judges of it they only damnant quod non intelligunt quintilian condemn for the most part what they do not understand and rashly judge of the whole edifice whilst they view but an inconsiderable part of the building but so warmly are we attached to what lies before us and so prejudiced in favor of those modes and customs which are established amongst ourselves that we generally rate the merit of past performances by the standard and rule of present practice the ancients therefore are subject to the disadvantage of being tried not as justice demands by their laws but by our own  and here it is worthy of our observation to remark that the greek tragedy seems in it is whole progress to have kept pace with the place of it is birth and to have flourished and declined with it is native country the rise of athens from meanness and obscurity to power and splendour may be dated from the battle of marathon which laid the foundation of all her future glory soon after which we find aeschylus forming his plan of ancient tragedy after him arose the immortal sophocles who improved upon and greatly exceeded his illustrious master to these succeeded euripides born ten years after the battle of marathon and on the very day of the sea fight at salamis whilst these illustrious writers flourished athens flourished also for above half a century euripides was fifty years of age when the peloponnesian war began from which period the superiority of athens visibly declined and was soon entirely destroyed by the rival power of sparta in confederacy with the persian monarch sophocles happy in not surviving the honor and liberty of his country expired one year before the taking of athens by lysander when the sovereignty of greece devolved to the lacedaemonians  of the three great tragedians aeschylus was born at athens in the first year of the five hundred and forty years before christ sixtieth olympiad he embraced very early in life the profession of he had two brothers who were likewise in the army cynegirus and arminias at the battle of salamis the former lost his life the latter one of his arms arms and distinguished himself as an officer at the famous battles of marathon salamis and plataea the perpetual scenes of slaughter and bloodshed in which he was during a long series of years unavoidably engaged seem to have tinged his imagination with that portion of the fierce and terrible so distinguishable in all his pieces during the intervals of his military occupation he found time to write no less than seventy or according to some historians ninety tragedies only seven of which are now extant when he was pretty far advanced in years he lost the poetical prize to sophocles then but a boy or as other writers with more probability assert to simonides in an elegy on the heroes who fell at marathon a circumstance which so deeply affected him that he immediately withdrew from athens and retired to the court of hiero king of sicily a friend of the muses whose palace was a kind of asylum for the discontented poets of greece there we are told he lived in great affluence and splendour to the age of sixtyfive the writers of his life not willing to admit that so great a poet could dye a common death have thought proper to dignify his last moments with a circumstance which carries with it more of the mavelous than the probable an oracle had it seems declared for oracles were always ready on these occasions that aeschylus should fall by the hand of heaven accordingly that this might be fulfilled it is reported that an eagle was seen in the air holding in her talons a tortoise which unfortunately for the bard she let go and dropping on the head of aeschylus who happened to be walking beneath fractured his skull he is said to have gained thirteen victories over his rival poets which one would think was an ample recompense for the single failure that gave him so much uneasiness his tragedies were greatly admired during his life and after his death held in the highest esteem insomuch that a decree was passed by the senate declaring that if any person would exhibit the tragedies of aeschylus the state would bear the charges of the chorus and defray the whole expense of the representation an honor which probably had not been bestowed on any poet before his time though afterward as i observed above they were generally played at the public cost  aeschylus is a bold nervous animated writer his imagination fertile but licentious his judgment true but ungoverned his genius lively but uncultivated his sentiments noble and sublime but at the same time wild irregular and frequently fantastic his plots for the most part rude and inartificial his scenes unconnected and illplaced his language generally poignant and expressive though in many places turgid and obscure and even too often degenerating into fustian and bombast his characters strongly marked but all partaking of that wild fierceness which is the characteristic of their author his peculiar excellency was in raising terror and astonishment in warm and descriptive scenes of war and slaughter if we consider the state of the drama when he undertook to reform and improve it we shall behold him with admiration if we compare him with his two illustrious successors successor he hides his diminished head and appears far less conspicuous were we to draw a parallel between dramatic poetry and painting we should perhaps style him the julio romano of ancient tragedy  sophocles was born at colone a burgh or village in attica his father sophilus was as some writers tell us a much ink has been shed by the commentators on this subject both with regard to sophocles and demosthenes also who was it seems in the same predicament it not being determined whether his father was a vulcan or a common cyclop blacksmith or according to a more favorable heraldry master of a forge as the profession of arms was at that time more honorable and probably more advantageous than any other sophocles entered into it and followed the steps of his master aeschylus both as a soldier and a poet in the former capacity he had the honor to serve under the great pericles if we may believe athenaeus used to say that sophocles was a good soldier but a bad officer a circumstance which if he had not succeeded better as a poet it is probable would never have reached posterity pericles as a dramatic writer he was early distinguished for his extraordinary abilities which first placed him on a level and afterward raised him to a superiority over his illustrious rival he is supposed to have written one hundred and twenty tragedies only seven of which are now remaining these were received by his cotemporaries with the applause they so highly deserved it is remarked that he never acted himself in any of his plays as aeschylus and euripides did his voice being too weak and low for the stage though he was always present at the representation and received the applauses of the audience who we are told seldom failed to signify their approbation by a loud and general clap both at his entrance into and leaving the theater he was crowned twenty times and though he probably sometimes shared the fate of his brother poets by unjust censure could never be prevailed on as his rivals were to leave his native country to which he took it is with great reason imagined that sophocles laid the scene of his latter oedipus in colone with a purposed design of doing honor to the place of his nativity every opportunity of showing his sincerest attachment with regard to his death historians if scholiasts and commentators may be so called have indulged themselves in the same liberty which they took with his predecessor aeschylus some kill him with a grapestone others tell us that he died with joy at being crowned for one of his tragedies whilst a third set gravely assure us that having one day an inclination to play a part in his own antigone he dipped into a speech too long for his weak lungs and expired merely for want of a better breath in the midst of it  after all as sophocles according to various testimonies lived till ninety it is not improbable that he might have died of the story of his sons ingratitude told by plutarch and others is omitted here because my readers will find it related in my notes on the translation of the oedipus coloneus see v   p      sophocles had several children one of which whose name was iophon is said to have inherited the dramatic genius of his father and to have written four tragedies the names only of which are come down to us viz ilium achilles telephus and actaeon   extreme old age a distemper which is seldom perhaps more favorable to poets than to other men the athenians erected a sumptuous monument in memory of him on which was engraved a swarm of sophocles was universally styled the be some commentators have taken the bees from off his tomb and hived them in his cradle assuring us that when sophocles was an infant a swarm of them was seen to alight upon his lips which was at that time looked on as a presage of his future eloquence bees in allusion to the name generally given him on account of his verses which are indeed wonderfully soft and harmonious or as a nobler poet even than sophocles himself expresses it sweeter than honey or the honeycomb  sophocles may with great truth be called the prince of ancient dramatic poets his fables at least of all those tragedies now extant are interesting and wellchosen his plots regular and wellconducted his sentiments elegant noble and sublime his incidents natural his diction simple his manners and characters striking equal and unexceptionable his chorusses well adapted to the subject his moral reflections pertinent and useful and his numbers in every part to the last degree sweet and harmonious the warmth of his imagination is so tempered by the perfection of his judgment that his spirit however animated never wanders into licentiousness whilst at the same time the fire of his genius seldom suffers the most uninteresting parts of his tragedy to sink into coldness and insipidity his peculiar excellence seems to lie in the for a proof of this i would refer my readers to his fine description of the pythian games in the electra the distress of philoctetes in lemnos and the praises of athens in the oedipus coloneus descriptive and exclusive of his dramatic powers he is certainly a greater poet than either of his illustrious rivals were i to draw a similitude of him as i did of aeschylus from painting i should say that his ordonnance was so just his figures so well groupd and contrasted his colors so glowing and natural all his pieces in short executed in so bold and masterly a style as to wrest the palm from every other hand and point him out as the raphael of the ancient drama  euripides the son of mnesarchus and clito was a native of salamis to which place his parents had withdrawn to shelter themselves from the storm of war with which greece was threatened by the invasion of xerxes he was born in the second year of the four hundred seventy five years before christ seventyfifth olympiad in the midst of all the triumphal pomp which followed the famous victories of salamis and plataea as the genius of euripides was not turned like that of his two predecessors toward a military life he attached himself to philosophy at that time the fashionable taste and study of all greece under the celebrated anaxagoras amongst many other new opinions advanced by him had asserted that the sun was a globe of fire which gave so much offense to the ignorance and superstition of his countrymen that he was forced to submit to a voluntary exile as the only means of saving his life which would otherwise have fallen a sacrifice to the enraged multitude anaxagoras but partly perhaps from the fear of incurring his masters fate and partly from the natural bent of his own mind soon left the perplexing paths of science and gave himself up to the more inviting charms of poetry as the stage was probably then as it is now far the most lucrative branch of it he applied himself early to the writing of tragedies in which he succeeded so well as to enter the lists with aeschylus and sophocles the immortal socrates to whom we may suppose he was in a great measure indebted for the applause and encouragement bestowed on him not only honored him wit his patronage and protection but entered into the most intimate friendship and connection with him he is even said to have assisted him in several of his plays the moral and philosophic air which runs through them all seems indeed greatly to favor this opinion which was industriously propagated by his diogenes laertius speaking of socrates says  mnesilochus told the athenians that euripides was only a hammerman to socrates and calls him  the comic poets frequently reproach him for his obligations to the philosopher enemies to obscure if possible the luster of such conspicuous merit he gained some commentators correct the text of a gellius and make it fifteen five victories and is supposed to have written seventyfive tragedies only nineteen of which are now extant some the english reader may find these letters at the end of my translation of the epistles of phalaris published in      letters of euripides handed down to us take notice of a quarrel between him and sophocles and give an account also of their perfect reconciliation though his tragedies were for the most part well received by his cotemporaries we may imagine that like other poets he met with some ill treatment from them as we find him in the latter part of his life at the court of archelaus king of macedon who loaded him with favors and treated him with all the respect due to his character and abilities there we are told he lived in great affluence and splendour about three years when unfortunately wandering one day into a solitary place he was set on by a pack of hounds and one of his biographers acquaints us that the dogs were planted there on purpose and set on by a brother bard grown jealous of his rising reputation who took this opportunity to dispatch him whether there be any truth in the whole story is extremely disputable the author however might very well expect to gain credit for it as it has been customary time out of mind and continues so to this day for rival poets to tear one another to pieces torn to pieces at the age of seventyfive aulus gellius informs us that the athenians sent to macedon for his body and had prepared to grace it with a pompous and splendid funeral but the macedonians refusing to deliver it they contented themselves with erecting a magnificent tomb to his memory and graving his name and honors on the empty marble a copy of his works was carefully deposited amongst the archives and so highly esteemed that a king of egypt in vain for a long time solicited a copy of them which the athenians positively refused till a famine happening in greece the king in return refused to sell them corn necessity at last prevailing they parted with the manuscript and the king acknowledged so singular a favor by permitting the merchants of athens to take away as much corn as they wanted without paying the usual tribute  in such high esteem were the works of this poet that many noble athenians being taken prisoners at this story is told at large in a small and elegant tract lately published entitled an essay on the influence of philosophy upon the fine arts p    syracuse the unfortunate captives were all put to death except those who could repeat any passages from the plays of euripides these men and these alone they pardoned caressed treated with the utmost respect and afterward set them at liberty  euripides fortunately for his own character as well as for posterity is come down to us more perfect and entire than either of his cotemporaries his merit therefore is more easily ascertained his fables are generally interesting his plots frequently irregular and artificial his characters sometimes unequal but for the most part striking and well contrasted his sentiments remarkably fine just and proper his diction soft elegant and persuasive he abounds much more in moral apophthegms and reflections than aeschylus or sophocles which as they are not always introduced with propriety give some of his tragedies a stiff and scholastic appearance with which the severer critics have not failed to reproach him it is most probable however that in this he complied with the taste of his age and in obedience to the dictates of his friend and master socrates who we may suppose thought it no disgrace to this favorite poet to deviate from the rigid rules of the drama in order to render it more subservient to the noble purposes of piety and virtue there is besides in his dialogue a didactic and argumentative turn which savours strongly of the socratic disputant and which probably procured him the name of the  philosopher of the theater  it is said of sophocles that he painted men as they ought to be of euripides that he painted them as they were a quaint remark which i shall leave the critics to comment and explain only observing that the latter is much more familiar than the former descends much lower into private life and consequently lets down in some measure the dignity of the buskin which in sophocles is always carefully supported there are some scenes in euripides where the ideas are so course and the expression so low and vulgar as if translated with the utmost caution would perhaps greatly shock the delicacy and refinement of modern manners the feeling reader notwithstanding will be amply recompensed by that large portion of the tender and pathetic the peculiar excellency of this poet which is diffused throughout his works his chorusses are remarkably beautiful and poetical they do not indeed as aristotle has observed always naturally arise from and correspond with the incidents of the drama this fault however his chorusses generally make amends for by the harmony of their numbers and the many fine moral and religious sentiments which they contain  upon the whole though euripides had not perhaps so sublime a genius as aeschylus or a judgment so perfect as sophocles he seems to have written more to the heart than either of them and if i were to place him with the other two in the school of painters i should be inclined from the softness of his pencil to call him the corregio of the ancient drama  from the works of these three illustrious writers and from them of all the greek tragedies produced by various writers and which are almost innumerable we have only thirtythree now remaining though according to the generally received account no less than two hundred and sixty or upwards were written only by the three great tragedians all the rest except a few inconsiderable fragments fell a sacrifice to barbarity and are buried in oblivion alone we must draw all our knowledge of the ancient greek tragedy which in the view we have here taken of it appears to be full complete and perfect and has been miserably disjointed and torn to pieces by the moderns from the ruins of this noble edifice have arisen two very imperfect structures the opera and tragedy of latter times both greatly though not equally defective the former confining itself merely to the eye and ear makes but a slight impression on the mind whilst the latter from it is omission of the chorus music scenery and decoration falls short of that beauty and perfection which is only to be found in the ancient drama we must at the same time fairly acknowledge that our manners and customs our opinions views taste and judgment are so different from those of greece that her drama is by no means in every respect a proper model and standard for modern poets and must after all we can advance in it is favor always remain among those reproachful monuments of the purity and simplicity of former ages which we cannot imitate though we are forced to admire  it must be confessed that ancient tragedy has it is share with every thing else of human imperfection too strict an attention to the unities has fettered and confined it many of it is beauties are merely local and temporal the plots are frequently uninteresting and illconducted the speeches either too long or too short the expressions sometimes course and indelicate in the general management and representation of the whole too much is sacrificed to popular prejudice superstition and vanity the ruling passions of an athenian audience too strong an attachment to the laws customs and form of government then prevailing threw a dull air of uniformity over the drama the same story the same characters and sentiments even the same expressions too often occur in different tragedies that simplicity which so distinguished the manners of the ancients had naturally it is influence over their taste also they selected one plain but noble object and all the variety which their dramatic poets aimed at or which the spectators required of them was to place that in different lights without suffering any other to intercept the prospect of it they admitted no episodes underplots or any of those extraneous incidental ornaments which make up modern performances one of the greatest advantages of modern tragedy over the ancient is perhaps it is judicious descent from the adventures of demigods kings and heroes into the humbler walk of private life which is much more interesting to the generality of mankind and confined themseves principally to the faults and perfections of the great as milton observes of them high actions and high passions best describing but because their taste was more correct and severe it does by no means follow that it was less true and perfect than our own the moderns heap incident on incident sentiment on sentiment and character on character a change which is perhaps rather to be attributed to the corruption of our taste than to the improvement of it it is always a mark of a vitiated stomach when wholesome and natural food is rejected with disgust and provocatives used to raise the appetite in the same manner i cannot but be of opinion that our impatient thirst after what critics affect to call business is nothing but the result of false taste and depraved judgment because ancient tragedy is not crowded with a heap of unnatural episodes stuffed with similies metaphors imagery and poetical flowers the moderns treat it with contempt and find nothing in it but a poverty of sentiment a want of order and connection in the scenes a flatness and insipidity in the dialogue a coarseness and indelicacy in the expression but even if we should grant the truth of every objection there would still remain to compensate for all these real or seeming imperfections a variety of true and striking beauties in ancient tragedy and there only we shall find a most exact and faithful picture of the manners of greece it is religious and civil policy sublimity both of sentiment and diction regularity symmetry and proportion excellent moral aphorisms and reflections together with a most elegant and amiable simplicity diffused through every page  in a word to affirm as many who have more learning than judgment sometimes will that there are no good tragedies but the ancient is the affectation of scholastic pedantry to deny them their deserved applause and treat them with ridicule and contempt is on the other hand the effect of modern pride ignorance and petulancy upon the whole french italian spanish and german critics may perhaps find some excuse for their severe animadversions on the ancient greek tragedy it may exercise their envy and find employment for their spleen and ill nature as they have nothing of their own to put in competition with it but englishmen should be above such envy and such malevolence because they can boast a dramatic writer superior to all that antiquity ever produced we may safely join with the most sanguine partisans of aeschylus sophocles and euripides in the sincerest admiration of their several excellencies and rejoice within ourselves to see them all united and surpassed in the immortal and inimitable shakespeare  finis
