the history of john of bourbon prince of carency containing a variety of entertaining novels viz   the surprise or the generous unknown   the mutual mistake or the unhappy discovery   the secret rival or the deceitful friend   the perfidious lady disappointed or the happy reconciliation   the slighted passion or the fatal resentment   the unfortunate lover   the female captives   the distressed lovers   the revengeful rival  0 the happy meeting or constant love rewarded   written in french by the countess daunois author of the ladies travels into spain translated into english  the second edition  london printed for j peele at lockes head in paternoster row mdccxxiv  the preface this translation was at first designed as an amusement without any intention of making it public the translator not presuming to succeed in the delicacy and politeness of a dialect peculiar to heroism but as the countess d aunois is the author of this piece and as most of her works have had the good fortune to meet with a favorable reception he was induced to hope it might obtain the like success besides he would not have ventured to deliver it to the press had he not consulted with some judicious persons who had read the original in french and were pleased to honor it with their sanction  it must be owned at the same time that this is not a literal translation for though in the french the characters are well drawn and the adventures agreeably related it was thought proper to retrench some surperfluous repetitions which are frequently remarked in stories of this nature written in that language  as to the last incident which is the murder of leonida succeeded by the marriage of the prince of carency to another lady that circumstance with the conclusion is entirely altered and it is presumed that those who shall take the trouble of comparing this with the original will approve the design since it seems unreasonable that leonida who was a perfection of virtue and beauty should die a tragic death and that the prince of carency who was so passionatly in love with her should after her cruel fate conceive tender sentiments for any other lady a character not becoming a hero however if the public should censure this opinion the translator must then submit to their unquestioned judgment and he humbly hopes that in consideration this is his first essay they will out of their candor and good nature pardon whatever fault they find in the attempt  the prince of carency the duchess of lancaster daughter of don pedro king of castile could not without the greatest concern see don johns accession to a throne where she should have been placed were not her fathers misfortunes the unhappy cause she very much solicited the duke her husband to declare war against him which he was inclined to only waited for a favorable occasion of making an alliance  at this juncture ferdinand king of portugal who often had differences about matters of interest with the king of castile gave the duke of lancaster an opportunity of declaring his intentions and sent to him desiring he would join with him in the conquest of their common enemy the duke without delay set out with a considerable number of forces and took with him his wife and three daughters these ladies were very beautiful and the youngest whose name was catherine being the only daughter of his second marriage had pretensions to the crown of spain by right of the duchess her mother who was heiress to that dominion  the king of castile finding that two such potent enemies had declared against him applied to his allies but more particularly to charles the vith king of france to whom he already owed many obligations that prince sent him men and money and fortune declaring in his favor he defeated the english and portuguese in several engagements the sickness produced by the climate was even more destructive to them than his arms but having weighty reasons to wish for peace and knowing that the duke of lancaster had left the king of portugal with some disgust he sent the prior of guadalupe to him at bayonne with considerable offers and a proposal of marriage between his son henry prince of asturias and the princess catherine daughter of the duke which he represented to be the only means of placing her on the throne of spain and at the same time promised he should have sufficient reason to be satisfied with their alliance  the duke received with pleasure this overture of peace being in all respects agreeable to his interest and the kings ambassadors performed the ceremony of marriage at bayonne the duchess of lancaster left biscay to conduct her daughter to medina del campo where the king received them with all the magnificence imaginable she there presented him in the name of the duke her husband with a crown of gold embellished with jewels and told him with a majestic air that since she had yielded to him the right she had to the kingdom of castile it was but just he should receive the crown from the duke her lord the king answered that he only accepted of it with a design of putting it on the princesss head as soon as his son should be of age the young prince being then but ten years old  the duke of lancaster remained all this time at bayonne though he passionately wished to see the king that he might endeavor to disingage him from the french interest but the spanish monarch was too sensible of the services he had received to have any wrong proceedings with the king of france in such a conjuncture therefore declined the interview which the duke desired and being indisposed at burgos took leave of the duchess in that place  charles the vith being informed of the king of castiles conduct in what related to him thought himself so highly obliged that he chose john of bourbon count of la march his kinsman as ambassador to that prince who had orders to tell him that he should ever embrace all occasions of expressing his gratitude for the value he was pleased to set on their alliance the count of la march was more capable than any of making known the sentiments of his king being of the first rank by his birth and fortune and by his great qualities esteemed one of the finest gentlemen of france  after having acquitted himself of his commission to the king of castile he contracted a friendship with don john of velasco who had married a french lady daughter of arnauld of solier she had for her fortune the city of vilalpendo which is one of the greatest in castile velasco by his birth yielded to none but princes of the blood and his merit was equally great dona maria his wife preferred the french to all other nations and inspired her husband with the same sentiments the count of la march had already so great an esteem for them that considering their vast fortune was to be inherited by an only daughter he resolved to propose a marriage between her and john of bourbon prince of carency the youngest of his sons  having meditated sometime on this affair he visited don john of velasco and among other things told him he had three sons that the king his master had provided for the two eldest and that the youngest was still at his disposal i am satisfied said he i should have no reason to complain of his fate were he destined to your daughter therefore if nothing opposes our alliances i ask her for him your proposal my lord replied don john of velasco is so obliging that i have room to believe you sincerely wish it she is yet but four years old and the prince your son but eight to what end can we dispose of the destiny of persons so little advanced in years that ought not to be the least obstacle said the count we can sign the contract of marriage and i will send the prince to you that you may form him for leonida i dont question but you will like him he is a fine youth and his sense exceeds his years you will be under no difficulty interrupted madam velasco to persuade us into an opinion of your sons merit it is sufficient that he is of your illustrious blood by what you are my lord we judge what he may be and i thank heaven that you have such favorable dispositions for leonida from her birth i designed her for one of my country which is still dear to me and don john sets no less a value on it than i it is true replied don john i have a great veneration for the french and am very sensible of their desert judge then added he with what pleasure we accept the offer you make leonida which is as much above our hopes as her merit this conversation ended with all the assurances of a perfect friendship and the articles of marriage were drawn the count of la march sent his to the king of france don john carried his to the king of castile and each consented to the agreement don john made his daughters fortune very considerable and the whole court was pleased with the match  some time after the count of la march preparing for his return into france asked don john of velasco and his lady whether they were willing he should send his son to them no my lord said they let him remain in your hands as a token of our love and esteem the education you will give him will make him an accomplished prince and we hope you will not part with him till he has taken a perfect impression of your great example the count promised he would take all the care imaginable to render his son worthy of being allied to them then took his leave  the king of castile acquitted himself by the count of the many acknowledgments he owed charles the vith and writing to that prince told him he could not sufficiently praise the merit and conduct of his ambassador the count had not been long arrived at the court of france when news came of the king of castiles death by a fall from his horse and his son don henry sent an account of it by don john of velasco the count of la march took that opportunity to do him all the honors of a court where he held a considerable rank being nearly related to the king he presented the prince of carency to him whom he found to be a finer youth than he imagined and from that time conceived as great an affection for him as if he had actually been happy in the possession of leonida the peace and tranquillity which france then enjoyed was soon after disturbed by an accident that happened to the king who being struck with terror and surprise at an apparation fell into a delirium which continued for some time  at this juncture there was a very nice negotiation to be carried on in spain and the dukes of berry and burgundy uncles to the king having taken upon them the administration of affairs looked on the count of la march as the most capable person to manage it the seeming pretense of his embassy was the usual compliments to the king and the infanta his brother on their marriage the one being lately married to the princess of lancaster and the other to the young countess of alburquerck who was one of the richest heiresss in europe the count of la march at his arrival in spain found don john of velasco in great favor at court the king having made him highsteward of his household and leonida though not above nine years of age was made one of the maids of honor to the queen and bred up in the palace  madam velasco was extremely pleased to see the count again and her satisfaction was so much the greater when he declared he had never seen any thing comparable to the beauty of her daughter he was so surpised when he saw her that he could not at first express his admiration her hair was black and her complexion as fair as possible it may be generally said of the spanish ladies that they have much finer eyes than those of other countries leonidas were so full of life and spirit that one could hardly withstand their brightness yet they retained all that air of sweetness and modesty which becomes her sex so well in short the beauties of her mind were as perfect as the charms of her person and the count of la march was so taken with her that had not his glory and the kings service called him back for france he willingly for her sake would have stayed longer at that court some time after his return he was sent against the english over whom he had the good fortune of getting so many advantages as obliged them to wish for peace which soon after was happily concluded with proposals made by king richard of a marriage with isabella of france but the count of la march had not the satisfaction to be at the conclusion of it being forced by his indisposition to retire to vandome for some relief and finding there that his illness increased he did not doubt but he was very near taking leave of the world therefore sent for the prince of carency and in a feeble voice thus said to him the condition i am in my dear son would give me great concern had i not procured a father for you in don john of velasco i am persuaded you will find no difference betwixt his house and mine therefore perform the promise i have made for you marry leonida it is your dying fathers command tell your brothers how dear they have been to me and that i recommend them to the care of heaven do not render your selves unworthy of your name prefer honor to life and never omit what you owe to god or your king i had rather see you dead than survive a disgrace owing to ill conduct and as for you my dear child it is a great consolation to me in dying to believe your inclinations will answer the advice i now give you the young prince filled with grief fell at his fathers feet and in spite of the sobs which prevented his utterance he endeavored to express himself in terms so moving and generous that the count of la march after so great a satisfaction had little regret in dying  the year following sigismund king of hungary sent ambassadors into france to desire charles the sixth to assist him with troops being resolved to engage bajazet those ministers gave the king an account how that the emperor john palealogus had called that enemy of the christians to his assistance against the despote of bulgaria and that bajazet making use of the advantages he had obtained would not leave a country where they had so imprudently let him enter the king concerned at the condition of sigismund permitted most of the youth of france to make an expedition in his favor the young count of nevers who was then but twenty four years old put himself at the head of the young noblemen who were very numerous among others james of bourbon count of la march highly distinguished himself the prince of carency his brother made this campaign with him and it is impossible to express the joy he received at having so early an opportunity of proving his courage  the particulars of this expedition i refer to the historian and shall only say there never was a more unhappy campaign bajazet having defeated the christian troops made a horrible slaughter amongst the french and with much difficulty consented to ransom five or six the count of la march and his brother were dangerously wounded and made prisoners before nicopolis the prince of carency was so afflicted at the disaster of his brother that in his confinement he neither thought of the danger of his own wounds nor his lost liberty when the count of la march was recovered and able to take care of his and his brothers fortune he heard with mortal displeasure the resolution bajazet had taken of putting all the prisoners to the sword and many were executed in that cruel manner when the count of nevers presenting his head to receive the fatal blow an old turk famous for his predictions cried out addressing himself to bajazet spare that young prince for he will destroy more christians than all your arms these words preserved the life they were going to deprive him of and the event answered the prophesy the prince of carency appeared in his turn and the deplorable state he was in at so tender an age did no ways lessen that noble air which distinguishes a man of birth and courage from a common person he was so perfectly handsome that bajazet himself was under some surprise and irresolute whether he should put him to death or be contented with his ransom but after some suspense the happy destiny of the prince triumphed over the natural barbarity of the other and life was granted to him and his brother upon condition that a considerable sum should be paid for their ransom they writ to their brother the count of vandome about it but while they were expecting an answer from france they heard that the count of nevers had paid his and was preparing to return  one night the prince not having a mind to retire as he was walking very disconsolate on the leads of the tower where he was a prisoner heard the whistling of an arrow which fell at his feet he thought at first that some person had a design upon his life but stooping to take it up perceived a letter tied to it which contained these words written in lingua franca  when you appeared before the sultan loaded with chains and in expectation of immediate death did you think you could move any thing but pity you inspired at that time more than you can imagine love hid in your eyes from a captive rendered you a conqueror alas i saw you my dearest prince and from that fatal moment my heart rebelled against my reason and forced from me numberless sighs methinks i see you i imagine i speak to you and all my thoughts are of you i almost persuade my self that my sentiments make a deep impression on you and that our souls already united flatter us with a perfect felicity but alas that would be too great a happiness i dare not hope nor even desire it and should sooner resolve upon death than make these sentiments known to you were not i persuaded you will never know who i am and far from taking any advantage of my weakness you will leave nicopolis without seeing me oh how unfortunate am i to find consolation in being distant from the object i love consider this extremity and if you cannot love me because unknown at least do not refuse me your pity i assure you it shall not prevail with me for i will soon put it in your power to leave this place i know your ransom is not come with that of the christian prince and that he is preparing to go without you but do not afflict your self all things are possible to love write to me to morrow at the same hour you receive this convey it by the same messenger to the foot of the tower and learn betimes to be secret oh of all mortals you are the most amiable why have i seen you and why must i never see you more   the young prince was not a little surpised at what he read it seemed to him so tender that he felt an extreme desire to see the person who expressed so extraordinary a passion for him and expected with the greatest impatience the time that he was to return an answer he went as he used to do to the top of the tower and there made a signal to the messenger who was waiting for it then flung his letter over which was written in these terms  you are the first that ever made me sigh and the sacrifice i offer you madam of the first motions of my affection ought to give me some place in your favor i thought till now it was impossible to love what one never saw but the uneasiness i feel and the ardent desire i have to see you convince me you are already too dear for my peace you render me the most unhappy of all mankind if you deny me the means of making my retributions and entertaining you with my transports is it possible you can refuse me that favor and at the same time express so real a passion for me what madam can you consent i should go from a place where you are oh rather leave me in my prison since i am destined to wear your chains   it was very late before the prince retired in hopes the fair unknown would have sent him a second letter the same way he received the first but was disappointed he went again the next day upon the tower where every thing appeared so silent that he had no room to flatter himself with what he so much wished is it possible said he to his brother who was prisoner in the same place with him and to whom he had told this adventure is it possible that the person who writ this letter sought only to divert her self at my expense the oftener i read it the more reason i have to believe it sincere for i am persuaded there is a smypathy in hearts and therefore it is impossible to be so touched with what is counterfeited i am convinced of what you say replied the count of la march and have my self experienced it which inclines me to think some other reason obliges your unknown not to write they passed the greatest part of the day on the top of the tower entertaining each other after this manner till at last night coming on without any hopes of a second letter they retired the prince returned to his chamber more melancholy than ever he had been but he was no sooner entered when he saw on a little cedar table a toilet richly embroidered with the cipher of his name woven in gold the work was perfectly fine it covered a scymiter embellished with jewels and a little casket with golden plates which he opened with great precipitation and found a letter in it with a sum that far exceeded his ransom here is what was wrote in the same hand with the first  go young prince go far from a place where my passion may prove fatal to you expect no more letters from me this is the last you will receive oh heavens i am going to lose you and lose you for ever why have not i power to follow you and render my fortune inseparable from yours i shall never more know your sentiments you will forget me before it is possible for me to think of any thing but you or cease to love you my wishes shall ever attend you pity me dear prince since i must pass my sorrowful life in bemoaning your absence and my misfortunes   the prince of carency admired the proceedings of this generous lady and his gratitude was of such a nature that the most transcendent passion could not have made a deeper impression for when he considered he was to lose even the hopes of ever seeing her his violent displeasure took place of all the joy he ought to have felt at being in a condition to pay his ransom and return to france he bid one of his guards go and tell the count of la march that he wanted to speak with him but first took care to hide the magnificent present he had just received  the count came immediately to him and saw in his eyes an extraordinary air of grief at soon as they were alone the prince flung his arms about his brothers neck i want your consolation dear brother said he for i can receive it only from you see continued he showing him the casket and letter see what i owe to my unknown and the necessity she imposes on me to go away without seeing her can any thing be more great or noble or can there be any thing more soft or moving than the words she imploys to bid me adieu oh how fatal will her generosity be to me since i must even lose the hopes of knowing who she is here he was silent but after having meditated some time she loves me said he and i burn with a more than equal passion for her why must i then leave nicopolis in remaining here i may discover the person to whom i am so highly indebted and if possible obtain the happiness of seeing her for love certainly is too good a guide to forsake me in so fair a way the count of la march who loved his brother entirely was of opinion that so magnificent a present could not come from any one but a person of the first rank and that if he exposed himself by making an enquiry after her and penetrated into a mystery that perhaps ought not to be disclosed he might create himself enemies which would be of a very dangerous consequence in a country where neither his birth nor merit could protect him and where the name of a christian was a crime great enough to deserve punishment full of these thoughts he conjured his brother in the most engaging terms not to persist in a thing which lay under so many difficulties and represented to him that he might not only ruin himself but also be the occasion of undoing the person whom he so dearly loved could you ever forgive your self said he so imprudent an action the lady loves you and were it possible for her to see you without danger she would have found means to favor your request therefore dear brother let us go away with the count of nevers and embrace the favorable disposition bajazet is in at present his capriciousness is ever to be feared and should he change his mind what would become of us  although the count of la marchs arguments were very weighty the prince was unwilling to submit to them having a strong desire to find out by what means the casket and scymiter were conveyed into his chamber he might easily imagine that one of his guards had been bribed but as it was hard to discover the person fearing he should apply to the wrong man he thought fit to be silent so took his leave of nicopolis without knowing to whom he owed the highest obligations  the prince of carencys thoughts were constantly employed on his generous unknown and after his arrival at the court of france he found a secret consolation in making her the subject of his discourse with the counts of la march and vandome who equally admired a passion so discrect and a generosity without hopes of any return most women that are in love and make presents said they have generally some view that tends to their private satisfaction they endeavor to gain a heart by gratitude when they cannot conquer it by their beauty but this illustrious foreigner said the prince aimed at nothing but procuring my liberty since she even commanded me to quit the only place where i could have seen her he used to talk so often of her that the count of la march feared he had some design of returning to misia in order to discover who this charmer was this made him entreat the prince to write an obliging letter to don john of velasco to put him in mind of their contract and assure him that he only expected his commands to go for spain the prince having yielded to this request consider well said he to his brother the violence i do my self shall i not be for ever unhappy in marrying a person for whom i have no inclination you know very well that my heart is filled with another object it is true replied the count you love an unknown person who probably you will never see you do not even know her name and perhaps she is no longer at nicopolis remember brother that leonida must crown your felicity she is a great fortune and very beautiful how easy it is interrupted the prince to advise others and imagine that a heart ought always to sumbit to reason but alas it too often rebels and never suffers greater torments than when it is forced into an engagement by the choice of others the count of la march was doing all his endeavors to inspire other sentiments in his brother which he hoped time might effect  the prince of carency continued extremely melancholy till he received letters from don john wherein he assured him that his daughter should never be disposed of to any one but himself but that being very young he desired the marriage might be deferred for some years and advised him to employ that time in traveling this last request gave no small satisfaction to the prince and as the marshall of boucicault was going then to take possession of genoa which had surrendered voluntarily to the king of france he embraced that opportunity and went along with him to see that great city which passes for one of the finest in europe as so many have given a description of it i shall only pursue my story  the marshall did not make a long stay at genoa being commanded to go from thence to constantinople with a fresh army which became dreadful to bajazet the prince of carency acquainted the marshall with the design he had to accompany him in that expedition but the latter being informed by the counts of la march and vandome of the passion he had for an unknown lady at nicopolis and knowing that he was contracted to leonida spoke to him in obliging terms and represented how much his honor was concerned in the performance of his promise to a person of so considerable a rank declaring at the same time that if he insisted on going with him he would be forced to inform the court of it these reasons obliged the prince to remain at genoa in the senator grimaldis house which had been offered to him in a most civil manner  one night the prince being more melancholy than usual went alone to the mole which affords a fine prospect and continued his walk along the shore till he insensibly found himself a great way from the city how unhappy is my fate said he sighing i love and am beloved but know not the object of my passion i can hear nothing concerning her fortune nor give her any account of mine neither can i tell where to find the lady whose generosity has only served to destroy my peace he was lost in these melancholy thoughts which were succeeded by others of a more tormenting nature why continued he did my father sacrifice me to one whom i can never think agreeable since i adore another yet something tells me it is a crime to disobey him oh too charming unknown cried he were you but informed of the state i am in you would recall me to you but what do i say that is a happiness i dare not hope she paid my ransom and commanded me to go it is possible she now loves me no more or strives to forget me and in either of the two i find but subject to torment me  these different reflections were perplexing the prince when of a sudden night came on with rain and terrible thunder which obliged him to direct his course along the wall of a park where he found a door that led him through a long alley of orange trees to a fine pavilion here he observed a low parlour the pannels of which were gilded and the roof finely painted as the weather was excessive hot the windows were open and there being lights in the room they gave him an opportunity of seeing one of the most beautiful persons in the world leaning on a couch she seemed asleep holding her handkerchief in in her hand a mourning veil covered half her neck and in this posture she inspired both love and respect  the prince stood some time at the window and perceiving that every thing was silent went into the parlour and kneeled by her the better to consider her charms she appeared pale and dejected and though asleep fetched deep sighs which were followed by tears that found a passage through her closed eyelids who merits this grief said he from so lovely a creature is it a husband or a lover you deplore he stopped here and reflected on chance that had conducted him to a place so dangerous to his liberty then he continued who can deserve those sighs and tears he looked with admiration on the exact proportion of her features the whiteness of her hands and arms the beauty of her neck and color of her hair his eyes fixed on so divine an object had already betrayed his heart and he had not well recovered the first effects of his surprise when the lady waked who appeared to be seized with fear which had like to have thrown her into a swoon he attributed this to the custom observed by the ladies of italy never to see men in their own apartments and thought she might be married to some jealous husband who finding a man in his house so late might have some suspicion which would prove of a fatal consequence to a person for whom he had already conceived so great a passion i am extremely concerned madam said he at the disorder i have occasioned but will retire with regret from a place which gives me so much pleasure no no replied she my dear lover flinging her arms about his neck do not leave me i love you too well to be frightened though my astonishment is great be witness of the tears i shed for your loss ah dear shade why did that terrible engagement part us the prince comprehended nothing of this obscure speech yet thought himself happy in the caresses he received and as the name of a lover pleased him that of a shade surpised and afflicted him the sensibility he had shown on this occasion might have convinced this fair creature that he was not one of the other world but her mind was so possessed with his being dead that she spoke to him as to a ghost which obliged him to say in a melancholy accent i find madam you are deceived in favor of some resemblance and i protest were i dead and deplored by you i should think my self much happier than living and indifferent to you alas i am not the object of your love who then my dear replied she with precipitation what sorrow could be equal to mine when i heard you were lost in returning from nicopolis and that after having escaped the fury of bajazet it was your misfortune to perish by your ships being blown up in an engagement i own to you as i could not believe you safe after so probable a relation i gave my self up entirely to grief am i not very unhappy said i to have procured him his liberty by paying his ransom since it has forwarded his end but oh heavens can any joy or surprise be equal to mine you are living my dearest lover and your eyes tell me you live for me read the motions of mine they will convince you i live for you alone  these words were so moving that the prince could not doubt any longer but this lady who entertained him so tenderly was his unknown of nicopolis and this opinion occasioned a joy which he could neither conceal nor express but thought he should die in ecstasie at his mistrisss feet he looked upon it as a miracle of love and fortune that he should unexpectedly find so surprising a beauty and he the object of her passion he fixed his lips on her hand and kissed it with such transports as he had never felt before their discourse had no more coherence but their sighs expressed enough the state of their souls the night was far advanced when they were interrupted by one of the ladys women who came to give her notice that her father was just arrived we must part my dear lover said she to the prince return to genoa and in two days come here again the same way and at the same hour i shall expect you in this place must i leave you madam cried he with a dejected air no i cannot resolve it oh rather consent i should remain here no danger can alarm me where you are present what you ask said she is impossible go my lord all i can do for you is to give you my picture which i sat for with a design to send to you when you were in confinement here it is continued she taking it from off her arm and tying it on his let nothing in the world make you neglect so precious a pledge of my affection he threw himself on his knees and would have expressed his acknowledgments to her but she left him fearing they should be surpised by her father  she was hardly gone when the prince abandoned himself to all the reflections that could attend so extraordinary an adventure love cried he what have i done for thee to merit these favors is thy goodness lasting and may not i apprehend that by some fatal turn thou will destroy a prosperity so little expected day began to appear when he perceived he was still in the parlour and fearing his staying longer there might be of some prejudice to his adored mistress he left the place with precipitation and returned to the senator grimaldis  as soon as he arrived he threw himself on his bed but could not sleep his mind was so much employed on the thoughts of his charming unknown he had his eyes continually fixed on her picture and fancied in her absence he could not have a companion more dear he rose very early and the senator hearing he was dressed came to wait on him and wondered to see in his countenance more gaiety and satisfaction than he had ever remarked before my lord said he with an obliging air though i have been in the greatest uneasiness about you not knowing what accident might have detained you a whole night alone in a country where you have so few acquaintance i no longer doubt but you have met with some agreeable adventure for i find you so different from what you commonly are that i cannot help congratulating you on it the prince though a little surpised at what the senator said to him having naturally so much discretion as not to be capable of disclosing a secret relating to love excused himself as a man of gallantry would do on such an occasion and turned the conversation on another subject when there came one who interrupting them told the senator that the count of fiesque was come to see him he rose up and said to the prince this gentleman my lord is of a birth and merit so distinguished that nothing can be added to the sentiments of esteem and consideration we all have for him he has lost a brother who was not inferior to him and who resembled you extremely in finishing these words he went to his own apartment to receive the count of fiesque  in a little time after the senator returned with the count and presented him to the prince who received him after so polite a manner that he could have no reason to be displeased at his visit and during their conversation he looked at the prince with such marks of astonishment that he perceived the count had found in him the resemblance which the senator had just spoke of you look at me so attentively my lord said the prince that i should think my self happy could the motive that engages you to it acquire me your friendship that can be of no service to a person of your distinction replied the count with great civility it is impossible to see you my lord and not have a particular esteem for you but i own that so perfect a likeness affects me very much and that if i were not well assured of my brothers misfortune i should have sufficient reason to doubt it in seeing you they afterward turned their discourse on other things and parted with true sentiments of esteem for each other  the prince of carency passed the rest of that day and the next in making visits and as he designed to stay at genoa so long as would be agreeable to his unknown he was desirous of being acquainted with persons of the greatest consideration there the senator grimaldi approving his design proposed to wait on him to brancaleon dorias who for his eminent qualities was highly respected in the republic it is not long said he since he returned from sardinia where he went to succor the king of sicily whom on this occasion he generously served having acted contrary to his own interest in regard to some particular pretensions he had on that kingdom the senator gave the prince a true character of this lord and added that signora doria his lady who was a person of great merit was still at cagliari if you please my lord said he we will go and make him a visit at his country house i am sure you will be charmed with the beauty and wit of his daughter which may induce you to stay some time in this place for no body can see her with indifferency if she be so dangerous as you represent her i should avoid seeing her said the prince but i confess to you continued he smiling that the present situation of my heart puts me out of her power i left a mistress at nicopolis who entirely possesses my thoughts i believe you my lord replied the senator smiling in his turn but am a little afraid you were not so faithful last night as you say in the remembrance of that amiable stranger  as the princes appointment was at night he hastened to signor dorias that he might return home time enough to obey the commands of his unknown the senator upon the road told him the young ladys name was olympia that she was passionately in love with the late count of la vagne and that the houses of fiesque and doria had a mortal aversion for each other which hindered her father from consenting to their marriage that although they were reduced to despair yet the obstacles they met with served only to increase their affection and that the count thought by absenting himself from genoa for some time signor dorias hatred might diminish but this departure proved fatal to him for soon after news came of his death olympia far from concealing her grief yielded her self up entirely to it which was feared she could not outlive the prince knowing by experience that of all passions love had the greatest empire he extremely deplored the fate of this fair lady it is a great unhappiness indeed said he to be separated for ever from the person we love in finishing these words they found themselves near the house they were going to so that he could not help interrupting himself by praising it he had sufficient knowledge in architecture to know a well finished building and in this he found order magnificence and a fine situation  the senator grimaldi introduced the prince to signor doria who gave him a reception equal to his rank and during their conversation said he had never seen two persons so like each other as the prince and the count of la vagne this gave the senator an opportunity of desiring signor doria to present him to olympia i could hardly dispense with my not answering your request replied he but that i am assured the presence of the prince will renew her sorrow and only serve to inspire us with pity he asked them to walk into a garden joining to his apartment from whence they saw a vast number of fountains playing whose waters seemed to pierce the clouds and made by their fall a pleasing noise that inspired agreeable thoughts from thence they went into a labyrinth at the end of the garden and through a little alley of jessamine he led them into a grotto but was not a little surpised to find his daughter there who had retired to be more at liberty to indulge those ideas that were most pleasing to her  how astonished was the prince when he saw olympia and knew her to be the same lady he found asleep in the parlour and for whom he had already conceived so great a passion and how great was her surprise when she saw her supposed lover with her father who seemed to have no longer an aversion for him she looked with some disorder at the prince whose confusion increased at the thoughts of what he had just heard of the count of la vagne the condition of their souls was equally painted in their eyes and the senator grimaldi began to penetrate into part of the mystery when olympia advancing toward her father flung her self at his feet oh sir said she oh my father is it possible that you have at last pitied our sufferings and that you your self restore me my lover at these words the prince could no longer be unacquainted with his misfortune he turned pale and trembling supported himself against a pyramid of pebbles but his affliction being superior to his courage he had like to have expired on the place signor doria who was possessed of nothing but olympias error thought only of undeceiving her my dear daughter said he the prince of carency whom you see here is a prince of the house of france who does not know you nor did you ever see him before you are deceived by the resemblance there is between him and the count of la vagne i wish that too unfortunate gentleman were not lost i would no longer oppose your mutual desires these words were daggers to her heart she turned her eyes on the prince and fixed them on him a great while without having power to speak then changing her color fainted away and remained without any sense of life signor doria ran for help whilst the despairing prince gathering new strength from his passion took her in his arms and pressing her tenderly said in a low voice interrupted with sighs have not i given you my heart madam could the count of la vagne love you more than i who cannot think myself undeserving of the declaration you made me since i adore you with too much ardour ever to change and i hope my constancy will make some impression on you while the prince was speaking thus without being heard by olympia signor doria and the senator brought some water from a fountain that was near and having sprinkled a great deal on her she recovered but finding her self in the princes arms ah leave me my lord said she looking at him with a languishing air and endeavoring to disengage her self you have deceived me and interrupted my grief but death shall soon repair an error which was not voluntary it is impossible to express the state the prince was in who found himself distractedly in love without any hopes of a return he heard his mistress regret her mistake and retract the professions she had made him he secretly reproached himself for having been inconstant to his unknown of nicopolis but could not be enough surpised at the fatal likeness between him and the count of vagne and the similitude of their fortunes they being in the campaign of misia both taken prisoners by bajazet sent to nicopolis and ransomed by their mistrisses every thing had so strange an affinity that the prince had reason to think himself the most unhappy of all mankind  olympias women being come they took her from the prince who followed her into her apartment she was laid on the bed which he approached but as soon as she perceived him she turned her face from him and abandoned her self to grief what have i done madam said he to deserve your disdain you have rendered your self mistress of my heart and prevented me declaring my sentiments to you by generously confessing yours in terms so obliging that i was transported yet you now hate me you even deny me a look and what ought to influence you in my favor incurs your displeasure olympia made no answer but with a feeble hand pushed him from her signor doria could not guess at the meaning of this discourse not knowing that the prince of carency had ever seen his daughter the senator grimaldi suspected something of the matter but thought it very extraordinary that so infant a passion should already have the force of the greatest engagement  the illness of this divine creature increased and the princes despair was equal to it it is impossible to represent two objects more worthy of compassion signor doria distracted at his daughters condition desired the prince to retire because his presence augmented her pain and nothing less could oblige the other to withdraw but before he retired he approached her in opposition to what they could say and kneeling by her bed see madam the affliction i am in said he with broken sighs own at least that i deserve your pity if you are cruel enough to deny me your esteem oh what have i done within these two days to render me so odious i love you madam to such a degree that i am too well assured if you disdain me i cannot live but what am i saying if the life of a man you no longer seem to value is a sacrifice worthy of you i shall prefer it as a happy fate no my lord said she endeavoring to answer him i would not have you participate of my ruin only wish that after the irreparable loss i have received death may terminate my misfortunes i cannot help confessing the greatest concern to see your condition but as i am the cause of it continued she it is just i alone should suffer live my lord live i conjure you forget my weakness and let me dye in ending these words she desired her father and the senator to carry the prince away they told him that as it was olympias request she ought not to be disobeyed overcome by these persuasions he left the chamber but so disordered that they were forced to support him signor doria led them into a magnificent apartment and excused his being obliged to leave them his daughters illness requiring his presence the senator stayed with the prince who after being silent some time asked him if olympia had been at nicopolis and whether it was there she had paid the count of la vagnes ransom he answered she had not been there but that the count being taken prisoner by bajazet writ immediately to his mistress and his brother desiring the latter to send him a supply that some affairs of importance having at that time obliged the count of fiesque to go to rome olmypia feared his absence might detain her lover the longer in his confinement and for that reason sold some of her jewels which she could dispose of unknown to her father and sent the value of them into misia for his ransom that as he was coming back in a small vessel it was attacked by a pyrate and whilst they were fighting the powder took fire and both ships being blown up all those who were on board perished this news was brought to genoa with so many circumstances that there was no room left to doubt it  the prince heard this relation with a great deal of concern and after being a while without speaking he lifted up his eyes to heaven i can hardly believe said he there is a mortal on earth so wretched as i am give me leave to tell you sir that i was but eight years of age when my father signed a contract of marriage for me with don john of velascos daughter and on his deathbed commanded me expressly to marry her some years after i was taken prisoner at nicopolis where i was uncertain of life or death having reason enough to fear the worst from bajazets unequal temper who at last consented to receive my ransom which i expected from france when a lady who is yet unknown to me made my safety her care she wrote to me and sent me a sum which much exceeded my ransom and i must own her wit and generosity inspired me with so perfect a passion that i believe i could not have loved her more had i been acquainted with her being thus set at liberty i came to the court of france where i made but a small stay my mind was continually distracted with the idea of my unknown which determined me to come here with the marshall oh certainly it was the fatality of my stars that conducted me you have been witness since my arrival of my excessive melancholy and as it was not in my power to conceal it rather than trouble my friends i endeavored to find out the most unfrequented places to be more at liberty to indulge it here the prince recited his adventure with olympia but the thoughts of so cruel a disappointment obliged him to be silent some time then recovering a little he continued his discourse oh sir said he think how great is my misfortune she whom i adore at genoa is not the same i loved in misia this charming lady who flattered me with her heart is now dying for another the tragedy is before my eyes i have by my presence been an addition to her torment and it is probable she is this minute expiring whilst i am reflecting on the cruelty of my fate he rose up and was going out with precipitation but the senator imagining he had a mind to go to olympias apartment stopped him representing that such a behavior would highly displease her and that he ought rather by his absence to procure some ease to her disturbed mind the prince was obstinate but while they were disputing they heard the cries of many women which gave the last alarm to the prince oh heavens the work is done said he flinging himself upon a couch it is done she is now no more i have lost her for ever his tears would not permit him to continue his complaint the senator seeing the melancholy condition he was in extremely pitied him neglecting nothing that he thought could allay his grief which was too violent for any thing to mitigate  some of the servants came and told them olympia had just breathed her last in her fathers arms it is hard to imagine the agonies the prince was in when he heard this dismal news and as he could not doubt the certainty of it it flung him into the deepest despair oh in what tender language did he deplore her loss and with what compassion did he move those who saw him in his desolate state which time it self could hardly alter he was going away without seeing signor doria which proceeding might appear irregular did not one enter into his afflictions for he looked upon this unhappy parent as the cause of his daughters death the senator grimaldi represented that civility obliged him to condole with signor doria on the loss he had just received say rather replied the prince with some passion that i ought to load him with reproaches barbarian as he was to oppose olympias marriage with the count of la vagne which occasioned the cruelty of his fate and has been the source of my present misfortune but my lord said the senator do you reflect that if she had been happy in the count she would not not have met with this unfortunate adventure it is probable i might never have seen her said the prince interrupting him or if i had i should have known who she was and consequently not have taken her for my unknown and my gratitude for the one would have protected me from the charms of the other but alas it is no more in my power let us go said he let us go sir i have done my last his tears and affliction obliged him to be silent so they returned to genoa  the prince spoke but little on the way and what he said only related to the unhappiness of his destiny oh night oh fatal night cried he what pleasures did you not promise me this minute i should have been with that divine creature according to her own appointment alas i shall see her no more her beautuous eyes are shut for ever these cruel reflections made him very thoughtful and the senator took that opportunity to speak to him could you follow my advice my lord said he you would endeavor to conquer two passions which torment you at once for you love a lady at nicopolis whom it is likely you may never see olympia you have seen and loved her at first sight she is now no more i must own that all the circumstances of your adventures are fatal but if you call reason to your assistance it will tell you that your love is only due to leonida she is destined for you and i am informed she is a perfection of virtue and beauty why then my lord should an unknown or a person that is no more deprive her of the right she has to your heart why replied the prince alas is it in my power to love whom i please and forget two objects that so entirely possess my soul love without consulting duty takes possession of our inclinations he promises a thousand pleasures and will sometimes grant small favors but oh what bitterness has been mixed with those he has hitherto bestowed on me the senator perceived by the warmth of his discourse that his advice though very reasonable was ill timed therefore chose rather to pity the prince than condemn those sentiments which were too passionate and confused to be easily conquered  olympias death was generally lamented at genoa being a lady endowed with many excellencies the count of fiesque was extremely touched at it nothing could give more luster to my brothers merit said he to his friends than the sacrifice of this fine creature who despising fortune that persecuted them would not survive his fate no less than so great an example could persuade me that a passion does not expire with the loss of its object  the prince of carency who spoke of her with great concern soon made his passion known to the world his affliction was so deep that it appeared in his countenance and though he was denied to all company yet he could not refuse seeing don fernand benavidez who was a nobleman of andalusia lately arrived from spain and appeared to be so fine a gentleman that he easily gained the friendship and confidence of all who were acquainted with him he was at that time distractedly in love with leonida whom he had often seen by the means of his sister casilda who was also maid of honor to the queen of spain and was mistress of so many agreeable turns of wit that leonida preferred her to the rest of her companions the perfect friendship that was between these ladies gave benavidez an opportunity of declaring to his sister the sentiments he had for leonida which engaged her to speak often to the young lady in his favor but without the least appearance of success as he knew she was contracted to the prince of carency who was then at genoa he was seized with so immoderate a fit of jealousy that he resolved to make that voyage on purpose to see his rival and sometime before his departure conversing with casilda he said to her it is possible sister i may discover some essential defect in his person or humor which being made known to don john of velasco and leonida will give them such an aversion to him as may induce them to break a match that is not yet so far advanced as to destroy all my hopes but if in this happy rival i can spy no fault i shall then apply to the only remedy i have left he must die by my hand or i by his and in either of the two i shall think my self much happier than in my present condition casilda who loved her brother entirely was surpised and grieved at so violent a resolution you need not go to genoa said she with a design to discover any imperfection in that prince i have seen those who know him and have no interest in speaking his praise yet agree they never saw a more complete gentleman besides his high birth greatly distinguishes him and don john is a man of too much ambition not to promote a match so glorious to his family therefore depend upon it you will never prevail with him i advise you to make your passion known to leonida before you venture on any other attempt the affection she has for me may induce her to be favorable to you love is capricious and there are no measures to be taken with it chance often decides the strongest passions and if you can meet with that sympathy which produces the union of hearts you need no other means to make you happy ah my dear sister replied benavidez do not flatter me i have not resolution enough to follow your advice if my confession offends her she will forbid me ever seeing her more which must soon put a period to my life therefore i will try all other ways before i speak to her casilda seeing her brother so firmly resolved took no further trouble to persuade him to the contrary  thus he set out on his journey and being arrived at genoa went to visit the prince he could not have recommended himself better than by speaking olympias praise and deploring his misfortune in her loss but one day in conversation he said to him designedly you are not so much to be pitied my lord as you imagine since donna leonida is destined to be yours i believe continued he endeavoring to discover the princes sentiments you may find such perfections in her as will make you forget your other disappointments these words rather afflicted than consold the prince you see my grief replied he and as you are my friend i must own to you the engagement my father has laid me under gives me a mortal displeasure were my destiny in my own power i would entirely lay aside all thoughts of marriage for at an age that others are hardly capable of receiving the first impressions of love i have endured all its torments without being blessed with any of its pleasures  whilst the prince was speaking benavidez had time to divert the confused thoughts which tormented him he extremely rejoiced to hear the prince declare the indifferency he had for leonida but that joy was often interrupted with those fears which generally attend great passions here he resumed the discourse and expressed himself with so unaffected an air that the prince did not suspect the least design i participate with you my lord said he in your trouble which is too well grounded the most agreeable marriage time may render indifferent constant society discovers many failings and it is very rare to find any happiness in an alliance contracted without inclination but these are not the only reasons that induce me to pity you here he stopped and seemed in a sort of disorder as a man who had said more than he would willingly have done the prince taking notice of it i penetrate your thoughts don fernand said he why should you conceal any thing from one who has no reserve to you pray tell me what you know of leonida i know nothing prejudicial to her honor replied benavidez but i must own my lord i am so particularly acquainted with her that i fear you will be very unhappy if ever she is yours her humor is inconstant and suspicious the haughtiness of her mind is insupportable to all that know her and in short she is become so ridiculous at court that she would meet with many affronts were it not for the rank her father holds there  oh heavens what do you tell me cried the too credulous prince is it possible that all those who spoke of her have endeavored to deceive me in saying she was the most accomplished creature they had ever seen they only said it to soften your grief my lord replied benavidez with an indifferent air and i think my self very imprudent for having treated her with so much freedom you know me not my dear benavidez said the prince taking him in his arms do you think me capable of receiving ill so generous a confidence no i protest i am extremely obliged to you and what grieves me most is that i cannot make the right use of it my fate is decreed and there is no declining it what my lord do you then intend to marry her replied immediately benavidez alas what can i do said the prince it was my fathers last command and i will not deserve the reproach of having disobeyed him for my part cried benavidez i should for ever upbraid my self if i suffered you to proceed any farther in this affair as i profess my self one of your most zealous friends i will sooner give my life than see you unhappy you carry your friendship too far generous benavidez replied the prince it is not reasonable that my indifference for leonida should make her relations your enemies therefore i am resolved to offer my self a victim to my fathers will without thinking any more of what i may have to fear in the society of a person so disagreeable benavidez began to apprehend that if he continued to oppose the prince in his design it might give him some cause of suspicion so took his leave in the most violent despair how unfortunate am i cried he what must i resolve on i adore leonida and can never flatter my self with a return whilst the prince of carency who loves her not is going to possess all her charms no i cannot bear the thoughts of it i must sacrifice this happy rival before he sees his mistress or lose my life he pronounced these words with a menacing air and like a man almost distracted was tempted more than once to return and stab the prince but after having been some time in this disorder his spirits became more calm what said he can i with justice hate him since he is my rival against his will ought not i rather to open my breast to him implore his pity and conjure him to yield leonida to me no this expedient will never do cried he again i cannot repose this confidence in him what would he think of me should i confess a passion for her after having described her as a person undeserving of him and advised him against her he must then believe me the greatest of villains but let him think what he will of my sentiments i had rather submit to every thing than be deprived of the object i love i shall tell him the reasons which induced me to speak of her as i did the force of my passion will excuse me to a person who is so well acquainted with the effects of love and has no other motive to marry than obedience but alas my happiness is not in his power leonidas father is the first grandee of spain constable of castile and the kings favorite and suppose all his engagements with the prince were entirely broke off he would design a match for his daughter much more considerable than i could pretend to be these melancholy reflections served to persuade him that to sacrifice the prince or implore his aid would be equally of no effect and that he ought to find other means to procure himself the only thing on which depended his felicity  benavidez stayed some time at genoa and the prince proposing to go on his travels in hopes that changing of places might divert his grief asked him whether he was willing to go along with him he accepted of the offer and the senator grimaldi who was persuaded that the princes affliction was exceeding great resolved also to accompany him to rome being generously inclined to partake of his troubles since he could no ways remove them he had a mighty respect and friendship for the prince whose merit and distinguishing qualities made so strong an impression on those who knew him that they could not help admiring him benavidez had now laid a design whereby he expected to break the princes measures and in order to succeed he wrote to his sister that chance had conducted him to genoa where the prince of carency was deploring the death of olympia doria with whom at first sight he had fallen passionately in love upon this he gave an agreeable turn to his letter which rendered it very diverting but so ridiculously uncharacterized the prince that he would have had all the reason imaginable to resent it had he known any thing of the matter  benavidez desired his sister by a private note not to neglect showing his letter to leonida which she as exactly performed as he could have wished one day as they were both taking the air casilda told her she had received a letter from her brother wherein her name was often mentioned he has been some time absent said leonida does he not talk of returning soon he is at present employed in your service replied casilda maliciously since he is consoling a prince for whom you ought to be concerned and if you will promise me to be secret i can tell you something in confidence that may be of use to you i know you are always diverting your self with one raillery or other said leonida who really thought it was nothing but a jest nevertheless i promise you to be secret if that will do take this letter then and read it replied casilda you will see i am in earnest and that the prince of carency in giving you his heart will present you with nothing new leonida read with some kind of eagerness what benavidez had written to his sister then looking on her smiling i must confess said she i am no ways alarmed to hear of the princes passion for a fine woman and am vain enough to flatter my self that when he sees me i shall have it in my power to deface the impression she might have made on his heart i am persuaded a dead rival can prove no ways dangerous and provided i have no other to fear i dare be assured i shall live in perfect tranquillity casilda was extremely confused to see in what manner leonida had taken a thing that she imagined would have vexed her but concealed her disorder you are in the right my dearest companion said she embracing her to promise your self every thing from your incomparable charms they have power enough to eclipse the strongest ideas of any love but that which you inspire leonida whose modesty was parallel to her beauty would hear no more of these encomiums so interrupted her desiring she would choose some other subject for their conversation i would willingly oblige you replied casilda did i not think my self bound in friendship to represent to you the advantages you have over the prince of carency and how unfortunate you will be if you marry him reflect a little on what my brother writes can any thing be equal to the weakness of a man who falls distractedly in love with a person at first sight knowing at the same time he was destined to be yours it is easy to judge of his character by such a proceeding indeed pursued she sighing it grieves me that you should be promised to one who so little deserves you i am sensible of the marks you give me of your affection my dearest casilda replied leonida and am not less touched at the misfortune you have made me foresee were i mistress of my destiny i could make a choice different from that which is allotted me i wish my father would consult my sentiments on that subject and not so entirely follow his own but let what will happen i am resolved to obey him and will not even endeavor to make him change his resolution if i am unhappy in a person i do not like it shall only affect my self being determined never to give him any reason to complain of my conduct casilda made no objection to so reasonable a disposition fearing leonida should perceive some underhand design but thought she had made a good progress for the first attempt in discovering from her own mouth that she not only looked on the prince with indifference but had already conceived an aversion for him which flattered her that time would procure some other opportunity of practicing such artifices as she was capable of framing  the prince at this time was at rome and being informed of the emperor vendislas journey to rheims where the king of france was preparing to give him a reception believed on this occasion the court would appear in its greatest luster and that it might be taken ill if he were not present therefore proposed that tour to the senator and don fernand who readily consented to accompany him to the solemnity  upon his arrival at paris he ordered a fine equipage to be made and from thence went to rheims the pretext of the emperors coming there was a treaty of marriage between the duke of orleanss daughter and the marquis of brandenburg though some ascribed it to other motives the young princes and lords who attended the emperor and the king of france to this meeting left them to treat by themselves and passed their time in pleasures agreeable to their age as tournaments running at the rings and balls which daily succeeded each other with so much order and magnificence that all the nobility of france endeavored to be spectators of this triumphant season  the prince of carency amidst these pleasures was extremely melancholy his unknown of nicopolis the death of olympia and his aversion for leonida were equally a torment to him and benavidez entertained him constantly in all these dispositions  soon after the emperor and the king of france having agreed on what they came to treat of took leave of each other the latter being then informed that a rebellion had broke out in england sent over a number of troops under the command of the count of la march the count of vandome and the prince of carency who were desirous of acquiring glory embraced that occasion and accompanied their brother in this expedition the senator grimaldi took his leave here of the prince and returned to genoa but don fernand benavidez went over with him for england where they met with so little success that they were soon forced back at their arrival at the court of france the prince of carency perceiving that the princes of the blood his near relations were in contest relating to the regency thought he could not well remain there without engaging in their quarrel so resolved to return to rome and having told his design to benavidez who was willing to go with him took leave of the court and set out on his journey  the mean while leonida and casilda were made ladies of honor which allowed them more liberty than before and as they waited on the queen whenever she went abroad many people who had never seen leonida were so charmed with her that she soon passed in spain for a surprising beauty this opinion did no ways entitle her to the friendship of her sex for though the ladies at court could not disown her extraordinary merit yet it invited them all to envy her casilda used to talk very much to her in favor of her brother saying things at the same time entirely to the prince of carencys disadvantage it is true that what she could say in behalf of the one made but a slight impression on leonida but then the ill character she gave of the other perplexed her extremely she began to think her self very unhappy in the choice her father had made for her of a prince who had no other recommendation but his birth i cannot imagine said she one day to casilda why the world will attribute so many fine qualities to a man who is far from possessing the least of them and how those who have seen him can study to deceive me in his favor that is the character of the age replied casilda the prince is considered as a man of an eminent rank and great fortune and such persons as know he is contracted to you will certainly set him off to the greatest advantage i am even surpised at the sincerity of my brother who i fear will have cause to repent hereafter of what he has done it is possible you may one day tell the prince what he writ to me about him and your disdain will be his only reward for the intention he had to serve you ah know me better cried leonida and do not think me guilty of ingratitude i am too sensible of my obligation to your brother ever to expose him to the princes resentment and i declare to you my dear casilda that after having consulted my inclinations i am at last resolved to make good use of his advice i will throw my self at my fathers feet and represent to him my aversion for the prince in so feeling a manner that my prayers and tears shall prevent his concluding our marriage casilda was extremely pleased at this declaration and encouraged leonida in that design not omitting to put her in mind of the misfortunes which attend an alliance made out of political motives and not to give her time to change a resolution so agreeable she conducted her to don johns apartment and there left her in order to go and write to benavidez her letter was in these terms  return dear brother return every thing answers your desires leonida believes the picture you sent her of the prince is a true copy of the original and that love has no share in what you write oh heavens how happy should i be had i as much reason to be contented with my destiny as you have with yours but the ungrateful henriquez has relapsed into his first passion in spite of all the care i took to prevent it he has seen donna blanca consider then the state i am in i impatiently wait your return to tell you my trouble and beg your consolation since nothing else is capable of giving me any   benavidez was arrived at rome when he received this letter which gave him inexpressible joy casildas affliction had not power to interrupt the pleasure he had conceived at the thoughts of leonidas being disposed to favor his passion he went to visit the prince who no sooner saw him but perceived so great an alteration in his countenance that he could not help inquiring into the cause benavidez said he you must have received some agreeble news for your eyes seem to own it i will not keep any thing a secret from you my lord replied he i come rather to make you my confident speak then with an entire confidence said the prince you cannot do me a greater pleasure i am in love continued benavidez and have some reason to flatter my self with an obliging return you must know that my mistress having unjustly suspected my constancy by the false insinuations of some of my enemies would not so much as hear me in my justification but forbad me her presence and the care she took to avoid me had like with my life to have ended my misfortunes i left the court very disconsolate and retired to my country seat where i found that solitude only augmented my grief therefore to remedy this ill i resolved to travel so took leave of my sister the most distracted of all mankind she extremely pitied my condition and promised in my absence to use her utmost endeavors to make my peace which at last she has done with the most obliging circumstances my mistress recals me and now impatiently desires my return but in spite of my passion i am sensibly affected my lord with being obliged to leave you for i have felt so real a satisfaction in your company that i could wish i had never known you or that i were never to part from you  the prince at these words embraced him with great tenderness which showed that his departure touched him to the heart i was in hopes said he you would have gone with me to the court of navarre where my brother is to marry the kings daughter and has desired me to attend the ceremony what violence must i do to my secret pain in a place where nothing but pleasure will be thought of i cannot abandon my self to my melancholy neither do i believe i can be so good a counterfeit as to conceal it from persons so discerning and if i speak of my torment to my brother i fear he will not think it worth his concern judge then my dear benavidez what consolation your company would be to me since you not only deplored my fate but softened my misfortunes and in all respects have appeared the best of friends oh how necessary would your assistance be in this juncture and how extremely shall i regret your absence but these considerations are too weak to oppose what your adorable mistress commands and your inclinations invite you to obey go then continued he sighing go and taste those pleasures which are prepared for you he finished these words with so dejected an air that it would have created pity in any one but a rival for when once we adore an object we conceive an aversion for those who are obstacles to our happiness and have no longer power to be just even to the merit of any other votary  the nuptials of the young princess of navarre were celebrated with a pomp and magnificence equal to the occasion all manner of diversions were given at the kings expense to make that solemnity as fine as possible but in the midst of these pleasures the prince appeared lost in a distraction of mind which was too great for any thing to alleviate however he affected a gaiety which he was so little used to that the counterfeit was easily perceived what makes you so very melancholy brother said the count of la march to him one day i see the violence you do your inclinations when you are in the best of company it would be better for you to break off with your friends and give your self up entirely to your own humor you make me an indifferent return interrupted the prince for the care i have taken to conceal my chagrin but i protest to you that it is of such a nature as cannot be conquered therefore dear brother i will take your advice and in banishing my self from a place where my presence is disagreeable avoid reproaches which very much affect me these words made the count of la march sensible that to rally him upon his grief was a certain way to augment it and as he loved the prince dearly and found many shining qualities in him he embraced him with the greatest marks of affection what dear brother said he in an obliging manner is it possible you should take a thing so seriously which was only designed as a jest do you think that for so slight a matter your company could be disagreeable to me no do your self more justice and never suspect mine so unfortunate a man as i am replied the prince has ever room to fear and if you knew what it is never to have seen one mistress and to lose another as soon as you had conceived a passion for her you would not add to my pain the count could not help smiling at the fantasticalness of these different adventures you do not pity me then said the prince nor comprehend how one can suffer so much with so little reason you think it ridiculous in me to sigh for a person i do not know and for one that is now no more but oh these two things are the principal cause of my melancholy the count of la march pitied him extremely and omitted nothing afterward that could console him  by this time benavidez was arrived at madrid where he found a great alteration the king being dead and the care of his son don johns education who was then but twenty two months old left to don diego lopez of cuniga and don john of velasco which mark of the kings esteem for these two lords in reposing so great a trust in them gave a mighty addition to their fortunes and power the court was very much divided at that juncture the infanta don fernand brother to the late king having a considerable party was offered the crown but he generously declined it and had the young prince proclaimed king which was performed to the great satisfaction of the queen who after her son was settled on the throne retired to villa real for the benefit of the air and agreeable situation of the place  it was here that leonora wife to don diego lopez introduced her self into the queens favor and had so great an influence over her that whatever she asked was immediately granted she had a great deal of wit but of so dangerous a nature that those who sincerely espoused the queens interest began to lose their credit by her malicious insinuations which made them in a little time conceive as great an aversion for the sovereign as for the favorite  thus was the state of affairs when benavidez came to villa real where he staid some time before he could find an opportunity to speak with his sister because during the first days of mourning it is the custom in spain not to admit any person into the palace except the family but as soon as the queen could be seen he was introduced into her apartment where he found leonida and casilda it is impossible to express the different agitations he was in at the sight of leonida who might have discovered his secret thoughts had she perceived his disorder  after having satisfied the queen in some particulars relating to his travels he hastened to his sisters apartment but was agreeably surpised when passing through a gallery of paintings where casilda had designedly invited leonida to walk he met them and saluted leonida with much respect give me leave madam said he to acquit my self of the commission i received from the prince of carency who charged me to assure you that he will be soon here in order to conclude a marriage to which you are destined though unknown to each other it is an equal misfortune to us both replied leonida with a dejected air and the particulars you writ to casilda relating to the character of that prince have so tormented me that i have omited nothing ever since which i thought could persuade my father to change his resolution but he so strictly regards his word that hitherto my prayers and tears have had no power to move him benavidez fetched a deep sigh and after a moments silence the prince desired me madam said he to send your picture to him and i must confess it would be a trouble to me to see him receive that favor had he not a prospect of being happy in the possession of the original i cannot dispose of my picture interrupted leonida without my mothers leave therefore it depends on you to ask it of her but in my opinion it is entirely unnecessary the prince will see me too soon for his peace or mine i am not amiable enough to efface the objects which possess his heart but i will try by my obedience to deserve his esteem madam said benavidez since you consent to it i will tell madam velasco that it is the prince your lovers request speak to whom you please of it replied leonida with an air of contempt but do not call so fantastical a person my lover i can never like a man that falls in love with all he sees and even with those he never saw  as she had finished these words madam velasco who was going to the queens apartment entered the gallery she knew benavidez had been a great while with the prince of carency which made her suppose there was an intimate friendship between them and as her concern for a prince who was contracted to her daughter could not indifferently affect her she immediately enquired after his health and expressed a great impatience to see him in spain benavidez told her he had left rome and was going to the court of navarre to be at the solemnity of his brother the count of la marchs nuptials with the princess beatricia daughter to the king that the prince passionately wished for leonidas picture which he had promised to ask for him and therefore addressed her for that favor madam velasco was very much pleased at the zeal benavidez seemed to have for his friend and told him she would do any thing that might be agreeable to the prince that her daughter should sit for her picture and desired he would take care to send it to him benavidez found that his hopes as well as passion augmented and flattered himself that the plot he was framing would have its desired effect he left madam velasco and leonida to go with his sister into her apartment and after giving each other proofs of an entire affection i have something to say to you brother said she come into my closet she took him by the hand and sitting down could not help shedding a shower of tears you weep my dear casilda said he embracing her have you any thing to say to me concerning don henriquez ah brother said she he is the ungrateful object that troubles my peace and remembers no more the obligations he owes me i shall find some ease in relating to you all that has happened and as a disappointed passion is less discreet than a successful one i am going to inform you of what you know but very imperfectly  don henriquez was on board the fleet with the admiral his father when one day as the queen was hunting and we all attending her donna blancas horse started and not knowing how to manage him ran away with her several cavaliers rode after her who were invited to serve her either by inclination or interest she being perfectly handsome and daughter to leonora who was then the queens favorite as i am naturally politic enough i endeavored to reach her before the rest when i saw her from the rising ground i was on fall in a valley i rid as fast as possible to her assistance where i no sooner came but the first thing that struck my sight was a case set with diamonds which dropped out of her pocket when she was thrown off her horse i took it up and had no other reason for not returning it instantly but the curiosity of seeing what was in it donna blanca was in a swoon when the rest of the company came up they immediately gave her what they thought would restore her to her senses being stunned with the fall and as soon as she came to her self she perceived she had lost her picturecase which was sought for but in vain i took notice of all her motions and her uneasiness increased with the fear of not finding what was so dear to her this gave me the greater inclination to keep it with the only view to mortify her being one of the finest young ladies of the court and daughter to the favorite  as she had received no hurt she went up to the queen but appeared so melancholy that her mother expressed much concern i was impatient to be alone that i might see what was contained in the case but how can i tell you brother or at least in telling you ought i not to dye with shame i had but just cast my eyes on the picture which was enclosed when i found such motions in my heart as surpised me being what i never felt before i was charmed with the noble air and youth of a gentleman whose features were so admirably well drawn that i could no ways doubt but it very much resembled the person whom it was designed for i gazed at it with delight and though unknown to me i thought it was impossible to see any thing more lovely i did not consider at first how dangerous my curiosity might prove so employed some hours in admiring this fatal picture whose idea it was not in my power to deface it threw me into such reflections as generally succeed excessive transports oh unhappy casilda cried i what subtle poison has seized thy heart art thou so tired with thy liberty that thou must lose it this day i know not who this is that seems so charming i am well informed that he is in love and is beloved since donna blanca who is so beautiful is the guardian of his picture which she showed by her uneasiness to be very dear to her what hopes then can i have of any relief and to whom must i apply my self should not my birth and modesty be sufficient to impose silence on me what could i pronounce the word i love and pronounce it in favor of a man who knows not the value of so great a sacrifice no my eyes shall sooner be witness of my rivals victory and i will die before i expose my self to the shame which must needs succeed such a confession but said i a minute after is it possible that in such a little time love could have made so great a progress i am forced to lay a command on my self not to speak of my weakness and i have formed a rival without having a lover  i confess to you brother this caused so great a change in me that i began not to know my self i was continually thoughtful and solitude was the only thing i courted i feared to discover my pain or seek for means to know the author of it if i show this picture thought i donna blanca will be informed i have it and then i shall be obliged to return it she is beloved and in so great favor that i dare not declare my sentiments much less contend with so dangerous a rival  two months were over before i could hear any thing relating to this affair i sometimes enquired what young lords were absent among others they named don garcia don pedro d avilas and don frederick henriquez how could i know whether the man that possessed my thoughts was either of them i endeavored to be acquainted with their character but those who were so complaisant as to describe them to me instead of giving me some light in the matter left me more in the dark and in greater despair i made it also my business to discover whether donna blanca had not a known engagement which i was persuaded was the only thing could satisfy me but they told me she was too imperious to receive the addresses of any of the grandees i knew the contrary though i was not at liberty to declare it so that i languishd between small hopes and cruel fears donna blanca was taken ill of the smallpox at this time and there was a necessity for her leaving the court i cannot help confessing that i was extremely pleased at my rivals misfortune heavens cried i just heaven make her as ugly as possible that the passion of her lover may turn to a mortal aversion the thoughts of this gave me some ease though i looked upon my being in love with a person i did not know as the greatest unhappiness that could possibly attend me how wretched would be my fate said i to my self if this picture with which i am so charmed should only prove the painters fancy and that i should never see its original i reflected at last on which would give me the most uneasiness to see donna blanca adored by him i loved or never to have hopes of seeing the object of my passion these in my opinion were two cruel extremes for i could not determine my self on either and therefore concluded i was the most unfortunate person in the world  my mind was in this situation when in the queens apartment thinking of the odness of my adventure i went to the window from whence i saw two noblemen followed by many attendants the youngest of the two so perfectly resembled the picture that i did not at all doubt but he was the original already so dear to me in the first motions of my surprise i fetched such a shriek and threw open the sash with so much precipitation that every body took notice of it and though the queen did not seem to mind it the first lady of the bedchamber did and reprimanded me severely i recovered the disorder i was in as soon as possible and told her i was deceived by taking the young lord for my brother whom i impatiently expected the affair passed in this manner and i did all i could to suppress the agitation which might attend the first sight of a cavalier whose shadow had so much disturbed my peace  in spite of all the reflections i had made i was seized with such violent emotions when the admiral and his son entered the queens chamber for it was they that i had like to have swooned don frederick henriquez appeared so thoughtful that i was grieved to the soul i ought not to flatter my self said i that donna blanca is indifferent to him in his looks i read my misfortune he sympathizes with her in the condition she is in and thinks none here worth his notice oh barbarian cried i to my self you think of nothing but your mistress cannot you turn your eyes on me and see the deplorable state of wretched casilda but brother i am ashamed said she interrupting her self i am ashamed of unveiling my weakness to you and exposing to your censure thoughts so offensive to the modesty of my sex i shall only tell you that the queen came out of her closet and the ladies made a circle about her when the admiral gave her an account of her naval force i resolved at that instant on a thing that will appear to you no less bold than precipitate which was to write to don henriquez therefore without consulting reason or considering the consequence i took out my tablettes and addressed him in these terms  affairs wherein the heart is concerned ought not to be deferred i deplore the condition of yours give me an opportunity of speaking to you and you shall be indebted to me for your peace let secrecy be the proof of your gratitude at night i shall expect you on the terracewalk under the window by dian s statue i there shall acquaint you my lord with some circumstances in which you are particularly concerned   when i had finished my letter i was at a less how to convey it to don henriquez at last i resolved to trust the young count of oropez with it his post of being first querry to the queen gave him as you know an opportunity of entertaining us often he had a great deal of wit and having on several occasions observed his discretion i made a sign to him and he came to me i have assured one of the young ladies said i to him that you can keep a secret and hope you will answer my good opinion of you there is nothing in my power madam replied he that i would not do to convince you i am not undeserving your generous sentiments it is not my secret said i blushing i am going to entrust you with but that of my particular friend who has a mind to perplex don henriquez she has just writ on my tablettes i desire you will find an opportunity to make him read it and do not forget to return them to me i shall never neglect madam the least of your commands replied he smiling though i cannot say you have charged me with so obliging a commission as you would have me think one word more said i be assured i am not concerned in it but notwithstanding shall ever acknowledge the favor you do me in obliging my friend oropez left me immediately and acquitted himself of what i wished with great address while he was with don henriquez i was extremely uneasy at this imprudent step but was not long so for oropez came back with my tablettes where at the end of my letter i found this answer  i never could flatter my self that any person was interested in the concerns of my heart but now i am happier than i imagined your commands shall be exactly obeyed i assure you of secrecy and as for gratitude it is the least return i can make so much generosity   these words so agreeably flattered my imagination that i longed for night with the greatest impatience in the mean time i made a thousand reflections which gave me hopes and entertained me till the appointed hour the night was very dark and hearing some body approach the window i threw up the sash and asked in a low voice don henriquez is it you yes madam said he it is the man in the world who is most indebted to you but at the same time i cannot help saying that the advantage you have over me is too unequal since you know me and i am not only unacquainted with you but even a stranger to what induces you to favor me with this interview i will satisfy you presently said i in a trembling voice and that you may not suspect i sent for you hither on a frivolous subject know that i am casilda benavidez therefore my lord do not use any dissimulation but tell me upon honor whether you are still in love with donna blanca if you will not be sincere in this confession i have nothing farther to say to you don henriquez seemed very much surpised at the question and having paused a while made me this answer donna blanca is so charming that her chains are glorious and since you believe i am her captive i will not scruple to own it these words threw me into a very great confusion what do you love that perfidious creature replied i who has made a sacrifice of you and even disposed of your picture to convince your rival how indifferent you are to her with that i took a light which i had hid for fear of being discovered and obliging him to come nearer i showed him his picture and looked at him so tenderly that he might have read my thoughts don henriquez after having viewed it turned his eyes on me and i perceived the surprise was agreeable to him but as what i had told him was very unexpected he asked me how i came to know that he loved donna blanca and by what misfortune he had forfeited her esteem i can easily satisfy you both these questions replied i your absence having banished you from your mistresss heart don diego cuniga made his addresses to her and was favorably received his father you know is one of the first grandees and she being very ambitious easily conceived a passion for him of which she could not have given a greater proof than sacrificing your picture to him his vanity was satisfied but his love instead of increasing by the assurance he had of a return made him slight her and even discontinue seeing her which she resented so much that it had like to have been the cause of her death he endeavored to persuade me i was the occasion of it for that if he had not seen me donna blancas impression would never have been effaced but as i had no inclination to believe him and did not give him so obliging an audience as he used to receive to alter my disposition toward him he brought me your picture told me every thing that passed when she gave it to him and begged i would accept it as an evincement that he never more would renew his addresses to her  although i looked on him as an unthinking young gentleman i took the picture and i protest to you my only motive for so doing was to undecive you in relation to your ungrateful mistress for though i had no acquaintance with you i frequently heard so much in your praise that it gave me no small concern to see you thus betrayed by a perfidious woman and therefore i resolved to do all in my power to dissuade you from ever thinking of her more i will take your advice madam said he in a great passion and don diego cuniga shall find at his return from sevil that if i am not a dangerous rival i am at least a troublesome enemy but madam continued he with a milder voice i hope you will assist me in my revenge on donna blanca you have been pleased to acquaint me with her perfidiousness and i swear i am already disposed to have an aversion for her were you but concerned in my interest i should certainly be restored to my self which happy state i only desire that i may be the more able to lay my heart at your feet i dare assure you madam that constancy has ever been my virtue and i am so well acquainted with love that you will find in me a passion if possible equal to your beauty it is too late replied i smiling to answer a proposal which you would not have made me had you less reason to be piqud but as i am inclined to wish that your words were sincere it will be a pleasure to me when i find your conduct engages me to determine in your favor in the mean time be very secret in regard to what is past your compliance in this will be an easy way to establish you in my esteem  i did not give don henriquez time to make me an answer but parted from him with so much satisfaction that i would not have changed my destiny for that of a queen my mind was all that night employed on pleasing ideas donna blanca is sick and absent thought i and will not appear at court of a long time it is possible her sickness may deface her charms and a mistress who is suspected to be inconstant having lost that attractive will find it a hard matter to justify her self besides i have admirably well succeeded in my stratagem don henriquez is inclined to like me and thinks he has cause enough to break off with her what have i then to fear i shall have made the conquest of his heart before ever my rival can be able to come and dispute it with me  i appeared the day following at court in a rich dress which every one admired having a particular interest in adorning my self to the best advantage and i disposed every thing so well that don henriquez came and assured me he had no reason to complain of his mistresss proceedings and that he was so entirely pleased at the discovery i had made him that it lay wholly in my power to render him the most constant of lovers this declaration was attended with all the courtship that could be expected from a man passionately in love how great was my felicity in those days i was blessed with all that love and gallantry could inspire but oh brother i am ready to die when i call these things to mind and have nothing now remaining but mortal grief are you entirely disengaged said i sometimes to him and could you resist donna blanca should she endeavor to regain your heart you must needs suspect my sentiments replied he to question what i would do in such an occasion i take heaven to witness charming casilda that were she as constant as i could have wished her and more beautiful than ever she appeared to me i should no longer confess her power though his protestations transported me yet i had room to apprehend that when he saw my rival a discovery might be made in which i should prove very unhappy i secretly reproached my self with my perfidiousness and feared some punishment would attend it which was sufficient to make me uneasy therefore i pressed don henriquez to solicit his fathers consent to our marriage that they might afterward join in their request to the queen about it which being once granted i should have no longer reason to fear he represented to me the fantastical humor of the admiral but promised he would apply himself with the greatest care and address in order to prevail with him these assurances extremely flattered me and i was expecting the effects of them when one day the queen went to take the air in the forest of javalles attended by her ladies who were riding by her open chaise but we were hardly got to the height of a little hill when we discovered in the plain some men on horseback which we knew to be moors they were engaged with spaniards whom they charged so vigorously that we thought them in the greatest danger we saw at the same time a lady at the foot of the tree appearing to us in a swoon with several women about her who by their actions expressed much concern  the queen stopped at some distance and saw this engagement with great uneasiness but don henriquez who had followed us came up to her and desired leave to go and succor the spaniards which her majesty having assented to and commanded some of her guards to attend him he attacked the moors with so much bravery that the scene was changed in an instant and they being no longer able to oppose him were obliged to fly for safety all this while my fearful thoughts were employed on the dangers he was exposed to i was praying for his success though already conqueror and as i observed all his actions with a watchful eye i saw him approach the ladies who were still frightened though their enemies were fled  don henriquez had scarcely turned his eyes toward them when spurring his horse he rid full speed from the place but perhaps he considered that so great a slight to the lady who was donna blanca might displease the queen supposing she took notice of it therefore his politics or rather my inevitable misfortune forcing him to return he went up to her and alighting saluted her very coldly but what he said what so short and confused that in spite of her attention she could not comprehend it i owe you my liberty said she my lord for which i shall think my self eternally obliged to you though i am persuaded you knew not in whose cause you fought no madam answered he i was a stranger to whom i rendered this service i protest that had i known how far you were concerned i should have had occasion for all my generosity to support me in fighting for the most perfidious person in the world and for my part replied donna blanca with an air of pride i retract my obligation since you confess your self unworthy of being my deliverer she said no more because one of her women was near from whom i had this relation but called for her chaise and went to meet the queen don henriquez left her and came up first to give her majesty the particulars of what had passed and to let her know that it was donna blanca he had relieved who had like to have been carried off by the moors at this name i was thunderstruck and my imagination contrived a thousand ways to torment me representing all i had to fear from so fatal a rencounter can any misfortune be equal to mine said i donna blanca taken by the moors was going by her captivity to deliver me from all the alarms her return could be capable of giving me she is rescued from this danger and owes her safety to the arm of don henriquez i have now every thing to apprehend he is just come from her and i doubt has discovered my treachery i know not whether i deceive my self but his looks tell me he loves her still the thoughts of her being inconstant might have cured him but nothing can do it if he is once convinced of her innocence i shall appear a monster to him and become the object of his aversion heavens what shall i do if what i dread should happen whether don henriquez would not talk to me for fear of being taken notice of or that he had no mind to it i cannot tell but he did not speak to me all that day donna blanca who had not seen the queen since her recovery from the smallpox took that opportunity to kiss her hand i was inconsolable to find her as handsome as ever and her praise the subject of every ones discourse whilst i as silent as death was observing don henriquez who i thought did a violence to his inclination in not approaching her they appeared both in some confusion yet their eyes seemed to express more love than anger none but a rival could have known the cause of these different motions but oh nothing escaped my penetrating jealousy i read in their looks as i imagined my eternal ruin  the queen was returned to villa real and i in her apartment before i knew where i was or even which way i came i was lost in melancholy and thought it was very cruel in don henriquez not to show the least concern for me what said i is his passion come to this he who has rendered donna blanca so essential a service and knows i apprehend nothing more than a relapse does he thus neglect giving me assurances of the contrary i passed all that night in the greatest anxiety and though i found my self indisposed in the morning i rose early and went to the queens apartment fearing something might happen there prejudicial to my interest  donna blanca appeared at court that day finely dressed and so beautiful that all but leonida yielded to her don henriquez was just by me when my rival entered the chamber heavens madam said he how handsome she is what pity it is she is false why should her falsity affect you my lord replied i since at present she ought to be indifferent to you it is true madam answered he sighing but i only deplore the misfortune of those who wear her chains you are very charitable said i and the public is much indebted to you here such a crowd of various thoughts presented themselves to me that i was at a loss how to continue my discourse and don henriquez without enquiring into the cause of my silence had his eyes fixed on donna blanca what is this cried i you appear to me different from what you were yesterday do you repent of having changed your mind and are you still slave enough to love that perfidious creature dont you remember that she sacrificed you to a man of no merit which made me blush for her as much as i do now for you at this he interrupted me and said indeed casilda you must know me very little to frame such injurious suspicions there is not a man in the world who resents an ungenerous usage more than i and let me assure you that after i have loaded her with reproaches equal if possible to the offense i will not only show an indifferency for her but even despise her to such a degree that you shall have no reason to complain of my future conduct  he pronounced these last words so faintly that i was confounded what said i do you want to come to an eclaricissement with donna blanca you could do no more were she a pattern of tenderness and constancy i suppose added i you would have no value for such a mistress but give me leave to tell you my lord that if you speak to her i will never see you more he was surpised at these words and looked at me a great while endeavoring to penetrate into the cause of this resolution he called to mind what donna blanca had said to him which gave him suspicion enough to increase his curiosity and though he promised to comply with my commands he did it with so indifferent an air that i could no ways doubt of my misforfortune  i went from the queens apartment into my own and flung my self upon my bed half dead and drowned in tears soon after leonida came into my chamber who saw my concern and distraction which wanted very little of despair and sitting by me did all she could to soften my grief without knowing the cause of it but to disburden my mind of part of its depression i gave her an account of what had passed as she had never been in love and consequently unacquainted with what one in that state is capable of she could not help condemning my treachery to my rival oh leonida said i you little know the effects of a violent passion every thing is allowed to lovers when they are in pursuit of a heart say rather replied she that we often allow to our selves many things which are very blameable if i have committed a crime said i my punishment is near alas i was not mistaken don henriquez had found an opportunity to speak to donna blanca his impression was not quite effaced whatever reason she might have had to complain of his behavior they accused each other and by that means discovered the part i had acted i leave you to think brother whether they were not reconciled at my expense i was not long before i knew my fate for henriquez came and upbraided me with my perfidiousness i would have persuaded him he was still captivated by donna blanca and that by her artful insinuations she had prevailed and imposed on him but the ill opinion he had of me prevented his believing it as i knew his temper i thought i could not do better than confess the motive which had incited me to make him quarrel with his mistress judge the condition i was in dear brother when i owned that love was the occasion of my guilt and exposed my weakness which i was then sure would meet with a fatal return i sought for reasons to excuse my crime by painting my passion in the most lively colors and my tears convinced him of the truth of what i said he heard me without the least interruption but at last looked at me with attention and assuming an imperious air i think my self sufficiently revenged of your treachery said he since you love me and i have no thoughts of you but what are despising in finishing these words he left me the anger shame and grief which divided my soul had like to have immediately ended my unhappy life but leonida came to me at that time and used her endeavors to console me without the least success i was meditating the ruin of donna blanca and henriquez and felt in my self such a disposition for a desperate undertaking that nothing but the natural sweetness of my friends temper could moderate my rage my rival though victorious would not resolve to pardon me she complained to her mother who was weak enough to enter into her sentiments as a confident and ever since they have watched all opportunities for revenge i have by their means forfeited the queens favor and meet every day with so many subjects of grief as would deprive me of life could any thing be capable of it but the loss of the ungrateful henriquez i heard yesterday that leonora had prevailed with the queen to propose a match to the admiral between donna blanca and his son and that he had given his consent to it i shall soon see her triumph judge then  here casilda could no longer restrain her sighs and tears which obliged her to be silent benavidez who was extremely touched with her affliction told her he would fight don henriquez and neglected nothing which he thought could lessen her pain but as that which affects the heart is very different from any other so it requires more time for its cure we shall find notwithstanding in the sequel of casildas story despairing as she was that many years were not expired before she found consolation  benavidez gave his sister an account of what had passed between him and the prince of carency and told her he must needs have leonidas picture for he had thought of an expedient to make her have a great aversion for her lover but that he would not declare his passion to her till he was assured she had some confidence in him for which reason he begged casilda to solicit his interest who promised to act for him to the utmost of her power accordingly she desired madam velasco to let her daughter sit for her picture which in opposition to the young lady was immediately granted and given to benavidez who caused another to be drawn but with so awkward an air that none could see it without having a disdain for the original this was the picture he sent by an express to the prince with a letter at the same time telling him that that piece would show how charming the person was whom fate had decreed him since it was her perfect likeness and that he had entertained her with his merit but she hardly would have patience to hear any thing on that subject which convinced him her thoughts were employed on some other object  the prince who gave too much credit to benavidez was struck with such confusion at the sight of this picture and letter that he immediately wrote to him and without any caution confessed the cruelty of so unhappy an alliance and his aversion for leonida but as she had some reason to be persuaded that her picture would produce a contrary effect she often asked benavidez out of a motive of selflove whether he had heard from him and what was his opinion of her therefore as soon as he had received the princes answer which was writ in such terms as overjoyed him being that nothing more disobliging could be added he contrived that casilda should show it leonida with such an air of secrecy as if he were no ways consenting to it the thing was carried on as he had designed it leonida read the princes letter at which she was so offended that she immediately went and threw her self at her mothers feet and conjured her with tears to break off a marriage which would render her the most unfortunate creature in the world i will not pretend madam to disobey you in any thing said she but is it possible that you your self would occasion my ruin though i have but little experience in the sentiments one ought to have for a husband yet it appears to me that without mutual love nothing but continual torment can be expected for how can i value the man you have chosen for me since he has not only conceived an aversion for me but thinks me ugly and despises me cannot you change my fate madam oh rather let me never marry or if you are not pleased i should live with you send me to a monastry i will sooner embrace that state of life than be united to a prince for whom i have no inclination madam velasco moved at her daughters complaint took her several times in her arms and endeavored to console her in a most tender manner if it wholly depended on me my dearest child said she i would soon ease your mind but your father is my lord and we are both so far bound in duty to comply with his pleasure that i cannot promise you any thing till i know what are his intentions as she had ended these words don john of velasco entered the chamber the mother and daughter flung themselves at his feet and with prayers and tears conjured him to break off with the prince they showed him the letter he had written to benavidez but all would not do don john was determined to keep his word with him even at the expense of his daughters happiness he answered them that the contract was signed and nothing should ever make him revoke a thing he had concluded with the late count of la march so leonida withdrew in the greatest affliction and having informed casilda of her fathers sentiments told her she was resolved to retire into a monastry that will be no effectual relief to you replied casilda maliciously for a man who has so much power as don john will easily oblige his daughter to quit a place wherein she had thrown her self without his consent but my dear leonida your grief is so moving that i have already proposed means to give you some comfort my brother who is entirely devoted to your service and in whom you may faithfully confide has a fine house near carmona it is an agreeable retirement surrounded with spacious woods i will go and live with you there what my dear casilda interrupted leonida is your love for me so great as to quit the court i could make you a greater sacrifice replied casilda sighing you know the reasons i have to hate this fatal place the false henriquez will soon be married to donna blanca i shall have nothing before my eyes but what will increase my despair and in spite of my pride and reason i cannot cease loving that cruel man though he glories in my weakness absence is the only thing that can efface his idea let us go charming leonida continued she let us fly the man i love and him you hate my fate is more deplorable than yours replied leonida your absence will procure you some ease and no body will pursue you but as for my part i shall be pursued and perhaps discovered and brought back to my fathers house where i shall meet with very severe usage ah how little do you know the sad condition i am reduced to cried casilda do you think it a consolation to tell me that no body will pursue me that is the chief cause of my grievance i could wish the perfidious henriquez would abandon all and follow me heavens how transported should i be if you propose to enjoy a perfect tranquillity replied leonida do not harbor any wishes so contrary to your peace alas i know not what to wish said casilda then let us go solitude and absence may chance to give some ease to my mind young leonida who had but little experience and did not foresee the fatal consequences of such an undertaking consented to the dangerous proposals of her companion she embraced her a thousand times and confessed in a most tender manner her obligation for the considerable service she was going to render her they afterward agreed on a day and hour to execute their project and employed all their thoughts in taking such measures as could make it succeed  this was the state of affairs when they were informed that the count of la march was arrived at seville with a magnificent attendance and a body of eight hundred men to succor the infanta don fernand who was then at war with the moors the virtue and eminent qualities of this illustrious prince were soon published in spain and the prince of carency his brother had no small share in the general applause he had accompanied the count to seville from whence he intended to go to villa real in order to marry leonida but fortune was preparing long torments for him instead of those pleasures he would have tasted in the possession of a lady so charming and virtuous  the prince wrote a letter to benavidez to acquaint him with his departure from seville which he immediately communicated to leonida she now thought it time to be gone and without farther consideration trusted her self with casilda to the conduct of benavidez who over joyd and full of hopes omitted nothing that was necessary in this affair they left villa real and he accompanied them some part of the way but fearing his absence from the court at the time of their disappearing might give some suspicion of his having a hand in it he desired leonida and his sister to accept of one of his friends who should wait on them to their journeys end being a man whose fidelity was so well known to him that he ran no risque in trusting him with his mistress and sister  benavidez expressed much concern in parting from leonida who might have easily perceived it had not her thoughts been employed otherways he took his leave of them and they continued their journey with all the diligence and secrecy possible when they were arrived at benavidezs house where no body knew them they changed their names leonida called her self felicia and casilda took the name of beatricia saying they were sisters and of the house of leon  the gentleman who had accompanied them returned to villa real and gave an account to benavidez of their successful journey whilst the young ladies were taking the innocent pastime of an agreeable solitude  benavidez notwithstanding the impatience he had to see leonida appeared at court with a counterfeit air of gaiety but heavens in what affliction were don john of velasco and his lady when they perceived their daughter was gone they believed at first that she and casilda were retired to a monastry and benavidez seemed to believe the same saying that that was the only reason which prevented him from searching all spain in order to find his sister don john who had greater cause for uneasiness employed all means to discover the place where leonida might be but his enquiry being to no purpose he was almost in despair benavidez the mean while was proposing to himself no slender share of happiness in the success of an enterprise he had managed so artfully but the queen being then informed that some grandees of spain who were dissatisfied with the government were carrying on a traitorous design and had resolved to deliver up some considerable towns to the king of granada she ordered that benavidez who was governor of one of those places and had been impeached tho innocent should be taken up this unexpected blow threw him into a desperate condition he feared it had been discovered that leonida was at his house and that he was arrested on that account but when they told him that it was for high treason he thought himself too happy and seemed less moved for the loss of his life than the losing of leonida however his being prevented from going to see her increased his grief to such a degree that he could not conceal it from his guards which made them conclude him guilty  the prince of carency arrived at this time at villareal and did not know what to think of the many reports he heard the flight of leonida and casilda benavidezs imprisonment and the distracted condition of don john of velasco and his lady as well as his concern for a person to whom he was contracted and the necessity he was under of using his utmost endeavors to find her together with his indifferency for her all these united perfectly confounded him he made an ineffectual attempt to speak to benavidez who was so strictly guarded that he judged the affair he was accused of would meet with no favor if once convicted unless the queens goodness would prevail with her justice he heard that leonora was her favorite and having a strong inclination to be serviceable to his friend he made his court to this old lady who though as proud as great could not but conceive a particular esteem for the prince don john and his lady were so charmed with him that their satisfaction would have been completed had not his presence renewed all the grief which the loss of leonida occasioned so that nothing could moderate the affliction of these disconsolate parents  the prince of carency was presented to the queen who received him with a respect equal to his birth and merit donna leonora used to speak so often to her of his fine qualities that she soon perceived her favorite looked on him with an obliging eye and that he triumphed in her esteem over the other princes and grandees of the court he constrained himself as much as possible to oblige her being invited by no other motive than to serve benavidez oh had he known that he was working for the greatest of his enemies and one who was endeavoring his ruin he would have left him to his evil genius  one day as the queen was walking in the palacegardens attended by most of the court donna leonora affected to keep at some distance which the prince of carency perceiving he went and saluted her she received him very graciously and asked him if he would go with her into a green arbor that was not far after he had returned her compliment he led her to the place where being set down she spoke to him in this manner do you take this opportunity i give you my lord of entertaining me as a favor i seldom grant to any your youth wit and quality are sufficient motives to make you admired but as i have no inducements to create a passion be so kind as to tell me from whence proceeds the desire you have of conversing with me is it the effect of a sympathy that is frequently found between two hearts and for which no reason can be assigned the prince was very much surpised at what he heard but still had a mind to obtain her favor on the account of benavidez without intending to make any declaration that might distinguish a lover from a friend he looked at her some time as one astonished which entirely confounded leonora you ought madam said he to be convinced that you have highly obliged me in condescending to this interview which is an honor i have this long time wished for but if you will give me leave to improve this occasion let it be in behalf of the unfortunate benavidez i know the queen has so just an opinion of your good sense that she will readily assent to any thing you are pleased to promote grant him your protection it is the greatest favor i can ask your petition is not very great replied leonora in an angry tone when you employ for another the opportunity you ought to embrace for your self is it possible my lord that you can think of your friends interest and neglect your own oh i see too well that i am deceived there can be no passion where there appears so much indifferency this embarassd the prince more than ever any thing had done yet he tried to conquer himself and taking her by the hand you know very little madam said he the language of my eyes when you form so ill a judgment of my sentiments as to doubt of my passion your charms are the only subject of my contemplation and the fear of offending you was the cause of my silence this obliging confidence my lord replied she equally flatters my vanity and love for i could not think my self so happy in your favor i am infinitely pleased at the confession you have made me and since you would have me serve benavidez i promise you to do it effectually whether he be innocent or guilty he shall be set at liberty the prince made his retributions to her in so grateful a manner that she was perfectly charmed with him but as he was tired with this disagreeable conversation he impatiently rose up and took his leave  when he was alone he abandoned himself to those reflections which were most painful to him heaven just heaven cried he what am i reserved for i find my self entangled in an amor with the ugliest of women and who is the only one that ever gave me a favorable audience oh i love my unknown at nicopolis and olympias memory is still dear to me leonida prevented by some fatality has chosen rather to fly her fathers house than yield to his commands now must i to serve my friend counterfeit a passion for this favorite who is an object fitter to inspire aversion than a more obliging sentiment  though he reproached the cruelty of his fate yet he did not omit paying his devoirs every day to leonora whose passion rose to that violence at last that she determined to marry him which was the thing in the world he least thought of she sent to him and desired he would come to her which having obeyed my lord said she if in the profession you have made me there is more truth than complaisance and that you are touched as much as you would persuade me you cannot give me a greater proof of it than by uniting your destiny with mine i will not trouble you with a detail of my birth and fortune all spain can inform you of both but shall content my self with assuring you that you will find in me so good a friend in becoming your wife  my wife have you such a thought cried the prince interrupting her here he was silent but perceiving his mistake he endeavored to recover it and assuming a tender air such an alliance madam said he would infinitely please me if i were not engaged to leonida and you know it is not in my power to retract my promise no cruel as you are i know nothing interrupted leonora in a furious manner i saw your surprise and horror at a proposal you are not worthy of you have not only deceived me but have also deceived your self know sir that in this kingdom you must not dare to offend a person of my quality unpunished especially one who has as much power as the queen benavidez shall be my first victim and take care perfidious as you are that you be not the second in finishing these words she gave him a menacing look went into her closet and shut the door with great violence leaving the astonished prince in her chamber  he immediately went to madam velascos and without any reserve acquainted her with all that had passed you may be well assured madam said he that were i not even contracted to leonida i would sooner choose to dye than marry a woman who by her cruelties is become odious to all spain i know her birth and fortune are equally great but i despise them both therefore give me your advice madam and tell me what measures i must take to deliver my self from this monster without exposing the life of benavidez that is a harder task than you imagine replied madam velasco the violent temper of this woman has already sacrificed many and i tremble for you the queen loves her to such a degree that she will blindly condescend to all her desires alas my lord why are you in spain or why are you not the husband of leonida with this she burst out into a flood of tears you weep madam said he and i have reason to believe you are concerned for me do you think this affair will have any other consequence than my being obliged to quit villa real i am no subject of spain neither is a man of my rank to be insulted without revenge and i am assured that if leonora sees me no more she will soon forget me then prepare to depart my dear son replied madam velasco embracing him tenderly i will take my daughter with me into france if she is living and nothing shall alter the resolution i have taken to make her eternally yours  though nothing could be more obliging than the assurances madam velasco gave the prince yet he did not extremely wish for the performance he was in hopes that either leonida would not be found or that her aversion for him would continue in which case the marriage of course must needs break off and he would be no longer under the obligation of executing his fathers commands he immediately took leave of don john of velasco being resolved to go away the same night in order to join the count of la march his brother who was waiting at seville for the infanta don fernand to march against the moors  he retired early to his apartment and gave orders that all things should be ready for his journey but leonora who had spies over the princes actions was soon acquainted with his sudden resolution and seeing she had no means left to prevail with him ran and threw her self at the queens feet conjuring her with tears in her eyes to take pity of her weakness the prince of carency is parting madam said she he abandons me and i shall be the wretchedest creature in the world without your majesty is pleased to protect me the hopes of being his wife flattered by his assiduity and faithless protestations made so deep an impression on me that it was not in my power to decline a passion which would have united our destinies but the traitor has deceived me and i am going to lose him for ever unless you give immediate orders to have him seized what pretense could i have to act in that manner replied the queen with that complaisance which was usual to her he is contracted to leonida and don john of velasco is in great power he has friends and relations in this court and should i undertake to break his daughters contract in favor of you it would be doing him the greatest injustice besides with what authority could i do it i have no power over that young prince dont you know he is related to the king of france and that a man of his quality is not to be dealt with like other people then consider that the count of la march his brother is actually at seville and is soninlaw to the king of navarre all these things are to be weighed with deliberation ah madam replied leonora i do not intend to expose your majesty when i entreat you to detain the prince you have a good pretense to do it without my appearing any ways concerned there is an intimate friendship between him and benavidez and would it not be sufficient to make the world understand that the prince has a hand in the rebellion your authority dispenses you from giving an account of your actions and who dares inquire into your conduct the prayers and tears of this old favorite prevailed at last with the queen and she consented that a captain of the guards should go immediately and put the prince under arrest which was no sooner executed but the queen had him brought before her and having ordered every body to withdraw spoke to him in these terms what my lord said she could one have thought you capable of betraying us and that under the notion of a friend you were privately conspiring with those who intended to deliver up some towns of this kingdom to the barbarians dont pretend prince to say any thing in your defense for nothing can justify you i am too well informed of your intreagues so prepare your self to undergo the punishment you deserve your eminent birth will not protect you without my favor and if i grant you your life it shall at least be at the expense of your liberty donna leonora loves you my lord and has already interceded for grace if you will marry her i may in regard to her forget the pernicious designs you had formed against this kingdom  the prince heard with all the respect imaginable what the queen had to say then answered her with a noble and undaunted air my heart is incapable said he of forming so mean a design as that which your majesty lays to my charge and i have too much interest in justifying myself to consent that you should forget my crime in consideration of leonora no madam i refuse the mercy you offer me and demand nothing but justice which i have no cause to fear be it ever so severe go then prince said the queen you shall be strictly guarded and severely punished if guilty  he was conducted from thence to the same castle where benavidez was prisoner and confined several days with orders that no body should be admitted to him however this affair could not be carried on with so much secrecy but that don john of velasco was informed how ill they used the prince for whom he had so great a value he addressed himself to the queen about it in very warm terms and even threatened her with the king of frances resentment but she was resolved to venture at all and show no favor to him unless he married leonora  this imperious favorite who was the only person that had leave to see the prince came one night into his chamber richly adorned with jewels but so frightful as to her person that he could hardly prevail with himself to look at her nothing shall be impossible to me said she my lovely prince taking him by the hand i have every thing in my power and if you will marry me i promise to deliver you out of this horrible prison but if you are too proud and despise me be assured you shall pass the rest of your days here or end your life in a more tragic manner ha continued she perceiving in his countenance a great deal of anger mixed with disdain do you conceive less horror for the block than for my person i am not young i confess yet such as you see me i can make the felicity of the greatest princes in spain who daily offer me their sighs and vows which with mine i sacrifice to you see my my dear prince see what a shameful part you make me act i blush in confessing my weakness and your obligation to me ought to be the greater i who make all the court tremble am here before you like a victim uncertain of life or death waiting its doom say then will you decide my fate you are the only man that can make me happy and without you i am for ever wretched whilst leonora was speaking the prince of carency felt so violent an aversion for her that he could hardly command his passion but having overcome it a little he said with a very indifferent air are you not yet satisfied with what you make me suffer and will you for ever persecute me with a passion to which i can make no return i declare that in my thoughts the misfortune of being beloved by you is one of the greatest that could happen to me and since my sincerity offends you pursue your rage and let your vengeance fall on a man who can reproach himself with no other crime but that of having given you room for some time to believe he could like you after these words he was silent and whatever she could say to him he would not make her any answer  she ran out of his chamber like a fury threatening him with speedy death and from thence went directly to see benavidez who was very uneasy as one may well conceive having been disappointed in his design relating to leonida and not knowing whether she was still at his house or whether since his confinement her father had not found her out and married her to the prince of carency besides he could not tell but the crime he was accused of though innocent might cost him his life  these reflections were tormenting him when he saw leonora coming into his chamber he could not imagine the cause of so unexpected a favor and just as he was going to make his retributions to her she began in these terms benavidez said she with a voice that expressed the motions of her soul your life or death now depends on the best of your friends you are impeached and believed guilty the prince of carency who loves you entirely is actually a prisoner with you in this castle and i am willing to let you know that i have conceived a particular esteem for that prince you shall have leave to see him and be sure you use your utmost endeavors to persuade him to marry me in which case i answer for your liberty but otherwise you will have cause to fear both for him and your self farewell remember now that your interest and mine must be the same after having spoke to him in this manner she gave him no time to make any answer but went away with great precipitation  benavidez who before was despairing could not hear this news without being extremely pleased he resolved to use his utmost address in persuading the prince and as he knew the influence he had over him he flattered himself with easily overcoming all difficulties what a happiness will it be cried he if he yields to leonoras desires i shall then be sure of my charming leonida and this favorite whom i shall oblige will in gratitude employ her credit to make her mine i find it is not as yet known where she is my house has this treasure still in its possession and as soon as i obtain my liberty i will go and visit her in her retirement after having employed his thoughts on so agreeable a change of fortune he could not help reproaching himself with the treacherous part he had acted toward his friend and leonida no said he i shall never enjoy a real felicity since i must be obliged to deceive two persons who so entirely deserve my affection and will be inconsolable when they come to know one another to find their destiny changed by my perfidiousness these reflections gave him some concern but as his love transcended his friendship he resolved to arm himself against all remorse  whilst he expected with great impatience to speak with the prince of carency don john of velasco was using all his endeavors to get him out of prison he at last bribed one of the guards who having brought ropes and a file helped to cut the bars of his window and the night being very dark they both escaped on horses that were waiting for them  but this could not be done so secretly as not to alarm some of the guards who heard a noise in the princes apartment which they entered and perceiving his flight went immediately to give notice of it to leonora this news made her furious she ordered several horsemen who were all devoted to her interest to pursue him and was so confounded that without knowing what she said she commanded them to take different ways and told em that in case they overtook him and could not prevail with him to return they should kill him but after they had left her and the first effects of her passion were over she reflected on the cruel commands she had given and did not at all doubt but they would be too well executed by those villains what cried she am i going to be the murderer of a man for whom i would willingly lay down my life and do i convey the poinyard to his breast oh unjust fate why are you not contented with taking from me the object i love without making me the author of his death being thus prepossessed with dismal thoughts she was no more mistress of her self she sent immediately to countermand her inhuman orders but alas it was too late they had killed the prince in spite of his brave resistance which was so great that he would not have been overcome but by a vast superiority  leonora was saluted with this news at villareal which she received as one who already expected it and had no other thought but that of dying the prayers and tears of the queen were of no force she tore her hair and wounded her face and her extreme grief soon forwarded her death which made some atonement for the barbarity she had just caused to be acted on one of the finest princes in the world  don john of velasco and his lady were inconsolable for his loss reproaching themselves for not giving him a sufficient guard they regretted him as if he had been their own child and loaded with imprecations the memory of leonora benavidez not being so strictly guarded as before was soon informed of the princes death but his love triumphed over his gratitude which made him perfectly insensible of the misfortune of a person who had loved him so entirely  whilst these things were passing at court leonida and casilda under the names of felicia and beatricia were strangely alarmed in their solitude the gentleman who had left them safe there acquainted them with benavidezs being made a prisoner of state and accused of having a correspondence with the moors casilda at this news was resolved to go back to villareal in order to intetcede for her brother and do him what service she was capable of but leonida who feared to remain there alone represented to her that as leonora was not her friend and that through her means she had already lost the queens favor her presence instead of mending her brothers affairs would make them worse that besides she would have the mortification of seeing henriquez married to donna blanca which would only renew her grief these arguments would not have prevailed with casilda had she not apprehended that in leaving leonida who in the mean time might return to her fathers house benavidez would lose all the fruits of her artificial management which consideration prevented her journey  leonida and casilda used often to walk in a forest near their house and one evening as they were sitting by the side of a rivulet a horse ran by in a full gallop which frightened them very much seeing no body on his back they quitted the place hastily and as they were in their way toward the castle their surprise was much greater when they perceived two men lying on the ground wounded and covered with blood such a sight was very frightful to these young ladies who believing they were dead durst not approach them but ran home and called some of their servants with whom they immediately came back in order to give assistance to these two gentlemen if happily it were not too late  the ladies now having some attendance with them came up to these unknown cavaliers and found that one of them was already dead and the other still breathing leonida who had hitherto seen all mankind with indifferency seemed to have something more than compassion for the misfortune of this stranger whom one might judge by his noble air and dress to be of the first quality and as casilda appeared to be equally concerned leonida did not so much wonder at the effects it produced in her  oh what pity would it be cried leonida looking at casilda should this stranger die but what hopes can one have of his life it is possible he is now expiring in saying this she sprinkled water on his face and laid his head on her knees whilst casilda caused a sort of carriage to be made with the branches of a tree at last fetching a sigh he opened his eyes and perceiving leonida made an effort to speak to her but his spirits being wasted he fell into a swoon which gave them reason to believe his life was in danger  leonida and casilda whom i must now call felicia and beatricia when the carriage was finished ordered their servants to lay the stranger on it and thus they conveyed him to their house in great silence being perplexed with such a multitude of thoughts as would not admit of any interruption as soon as they were there they sent to carmona for a surgeon who after having probed his wounds told them they were not mortal this agreeable news changed the scene of sorrow into that of joy felicia went to his bedside and by this time he had recovered his speech which he employed in returning thanks for her generosity i can no longer deplore said he in a feeble voice the dismal adventure that had happened to me since it gives me an opportunity of knowing the most deserving person in the world but i fear madam my being in your house may incommode you which extremely lessens the satisfaction i should have to be where you are in saying these words he looked at her with so much admiration and pleasure that had she understood the language of his eyes she would have easily guessed at the motions of his heart do not be uneasy sir replied she you shall want for no assistance nor have reason to apprehend we see you here with displeasure you are now in a condition wherein silence and rest are equally necessary which reason induces me to leave you with that she retired and left beatricia behind her who as soon as felicia was gone approached the bed and said to him though may sister has assured you how desirous we are to be serviceable to you yet i must repeat the same and conjure you sir to have no other thought but that of recovering your health it will be no easy matter madam replied the prince to recover in a place where the objects i see may prove more dangerous to me than the wounds i have received beatricia who did not doubt but these words were addressed to her seemed not to comprehend their meaning but taking leave of him went to felicias apartment and asked her what the stranger had said to her she without dissembling gave her an account of their conversation which very much pleased beatricia i must confess said she he expressed himself more obligingly to me than he did to you these words gave some uneasiness to felicia without knowing from whence it proceeded  beatricia who was in a different disposition of mind proposed to her self that the only means to banish don henriquez from her heart was to yield it to another whatever trouble a new inclination may give me thought she it never can be equal to the pain i endure the man i love is now in the arms of donna blanca and all my hopes on that side are vanished but in placing my affection on some other object it may be kindly returned i had cause enough to apprehend that felicia would appear more beautiful than me in the eyes of this lovely stranger but his words have convinced me of the contrary and i am resolved to be favorable to him whatever may be the event love is a pleasing torment  the prince of carency continued ill some time and during his illness received daily instances of the generosity of these ladies particularly felicias obliging behavior to him on all occasions made him desirous to express his gratitude he began to think his preservation was chiefly owing to her tender care and by degrees fell desperately in love which threw into the following reflections how difficult a task will it be to make an impression on that unpracticed heart her modest looks and the blushes which cover her cheeks every time i cast my eyes on her evince how little she his acquainted with love and dare i flatter my self with succeeding in such an attempt no i must not hope for so great a favor from fortune i was beloved at nicopolis by a person i never knew i no sooner became captive to the charms of a lady at genoa but death snatched the dear object from me and lately as i arrived at villareal with a resolution to marry leonida i was informed of her flight and aversion to me alas my unkind stars were not satisfied to afflict me with all these misfortunes they have sent me a greater one leonoras passion for me her desperate rage caused me to be treated in this barbarous manner and her cruelty would still threaten my days with the greatest dangers were she informed that i had escaped and was now in this place but oh how can i resolve to leave felicia who is already more dear to me than the life i would endeavor to preserve all i can do in this distressed state is to change my name i am inclined to believe that as i was taken for the count of la vagne at genoa i may pass for the same here where i am not known if it be my good fortune to render my sentiments agreeable to this lovely charmer i shall never wish for a greater blessing i do not doubt but she has an affection for her sister therefore i must address my self to her and obtain favor if possible by her means the prince used often to entertain himself after this manner betwixt hope and fear  beatricia one morning rose earlier than felicia and went to see the prince who was awake and had rested very ill all night as soon as he saw her enter the chamber he thanked her for so obliging a care and told her he hoped she had reposed much better than he had done i must confess sir said she i have felt some uneasiness which i must lay to your charge since it proceeds from the curiosity i have to know who you are and the uncertainty i am in of being satisfied on that subject you judge very unfavourably of my gratitude madam replied the prince if you think me capable of not obeying your commands i am of genoa and of the house of fiesque my title is the count of la vagne i have been some years in my travels and as i was riding through the neighboring forest in my way to seville i was assaulted by robbers i did my endeavor to resist them but their number overpowered me and left me madam in the condition you saw me i know your family my lord replied beatricia and could have judged in seeing you that your extraction was illustrious the count of la vagne for now i must give that title to the prince of carency interrupted her to enquire after felicia but with a kind of impatience which did not very much please beatricia who in a cold manner made answer she had not as yet seen her as she was speaking the surgeon came in to the dress princes wounds so she thought fit to retire she went directly from thence to felicias apartment who was just rising what said she to beatricia dressed already how comes it sister you are up so early i can give you no other reason replied she only i was ashamed to lie a bed so fine a morning but will you believe i have been to visit the stranger and that i know his name and country you may as well say interrupted felicica that you know also the secrets of his heart no replied beatricia smiling i am very sincere and can assure you our conversation ended with his acquainting me that he is of genoa and is called the count of la vagne as you are to visit him next perhaps you may learn something more i have not so much curiosity as you imagine replied felicia and i fancy i shall trouble him but very little with my presence accordingly she did not go into the princes chamber till late in the evening being then informed he was very ill for his uneasiness at not seeing her all that day and the pain occasioned by his wounds had thrown him into a violent fever as soon as she approached his bed he looked at her with much tenderness and said i flattered my self more than i ought to have done madam in thinking the condition i am in had moved your pity since i find at present nothing touched you but the sad aspect of a dying man pierced with wounds and lying in a sea of blood you abandon me charming felicia and take no care to preserve the life of an unhappy wretch who is indebted to you alone for the small share he has left of it i would not incommode you with a visit my lord replied felicia my sister having told me this morning that in the state you are in nothing was more necessary than repose no no madam said he interrupting her you have not thought on me donna beatricia did not hinder you from coming to see me your eyes convince me of the truth and you only wish my recovery to banish me your presence for ever he said this with an air so moving that she could not help showing in her looks more affection than indifferency you have been here so little a while replied she that i hardly have had time to consult my inclinations yet give me leave to assure you that i find nothing in them to your prejudice and should very much regret my having known you if i thought in leaving this place you would entirely forget me she expressed these last words blushing and with some fear which charmed the prince who was going to make his retributions when beatricia entered the chamber in some disorder one of my women my lord said she who is just returned from walking in the forest found this picture in the same place where we first saw you i suppose it is yours and the person it represents is too charming not to merit all your affection the prince told her it was true the picture had been recommended to his care and received it with a deep sigh it was that which olympia doria had presented to him this gave much uneasiness to felicia who could not help desiring to see it but had hardly turned her eyes on it when her mind was filled with trouble which to conceal she retired to her closet where being alone i thought said she i had only casilda to fear but alas my fate is much more severe for certainly the person he loves is the most beautiful creature in the world and his passion is returned since she has given him her picture if he should cease to love her on my account it would be a perfidiousness that might give me room to fear in my turn a resembling destiny and if he is constant to her what can i hope she yielded her self up to these sad reflections and leaving them for others more tormenting oh continued she could any thing be more fatal than this last adventure i flew from the prince of carency because my parents would have me marry contrary to my inclination i thought my self safe in this forest where i only apprehended to meet with wild beasts but these fierce animals have done me no harm it is a stranger a dying man that has deprived me of my peace and made me acquainted with sentiments i thought leonidas heart incapable of receiving a shower of tears attended these words and she resolved never more to see this dangerous cavalier for which reason she feigned an indisposition and confined her self to her bed but could not help enquiring after the count who was now extremely ill his fever was very much increased by his not seeing felicia and his anxious reflections so tormented him that he thought of nothing but death  he was in evident danger when beatricia entered felicias chamber all in tears there are no hopes left sister cried she the unhappy count is dying if you have a mind to see him before he expires you have no time to lose felicia was not prepared for this disagreeable news which had like to have thrown her into a swoon but being a little recovered she repented the obstinate resolution she had made to see him no more she thought now she was going to lose him for ever and that such a loss would make her the most unfortunate person in the world ye powers above cried she going toward his apartment give me the count of la vagne were he never to love me should he even hate me let him live  she ran into his chamber whilst he was in a fainting fit his eyes were shut and he had neither voice nor pulse she approached him trembling and raising his head laid it on her bosom bathed his face with tears and at that instant was more to be deplored than him she lamented at last he fetched a deep sigh and opening his eyes was transported to find his dear felicia near him and so touched at his illness he looked languishing at her and making an effort to speak ah divine felicia said he is it you that gives me assistance and are you come to save me from death you need no longer fear for a life i cannot lose since its preservation is become your concern my lord replied she low enough to be heard only by him believe me your life is very dear to me and i wish nothing more than its continuance if you knew what you have made me suffer you  here beatricia interrupted them by her presence so they could not pursue their discourse but these few words produced such wonderful effects in the count that he daily recovered  how much were these lovers to be pitied not knowing each other chance had contrived to make them meet yet it was their unhappy destiny not to enjoy a blessing for which they would have sacrificed every thing such is the misfortune of some persons who purchase the most innocent pleasures at the expense of a thousand torments felicia accompanied by her sister went often to see the count who observed the care she took never to be alone with him but he could not desire beatricia to give him an opportunity of entertaining felicia for though of all mankind he had the least vanity yet he perceived by her looks and expressions that she had some favorable thoughts of him and consequently an improper person for a confidant but one evening hearing she was gone into the forest without her sister he caused himself to be dressed and though he had hardly strength enough to walk yet went to felicias apartment  she could not help being very much surprised when she saw the count who fell at her feet without having power to speak one word he took her hand and kissed it with such transports as expressed the motions of his soul felicias disorder was not inferior to his they looked at one another as if they had met after a long absence at last the count broke silence you have inspired me madam said he with a passion so transcendent that you must needs have perceived it in all my actions and i must confess i thought you took some pity on me but i have too much cause to believe the contrary since your looks express the utmost indifference oh judge how uneasy i am at this cruel uncertainty i now come to know my fate and conjure you adorable felicia to tell me what i must expect my love is such that nothing can ever make it change and were i sovereign of the universe i would lay it at your feet here he was silent and felicia replied with as much grace as modesty my concern was so great whilst you were speaking my lord that i did not consider you were on your knees i beg you will rise if you are desirous i should say any thing to you he obeyed her commands but feared to cast his eyes on her being like a man who expected to hear the sentence of his death we are both in a disorder said she which we might have avoided had you not spoke to me of your passion i must confess my lord to my shame that the same inclination which engaged you to entertain me has prevailed with me to hear you what more can i say of my weakness continued she blushing i discovered part of your sentiments and endeavored in vain to conceal mine i had never loved any thing before any my stars have decreed you should become agreeable to me yet do not think to take any advantage from so sincere a confession since i declare my mind this time with a resolution never to speak to you more but without having a desire to penetrate into the cause i cannot help telling you the fear i am in of being made a sacrifice to another whom perhaps you might love better than me oh madam cried the count in a rapture judge better of a man whom you have just loaded with your favors and do not suspect ingratitude from a heart that bears your image be assured a person who sighs for you can never think of any other object what have not i to fear replied she from the lady whose picture you so much esteem that shall never give you the least trouble said the amorous count presenting it to her here it is keep it as an evincement of my fidelity felicia was touched at so great a proof of his passion and expressed much satisfaction in receiving it then desired him to retire apprehending that his being up so long might do him a prejudice and whatever violence he did his inclinations he could not refuse obeying her  as soon as he was gone she reflected on all that had passed what leonida said she are you not content with hearing a declaration which you ought to have declined but also have owned to a stranger that you could love him you who are engaged to the prince of carency can you be so easily captivated and weak enough to confess your affection for another you have already shown your jealousy which is a certain proof of a violent passion what judgment will the count form from such a behavior you are going to lose his heart and become a disgrace to your sex oh unfortunate creature what must you do to atone for a fault which seems of so high a nature these thoughts gave her the deepest concern and her face was bathed with tears when beatricia returned but she took so much care to hide them that they were not perceived  the count being retired to his chamber passed his time the most agreeably in the world when he called to mind felicias generosity but could hardly flatter himself with the success he wished for oh love said he will you at last change my pain into pleasure and repair the ills you have done me amiable felicia has heard me and protested i was not indifferent to her heavens let us be for ever united that our good or ill fortune may equally affect us day began to appear before he could close his eyes he rose and went to see felicia who was alone in her closet reflecting on that which had racked her imagination all night she received the count with much civility but appeared so melancholy that he knew not what to think of so great an alteration what is my crime madam said he have i done any think to incur your displeasure you seem unwilling to turn your eyes on me are you concerned for having given me room to think myself the happiest of men and do you already regret the obliging terms you employed yesterday to banish my alarms alas continued he are you resolved to cast me at once into despair by so cruel a change no my lord replied she looking at him with an air that might convince him of the contrary i have used ineffectual means to conquer those sentiments i discovered to you i wish i could see you with indifference but i find it is not in my power do not then be uneasy i alone ought to be so the count transported with love and gratitude took felicias hand and kissed it with all the marks of passion and respect that could be expressed on such an occasion beatricia being informed they were together entered suddenly the chamber they were in and surprised them just as the count was kissing felicias hand how strangely was she amazed at seeing this she changed color several times and her eyes were animated with an uncommon fire which they immediately perceived though she endeavored to conceal her disorder  their conversation turned on a general subject and from that hour she used all possible means to prevent their entertaining one another in private these proceedings extremely perplexed the count divine felicia said he to her one day pity my sufferings and consider how severe a law i am forced to impose on myself when i silence a passion which i have had the good fortune to render agreeable to you what authority has your sister to lay so cruel a restraint on you i see her uneasiness my lord replied felicia and to show the confidence i have in you i will own to you she is not my sister nor even related to me i would have let you sooner into the secret had i found a favorable opportunity oh madam how obilging is this declaration replied the count and what reproaches do i owe myself for not having acquainted you with the circumstances of my life the hours i passed in your company were so transient that i chose to employ them in confessing the power of your charms we both of us have erred my lord replied felicia in neglecting to inform each other of some particulars which are essential to our future felicity yet if i may judge of your heart by my own it had no share in this omission and i promise to give you a faithful relation of all that has passed from my infancy you will then find it is not without cause that i sigh sometimes and complain of the rigor of my fate but you must prepare your self to overcome a great many difficulties if you persevere in your love for the unhappy felicia oh madam replied he no difficulties can ever alarm me i have love and courage to assist me and if you espouse my interest all things will be easy to me but said she suppose i were contracted to another what would you do at these words the count changed color what do you tell me madam cried he contracted oh heavens to what misfortunes am i doomed do not afflict your self my lord replied she i am yet mistress of my destiny can you think i would receive your addresses if i had an inclination for any other no such a proceeding would render my heart unworthy of you these assurances gave some ease to the counts mind who was just going to express his satisfaction to his charming mistress when beatricia came and troubled them with her presence  her jealousy was now increased to such a degree that she was even distracted when she saw them speaking to one another and as soon as she was alone she abandoned herself to the most violent despair i am not beloved said she and i flattered myself that i had inspired the count with such sentiments as would have been agreeable to me but he is entirely devoted to felicia he adores her and she triumphs over my weakness what do i say continued she after having reflected some time perhaps if he were acquainted with the motions of my soul he would act another part ah why did i not declare my thoughts to him and why should i accuse him of being the cause of my torment since he does not know the indisposition i am in i must either inform him of what i feel or resolve to see him constant in his passion for my rival  after having passed the greatest part of the night in reflections of this nature she rose early and sent to the count desiring he would meet her in the garden this unexpected message gave him some uneasiness notwithstanding he obeyed her orders and as soon as she saw him her mind almost changed in relation to the subject that induced her to send for him he asked her obligingly what were her commands to which she answered in these terms your health my lord is so perfectly recovered that i fear we shall lose you soon and as i have some reason to be convinced our company is not indifferent to you i take this occasion to assure you how pleased we should be to see you remain here yet i cannot help saying i have endeavored in vain to discover whether my sister or i have the precedence in you affections perhaps this question may show my indiscretion but i believe you a man of too much honor to leave me in an uncertainty therefore let your inclinations determine in favor of either of us i will do you all the service in my power and if you make me your confidant it shall no ways lessen my friendship for you the count who was above any dissimulation expressed much pleasure at the opportunity she gave him to declare his sentiments nothing can be more generous than your proceeding madam said he and i should be unworthy of your goodness if i did not repay it with sincerity i am in love it is true and you would have been the object of it had i not feared my passion might offend you young felicia has captivated my heart and i conjure you to favor me in my attempt on hers i shall in return show my esteem and gratitude to you for so considerable a service beatricia at these words was thunderstruck and would have fallen down at his feet were it not for a tree that stood by which supported her she made a vain effort to conceal her grief her color changed and the tears which ran from her eyes discovered part of her sufferings to the count who said many obliging things to her by way of consolation and protested he would for ever do his best endeavors to serve her but all he could say was not capable of giving her satisfaction love requires love and it is an offense of the highest degree to offer any other thing in return  about this time don fernand benavidez who was innocent of the crime laid to his charge having no more leonora for his enemy began after the death of this favorite to be heard in his justification he wrote the particulars to casilda and withal that he was in hopes of being soon set at liberty after which he would immediately go to see leonida this she kept secret till she had penetrated into the sentiments of the count but when she found all her hopes were destroyed she thought of nothing but tormenting these happy lovers in their amor what said she shall i suffer this ungrateful man to be blessed with the sight of my rival and omit acquainting my brother with an adventure wherein he is so much concerned he doats on leonida whilst she loves the count of la vagne and is equally beloved my brother and i without doubt must be the victims of their passion and he will load me with eternal reproaches for having admitted so dangerous a stranger into his house i must sacrifice him to my revenge for what can i expect from his cruelty my sighs and tears had no power to move his pity and since nothing can prevail with him i will punish his barbarity i have but this remedy left and cannot flatter my despairing soul with any other relief  having tormented her self with these confused thoughts she wrote a letter to her brother wherein she gave him the particulars relating to what she knew of the count of la vagne telling him at the same time that he had conceived a passion for leonida who returned it with sentiments so obliging that she believed it would be impossible to disengage them unless he took very secret measures benavidez was strangely affected with this news which he received the day the queen had ordered his liberty what said he to the gentleman who had accompanied the young ladies to his castle have i deprived the prince of carency of the possession of this excellent creature to yield her to the count of la vagne i thought i had concealed her in a place so retired that she would have escaped the most penetrating spy yet the cruelty of my fortune has so contrived it that she should find in that solitary forest one of the handsomest men in the world expiring and prevent his fate by making his preservation her care which i fear has robbed me of leonidas heart my confinement cost the prince his life whose generosity engaged him to make his addresses to leonora with the only view of procuring my liberty by what fatality continued he does the count of la vagne live is not he the same whose death olympia daria so much deplored that her grief terminated her days has he so little gratitude after loving a mistress who died for him to make a second choice her impression ought to have been everlasting but i will punish his inconstancy to her and his new passion for leonida who has made me already commit too many crimes to leave my felicity imperfect i must give some ease to my bleeding heart by depriving this too happy rival of his life these violent reflections were followed by many others for he thought that if he kept leonida longer at his house as chance had made her acquainted with the count of la vagne a like accident might expose her to the sight of some persons who knew her and would inform don john of her retreat  love and jealousy would not permit him to stay any time at villa real he had no sooner seen the queen and returned her thanks for his liberty but went privately to porto real in order to dispose every thing for the carrying off of leonida to morocco where he was sure to be in high esteem having several relations of great distinction in barbary  he there made an agreement with a captain of a ship then went to his country seat but stopped first in the forest and sent for his steward to whom he gave a letter to casilda with orders to deliver it into her own hands he was not long expecting an answer for he saw her coming with the man he had sent benavidez went up to her and after having embraced her tenderly sought for the most concealed place to entertain her and here they took resolutions so contrary to the felicity of the count and leonida that it had like to have deprived them of their lives oh how far were they from foreseeing their misfortune since at this time they were making protestations of eternal love and little thought that benavidez and his sister were proposing means to disappoint them  casilda told her brother she had sufficient reason to be convinced that the counts addresses to leonida were favorably received i will cross their passion interrupted benavidez with a furious air i am resolved to seize on leonida and carry her to morocco you shall go with us but before we part i must sacrifice the presumptuous count of la vagne to my resentment what brother cried she almost distracted will you not be content to possess your mistress without my going with you to a place for which i have so great an aversion i do not intend to do any violence to your inclinations said he in making you this proposal but i suppose the same motive which invited you to abandon the count and enter into this retirement may engage you to go elsewhere nevertheless sister you are under no constraint the only thing i desire you will do for my satisfaction is to contrive a way for me to be hidden this night in the counts chamber that i may have the pleasure of striking a heart that dares adore leonida suspend your design barbarian interrupted casilda in her first transports i am as little able to hear you as second your cruelty the counts life shall not be in your power till your have taken away mine what do you say sister cried benavidez extremely surpised i can hardly believe what i hear is it possible that you love this stranger and have already forgot hinriquez are you destined ever to make choice of ungrateful men remember how your first lover treated you and what you are to expect from this do you imagine that after having a passion for leonida and being beloved by her he can change his mind in favor of you this is very disobliging replied casilda but i hope every thing and flatter my self with his love if he sees her no more seize on her fly with her and leave me here with him will it be consistent with your honor to stay alone with the count said he what will the count think of it if once it is known at villa real they will think nothing to my prejudice replied she the count must be mine or i retire into a monastry so that i shall have but little reason to be concerned at the worlds opinion whether good or ill fortune attends me do you consider sister said benavidez that your affection for my rival may put him hereafter in a condition to dispute leonida with me i would have shown his corpse to her defaced with wounds and her hopes being destroyed by his death she would easily consent to make me happy what an error it is replied casilda to suppose that so horrid a scene could introduce you into her favor she would ever reproach you of the greatest cruelty yet if you believe his death will serve your designs say you have killed him though its uncommon to boast of such a fact were it even true  benavidez perceiving his sister loved the count too passionately to consent to so cruel an action in compliance to her as well as out of fear of her making any discovery would no longer insist upon it to show my affection for you dear casilda said he i submit to your pleasure only oblige me in being secret he had brought with him three men devoted to his interest who he was sure could carry off leonida without being discovered therefore having taken effectual measures with casilda the design was soon executed to his satisfaction  that evening his sister invited leonida to take a turn in the park and by degrees led her into an alley which conveyed them toward the forest till at last night coming on and leonida hearing a noise was going to retire when she was seized by benavidez and his men in spite of the fright she was in she endeavored to disengage her self from them and having sufficient room to believe it was a plot against her she cried out repeating several times the count of la vagnes name and called him to her succor but alas he did not suspect his felicia was in danger who was carried off and gone a great way before he heard of her or his own misfortune casilda took care the count should know nothing that night of what had passed to prevent his pursuing her brother but sent to him the next morning and desired he would come into her apartment having an affair of consequence to communicate to him as soon as he entered her chamber she affected to be melancholy there is no friendship said she but love can dissolve you were witness my lord of that between felicia and me she is not my sister i must confess yet i never could have imagined she would abandon me in such a manner read this letter which she left on her toilet it was just now delivered to me you will find it equally regards us the count in taking it expressed as much uneasiness as if he had known it to be a messenger of ill news it was written in these terms  the affection you have for your brother and your fears of exposing him to any danger were the motives that hindered me from acquainting you sooner with his and my design you certainly would have opposed it had you known i am going away with him this night i could wish sister your love for me would invite you to come to us at jaen you may assure your self i should be overjoyed to see you and hear that your sentiments for the count of la vagne have met with a kind return i leave him with you so hope you will have no cause hereafter to complain of his indifference as i have a particular esteem for him i desire you will inform him of what you know concerning my affairs that he may be convinced it is no more in my power to dispose of my heart and remember my dear casilda that if i made my resolution a secret you ought to forgive me since faults of love deserve rather pity than anger   this fatal letter threw the count into such an agony that he was like a man who felt the tortures of an approaching death he turned pale and all his senses abandoned him casilda who was prepared for this dismal scene took care that speedy assistance should be given him and by the help and force of remedies he soon came to himself he opened his eyes and seeing several persons about him made signs to them to withdraw which they obeyed and left casilda with him in the chamber he looked at her some time without being able to utter one word at last having recovered his speech he said in a feeble accent it was unkind in you madam to acquaint me with the greatest misfortune that could ever happen to me no my lord interrupted casilda i do not deserve a reproach it is but reasonable you should be informed of felicias sentiments after what she has done for benavidez who is this you name the prince suddenly replied i name don fernand benavidez my brother said she and the lady who went here by the name of felicia of leon is leonida of velasco her father had contracted her to the prince of carency who is highly distinguished by his eminent birth and personal merit but having conceived a tender affection for my brother she preferred this retirement to the court and would not wait the unwelcome arrival of a person to whom her father had destined her we came away together from villa real and ever since she has continued a mutual correspondence with my brother her going away with him last night is an evincement of this truth the prince at these words broke out into so passionate a grief that it would have moved the most inhuman heart with pity o cruel fortune cried he will you never cease to persecute me was it then leonida i saw and to whose potent charms i yielded only to make me more wretched through her inconstancy the ungrateful fair betrays and flies me and that dear friend too that same benavidez for whom i sacrificed my self he is the man who has imposed on my credulity he is in love with the woman to whom i am promised and the traitor described her to me as a monster to make me conceive an aversion for her is this all the reward i must expect after having adored leonida and so entirely loved benavidez casilda was in the greatest astonishment imaginable to hear the prince express himself in these terms she easily understood by his discourse that he was the same prince of the house of bourbon whom the count of la march his father had contracted to leonida but her surprise was the greater because she thought the prince not finding leonida at villa real was returned to france and as she knew nothing of his adventure with leonora she could not well conceive by what accident he had been attacked in the forest and why he had changed his name these different circumstances wholly employed her thoughts the prince on the other side could not moderate his grief he was like a person deprived of his senses what with sighs tears and menaces no man ever appeared in a more deplorable condition  what need you my lord said she express so much concern for leonida she never loved you you see she has preferred benavidez and forgets even the rules of modesty to follow her lover why then will you suffer so much for an ungrateful woman who merits not your consideration oh madam cried the prince i know not what i do my despair is so great that i am no longer master of my reason my misfortunes are not to be comprehended i find my self betrayed by a person who was contracted to me from her infancy and by a friend to whom i had confided the secrets of my soul leonida who seemed to approve my passion has deceived me and added contempt to her ingratitude she knew i adored her yet the perfidious fair received my vows only to sacrifice them to another just heaven revenge me of this perjured beauty but what do i say continued he a moment after i have not resolution enough to wish her the punishment she deserves she is dear to me in spite of all and i will do my utmost endeavors to regain her oh i love her and love her to distraction the force of my resentment must fall on the traitor benavidez his blood shall atone for the affront i have received you might do what you say my lord interrupted casilda if leonida loved him less but you have sufficient cause to believe by the letter she left and his flight that she is now married to him they are gone together to jaen don alonzo who is governor of that town and my brothers uncle approves his passion for her and will protect him believe me then the design you form is impracticable do you think benavidez would have made such a step without taking all necessary measures for it don john of velasco is one of the greatest men in spain and my brother knowing his power has carried her to a place where he defies his enemies his precautions interrupted the prince will be ineffectual against me i neither fear danger nor death and if i revenge my wrongs i shall die with content  live my lord replied casilda blushing oh live for me since my passion for you is transcendent think with what pleasure i received you into this house and though your retributions were no ways equal to the greatness of the favor yet nothing could prevent the fatality of my destiny which not only forces me to love you but even deprives me of my peace and liberty ah my lord can sentiments so tender make no impression my fortune is great and my family one of the first in castile then let our hearts be so united as we may be for ever happy i will leave my friends and relations to follow you to the utmost bounds of the world while casilda was thus declaring her mind to the prince and flattering her self with success he walked distractedly up and down the chamber with his arms crossed taking so little notice of her discourse that he neither looked at her nor made any answer but like a man in a violent passion was leaving the apartment without knowing what he did or where to direct his course  casilda who could not bear the thoughts of losing the prince had no longer reason in her words or actions but ran and stopped him with her face drowned in tears will you go barbarian said she what will you fly me and abandon a woman that adores you to follow perfidious leonida leave her with my brother despise her and to complete your revenge even forget her since by her behavior she has rendered her self unworthy of your love my quality is equal to hers and what i have superior to her is my constancy but what do i see oh heavens cried she looking at him with what ingratitude am i rewarded you leave me to expose your self to the greatest dangers you  she was going to continue her discourse when the prince interrupted her what would you have me do madam said he can i love any thing but leonida and were i capable of a change could it be in favor of the sister of benavidez ah do you deprive me even of hope which is not denied the most unfortunate replied she shedding a shower of tears where fury had no less a share than love but inhuman as you are dont think to live in peace with your cruelty i will find means to torment you and make you repent the little regard you have to my sufferings  the prince did not stay to make any answer to casilda whom he left in her chamber without either strength to follow him or power to speak a word but was meditating on several violent designs being divided between love jealousy and despair  after this scene it is not to be imagined the prince would remain in benavidezs house he resolved immediately to go to carmona where he thought he might hear something concerning leonida and as that town was in his way to jaen which was the place mentioned in her letter to casilda he was in hopes by a strict enquiry to discover the road benavidez had taken with this design he set out but could not help complaining of the adversity of his fortune can i ever flatter my self said he with the possession of a heart that has so inhumanly betrayed me what motive could induce leonida to act in so deceitful a manner was it only to sacrifice me to benavidez no i cannot harbor such injurious thoughts of one who appeared so modest and virtuous then calling to mind that she had told him she was engaged why cruel creature said he as if he were speaking to her why did not you entirely confide in me you are engaged it is true since i am the man to whom you are contracted we should have known each other and perhaps you might have loved me but instead of acting sincerely you have carried your perfidiousness to an extremity you listened to my transcendent passion and flattered me with a return only to make my despair proportionable  had his distraction been of a more moderate nature it is probable he would have apprehended farther consequences from the fury and resentment of leonora for as yet he was not informed of her death besides he had no mind to go to seville for fear of seeing the count of la march his brother to whom he would be obliged to relate his adventure with leonida and the error she had been guilty of which he could not resolve being of a generous temper and incapable of saying any thing to the prejudice of a lady he loved so entirely  these obstacles at another time would have embarassd the prince but in this conjuncture they did not in the least affect him for his thoughts were wholly employed on the measures he should take to recover his dear leonida he arrived at carmona and though in a spanish dress was presently known to be a foreigner by the fairness of his complexion and color of his hair he carried in his countenance such marks of melancholy that no body could see him without concern the governor of that place was soon acquainted with his arrival and as he had received orders from court not to let any stranger pass that way without examination hearing he was a person of quality and a foreigner out of a compliment he paid a visit to the prince who received him with so much politeness and grandeur that after a short conversation and many offers of service the governor invited him to accept of an apartment in the castle  the prince returned his civility in a most obliging manner and desired to be excused because his affairs would not permit him to stay above one night at carmona but the other unwilling to be denied repeated his importunities and with much difficulty persuaded him to comply with his request  a noble entertainment was prepared in the castle for the prince who could not suppress his violent chagrin which the governor perceived but would not enquire into the cause he understood by his discourse that his design was to go to jaen and as he had a son who commanded a company in the citadel of that place and whose name was don gabriel dagular he told the prince very obligingly that if he approved of it he would write to him in order to acquaint him with his arrival there and added that if it were in his sons power to serve him he was satisfied he would neglect no opportunity of expressing his readiness  this free and gallant behavior of the governor engaged the prince to accept his offer with the same freedom he knew no body at jaen and as he wanted the assistance of some person in whom he could confide to enter privately the citadel where he thought benavidez and leonida were retired he the more willingly embraced so favorable an occasion the next day having made his acknowledgments to the governor for his extraordinary favors he took leave of him and left carmona but not without acquainting don john of velasco with what had passed that he might act on his side for the recovery of leonida never was surprise greater than that which his letters caused at court for don john and his lady were persuaded the prince had been killed by leonoras assassins one may imagine how great was their joy when they heard heaven had preserved him yet it could no ways alleviate their inexpressible grief for the loss of their daughter they immediately thought of means to get her away from jaen where they believed she was but whilst the prince is on his journey thither let us see what becomes of unfortunate leonida  as soon as don fernand benavidez had brought her out of the park he sat her on horseback before him and held her with such force that all the efforts she made to disengage herself were in vain she cried out and implored heaven and earth for succor she called the count of la vagne to her assistance but her cries and tears had no power he led her through uncommon ways over mountains and rocks where the echoes answering her complaints rather augmented her sorrow than lessened it  whoever you be said she to benavidez you are the most unjust of mortals to use this violence with me i never gave any one cause to treat me after so cruel a manner why will you take pleasure in disturbing the peace of my life by what authority do you act thus if my father has sent you i am disposed to obey his orders without being under the necessity of traveling all night with a troop of men as if i were a criminal oh let us stop continued she seeing he made no answer i conjure you carry me back to the place where you found me you need not apprehend my escape since i am alone there with a young lady whose brother is now prisoner at villa real and were he at home he has too great a respect for my family to oppose my fathers commands here her tears interrupted her complaint and forced her to be some time silent she began to be persuaded these men were come to take her away by the order of don john who she thought had been informed of the place of her retreat and of the count of la vagnes being there she tenderly regretted the absence of her lover if he knew said she to herself where they are carrying me i should have less reason to be uneasy for certainly he would soon find means to see me his birth and merit are sufficient recommendations to entitle him to my fathers favor who being once convinced of the aversion the prince of carency and i have to each other would undoubtedly consent to break off the match and yield me to the count thus she traveled all night entertaining herself with reflections of this quality  as soon as aurora displayed her gilded beams leonida endeavored to know the person who was carrying her off but heavens could any surprise be equal to here is when she saw it was benavidez at first she had not power to speak her tears prevented her utterance whilst a thousand different ideas presented themselves to her mind she at last cried aloud no longer doubting of her misfortune are you become my enemy don fernand you who offered me your house to conceal me and in whom i had that confidence do you thus break through the laws of hospitality and force me away in this manner  dont accuse me unheard divine leonida said he interrupting her my passion for you would never have shined had you been destined to the prince of carency by your own inclination as you are by the will of your parents i saw with delight the birth of your aversion for him which flattered me that after procuring you a retreat from the persecutions of your father whose authority and resentment are not to be opposed your justice would oblige you to turn your eyes on me and incline you to think i was not so ardently devoted to your service without loving you to distraction but whilst i was an unfortunate prisoner deprived of all that could give me pleasure you were entertaining the count of la vagne whose life you had saved i was informed of his passion for you and of the favorable reception you gave him what were all my pains and cares designed for this stranger and did i expose myself for no other reason but to procure him an opportunity of declaring his love to you was there ever a destiny more unaccountable i conjure you madam to cease tormenting your self you have no just cause to grieve it is not your fathers house you regret neither is it the prince of carency since your disdain for him is so great that you chose rather to quit the court than see him but you sigh for the count of la vagne his absence occasions all these tears what madam ought you not to prefer me to him do me justice suspend your resentment and you will approve my conduct ah cried leonida your offense is too great you have behaved yourself like a traitor and you must expect nothing but my hatred and that of my family if it be true you love me as you say you do use other means to gain my favor restore me my liberty and let me have the disposing of my destiny you may afterward dispute your title to me with the count and deserve by your services that precedence which you apprehend i give him you have one advantage he has not which is my being already under some obligations to you and so far i acknowledge my gratitude therefore i would not have you forfeit the esteem due to so peculiar a merit but dont think you shall ever prevail with me by force or by a disrespectful behavior your present conduct is a sufficient motive to render you odious to me yet upon condition you will obey me i am willing to forget your offense and pardon the rashness of a passion which perhaps you were not master of  i penetrate into your thoughts too well madam replied benavidez to let my self be deceived by a discourse you would not have made me had you been at liberty to declare your sentiments the count has an indisputable advantage over me he has had the good fortune to acquire your favor but as for my part you ever looked on me with all the indifferency imaginable your words bear more policy than good nature and your heart speaks for my rival besides do you think me credulous enough to believe your anger can be so easily appeased no i ought not to run the hazard of losing a treasure i have already in my possession therefore madam for my passions sake pardon my not complying with your request resolve to be mine since by that means you can render me the happiest of mankind i will go with you to any part of the world you shall be mistress of your destiny and mine then i will obey you for ever  ah barbarian cried leonida in a mournful accent i would sooner sacrifice a thousand lives if i had em than consent to be yours it is not without reason you suspected my words i had no other design in speaking to you as i did but that of retrieving my liberty and flying you as the cruelest of my enemies i see nothing can deceive a man who is too great a master of dissimulation not to dive into the thoughts of others you may easily judge that as my aversion for you is infinite so is my resentment of the injury you dome but you shall not glory long in your treachery i had rather cast my self into the arms of death though never so dreadful than live with you yes i can find the way to die and in dying meet with too great a felicity in my despairing condition  having spoke these words with much anger and emotion she would not say any more nor even look at him though he used his utmost endeavors to appease her this was the deplorable state she was in when benavidez embarked with her at portoreal in order to sail for morocco which passage was then very dangerous because the spaniards having lately defeated the king of tuniss fleet the barbarians were so enraged that they swore they would be revenged and give no quarter to any spanish vessel  leonida was hardly embarked when a handsome young lady came o her in a respectful manner her features were very regular and her countenance so sweet and agreeable that leonida though her grief was inexpressible fixed her eyes on her with a secret pleasure her name was inea she was daughter to the captain of the ship and showed an extraordinary desire to be serviceable to our distressed fair in her affliction i am extremely obliged to you said leonida to her for the concern you express but i beg you will give yourself no farther trouble the condition i am in neither lets me seek nor wish for relief oh leave me to my despair since nothing but death can ease me i have no design to displease you madam replied inea but i think my self under an obligation to serve you in all that lies in my power i can easily perceive your trouble is exceeding and that your thoughts are entirely employed on some great disaster but i am persuaded we ought never to despair since the cruelest fate may receive a favorable change charming inea interrupted leonida having heard her name i am almost without hopes we are bound for africa and the traitor who has forced me away is carrying me into a kingdom where he has great power alas who is it that will come to my help neither my relations nor friends know any thing of my misfortune no body is acquainted with it but a woman who is even as perfidious as himself these words made her call to mind casilda and so fatal a remembrance occasioned her to shed a rent of tears o traytress said she as if she were present what have i done to you to deserve this from your hands it is you that helped your brother to carry me off and by your wicked contrivance i am now come to this disgrace you have ill rewarded the affection i had for you i hardly suffered the count of la vagne to make professions of love to me because i knew you had a passion for him and could i have disposed of his and my destiny i would not have given you the least uneasiness you had no such generous sentiments for me it was by your means your brother knew the affection i had for this stranger and at a time that you pretended you were not deceiving me by your false caresses you drew from me all my secrets which you have ungratefully abused and only sought my ruin by such a discovery she pronounced these words with a passion justly inspired and thought by unloading her mind she might give some ease to her overburthend heart  benavidez flattering himself with a successful voyage whenever he spoke to leonida entertained her with his passion and said he hoped that as she saw a necessity of submitting to her fate she would consent to make him happy this discourse she heard with contempt and had so little regard for his sighs tears and menaces that she never turned her eyes on him but was thinking how she could escape the hands of her ravisher which she would have courageously done by choosing death had not the sentiments of religion opposed so cruel a resolution as benavidez knew his presence was odious to her he seldom appeared but was in hopes time would make an alteration in his favor and proposed as soon as they were arrived at morocco to find means to make her obey him if he was not fortunate enough to render himself agreeable to her  the wind being fair they soon reached the streights of gibraltar and entered the mediterrean where having sailed some time the seamen shouted for joy in seeing the coast of africa and did not doubt but they should make the land in a few hours leonida at this news lamented her unhappy state she went upon deck and casting her melancholy eyes over the vast ocean i am looking into the skies said she to inea to see whether i can discover any dark cloud or sign of an approaching storm i wish you were not with me in this ship then should i be the more willing to perish here but alas how calm is the sea and how serene the air we shall soon reach africa and i have nothing left my wearied soul but cruel despair her head was leaning on one of her hands and her neck bathed with tears that ran from her beauteous eyes in this posture inea was endeavoring to give her some consolation when suddenly she cried o heavens here are too great ships coming up to us under full sail how unfortunate should we be if they were enemies these ships belonged to the queen of fez and had discovered by the flag of benavidezs ship that they were spaniards which was a sufficient motive to attack them war being declared at that time between the two nations they came up to them and though there was a great inequality of force yet the captain would not surrender without fighting benavidez seconded him in his defense with all the courage imaginable it distracted him to think he was going to lose a person he loved more than life and lose her in such a manner since it would either be by his death or her captivity  these dismal thoughts made him believe he should have power enough to defend his mistress you shall see this day madam said he whether i deserve to be preferred to the count of la vagne i will sacrifice the last drop of my blood to deliver you from the danger you are threatened with but if i dye adorable leonida remember i dye for you and that had not my passion been the cause i would not have committed those crimes for which i have incurred your aversion  i dont think said she with an air as full of pride as coldness that i am any ways obliged to thank you for what you are going to act in my defense i cannot fall into hands more barbarous nor more odious to me than yours benavidez had no time to make her an answer he can above deck and did such actions as one would have though incredible had he burned with a milder passion but this brave spaniard was not long able to sustain the overpowering force of the moors those that could have seconded his courage were already wounded and as he was also pierced with wounds he was forced at last to yield and let his feeble body take place among the enemies he had just sacrificed to his rage  the young prince abelhamar who had just fought him admiring his courage did not see his approaching end without some concern he commanded that nothing should be neglected to relieve him and was going to speak to him when he was informed that several ladies were found in the cabin leonida appeared among them like a queen in the midst of her subjects he was surpised at her superior beauty and though fear was still painted in her face and her eyes had less power than usual yet her charms had so great an influence that the prince from a conqueror became almost a captive benavidez knew her though dying and made an effort to rise and speak to her you are revenged madam said he of an unfortunate man who never could have been capable of displeasing you had not his passion for you been proportionable to his offense dont envy me the consolation of believing my memory will not be odious to you and that the loss of my life may atone for my crime  leonida moved at so melancholy a sight and her own condition together could not restrain her tears i pardon you don fernand said she the injury you have done me and was never cruel enough to wish your death she said no more seeing his eyes were closing and that paleness had overspread his face this new scene of misfortunes afflicted her extremely and gave her room to fear the danger which now threatened her was far greater than that she had escaped she saw herself a slave to the cruelest enemies of the spaniards and was well informed don john her father had once been a terror to those barbarians which made her believe were she known her captivity would be the more rigorous  whilst she was filled with these reflections young abelhamar looked on her rather as a divinity than a human creature and though the admiral commanded in chief yet as prince of the blood he had all the deference paid him that was due to his quality he approached leonida whom he addressed in a most obliging manner saying she should have no reason to deplore her fate and promised to use all his interest with the queen of fez to restore her to her lost liberty he spoke spanish very well and leonida returned him thanks for the compassion he showed to her misfortune  since the condition i am in my lord said she inspires you with pity i beg you will let me know my fate you shall be obeyed madam replied abelhamar as soon as you go on board the admiral for the miserable objects that present themselves to you here only increase your melancholy he then gave her his hand and conducted her on board the other ship  all the women who were taken with leonida followed her in hopes that by her means they might be delivered from the captivity which threatened them as soon as she was in the cabin abelhamar spoke to her in these terms you seem uneasy madam to know your destiny were it in my power i would soon resign to you the disposal of it and esteem myself happy in serving you i am sorry my ill fortune obliges me to comply with the admiral who i must inform you has given orders for us to return to sallee the capital of the kingdom of fez where you will be presented to the sultaness celima this princess is my first cousin her father had her brought up in a castle by the seaside and one day as she was walking on the shore attended only by her women some corsairs who were at a distance perceiving her landed suddenly and finding she was very handsome took her and carried her to bajazet who rewarded em considerably for their present  this emperor of the turks in spite of his natural haughtiness became distractedly in love with this princess whose charms were so transcendent that she received the greatest marks of distinction from the proudest prince in the world celima made her father acquainted with her fate who taking advantage of the influence she had over the emperor prevailed with him to lend him men and money in order to dethrone my father who then possessed the crown by his birthright and the laws of the land accordingly he not only succeeded in the enterprise but even deprived him of his life and as my youth could give him no apprehension he was contented with keeping me confined in his palace  bajazet carried his arms into missia and took celima with him who was witness of the advantages he gained over the french and hungarians but this princes fortune met with a strange turn his army was defeated by tamerlane the great and himself taken prisoner in the battle celima notwithstanding his overthrow found means to make her escape and returned to sallee where her father received her with joy proportionable to her merit some time after he and his son dying the crown fell to this princess who took effectual measures to secure it it was thought at first she had a design to marry me which would have partly made amends for the wrongs i had suffered from her family but she has solemnly declared against marriage though young and handsome and the melancholy life she leads makes people suspect she is affected with some deep concern which cannot be attributed to the captivity of bajazet since she has often protested she would rather be the last of his slaves than the first of his favorites she seldom sees any company but has a great many beautiful slaves which are brought to her from all parts of the world and as she is extremely unwilling to restore them to their liberty when she likes them i very much fear you will acquire so great a share in her favor that she will not part with you i would prevent this misfortune were she less absolute but she is so jealous of my actions that should i release you it would be sufficient to make her think me criminal  alas my lord interrupted leonida i am now too well satisfied i shall pass the rest of my days in an unhappy captivity yet i own the danger i have escaped from the power of him that forced me away appeared to me much more terrible abelhamar desired she would acquaint him with her adventure which she related with all the grace imaginable but concealed benavidezs name and her own telling him here is was felicia of leon and so disguised her whole story after the same manner  leonida having entertained him some hours he ordered a repast to be served then retired leaving her with inea who was lamenting the misfortune she had received by the death of the captain of their ship who had been killed in the fight oh father said she why have i lost you or why did i not die with you what are become of all my hopes they are vanished and the remainder of my life will be a continued scene of misery i am now a slave and dare not flatter my self with any relief from my relations who will never ransom me you were every thing to me and your paternal love was my only joy though leonidas troubles were great enough and she not in a condition to comfort any one her natural generosity and tenderness would not permit her to forget inea on so sad an occasion she approached her and embracing her said my dear inea do not indulge your self in these complaints you see i am as unhappy as you are yet bear my misfortunes with more resolution ah madam replied inea you have less reason to complain than i or more courage to support you as to what regards me every thing has contributed to load me with torments my father pierced with wounds is represented to my afflicted mind and by his loss all my agreeable hopes are for ever destroyed what have i not done ye mighty powers cried she to attempt this voyage i had at last compassed it and was flattering my self with success but you see madam how little we must depend on fortune which binds me with chains at a time that i expected to enjoy a perfect felicity in ending these words which were often interrupted with sighs she turned her eyes on leonida and seeing her face was bathed in tears did not doubt but her discourse had affected her which gave some ease to inea alas how generous you are madam said she to share my troubles i am so sensible of your goodness that i wish nothing more than an opportunity of giving you an evincement of my gratitude you have this day gained a heart madam which shall for ever be at your devotion the compassion i have for you inea said leonida you well deserve and i protest to you i shall much less deplore my misfortune if by its means i acquire your friendship we are both of us captives and as yet unacquainted with our future destiny but whatever happens i hope we shall be together that we may tell our pain to each other which is the only thing can give relief to the unfortunate  these melancholy reflections led her into those of a deeper nature to which she entirely abandoned her self and continued weeping bitterly most part of the night then complaining she cried why dont you come my dear count of la vagne and deliver me from the hands of our common enemies oh how agreeable should i think such a change of fortune after so considerable a service my father could not deny giving me to you and the prince of carency would be overjoyed at having escaped a marriage to which he had so great an aversion but alas continued she how far am i from this happy state my infelicity is real and i cannot acquaint you with it i know not in what manner the queen of fez may treat me it is probable you will never hear of me and death only will terminate my misery she would have passed the rest of the night in these sad repinings if inea who was much troubled for her had not diverted her thoughts pardon me madam said she for interrupting you and let me entreat you to take a little repose they say we are to land to morrow at sallee would you appear before the queen under so deep a concern our dependence is on your perfections and we believe her majesty will be so pleased with you that by her favor you may soon contribute to our liberty but madam were it only for your own sake preserve those charms which i fancy have already touched prince abelhamar fine ladies may expect every thing from their beauty  oh inea what do you tell me replied leonida fetching a deep sigh how different are your sentiments from mine the unhappy experience i have made of a violent passion gives me too just a cause to fear the like disaster though if you consider well the figure we shall make in the court where we are going as being christians we must rather expect to be slighted by those barbarians and exposed to their cruelty but there is nothing i would not prefer to the misfortune of being beloved by abelhamar you imagined my dear inea that such a conquest would flatter my vanity yet for my own satisfaction i will sooner believe you misinterpreted his meaning and thought what he acted out of generosity proceeded from some other motive however since you desire it i will endeavor to take a little rest in finishing these words she embraced inea and laid her self on the bed  love had already made a great progress in the heart of abelhamar who was so taken with the beauty of leonida whom we must again call felicia that the thoughts of losing her when once presented to the queen gave him much uneasiness is it possible said he to mula who was his favorite that i can deliver up this divine creature to the power of my mortal enemy why has fate ordered i should be the author of her captivity how shall i after such a conduct evince her of my sentiments will she not have room to load me with reproaches which must be succeeded by her aversion he was now ruminating on a thousand different projects first he had no mind she should land at sallee then he thought how he might carry her off at his arrival there and after all would thus examine himself from whence proceed these motions sure i am not in love have i had time to conceive a passion for this fair stranger no no said he it is only the effect of surprise and admiration which will have no farther consequence and i shall forget her in ceasing to see her yet if she should become dear to me continued he i can ask her of the queen who i believe will not refuse me one slave out of so great a number celima in making me a present of this young lady whom i might have kept without her consent will think she highly obliges me and i dare assure my self she will be ready to give me such a proof of her goodness at a time that i have pretensions to greater favors  this opinion composed a little the agitation his mind was in but its calm was not long ah mula said he it is not celima alone can oppose my good fortune felicia is the person who must decide my destiny can i flatter my self that she is not already engaged if she has an inclination for any one in spain i must not expect she will be favorable to me i shall appear in her eyes as a tyrant that forces her from the arms of the man she loves mula used all arguments to persuade him into a better conceit of his personal merit but as in affairs of love the least uncertainty is a cruel torment he passed that night betwixt hope and fear without taking any resolution  at the first appearance of morning he grew impatient to see felicia and hearing she was up went to her apartment she received him with much civility but seemed extremely dejected which grieved abelhamar who used many tender words to express his concern after a short conversation she begged leave to go upon deck he readily consented to her request being desirous to embrace any opportunity of obliging her and immediately ordered it to be spread with a rich carpet and cushions of cloth of gold then conducted her to the place that was prepared and sat down by her under a magnificent canopy they were some time without speaking to one another for felicia having turned her looks toward the coast of spain could not forbear melting into a flood of tears which threw abelhamar into so deep a melancholy that he had no power to interrupt her at last she recovered a little from that excess of grief and broke silence the respect that is due to you my lord said she ought to make me conceal my affliction in your presence but your generous compassion hinders me from laying so great a violence on my spirits i must let my sorrow take its course since it is the only relief i can expect in my deplorable condition here forced away from my friends my country and a considerable fortune i am suddenly become slave to a queen who perhaps will not grant me my liberty at any rate alas my lord is there no means left to deliver me from this misfortune the prince no longer master of his passion flung himself on his knees and taking her hand divine stranger said he judge better of your transcendent charms you are not yet arrived at sallee and it is in your choice not to go there at all i adore you amiable felicia for it is impossible you should not inspire something more than love if such sentiments merit your favor here i lay my fortune at your feet do not disdain the vows of a prince who in right ought now to be king of fez oh that i had a crown in my possession i would place it on your head if you thought me worthy of wearing it with you yet i have some friends left and a sanctuary to go to come madam then let us away so that i possess you all my ambition will be satisfied ah my lord said felicia interrupting him do not follow the dictates of an infant passion which may cause you to blush hereafter consider you are speaking to a christian captive who has gratitude and generosity enough not to accept offers which might occasion your ruin i am indebted to you it is true yet think what i owe to my self it would be impossible for me to consent to go with you without being the author of your disgrace and my eternal shame the difference of our laws and religion the inequality of our fortunes and our little knowledge of each other all these oppose such a design and should i leave my self to your care you your self would tax me with the greatest imprudence continue madam replied abelhamar with impatience and rather say you love some person in spain say cruel creature you have an aversion to me which is the only motive of your consideration ah felicia how easily might we overcome all these difficulties were you inspired like me with a tender passion and how little would you reflect on the consequences of an engagement which flatters us with so perfect a felicity but alas i see too well you prefer the queen of fezs chains to that liberty i now offer you here leaning his head upon his hands he silently expressed his pain with sighs that prevented his utterance felicia continued speaking to him with much sweetness and prudence but soon forgeting he was near her she relapsed into her former affliction at the thoughts of her unhappy destiny they were both in this situation when the admiral who at a distance had observed them some time approached the prince and asked him whether he was disposed to eat who having recovered from the little disorder he was in made answer it should be as felicia pleased this beauteous lady blushing said to him you do not reflect my lord that i am a captive here who alas has no command ah madam replied he speaking to her in a low voice you know too well the unlimited power you have wherever i am and no body feels the effect of it more than i if your empire is so great in misfortunes what would it be at another time in ending these words they were interrupted by the joyful shouts of the seamen who had just discovered the coasts of the kingdom of fez which news struck felicia with consternation for whilst she was at sea she had some hopes that either a tempest would arise and cast them upon the coast of spain or that the spanish fleet which was then abroad would retake em but she was too well assured that being once landed at sallee she could not any more expect to be relieved  abelhamar on his side thought death less terrible than parting with this young lady whom he would soon be obliged to yield up to the sultaness and as he had not much time to remain with her he employed those hours in representing his passion to her in the softest language love and respect could inspire but she received his addresses with so much coldness that he began to despair of meeting with an obliging return  they were now arrived at sallee and as abelhamar could not resolve to go himself and present felicia to the queen of fez he told the admiral he was indisposed therefore desired he would excuse him to her majesty for not waiting on her he approached felicia at the same time and said it is you madam that hinders me from making my court to day for i cannot attend you to a place where you go with so much reluctance but be assured that in spite of your indifferency i shall not omit any thing to deliver you from your confinement you are too generous my lord replied she in endeavoring to contribute to my satisfaction which will be purchased very dear if it should hereafter give you the least chagrin  abelhamar retired exceeding melancholy and soon after felicia inea and the rest of the slaves were set on shore by the admirals command in order to be sent to the queen alas my dear inea said felicia looking at her with a dejected air we see our selves going into captivity and till now the civil treatment of abelhamar prevented us from feeling the full weight of our misfortunes this prince now leaves us and the fine palace we see is to be our prison at these words she could not restrain the course of her tears and inea kept her company in this dismal scene till they alighted at the first court of the castle from whence they were immediately carried to the queen  they found her seated on a carpet of gold beautified with diversity of colors and round her were several embroidered cushions enriched with pearl she was dressed in a turkish habit of silver brocade flowered with crimson and buttoned with diamonds and emeralds her girdle which was set with precious stones girded a little poigniard to her side part of her hair was tucked under a muzlin veil stripped with gold and the rest hung in tresses down her neck her eyes which were large and black though languishing shined with irresistible luster but in her mein was painted so much pride and haughtiness that it robbed her of part of her charms and rendered her awful to all that approached her  leonida attended by the women who were taken with her came and flung her self at the queens feet who thought her a surprising beauty she chose her and inea to be of her chamber and gave the rest to the admiral to dispose of as he pleased the queen knew leonida was a spaniard by her dress therefore speaking to her in that language asked her name and to what part of the world she was going when they took her to which she answered her name was felicia that a gentleman had run away with her who told her he intended to carry her to morocco but that he had been killed in the engagement and she thought her self too happy in her misfortunes to fall into the hands of so great a queen she finished these words with so weak an accent that celima easily perceived she was under a great affliction she extremely pitied the youth of this lady whose noble air persuaded her she was of eminent birth be under no concern felicia said she to her i shall extend my goodness to you there are greater troubles than those you are to undergo in this palace you must not judge of felicity by appearances and i know not after enquiring into your condition and that of some sovereigns i have heard of but yours is more happy for i believe added she your heart has preferred its liberty being uncommon for one at your age to receive an impression of love leonida made no reply but looking on the ground changed color and fetched a deep sigh celima who only spoke to her in this manner to discover the motions of her heart observing her disorder perceived she was touched with a secret passion but did not take any farther notice of it  a little after the governess of the slaves ordered felicia and inea to follow her to that part of the palace assigned for their use where she made em change their clothes and as they were to wait on the queen she gave them very rich stuffs for their dress they generally went bareheaded with their hair falling negligently on their shoulders and as a mark of servitude wore golden bracelets and chains on their arms when they attended the queen to any place they had large white veils of an extraordinary fine stuff which covered their head and part of their face  felicia appeared as beautiful in this new apparel as in that she had just put off and her actions were accompanied with so much grace that nothing seemed strange to her they carried her into a room where they were teaching the slaves to sing and play upon instruments which surpised her extremely not expecting to see so great a number of handsome creatures as if celima had the privilege of choosing them out of all the courts in the universe these captives showed no less admiration in seeing felicia they all came up to salute her and amongst them she observed a young lady whose air was so majestic and charming that she took a particular delight in looking at her but what increased her attention was the fancy she had to have seen her somewhere before and that she was not unknown to her they expressed an extraordinary civility to each other and as there is generally a greater sympathy between unfortunate persons than others these two fair captives mutually contracted a particular friendship  from thence felicia in her new dress was carried to the queen but made no stay in her apartment soon after abelhamar forgetting he had desired the admiral to make his excuses to celima for not paying his court to her that night ran impatiently to the palace and seemed extremely uneasy when he perceived felicia was not with her he did not presume to mention any thing concerning her but the queen saluted him in these terms you have brought me a lovely spaniard whom you shall see presently in her slaves dress i am persuaded you will not think her less beautiful than before and i must tell you i have learnt since your departure that she who was taken in the island of sardinia is the daughter of brancaleon doria her name is olympia and  here she is continued the queen seeing her enter the apartment she will inform you of something particularly surprising celima commanded her to entertain the prince with her story which she obeyed and felicia coming in at the same time approached olympia who began the ensuing relation  a young count extremely handsome and of a merit so shining that he was universally admired fell in love with me i made him no disobliging return thinking my father would be very well satisfied to give me to a person of his quality and one who had highly distinguished himself in the world his consent my lord was the only thing wanting to make us happy but alas we little foresaw the difficulties that opposed our desires  my father displeased with this noblemans family looked on him and all his relations as enemies however for a long time his politic reasons obliged him to conceal his true sentiments which he discovered when my marriage was proposed to him it was then we knew with mortal displeasure that time only could relieve us we both labored under all the vexation that such a disappointment was capable of giving us and as our affection daily increased we could not deny our selves the satisfaction of private interviews my father was acquainted with our proceedings which being opposite to his inclinations made him so angry that he told me in the greatest passion he would revenge my disobedience to him on the object i loved these menaces caused me to tremble for this young lord whom i conjured to absent for some time and soon after a glorious occasion invited him to go abroad bagazet had conquered a great part of the levant and the king of hungary endeavoring to beat him our of it applied himself for succor to most of the princes of europe who readily sent him all possible assistance though i considered this to be a long and tedious journey and even apprehended all the dangers the count might be exposed to yet through the necessity of his absence i seconded the desire he had of going to missia  we exchanged vows of eternal constancy to each other and the grief we felt at parting i thought would have cost us our lives the event of the campaign was very unhappy the christian troops were defeated and the count taken prisoner which news i heard with a concern not to be described i sent him money to pay his ransom and was expecting his return with the last impatience when i received an account of his death it is hard my lord to imagine how cruelly such a loss affected me i could no longer restrain my sorrow i persecuted my father with reproaches and would not permit either my relations or friends to see me i thought life it self insupportable and begged of heaven to shorten its date that i might be eased of the torment i then endured  this was my melancholy condition when slumbering one night my mind filled with my misfortunes i suddenly awaked and saw a person near me whom at first i took for the shade of my deceased lover such an apparition would have terribly frightened me had my passion been less violent i found afterward by his discourse that far from being with a phantom i had cause to believe he was the same lovely man so dear to me at this sight i abandoned my self to all the joy that could attend such a surprise and showed to this cavalier all possible marks of affection he was cruel enough not to undeceive me and i was not sensible of my error till the day following when by chance my father brought him into a grotto where i had retired to indulge my self with the pleasing thoughts of the counts being restored to life  i was then informed this gentleman whom i had taken for him had never seen me before which sensibly touched me i was so ashamed of this mistake that my affliction had like to have put a period to my days my father was extremely moved at my condition and as i knew his sentiments i did not doubt but he would oblige me in any thing i desired therefore embracing the occasion i conjured him in most pressing terms to give out that i was dead and permit me to go to my mother who was then in sardignia which he readily assented to i had not far from cagliary an aunt who was abbess of a famous monastry that lay in a wilderness near the seaside where i intended to end my deplorable life concealed from the sight of any object that might renew my sufferings  my father notwithstanding the chagrin this separation gave him disposed every thing for my departure and the news of my death was spread abroad without any ones thinking it supposed i immediately left genoa and my voyage had nothing remarkable in it for i soon arrived in sardignia where my mother received me and without deliberation consented to what i so much wished she carried me to her sister who was the depository of my secrets and having changed my name i led a life so retired that without being of the number of the dead i could not be reckoned amongst the living but i used often to be alarmed with letters from my father pressing me to quit my solitude in order to return home which made me apprehend he would use his authority to compel me to it therefore i went and flung my self at my aunts feet and conjured her to give me the nuns veil that having once made vows my relations might lose the hopes of my returning again into the world  she at first opposed my request believing she ought not to make such a step without the advice of my friends but at last my prayers and tears prevailed on her she desired the bishop of cagliary to perform the ceremony and as it is the custom in that place for the person who takes the habit of a novice to go with a number of young ladies to hear the prelate in a little chapel by the seaside i went out dressed in a long gown brocaded with silver my hair hanging loose on my shoulders and my head crowned with flowers my companions were also dressed in white and in this manner we formed a procession along the shore  it is now said i my dear count that i am going to sacrifice to you the rest of an unhappy life which was destined to be yours were you sensible in the region where you are of what i do for you in this world you would rejoice to have inspired me with such sentiments i was lost in these thoughts when i heard a great noise the cries of my companions obliged me to look behind me where i saw several men following us with their swords drawn i endeavored to make my escape but two of them being come up to me carried me off with some of the young ladies and having forced us into a boat rowed immediately up to their ship where we were under sail before any one could come to our assistance  one may easily imagine that such a surprise terrified us extremely but it was nothing to the inexpressible grief which seized us when we found our selves in the hands of a corsair of algier neither our prayers nor tears had power to soften him all his thoughts were fixed on making the most of our captivity he soon lost sight of sardignia and after having taken other prizes steered his course toward sallee being sure to sell some of us to the queen who was pleased to choose me as you know my lord out of a motive of pity for i was so very melancholy that none could see me without compassion  it never came into my head to acquaint my father with my captivity nor did i wish the recovery of my liberty which i was going to offer as a sacrifice when the corsair took me it was equal to me to be shut up in the palace of sallee or in a monastry since i had no other desire than that of leaving the world and passing the remainder of an unfortunate life without any engagement  in this state were my affairs and i daily receiving new favors from the queen when a merchant of genoa who deals in jewels came to this court her majesty being desirous to see what valuable things he had to dispose of sent for him and i was near her when he entered the apartment he no sooner cast his eyes on me but seemed astonished for he did not doubt of my being dead as it was reported yet in seeing me he had cause enough to believe i was brancaleon dorias daughter since he had spoken to me too often at my fathers house not to know me again and as he immediately perceived i knew him it so confirmed his opinion that he desired leave to speak with me which he obtained of the queen is it possible madam you should thus neglect writing to your friends who so infinitely love you and are lamenting your death at genoa whilst you are living and a slave at sallee who bemoans me said i with a melancholy accent do you believe that after the fatal destiny of a person who was dearer to me than life i could find any relish for the world no as my passion was great so was my sorrow and no other motive induced me to spread abroad my pretended death only to retire into some solitude and there forever regret the loss of a man i so dearly loved in finishing these words i burst out in tears and the jeweller fixing his eyes on me with admiration you deserve a better fate madam said he and i esteem my self happy to have met with this opportunity of assuring you the gentleman you actually deplore did not perish as it was related he arrived at genoa a little after the report of your death at which he was so touched that his trouble is not to be described he admitted me to see him often but his grief would seldom allow him to speak and whenever he broke silence it was with your name he afterward fell dangerously ill and as soon as he recovered went to travel but he is now returned to genoa and i can give you testimonies madam of his eternal love  we were in a place pretty distant from the queen who could not hear our conversation but i was so transported at this news that without knowing what i did or considering why i ran and flung my self at her feet at first i was not able to speak my eyes gushed out with tears and i looked at her in so moving a manner that she asked me several times what was my request the merchant being a man of sense came up and explained the meaning of my disorder and as i had time to recover my self during their discourse ah madam said i to the queen i entreat your majesty to give me my liberty i am now willing to live and wish my self at genoa since my misfortunes are at an end no creature was more wretched than i and now none is more happy i protest to you madam i daily saw the light with pain having as i thought lost the only person that could make my felicity and desired death to terminate my miseries as it had done his i cannot call to mind all i said to the queen who was pleased to hear me with a great deal of condescension and being informed who i was as a particular proof of her esteem for my family she restored me to my liberty for which i returned her majesty repeated thanks i asked the jeweller a great many questions and desired he would procure me conveniences for my passage in the next ship that should sale for genoa but after having made more serious reflections i thought it prudent not to put my self into my fathers power till i had first consulted the count and taken measures with him to succeed in our mutual desires without running any risque of meeting with new obstacles  after these considerations i wrote to him by the same merchant who is returned to genoa in order to bring him here this is my lord what has passed during your absence which the queen commanded me to relate to you  abelhamar thanked her majesty and afterward olympia for whom he had always shown a particular value you have no reason now to complain madam said he to her hymen is going to reward you for all the pains love has made you suffer you will soon see the object of your affection and unite your destinies ah how happy is such a state in ending these words he sighed and looked languishingly at felicia who turned her eyes on the ground fearing they should meet his he also endeavored to speak to her but she carefully avoided his approach this proceeding so deeply affected the prince that he retired almost in despair the queen who was troubled with a secret uneasiness went into her closet to indulge her usual melancholy and the slaves repaired to their apartment  felicia finding inea in her chamber embraced her with as much pleasure as if she had not seen her of a long time we have said she illustrious companions in our servitude that fine creature they call olympia is daughter to the famous doria i have just now heard her story which she related to prince abelhamar oh heavens my dear inea how worthy of envy is her fate she will soon see her lover whose death was so surely believed that after his loss she determined to sacrifice the remainder of her life to solitude if you ever have felt a tender passion you may imagine how agreeable such a meeting will prove to them her eyes already shine with an unknown luster and express the motions of a satisfied mind alas continued she how different is her case and mine i conceive madam interrupted inea your uneasiness does not proceed entirely from your captivity were i permitted to say more i should judge your heart was concerned in the sighs and tears which sometimes you cannot restrain relieve your self in complaining madam and if you think me worthy of being your confident i dare assure you i shall never forfeit that honor by divulging your secret i am persuaded of your sincerity my dear replied felicia and think my self happy to have met with a person in whom i can confide but if i relate my melancholy story to you i hope you will oblige me with a recital of yours and believe what i desire does less proceed from my curiosity than the particular interest i have in all that concerns you i flatter my self with what you are pleased to say lovely felicia replied inea and to show how obedient i am to any thing you command i will now give you a relation of my misfortunes  the story of inea i am born of a noble family of andalusia where my father had a good estate and married a lady who brought him no fortune he was ever thought a gallant man and being bred up to the sea from his infancy the king gave him a ship of war he has left two daughters my eldest sisters name is mathilda who is very handsome we used to see but little company according to the custom of spain but my father having received into his house a young gentleman of a distinguished family in toledo whose name is don ramire of castro a secret sympathy disposed his heart and mine to receive impressions for each other i was pleased at his gentle air his wit and soft insinuating manner which engaged me unawares and we were not long acquainted before he declared i had inspired him with the tenderest passion  he thought himself happy in wearing my chains his fortune and merit gave him such advantages that he had no room to apprehend any of my friends would oppose his felicity and i was of the same opinion for though i resisted the infant inclination i had for him it proceeded only from the fear i had of its not being sincerely returned how unfortunate should i be said i to my self were my affection placed on a man who might receive it with indifference i ought before it is too late resolve to fly and deny my eyes the pleasure they take in seeing him the just diffidence i had of my own merit obliged me to be very reserved to don ramire and behave my self in a manner quite opposite to my sentiments which inclined him to believe i had conceived an aversion for him this thought did not only afflict him but made him so timorous that he had not power to speak to me i examined all his actions with great care and when we were together he appeared extremely pensive i attributed this to the weak impression i had made on him which created in me much uneasiness and i did the greatest violence to my self in not showing my concern but though our minds were prepossessed yet our eyes meeting sometimes could not help confessing the inward motion of our hearts ah too indifferent don ramire thought i if you are really touched in what manner would your looks express it since without being so they speak the soft language of love he told me afterward he had conceived the same idea of me and discovered in my eyes something which would have flattered him had i not given him too many instances of my insensibility  my sister passed some time in studying our looks and was endeavoring to know whether we had a passion for each other having her self a secret reason to be informed of the truth all the care she took served only to persuade her there was no love between us and that she might undertake what she pleased without apprehension don ramire appeared as agreeable in her eyes as he did in mine but the difference of his proceedings with her was very remarkable it came into his head first to acquire her friendship that afterward he might make her his confident and so by degrees engage her in his interest thus one may see how blind is love in some of his projects for there was very little probability that mathilda would act in such a character she was my mothers favorite as my eldest sisster had a right to be married before me therefore don ramire being the only person who then seemed desirous to make an alliance with our family it was thought but just she should have the precedence  i was not long before i discovered her intentions and my uneasiness met with so vast an addition that it had like to have thrown me into despair what said i complaining of my fate am i already jealous i who can hardly tell what it is to love and must i feel a thousand different pains which ought to be unknown to one of my age methinks i could approve his passion were he disposed to like me yet i have avoided him with the same caution i would have done the man i hate was ever conduct like mine my sister is taking advantage of my timidity she is beloved and in spite of that i still harbor such sentiments as ought to make me blush since they will render me the unhappiest creature in the world  don ramire whose perplexity of mind was not inferior to mine could no longer be silent and as mathilda gave him all opportunities of entertaining her one evening as they were walking together in one ally of the garden and i in another unknown to them and at too great a distance to hear what they were saying i perceived he was talking to her with a great deal of emotion at last i saw him fling himself at her feet and taking her hand kissed it so ardently that i no ways doubted but he had just declared his passion to her which meeting with an obliging reception occasioned those transports in him oh heavens what a sight was this to a person in my condition i would no longer observe them but went into an arbor at the end of the ally not having strength enough to support me nor power to resist the course of my grief  there i threw my self on the ground leaning my head on a bench and covering my face with my veil i shed a shower of tears oh how cruel is my destiny said i don ramire and mathilda love each other she has heard his declaration and given him a favorable audience for which he made his retributions to her on his knees and i can never flatter my self with the hopes of being dear to him here my sighs and tears made me perfectly ashamed and i was as mad at my own sensibility as at his indifferency but had i known what was passing between him and my sister i should have had as much reason to be pleased as i thought i had for the contrary  in fine madam after a conversation that turned on different subjects don ramire urged by the violence of his pain delivered his thoughts to her in the following manner charming mathilda i must entrust you with a secret on which depends the peace of my life be pleased to hear me and let me find in you those generous dispositions that may contribute to my future happiness as she believed he was going to disclose a secret to her wherein she was chiefly concerned she thought fit to keep him under such a restriction as not to allow him too much liberty you ought sir answered she to discover your pain to a person of more wit than me i have not experience enough to give you any advice and there are certain things i do not desire to know be assured madam interrupted he i have too great a respect for you to say any thing that could give you the least displeasure moreover you have nothing to fear since you are not interested in this affair i am only going to tell you i have a passion for inea whom i adore i hope my success from your good offices and conjure you to grant me your favor in this request in finishing these words he flung himself at her feet and his thoughts were so entirely taken up with what he was saying that he took no notice of the different emotions which appeared in her looks all that rage shame and excessive love could make one feel joined at once to torment her you love my sister said she after being some time silent and you choose me for your confident without considering that as i am the eldest my fortune must be settled before hers i am so offended at the injury you do me that were i more revengeful than i am i would instantly punish your indifferency go sir continued she speak to her your self i should render you but a very ill office with that she left him and no man was ever seen in a greater confusion he walked some time in the ally reflecting on what had passed and was now convinced mathilda having discovered her weakness to him would leave no art unpracticed to disappoint his passion for me  don ramire perplexed with these thoughts came into the arbor where i told you madam i had retired and was not a little surpised to find me there as for my part i knew not what resolution to take whether to go or stay when he put himself on his knees by me and entreating me to hear him adorable inea said he the condition i am reduced to does not permit me to be any longer silent i cannot doubt of your aversion since you not only debar me of your conversation but even turn your eyes from me i have used all possible means to decline a passion which i fear will displease you but as the torment i endure is little inferior to death whatever usage i am to receive from you hereafter only think i daily die for you  i could not imagine don ramire replied i you were so capable of deceit but your conduct convinces me of the truth you try in vain to persuade me this dissimulation is worse than the offense and i know what i am to depend on go sir i am resolved never to see you nor speak to you more ending these words i ran from him in spite of his endeavors to prevent me and left him with an air so full of pride and anger that he told me since he had like to have expired on the place his despair was so great that being retired to his chamber he was taken ill with a violent fever which obliged him to keep his bed  the mean while i went into my closer where being alone i abandoned my self to a thousand cruel reflections were i only to contend with mathilda thought i there would still be hopes of obtaining some advantage over her but the case now is such that should don ramire yield his heart to me methinks i would reject the offer he is a traitor who tells me he has sentiments for me which he has not he says the same to my sister and loves neither of us at least i have cause to complain since he chooses me for the subject of his raillery oh what fatality deludes me to love this perfidious man i fear he knows the affection i have for him which is a misfortune i cannot bear these thoughts forced a flood of tears from my eyes whilst i endeavored to banish him from my heart and i was thus depressed with sorrow when my mother sent for me i went down to her apartment and appeared so dejected that my sister who examined every motion of me did not doubt but i was come from don ramires chamber and that his illness was the occasion of my melancholy though at the same time i knew nothing of the matter nor would i enquire after him thinking he did not deserve so great a favor therefore i returned to my own chamber again without hearing his name once mentioned  mathilda persisting in her love for don ramire told my mother the conversation they had together in the garden and desired she would be favorable to her in laying her commands on me to use him with so much indifference as might destroy his hopes of ever attaining to my affection this my mother promised her and all she could wish on that subject the next day i heard the condition he was in who little thought i had the least concern for his illness though i must confess it gave me much uneasiness and compassion soon took place of my anger yet i would not go to see him whatever pain i suffered in denying my self that satisfaction  ah how great is my misfortune cried i not to have pride enough to suppress a passion which so immoderately disturbs my mind and yet have so much resentment as to deny my self the only pleasure this world can give me how is it possible i can be so cruel to a person whose idea is never absent from me and whose life i would purchase with my own  by this time his fever was so violent that the physicians were of opinion nothing but his youth could save him i was in my mothers apartment when they came to acquaint her with the danger he was in saying they believed him very near leaving the world at this news i was so seized with grief that all i could do was to reach my chamber where i fell in a swoon and continued so almost an hour  i had with me a young servant called tereza who loved me entirely and as she was no stranger to my affection for don ramire she helped me to conceal the despair i was in no cried i when i was a little recovered i cannot let him die spite of his ingratitude i find the preservation of my life depends on his heavens continued i bathed in tears shorten my days and give health to don ramire for alas without him what can i expect but unconceivable pain i protest to you madam i said a thousand distracted things the recital of which would tire you for sure no sorrow was ever equal to mine i was thus tormenting my self when my mother came into my chamber and her presence so surpised me that i had like to have related to her the subject of my grief she had just been with don ramire who conjured her in a most pressing manner to let me favor him with a visit adding that after so great a satisfaction he should contentedly die she told him any thing he desired should be granted then came to prepare me for this interview telling me how i should behave my self don ramire said she is so near death that what i am going to enjoin you i believe is unnecessary yet that i may have no cause to reproach my self i command you inea to show him all the indifferency possible in case he speaks to you of his passion i shall obey your orders with pleasure madam replied i though i am persuaded if he intended an alliance in this family he never had a thought of me you make an unseasonable declaration interrupted my mother in a severe tone for i know he loves you to distraction and it was very imprudent in him to choose your sister for a confident as being your eldest she ought first to be provided for besides it is my will pray tell don ramire so and that i had rather see you dead than his wife  my mother spoke to me with so much heat that i could not dispute the truth of what she said i presently comprehended her meaning and instead of a traitor as i thought him before i now found he was a man of honor and the constantest of lovers this no ways softened my pain for though i was overjoyed to know his passion was sincere yet on the other hand i saw my self at the point of losing a person i then esteemed worthy the sentiments i had for him and my alarms continually persuaded me nothing could mitigate so real a misfortune the impatience i had to see him would not permit me to say much to my mother i left her and took tereza with me to don ramires apartment which i had hardly entered and approached his bed when he turned himself toward me and reaching out his hand said in a weak voice come madam come and receive the last breath of a man who never sighed for any one but you though your injustice accused my heart with deceit the state you see me in ought to convince you there never was a passion more perfect it is for you i die adorable inea continued he pressing my hand it is you alone who is the cause and since it was my fate not to deserve your esteem i think my self happy not to survive your aversion in finishing these words he looked at me with eyes drowned in tears and fell into a deep silence which i did not presently interrupt being either in disorder or pleased to hear him mention a passion i began to believe and was willing to approve at last i spoke to him cease to reproach me don ramire said i cease to complain and think only of recovering i am unfortunate enough already and did not want this last stroke to complete my ruin must i lay aside the modesty of my sex and in spite of shame confess i love you oh consider what a sacrifice i make you when i own those sentiments i have so long endeavored to conceal i thought you had an inclination for my sister which gave me much uneasiness all your civilities to her i used to attribute to love and what very much increased my torment was the action you did some days ago when you flung your self on your knees before her in the garden i concluded you were entertaining her with your passion which made me retire to the arbor where you found me in order to indulge my grief that was the cause of my upbraiding you but now sir you may be satisfied for i have punished my self severely and you are sufficiently revenged in finishing these words i burst out in tears and this gentleman who before could searcely speak cried aloud with transports of excessive joy ah charming inea why was my happiness so long unknown to me i was just going with my despair to end my life but since you have delivered me from the arms of death i am resolved to live and live to serve you alone here i interrupted him to acquaint him with my mothers intentions which he protested he never would comply with i represented to him the necessity there was to affect an inclination for mathilda in order to carry on our amor the more successfully he told me his honor would not suffer him to act such a part and that he thought it more prudent to speak directly to my father concerning our marriage but as i knew my mothers jealous humor i was satisfied such a conduct would highly offend her and that no scheme would succeed so well as a feigned passion for my sister which opinion i at last persuaded him to approve  i cannot deny you any thing madam said he since my life is yours dispose of my destiny as you please i am devoted to your commands in short don ramire promised me to make his addresses to my sister in such a manner as might incline her to believe he designed to marry her as soon as i left his chamber i went to my mother and told her what he said on that point which pleased her extremely and as for my sister nothing could equal the joy she expressed at so agreeable a change  we used every day to visit don ramire during his illness and whenever i was alone with mathilda i constrained my self to exaggerate the affection he had for her which i really repeated so often that sometimes i was afraid i spoke the truth thus we managed affairs till he recovered and my family looked upon him as mathildas votary about this time the governor of porto real whose daughter had been newly married gave an entertainment with a ball at night to all the nobility of that place we were invited to this assembly which was much greater than any we had ever appeared at before don ramire who was to be of the party expressed some uneasiness at my going thither fearing my charms as he told me would create him many rivals indeed though i had no extraordinary conceit of my self i could not condemn his jealousy but rather approved it and thought i had reason to return him the same compliment we said a great deal on that subject till at last i took it into my head not to go there at all and was meditating on some stratagem to favor my design when my mother sent to let me know she was ready and only waited for me i immediately went to her but first made don ramire promise me whatever happened he would not leave the ball till he saw my mother and sister home again  we all went together to the governors don ramire gave his hand to my mother who was followed by my sister and as for my part just as i stepped out of the coach i designedly fell down and pretended i had spraind my foot so that i could not appear at the ball my mother displeased at this accident which she did not know to be a counterfeit sent me home and don ramire stayed with them very much surpised at what i had done being sensible it was a sacrifice i made him he had not resolution enough to stay by mathilda during all the entertainment but took an opportunity whilst she was dancing to go and place himself in a corner of the room and there wrote to this effect on his tablets  what torment does your absence give me adorable inea here you leave me exposed to the smiles of a woman i hate how do you think it possible for me to be complaisant to your sister when you are not by as soon as you were gone my thoughts like your shadow followed you alas this moment absent from you who is more unhappy than i and how fortunate should i think my self were i paying homage to your beauteous eyes   mathilda who was naturally uneasy not seeing don ramire by her looked every where for him and at last perceived him writing on his tablets she went and took him out to dance the sarao which you know madam was invented by the moors every cavalier leads his lady with one hand and carries a torch in the other my sister as she was dancing found it easy enough to take his tablets away unknown to him the dance being ended she went aside in order to examine them you may easily judge at reading what was wrote in em how enraged she was to find her self thus betrayed and the preference given to me having so good an opinion of her own merit as to believe it would have insured her from this misfortune  nothing could be equal to the violent passion she was in yet during the ball she endeavored to conceal it and what helped her most to dissemble was that to do her justice as she is very amiable don sanche of gusman son to the governor who was a fine gentleman but extremely vain addressed himself particularly to her and she thought she could not have a better opportunity to cure her passion and be revenged of don ramire than giving a favorable reception to this cavalier therefore she immediately gave him to understand my mother would be willing he should visit us although we are not fond of company said she yet sir your distinguished birth and merit entitle you to a privilege others cannot pretend to this invitation highly pleased him inasmuch as he had already declared his passion for my sister and could not well expect a return unless he were admitted to pay his devoirs to her  mathilda prepared my mother to receive him but did not mention the adventure of the tablets she only told her that as she was not very sure of don ramires heart a rival might give him some jealousy and induce him to conclude a marriage he daily seemed to decline while she was studying means to satisfy her revenge don ramire acquainted me with the loss of his tablets which he feared were fallen into the hands of my sister though i take little notice of her behavior toward me said he i observe within these few days she treats me with an affected civility i cannot well penetrate into the cause nor should be any ways uneasy about it only i apprehend she is informed of what we had agreed should be kept secret if you will give me leave continued he to declare my passion to your father we shall soon know what to depend on  i must confess madam the only motive i had to make a mystery of it was the pleasure of being secretly beloved by a man whom i esteemed so worthy my affection therefore i desired he would stay some time longer before he discovered his sentiments  consider don ramire said i that our condition is not so unhappy as you imagine we live together in the same house and in spite of the jealous eyes which continually observe us we see one another every day and our love is mutual  such as these were our daily conversations when we perceived by don sanches assiduous courtship to my sister that his passion for her had received a new addition we thought she treated him with so much distinction as persuaded us he would soon be happy in her favor which extremely overjoyed us for we waited nothing else to perfect our felicity how blessed will be my days said don ramire to me when without opposition i shall possess those excellencies i now adore ah dear inea does your heart sympathize with mine and may i hope to find in you those endearments which none but tender lovers can truly relish if once i am so fortunate as to obtain that wish continued he no thought of any other happiness for sure there can be none shall ever dwell in this bosom my vows shall be dedicated to you alone and the height of my ambition will only be to merit your love  alas madam you may imagine these obliging assurances from a man i so entirely loved made the days pass like hours but will you believe that while we were expecting the conclusion of my sisters marriage with don sanche her jealousy increased to such a degree that it would not give her a moments peace she was more taken up with the thoughts of revenge than with the care of pleasing a person who was proposing to her so advantageous an alliance i heard that one day don sanche having desired leave to speak to his father about it she suddenly changed color and her eyes expressed a more than ordinary grief i can no longer be silent said she to him in a cause wherein you are interested since you confess a passion for me and seem willing to unite your destiny with mine let me tell you sir you must first destroy the hopes of a rival to whom i am already engaged don ramire has obtained the consent of my family and impatiently expects an answer from his to terminate every thing before i saw you i was not aversed to him but alas i cannot now think of my fate without horror i do not doubt but your love and courage united will release me from this engagement since nothing except my inclination for you could induce me to decline it here her malicious tears interrupted her discourse and by this stratagem don sanche was easily persuaded to undertake any desperate thing against don ramire he assured her he would soon make him renounce his pretensions to her if he had assurance enough to oppose him in a place where his authority was great and in an affair where his heart was so particularly concerned adding to these words all that love could inspire  this made mathilda believe don ramire would rather yield her up than engage in her quarrel or that if he answered the challenge out of a point of honor he would have a potent enemy to contend with she must have been very revengeful to enter into a sentiment so opposite to those of her sex for she imprudently exposed at once two persons who were very dear to her don sanche impatient to come to a decision with don ramire writ to him that night in terms which showed an insupportable pride he thus addressed him  the passion i have for mathilda will not admit of a rival i am informed you are mine though it little concerns me you know who i am and that you will be disappointed in contending with me therefore i advise you to be secret in this affair and generously yield a pretension you cannot dispute without rashness   don ramire was highly provoked at readind this haughty billet and though he knew it was a plot of my sisters yet he would not let me into his resolutions fearing i might oppose em but immediately returned don sanche an answer in these terms  the indifference i have for mathilda could not have engaged me to dispute her heart with any one but your self it is sufficient you admire her for me to oppose your pretensions and in return to your liberty with me i advise you never to see her more unless you intend with your life to satisfy my resentment   as don ramire believed so violent a beginning would have a suitable consequence he went the next day to a place where he thought he might meet him as he effectually did don sanche no sooner perceived him but came up and said in a low voice without the least affectation well sir are you disposed to measure your sword with mine i am disposed to punish your insolence replied don ramire and shall expect you on the strand by the seaside where no body may prevent us they separated on this and don ramire went to the appointed place  he was hardly there when he saw don sanche coming up to him with menacing looks they both immediately drew and made several passes at each other don ramire parryd those of his enemy and soon put him in some disorder till at last he gave him a mortal wound which hardly left him life enough to confess the author of his fate as for don ramire he returned home with so much serenity in his countenance that it was to be admired he did not even think of taking the least care of his safety and seemed as if some secret charm detained him alas i am persuaded that fatal charm was my self he spoke to me with a freedom i could not attribute to any thing but the greatness of his soul and i had no room to suspect the misfortune which had just happened to him when of a sudden the governor and his guards surrounded my fathers house and snatched him from my arms in spite of all i could do to oppose em  those moments i cannot call to mind without the greatest concern the governor who was perfectly distracted as well as inconsolable for the loss of his only son came himself on purpose to sacrifice don ramire to his resentment i do not at all doubt but as he was seconded by a strong guard he would have killed my lover before my face had not i prevented him by standing between em and to save him exposed my self to all the danger for though i am naturally so timorous that even the sight of a drawn sword strikes me with terror yet i assure you madam on that occasion i behaved my self with so much resolution that i am convinced to be brave it is sufficient to be in love  don ramire who saw with the utmost despair the danger which threatened me was like a lion defending himself against a company of eager huntsmen he wounded some and avoided the fury of others but alas his courage and the little assistance i could afford him did not hinder them from seizing and carrying him immediately to prison  i thought at that time my soul would have departed from its habitation my blood turned so cold in my veins i would have followed don ramire and shared his misfortunes had not my mother and sister prevented me mathilda more like a fury than a reasonable creature loaded me with imprecations and reproaches the death of don ramire said she shall revenge me as well as the person whose fate i deplore the traitor shall be a sacrifice to the governors just resentment and my heart can receive no real pleasure till the day comes that he is to lose his life the violence of my grief would not permit me to make any answer my eyes said enough and i have well experienced that excessive affliction makes every thing but its cause indifferent to us  who can represent the torture i lay in all that night as soon as it was day i sent to some of don ramires friends desiring they would acquaint me with what they knew concerning his fate i was then informed he had been examined and the partial judgment of the court had already condemned him the governor being resolved not to show him the least favor but as there was a form to be observed in the trial they had permitted an acquaintance of his whose name was don tiello to plead in defense of his life  far from sinking under this misfortune i received new strength from its extremity it is no time now to shed tears cried i the safety of my lover is what i must think on teresa continued i you were ever faithful to me and are the only person in whom i can confide go run and buy me a suit of mens clothes for i am resolved to see don ramire i can pretend i am son to don tiello who sends me to inform him of what is passing in his affair and by that means i shall be admitted to enter the prison where we may take measures together for his escape ah madam take care what you do replied she if you are known what will become of you i am not in a condition said i that will permit me to apprehend any thing we must endeavor to snatch don ramire from the governors revenge and when he is safe i shall have time enough to think on what relates to me in ending these words i obliged her to get me the clothes which i immediately put on and fancied in that dress i might very well pass for a young cavalier  night being come i ordered teresa to take the key of my chamber and give out i was ill in bed then went out in this disguise protected by none but my guardian angels if by misfortune said i don tiello who has generously offered to defend don ramire should be with him or perhaps come in whilst i am there what must i do and how shall i extricate my self from such a difficulty love said i oh love for whom i suffer unconceivable torments be favorable to me this time you see my deep concern for the danger which threatens my lover i have little hopes and every thing to fear unless his safety becomes your care  when i was arrived at this fatal prison i hardly had strength to support me my spirits were feeble and i found my self in much disorder the first person i spoke to was the jaylors daughter i told her i was don tiellos son friend to don ramire and was come to inform him of the state of his affairs at these words she pressed my hand like a person in some concern and said ah sir the unhappy gentleman is lost if you do not take speedy measures to save him i know more of that matter than you continued she and perhaps interest my self as much the place we were in was so dark that i could not see her face though i had a great curiosity to know the person who expressed her self so feelingly but i said in a trembling voice pray tell me what you have heard concerning him all the judges replied she are devoted to the governor and don ramire will be condemned without appeal i have endeavored in vain to find an opportunity of speaking to to him but never could see him since he was brought here covered with blood and dust and in that dismal condition he appeared to me the handsomest man i had ever seen alas how fatal was that sight to me i was so touched with his misfortune that all my thoughts ever since have been employed on his safety and i am happy enough to have found an expedient which cannot fail  here she was silent but after a little pause assumed her discourse and since you are his friend continued she i ought not to conceal from you the disposition i have for him i must confess i love him and my affection is raised to such a degree that i am resolved to deliver him from hence if in giving him his life he will dedicate the remainder of it to me and render my fate inseparable from his tell him how near the danger is since he will not have common mercy shown him and that if he can purchase his life on these terms i am ready to serve him i know he is a man of quality and the vast disproportion there is between us but the condition i hope will make me acceptable to him i shall for his sake expose my family to the governors resentment who will believe my father contrived his escape and perhaps punish him accordingly how often have i said to my self laurea unfortunate laurea cease attempting a happiness that meets with such difficulties what has my passion for a stranger power enough to make me forsake my parents alas sir i have disputed with my self till i am no longer mistress of my reason i could sacrifice every thing for him he is dearer to me than life and the danger he is in affects me beyond imagination assure him from me that my heart never received an impression before i am young and though not beautiful may pass for agreeable oh how happy should i think my self if he did but like me and could his passion proceed more from inclination than gratitude i should die transported yet said she to me as you are particularly acquainted with him pray tell me whether he is not already engaged for in fine as i do every thing for him i also expect he will make me an equal return therefore go to him i shall wait your answer here in order to undertake something in his favor  though my heart was so contracted with grief that i could hardly answer her after she had ceased speaking i said to her madam your design in preserving a gentleman so deserving of life is truly generous i am persuaded he will not be ungrateful and shall let you know his sentiments when i return she left me immediately to tell her father i was don tiellos son who desired to see don ramire he made no difficulty but conducted me to the place where this unhappy gentleman was shut up alas madam where shall i find words to express the anguish and trouble i felt at that instant what am i going to do and what advice shall i give him said i must i deliver him up to my rival no i cannot bear the thought of it he shall never know the passion she has for him then reproaching my self for coming to such a resolution what continued i would i thus see him perish and deliver him up to the fury of his enemies oh sure i cannot be guilty of so much cruelty for rather than let him die he shall be hers i will with my own hand give him to her and since i am destined to be a sacrifice my peace and liberty shall be the ransom of his preservation  thus madam i came to the chamber where don ramire was confined and being let in the doors were shut again he was so extremely thoughtful that he hardly turned his eyes toward me till i spoke to him what makes you so dispirited sir said i where is that courage which ever supported you the tone of my voice made me known to him and opening his arms oh my angel cried he the only dear object of my vows is it you i see here in this frightful prison are you come to share my pains at these words he took hold of my hand and kissed it with transports of the greatest passion i sat down by him and was some time before i could recover my speech so many dismal thoughts conspired to increase my despair at last i made an effort and said if you knew my dear don ramire what is contriving against you my presence would not give you all this joy they are working your ruin and you cannot possibly avoid the misfortune you are threatened with but by marrying laurea the jaylors daughter who is in love with you and will do her utmost to save you the dress i am in deceived her and she has confessed her passion for you she charged me to inform you of it and requires your answer assuring me at the same time you will have nothing to fear if once you consent to her wishes i conjure you then by all our affection to embrace this important occasion marry her since there is no other remedy left i had rather deplore the loss of your heart than that of your life o fatal resolution added i must i even lose the hopes of ever being yours but alas what do i say it is no time now to reflect i cannot balance your interest with mine you must live sir though you live for another whilst unhappy inea retired to some remote solitary place will be dead to you and to the rest of the world  don ramire heard me with surprise and made me this reply do you think madam i shall not always prefer death to an inglorious life and that i am capable of making you the sacrifice no unfortunate as i am love and resolution are my companions and nothing shall ever make me change here i could not restrain my tears which he perceived and said cease weeping my dear inea why will you add to my calamities oh rather conceal your trouble since it is in vain to advise me to such an alliance must i speak to you no more of it replied i sighing are you then resolved on your death and mine and will your love and courage be of no other help to you than to let you fall a victim to an incensed parent whose only son you have destroyed at least strive to save your self promise every thing to laurea and perform what you please you know me very little madam interrupted he if you believe i can be so perfidious this young creature will depend on my assurances and i cannot resolve to deceive her heavens what shall we do then cried i your tender scruples are very ill timed do you consider how near you are the danger which threatens you and that your fate is almost inevitable i beg of you i conjure you to comply with laurea though you are dearer to me than life alas if i saw the least ray of hope do you think i would desire you to act so contrary to my peace oh my dear my eternal love continued i dont sacrifice your self to our mutual affection but yield to my last and earnest request  a deluge of tears followed these words and my spirits were so faint that i could hardly continue my discourse ah how fatal will your pity be to me cried he your trouble pierces my heart dont be so dejected charming inea heaven will take care of us yes said i heaven would take care of us indeed if you did but second its inspirations has not providence sent you laurea oh name her not replied he i conjure you by all the powers of love never to mention her more you are resolved to perish then said i i would live for you answered he but if it be not possible i will at least die constant and be satisfied with giving you the last proof of my fidelity here in a deep silence he embraced my knees and moistened my hands with his tears which gave a new course to mine my breast was filled with grief and in this sad moment a thought came into my head which i fancied might be executed without much difficulty  dont be against all the ways there are left to preserve your life said i but swear by your passion for me that you will strictly follow the advice i am going to give you it is unnecessary you should engage me by oath to obey you replied he you know i am devoted to your commands and though i could not consent to deceive laurea you must not judge from thence of what i am capable of doing for you well said i you shall have nothing to say to her i will be with you about this time to morrow and we must exchange clothes you shall go out in mine and immediately repair to don tiello who will have notice of it there are vessels going out a cruising and as you have relations at the court of morocco you may find an opportunity of going to a place where you will be out of the power of your enemies what madam cried he and leave you here a prisoner in my room exposed to the fury of your relations and the governors resentment must you be sacrified for my liberty no i had rather die before your face i am not base enough to resolve on any such thing i see very well said i to him in an angry tone that i must use all my authority to make you obey me since you compel me to it sir i command you to prepare your self to go off in the manner i told you i protest if you continue to be obstinate i never will see you more i retract the promise i made you of being yours and dispense you of all your vows to me so that now being free we may dispose as we please of our destinies  never was man in a greater confusion than poor don ramire when he heard me utter these words he flung himself at my feet and looked like one distracted are you then resolved madam to hate me and make another man happy said he what crime have i committed to deserve so many misfortunes i only refuse to fly this prison because i would not leave you here sure this proof of my passion cannot be so cruel an offense why will you add one torment to another i must be absolutely obeyed replied i since in leaving me here i run no risque laurea will get me out and it is with her i shall take measures for that purpose therefore if you love me do not oppose my setting you free alas madam dispose of me as you please said he in a dejected manner i am wholly yours and never would have disputed your power were it not for the fear i was in of exposing you to inevitable dangers i am now satisfied answered i for be assured don ramire if i loved you less i should not have been so displeased with your refusal at these words he passionately kissed my hand and with tender regret we separated  the jailer being told by a soldier of the guard that i wanted to have the door opened came and conducted me out but i was uneasy not seeing laurea who having veiled her self was standing in a dark passage near the outward gate where on a sudden i heard her say hold sir pray let me know what news from the person you have just seen he acknowledges your generosity with the highest gratitude madam said i and will make you mistress of his fate being resolved to live only for you i fear you flatter me replied she for i am easily deceived but if you do heaven will punish you both no said i do not suspect his honor nor mine you shall never have reason to repent your generous sentiments but when will you set him free as soon as possible answered she my father and the soldiers who guard him eat together i intend to put opium in their wine and when they are asleep steal the keys so let him out but what will become of us afterward continued laurea you shall embark together said i and rejoice at your good fortune far from portoreal thus i left her and she seemed highly pleased at the assurances i gave her  i was going toward home when i thought it very necessary don tiello should be informed of what had passed therefore i went to him and told him i had used his name to be admitted into the prison which i hoped he would approve that i had been trying means for my friends escape and as i did not doubt of succeeding we had agreed he should come to him as soon as he was free being persuaded he would be so generous as to take care of his safety till he had found a ship to carry him to morocco the circumstance is very lucky said he for my brother lies now in the road and only waits a fair wind to sail for that coast be assured i shall neglect no opportunity of serving him after this answer i desired him not to go the next day to the prison because i was to be there and should pass for his son so left him without being known and my mind was more composed than it had been ever since don ramires fatal confinement  by this time i was come home where i found teresa waiting for me i related to her all that had passed but when i recollected i had advised don ramire to lay his liberty at laureas feet i thought i could never have been capable of acting so contrary to my sentiments what could i do teresa said i for were he as weak as i have been and had fear made him inconstant by this time i should see him no longer mine and on the other side had i not used this stratagem in a few days he would be no more in the world  i found some ease in entertaining her after this manner most part of the night and representing to her his extraordinary passion and constancy his design of going to morocco and mine of meeting him there i ought not to distrust said i the promise he has given me since he declared he rather would choose death than be contracted to his deliverer and if i can get my jewels which are in my mothers keeping nothing shall prevent my making this voyage teresa told me it was easy enough to get into her closet and if i would carry her with me she would take upon her to get em though she should hazard her life for it her affection to my service so sensibly touched me that i embraced her and promised never to forsake her you must go out with me to morrow night continued i disguised in mens clothes for fear my relations perceiving my flight and the loss of the jewels should seize you as don tiello is a man of honor and in our prisoners interest i will meet him before i go to the prison and tell him my resolution of staying in don ramires place i shall desire him at the same to protect you and procure us a ship to follow him but madam replied she what will you do with laurea whom you intend to deceive under the notion of your being don ramire she will follow your fortune and if she discovers who you are may give you a great deal of trouble this requiring some reflection every thing i had to fear presented it self to my imagination all that night and tormented me a thousand different ways  the next morning i pretended i was extremely indisposed to prevent my mothers suspecting i had any design and as soon as it was dusk of evening teresa disguised entered my mothers closet and took the jewels as we had proposed it then i went directly to the prison where laurea was expecting me without any light i told her i was resolved to expose my life for her and don ramires service assuring her i would carry them to a ship which would soon put em out of the power of their enemies my fate is in your hands replied she and provided i am with him i love carry me where you please i am now endeavoring his liberty and do not doubt but i shall succeed in what i undertake i returned her thanks in the name of don ramire then hiding my self with my cloak went to the jailer whom i complimented in few words and desired the favor of seeing don ramire as from my father you shall see him this night and no more said he to me in a rough manner for orders are given that none but don tiello should be admitted and if the governor knew i suffer you to speak to him he would make me repent it this unexpected reception stunned me alas thought i if we do not improve this opportunity we are all undone  don ramire as soon as i entered his chamber received me in his arms and saluted me with so much tenderness in his words and actions that it showed at once his love and gratitude come my dear said i let us make good use of this precious moment put on my clothes immediately and give me yours cover your face after the same manner i did mine and if you meet laurea as you go out tell her don ramire depends entirely on her friendship teresa in whom i conside is dressed in mens clothes and waits at the end of a street to go along with you to don tiellos who is ready to receive you as for my part i shall stay here till laurea comes to relieve me alas my charming inea replied he how shall i resolve to forsake you no my only dear i cannot submit to a command so desperate if i must perish or lose you i readily prefer the first ah cruel man said i shall we then dispute for ever and will you act both your own destruction and mine how can you be so obstinate i beg you dear don ramire i conjure you by all the love you ever professed to me and the proofs i have given you of a return not to deny me this favor i fear every thing on your account but have little to fear on my own obey me this instant and make no reply  thus madam i at last persuaded him though not without much difficulty and having divested my self of my clothes i made him put em on the disguise seemed favorable to him and i was flattering my self with a successful event when the hour of parting drew near our sighs and tears were the interpreters of our excessive grief is it possible i have resolution enough said don ramire to act a part so contrary to the sentiments of my soul oh think that in obeying you this day i give you the greatest testimony of an inviolable passion i regard it as a proof of your constancy replied i which will have its reward our fortune may receive a happy change then we shall triumph over our ill stars i even feel a secret satisfaction in my present misfortune since it gives me an opportunity of showing how much i love you in what a different state is my bleeding heart cried he can i ever be more unhappy than to leave you in this frightful place and live some days without you but continued he be assured my body only will be separated from you my thoughts shall ever attend you receive my vows divine inea and let this ring be the pledge of my love heaven ordain we may be so united as never to be parted more i accept your hand replied i here receive mine and may the superior powers be witness of our promises adieu my dear continued i embracing him and bathing his face with my tears farewell my angel said he pressing me in his arms it grieves my very soul to leave you  don ramire in this manner was conducted out and as soon as i had lost sight of him all my fears for him and my own conduct came hurrying to my mind i know not madam how it was possible i could bear with the anxiety of my thoughts all that was dismal and full of terror entered my imagination whilst i was uncertain of his fate but by the time i thought he might be out of danger my afflicted mind received some relief  as i had passed but a very indifferent night i lay all the next day on the bed which made the jailer believe i was sick therefore whenever he came into my chamber he would not interrupt me but leaving what was necessary by me retired i continued in this situation till the evening when i was agreeably surpised with a visit from don tiello who brought me a letter and informed me of don ramires being happily embarked he highly commended the resolution i had shown in staying in his place with the hazard of my life to preserve his but after he had been some time with me he discovered i was not what i appeared to be the tone of my voice my complexion and particularly the emotion i was in when i spoke of don ramire with the joy i expressed at receiving his letter and my tears every thing confirmed his suspicions yet for fear of offending me he would not mention any thing of the matter protesting only he would do all that depended on him to serve me and that i could not confide in a person who would make a more generous return after some discourses of this nature he took leave of me wishing i might meet a recompense proportionable to so great and perfect a friendship i passed the rest of my night in reading over and over don ramires letter which was the only consolation i had the five days i was prisoner it was writ in these terms  i have left you my dear inea in so frightful a place and with such melancholy circumstances that you may easily imagine the condition i am in is not less deplorable than yours i must confess i was just on the point of returning to you but the apprehension i was under of displeasing you prevented my giving such a proof of my love oh ought i not to be ashamed you should have surpassed me in generosity and that i could be weak enough to suffer it yet do not interpret this to the prejudice of one who only consented to fly that he might preserve himself yours and since our good fortune equally depends on my life i shall take care of it as an offering no longer mine but consecrated to you come then speedily my angel and let us by our union taste immortal pleasures my leaving this place is deferred no longer than the finishing this letter i am going and shall expect you with impatience proportionable to the happiness of our next meeting adieu my soul adieu my only dear we shall have no reason i hope to complain hereafter of fortune since our passion surpasses every thing that has ever been known in the world   i must tell you madam i had taken teresa with me to the prison by which means i made her acquainted with laurea who supposed her to be a young gentleman and our intimate friend as they used often to meet in a place they had appointed for that purpose laurea could not help saying one day to her that she was very uneasy concerning what she should act in favor of don ramire and that she had a mind to leave him in confinement for what can i hope from him continued she i may depend on a great deal of chagrin on account of my father who will be prosecuted for his escape i shall be the occasion of the ruin of my family and how do i know but i may be lost with them it is true i am promised every thing from don ramire yet my birth is so inferior to his that nothing less than an extraordinary passion could induce him to condescend to our alliance besides he has never seen me and when we are once embarked together instead of loving me perhaps he may hate me oh i think my self already abandoned by him and set ashore on some desert island where death will be the recompense of all my pains teresa trembled at what she heard this young creature say knowing i could only make my escape by her means so omitted nothing to bring her back to her first intentions generous laurea said she i am persuaded if you knew the person you propose to serve as well as i do you would never change your resolution he has all the sentiments of a man of honor and i am sure his passion for you will be eternal the chimeras you frame to your self have not the least foundation i therefore conjure you to be constant in so important a cause which will undoubtedly contribute to your good fortune as well as his laurea ashamed of having shown so much inequality of temper made some excuses then resolved again on her first design i am willing to believe you said she and to convince you of the truth be here exactly at two after midnight i will bring don ramire to you every thing is ready for his escape and you may take measures for our departure teresa extremely overjoyed at these words left her immediately and went to don tiello to tell him don ramires friend whom he had seen in prison would be that night set free and desired he would prepare a sloop for their going off but continued she how shall we disengage our selves from laurea who will do us all the prejudice in her power if once she perceives we have betrayed her when she comes aboard said he and finds it is not don ramires concern she will be too happy to return home without discovering any thing for fear they should charge her with having an hand in his escape and if some unforeseen accident does not happen i am persuaded we shall manage this affair to our satisfaction  as i could not tell what hour laurea had appointed to set me at liberty i began to be very much tired with my confinement but in the dead of night i was relieved of my uneasiness when i heard my door open softly and saw the jaylors daughter being wrapped in my cloak i advanced toward her with my face almost hid for fear she should discover i was not don ramire i embraced her with the greatest marks of a violent passion but said little to her on the score of my gratitude she was in such disorder her self that i believe it would have been hard for her to perceive the deceit had she even seen my face in one hand she had a dark lanthorn and in the other a bunch of keys so without saying any thing to me she made me a sign to follow her which i did and we passed all the soldiers who were fast asleep as she had contrived it by putting opium in their wine thus we left the place without the least obstacle but as soon as we were in the street she took hold of my arm as if she were afraid i should fly her clingd to me so close that i was hardly able to walk  don tiello and teresa were waiting for me in the place they had appointed from whence we went together to the seaside where we found the boat belonging to the ship which was to carry me to morocco the night was very dark and laurea made me a thousand caresses i could but very ill return being in pain to know what would become of this young creature after she had discovered the plot we were not long a making up to the vessel and as soon as we came on board don tiello carried us into the captains cabin but madam how shall i tell you the surprise i was in when i found this captain to be my father who was no less astonished to see teresa and me after all the enquiry that had been made about us throughout the whole city don tiello knowing he professed a great friendship for don ramire had trusted him with the secret and declared i was that unhappy gentlemans mistress who had resolved to follow his fortune into morocco in mans disguise he started back three or four steps and not being master of the first effects of his passion was going to draw his sword when i flung my self at his feet oh sir said i forgive me remember you are my father and vouchsafe to hear before you punish me i embraced his knees and wet his hand with my tears though he entirely loved me yet in this occasion he showed his resentment by making me many reproaches and at last bid me say what i could to justify my self  i knew my only remedy was to confess the truth which i did in so feeling a manner that it moved his compassion he was very well acquainted with don ramires merit and had been thoroughly concerned for his imprisonment but being informed of his escape he expressed an entire satisfaction my father left us to go into another cabin with don tiello who was very much his friend i see said he you are surpised as well as me at what has happened you were certainly a stranger to ineas flight and did not think it was her you had put into my hands i protest to you replied don tiello i am under a consternation which i cannot express i cannot say i have committed a fault for perhaps it may turn to advantage that the affair has passed after this manner but if you will make me perfectly easy i beg you will grant me your daughters pardon whatever reasons you have to be displeased with her you see she is contracted to don ramire who is a man of birth and fortune and in my opinion you cannot dispose of her better than uniting her destiny to his i agree with you replied my father but his proceedings to obtain inea without my consent highly offend me i received him into my house as a particular friend and would have willingly given my eldest daughter to him was it nor a very ill return he made to so much civility when he engaged this young creature to disguise her self and follow him like a madwoman if you remember what inea has related to us replied don tiello she is alone culpable yet of all crimes those which love makes us commit are most excuseable and especially in a young person who has so little experience forgive her then i conjure you added he and you will confer an obligation on me which i shall ever acknowledge my father who was already disposed to favor me embracing don tiello said to him i am considerably indebted to you for entering so generously into the interest of my family and will forget ineas crime since you desire it if don ramire has a real passion for her i shall rejoice at the match and as a proof of my satisfaction i will carry her to morrocco in order to complete their happiness  this conversation ended in my favor as you see madam which i little expected for i was in the cabin so extremely afflicted that i may say no sorrow could be equal to mine what will become of me said i to teresa i am for ever unfortunate i loose my liberty in the very moment i thought my self mistress of my destiny and i am now in the power of a father who will have no mercy of me alas poor don ramire i must never see him more he will certainly think i am dead or inconstant and either of the two will drive him into despair i shall be delivered up to my mother and sisters severities which is a misfortune i can never endure  whilst i was speaking laurea looked at me with the eyes of a fury dont you deserve the fate you have met with said she nay even more than what seems to threaten you you have deceived me perfidious as you are and improved my weakness in favor of your lover i have just delivered up my family to the governors resentment but dont think to escape me you shall be my victim as i am yours in pronouncing these words she flung her self upon me and i do not doubt but would have stifled me had not teresa come to my assistance as well as my father and don tiello who hearing a noise ran and freed me from this mad creatures rage i stood in want of their help for i did not resist her prefering death to an unhappy life  don tiello saw very well to what a condition my grief had reduced me and neglected nothing to ease my troubled mind he begged i would no longer afflict my self i have prevailed with your father madam said he and he has promised me to carry you to morocco i had not patience to hear any more but upon these assurances went and flung my self at my fathers feet and embracing his knees expressed my gratitude he told me with a great deal of goodness that as it was don tiellos request he forgave me and consented i should marry don ramire at these words laurea cried aloud and made such complaints as would move any one with pity i knew by my self what she suffered alas said i to teresa were my case like hers how wretched should i be she loves don ramire and was flattered with the hopes of passing the rest of her days with him but now those agreeable thoughts are all destroyed she loves him less than you imagine replied teresa and if i had not done my utmost to make her pursue her first intentions i very much doubt the performance of what she promised you here teresa related to us what had passed between them as i have already informed you madam and don tiello told laurea the best thing she could do was to return to portoreal before day that her father might not know of her having a hand in the matter so he took his leave of us and carrying her with him into the boat they both went ashore  i had but just time to change my clothes when you came on board and your trouble madam interrupted the pleasure i began to taste at the thoughts of seeing don ramire who as yet has not heard of my misfortune he will leave morocco perhaps in hopes of finding me at portoreal his passion may make him forget the danger which threatens him at that place and i know not whether i shall ever see him more i have also lost teresa who was so true to me this poor creature was snatched from me by one of the officers in the admirals ship my prayers could not prevent her being carried off by this barbarian and i assure you madam had it not been for you i should have sunk under the load of innumerable calamities    here inea endeavored to hide her tears but could not restrain their course felicia embraced her and used many tender expressions to soften her sorrow alas my dear said she i my self am very unfortunate and did you know the cruel torments i endure you would own you are not alone to be pitied but i consider it is time for you to retire i have kept you up too long i am sensible madam replied inea i have tired your patience with the recital of my adventures but that is a fault which attends all unhappy lovers since the only consolation they have left em is that of lamenting their fate you do me injustice replied felicia if you have so disobliging a thought i am extremely pleased with your compliance and to convince you thereof i will to morrow in return confide the secrets of my life to you in finishing these words she embraced her again and inea went to her bed  phoebus had no sooner graced the watery plain but young inea impatient to hear felicias adventures rose and saluted her with a pleasant morning i wish my dear said felicia to her i had not closed my eyes all night for i have had a frightful dream concerning a person i very much esteem he appeared to me in the greatest dangers engaged with the moors and vanquished oh how my soul is alarmed your mind is so possessed with dismal ideas replied inea that you must not be surpised if they affect you in your sleep yet madam dreams are not to be taken notice of alas said felicia they would make no impression on me at any other time but what have i not to fear at present being far from my country and from a friend whose absence is the chief cause of my uneasiness though i own to you abelhamars passion for me is no small addition to my woes since i must be continually on my guard against the pursuits of a prince who has so much power in this court unhappy creature that i am were not my misfortunes great enough why must the few charms i have left serve only to render them the more insupportable dont add to your affliction madam said inea the prince has too much respect for you to use his authority in opposition to your inclinations and you may easily imagine as soon as your relations are informed of your destiny they will employ all their interest to relieve you i should be in the wrong to doubt their affection for me replied felicia weeping though in their opinion my behavior merits no favor oh that i rather owed my liberty to the man whose presence now would make me happy i find you are in love madam said inea interrupting her i confess it replied felicia blushing and since you have given me so great a proof of your confidence i promise you mine and will inform you of my weakness  felicia began immediately to relate her story from the time her father had contracted her to the prince of carency but her discourse was often interrupted with tears which the thoughts of her misfortunes extorted from her i am not only concerned said she at my being separated from the count of la vagne but inconsolable when i think how casilda betrayed me after having chose her for my friend and loved her sincerely i condemn her replied inea and wonder how any one could be so perfidious especially to a person who no ways deserved such inhuman usage  they were talking in this manner when the governess of the slaves came and bid em dress themselves in order to wait on the queen to the mosquez where they were obliged to attend though christians felicia during the ceremony of those infidels took such care to hide self in her veil that although abelhamar sought her with a great deal of attention he could not distinguish her from the rest of her companions he did not doubt but this affectation was designed which so sensibly grieved him that he retired to his apartment and wrote the ensuing letter  what crime have i committed lovely felicia to deserve your aversion you fly me and even deny me the satisfaction of seeing your beauteous face can you be offended at a passion your charms have created what violence have i not done my self to suppress my transports rather than incur your displeasure oh treat me with less severity my love is worthy a more obliging return since i am seeking means to procure your liberty which i hope to effect in spite of the queens opposition   celima being returned from the mosquez ordered that some of the slaves should come and work by her felicia was of the number and as abelhamar was watching an opportunity to give her this letter he approached her and slipped it into her lap which he thought she had perceived and would have taken care to hide it but it happened otherwise for the queen who was informed of the princes sentiments for felicia seeing him put a paper into her work found means to take it so was convinced of the truth and extremely pleased this young spaniard made no return to abelhamars passion the queen had a secret aversion to him though his only crime was that of being lawful heir to the crown she was in possession of which was a sufficient motive to make him disagreeable to her  that evening celima took a walk in the palace gardens and as she had a mind to speak with felicia she called her as it were to lean on her arm and advanced toward a terracewalk from whence one could discover the seaside with a most delightful prospect there she sat down and looking at felicia with a graceful air though you have not been with me long said she i have a particular kindness for you and am willing to tell you that if you have a mind to merit my affection you must entirely banish abelhamar from your heart i am informed of his sentiments and know part of yours but it is to be feared that a young creature as you are having no other engagement and being flattered with the hopes he gives you might sacrifice your virtues to your ambition yet i cannot believe you would consent to be his mistress for that is all you must expect from a man who certainly never will marry you i do not know madam answered felicia with a great deal of modesty who could speak to you of the princes sentiments but if your majesty is informed of mine you are convinced i have received his offers in such a manner as ought to destroy all the hopes my misfortunes might have given him the condition i am in madam continued she has not made any dishonorable impression on my heart and i bless heaven to find your majesty so opposed to a thing which i could not think on without the greatest horror for in my opinion it is more glorious to die than live a life destitute of virtue  what said the queen would you sooner choose death than be mistress to abelhamar who would not as well as i madam replied felicia and what other thought could enter into ones head this resolution is my only comfort since i know it to be an effectual way to deliver me from an infamous passion but if you have a lover in spain said the queen do you consider that in dying at sallee you never will see him more suppose there were any one for whom i had an inclination replied felicia i should be the more ready to die as being the strongest evincement i could give him of my constancy for if it were my misfortune not to live for him i never would for any other ha felicia said the queen smiling what do you tell me is it possible that cupid has already summoned a heart so young but alas there is no age free from his empire in one moment the fatal dart is lancd ending these words she sighed and remained some time in a deep silence  all the ladies who attended the queen were standing at such a distance from the place where she was sat that she could speak to felicia without being heard here said she taking the princes letter from her bosom see what abelhamar has wrote to you i believe you are virtuous therefore cannot suspect your conduct when you see him take no notice of my knowing his sentiments but advise him not to persevere in his design for instead of procuring your liberty as he promises perhaps he may lose his own for the rest of his days this she pronounced with a melancholy accent then rose and returned to the palace  felicia overjoyed at what the queen had said to her joined inea whom she desired to stay with her in the garden and they both went and sat down in the same place which celima had just quitted notwithstanding all the misfortunes that afflict me said felicia to her companion i have cause to bless heaven for the disposition the queen is in she forbids me receiving the princes addresses think my dear how willing i am to obey her and whether she had need to use her authority on this occasion i congratulate you answered inea since it adds to your comfort but i cannot conceive out of what motive she opposes a thing which ought to be indifferent to her unless she has her self taken an affection for him i am apt to believe said felicia her thoughts are employed on some object and that her heart is not entirely free from love for when she asked me whether i had any engagement i perceived she grew of a sudden so pensive that it was some time before she could recover her self yet i cannot think she likes the young prince for as she is mistress of her destiny i suppose she might make him her husband if it were her pleasure i rather believe she intends to keep him under an absolute submission to her will can she be so little acquainted with the motions of a heart interrupted inea to imagine abelhamars sentiments will receive laws from a sovereign whom he has some reason to hate as for my part i know it would be impossible for me either to love or not love by command i might so far prevail with my self as to be silent or to counterfeit an indifference and yet i cannot tell whether i should act that part so well as to please those who would lay such a duty on me i shall not dispute with you on that subject replied felicia but between us i esteem it a great happiness that my inclination is so ready to comply with the queens commands  as she had finished her discourse she perceived a man near her whom by the light of the moon she knew to be abelhamar which not a little surpised her she rose in order to run from him but he took hold of her and said do not fly me thus cruel felicia i am unfortunate enough to have heard your conversation with celima and could wish my self dead rather than give you the displeasure of seeing me once more at your feet here he was silent but after some time continued in this manner what did i think one whom i looked on a divinity would approve of the unjust queens barbarity and reduce me to the last despair by an inhumane usage take care ungrateful felicia how you behave your self toward me i am not here among strangers and celima who would fain dispose of my heart as she does of my crown may find fortune is not always constant and that usurpers have ever cause to fear my lord replied felicia i perceive you heard what the queen said relating to you i must not concern my self in affairs of state and since you know my sentiments i shall make no diffiulty in confessing them it is true i was sensibly pleased to receive a command so positive and conformable to my inclination for i cannot love an enemy to my country and religion why have i treated you like an enemy answered the prince what advantage did i take of my victory was it a crime to love and serve you i am sensible of all you acted for me interrupted felicia and my gratitude is equal to your favors accept of it then my lord as the only return i can make and it is even more than the queen will consent to  the prince falling into a violent passion leaned himself against a ballister of marble pillars which boarded the terracewalk and looking at felicia with despair in his countenance i swear said he by our great mahomet and by my love that if i dont enjoy you i will put the kingdom of fez into desolation pull down from the throne the unworthy princess who sits on it and burn this magnificent palace to ashes you shall see felicia what such a lover as i can do when he finds himself despised your eyes shall cause more confusion amongst us than any revolution ever did oh heavens my lord cried felicia can any thing be more dreadful than such designs what for an unfortunate slave as i am would you disturb the peace of this nation are not my woes great enough already must you attempt to force me away from the queen after i have declared to you that i will resolve on death sooner than consent to your desires my lord since i must confess it i am in love with one in spain and i will as willingly give my life as marry any other absence it self shall never lessen my affection for him i know the way to be constant and preserve my heart for one who  no i can hear you no longer said the prince interrupting her you endeavor to distract me with the cruelest things you can imagine but in time i will be revenged on you the queen and that dangerous rival finishing these words he left felicia  her affliction was so great that she had hardly reached the palace when she was seized with a violent fever which continued all that night the governess of the slaves went next morning to acquaint the queen of it who sent olympia doria to stay by her as soon as felicia saw her enter the chamber she said to her with a languishing air the condition i am in madam will only give you uneasiness and the company of so unfortunate a creature as i can be no ways agreeable to you i cannot tell whether it be a pleasure to you to see me answered olympia but i know very well nothing can give me a greater satisfaction than being with you and though i am in expectation of the only happiness that can bless my days yet in quitting this palace i cannot help regretting the absence of my charming felicia how obliging you are my dearest companion replied she but alas i shall have the greatest cause to regret when i see you no more what consolation would it be me were i going with you to genoa i have some reasons to wish it i will not presume to ask em said olympia fearing you should think my curiosity too great but if you will tell me why you are so desirous of going that voyage i shall take it as a mighty favor i will grant your request replied felicia as soon as my health permits me and shall desire you also to acquaint me with some particulars relating to a person of that country which olympia promised her and after having staid some time with her she went and gave the queen an account of the condition she was in  the mean while felicia and inea entertained each other with their grief whenever they found an opportunity of being alone should i inform the queen of abelhamars menaces said felicia to her friend she would take such measures as might secure the peace and tranquillity of her kingdom and by sending me for spain deliver me from his violence but continued she after a moments pause what reproaches should not i deserve supposing this young prince was only urged by his passion to speak as he did without having any thoughts of executing so rash a design and that upon my information he should be arrested then his disgrace and perhaps the loss of his life would be owing to me what an ungrateful return should i make to the obliging sentiments he conceived for me from the beginning of my misfortune inea approved very much her prudent considerations and represented to her how willingly the queen would embrace that pretense to make a sacrifice of abelhamar whose passion she only opposed with a design to provoke him to use her with disrespect which would consequently bring him to inevitable punishment and were it otherways it would not stand with reason that the queen should concern her self with any thing so much below her as a slave felicia was of ineas opinion and thought there was so much probability in what she said that she chose rather to be silent in the matter than make a discovery which might be the cause of greater disorders so implored the assistance of heaven for her deliverance as for inea she had already writ the particulars of her voyage to her dear don ramire and was impatiently waiting his answer  abelhamar whose passion was grown desperate retired from the queens palace to his own and there confined himself with his faithful mula cease flattering me said he and dont make me hope any thing from my submission to the queen and felicia i now am too well informed of what i must expect from their cruelty as i was walking in the palace garden distracted and melancholy i perceived at a distance celima followed by her women and to avoid paying my court to her i retired to a grotto under the terracewalk which i had just entered when the queen leaning on felicias arm came and seated her self in a place where i could distinctly hear all they said no mula it is not possible to express the intolerable aversion she has to me and with what disdain she speaks of me she has given reiterated commands to that lovely captive to fly and hate me who ungrateful as she is not only received em with pleasure but even promised celima more than she required of her and it was not long before i felt the effect of it for as soon as the queen was gone back to the palace and i could find an opportunity to speak to this young slave she confirmed with a most rigorous air what i had already heard and moreover told me she was in love with one in spain and that nothing in the world should ever make her change in a word i find there is no time to be lost i must immediately adhere to the king of tituans proposals that prince extremely resents celimas refusal a slighted passion demands revenge and he looks on me as one who is capable of assisting him before i had seen felicia i would not favor his designs thinking the queen might choose me to reign with her now i see my error she not only hates me but even opposes my happiness wherever i seek it  if i may be permitted to give you my advice my lord replied mula i am of opinion you should speak to celima before you enter into the king of tituans interest and try whether you cannot bring her into a more favorable disposition for you it is probable she may make some serious reflection and for her own sake not provoke you to act any thing desperate i am willing to make that one step more said the prince though ever so nice but as i believe the queen has a design to take me up let us be prepared for the worst if i am put in arrest do you go to tunis tell ismael the number of friends i have in this court and manage affairs so as by his assistance and theirs i may obtain my liberty possess my love and be revenged  it was late before abelhamar had ended his conversation which prevented him from going the next morning to the queens apartment and the first thing he heard was felicias illness this news caused him to be extremely uneasy he soon forgot all other projects and fixed his chiefest thoughts on seeking means to see the person he loved which met with some opposition celima having given orders he should not be admitted into her chamber and as for the governess of the slaves he could not flatter himself with the hopes of gaining her being an old woman entirely devoted to the queens will so that he was almost despairing of success in his enterprise but what is not love capable of it conquers all difficulties  the prince being young and handsome resolved to disguise himself in womans clothes in order to be presented to the queen by a captain of a ship with whom he was particularly acquainted he was a perfect master of the spanish tongue and did not doubt but he might easily pass for one of that nation he told his design to mula who used his endeavors to divert him from an attempt which might prove fatal to him but his arguments were of little weight where love had so great an influence he ordered immediately his physician to be called and bid him give out every where he was dangerously ill of a fever and that it was convenient he should see no company this news being talked of at court the seacaptain brought him to the palace among several other slaves which he had lately taken the queen took a particular notice of abelhamar and asked him some questions which might have puzzled him had not his wit been prevailing and his replies so ingenious that they did not give her the least suspicion of a disguise the governess of the slaves having asked his name he told her he was called eugenia and that he was a native of the kingdom of castile the queen ordered she should be conducted to felicia who perhaps might know her and be much pleased to see one of her country  abelhamar was sent in this manner to felicia who was in bed very much indisposed he no sooner entered her chamber but seeing her in this condition he turned pale and seemed so dejected that it would have pitied any one that was present at this interview as felicia and inea believed this new slaves affliction proceeded from her late misfortune they were no ways surpised at the disorder she was in but endeavored by their kind expressions to soften the rigor of her unhappy state  the amorous prince thus continued with his dear felicia and the oftener he saw her the greater were the effects of her charms which at last so potently influenced him that he could not resolve to quit the palace esteeming himself too happy in the company of his adorable mistress he had so many perfections that it would have been easy for him to make the conquest of the queens handsomest slaves had he made the least pursuit toward it but his heart was entirely filled with felicias idea and all his thoughts were employed on the only care of pleasing her  she also very much contributed by her innocent caresses to detain him their humors agreed so well that she desired as a favor they would let eugenia stay with her during her illness there is a secret charm in your conversation said she sometimes to her which gives me a much greater pleasure than any i can find in that of my other companions it is the effect of my love for you beauteous felicia that inspires you with this sympathy replied the passionate prince and how blessed should i be were i as dear to you as you are to me but continued he if you will give me leave to tell you my thoughts i believe you are indifferent whether beloved or not alas how great would be my felicity answered felicia with a melancholy tone were i such as you represent me you little know my sentiments they give me more uneasiness than my unfortunate captivity what madam said the pretended eugenia is it possible that after having wholly resigned my self to you you would make any thing a secret to me if your heart is touched with a tender passion will it not be a comfort to you to make me your confident what shall i say to you replied felicia i can only tell you my weakness and confess an engagement which is so dear to me that it fills my soul at once with a thousand different motions these words cruelly affected the prince who could not utter one syllable but turning pale he fixed his eyes on her and continued some time in this posture as astonished at what she said though she had already declared her sentiments to him in the garden at last he endeavored to speak and with a languishing accent said i should not be surpised so perfect a creature as you were adored yet felicia i flattered my self that far from having lost your liberty you were free from any passion this opinion pleased me extremely for although we are of one sex i must tell you i take delight in gaining the affections of a young unpracticed heart who is unacquainted with sentiments so destructive to our peace this made me conceive a particular friendship for you but i understand your disdain for some is equal to your weakness for others oh what shame and disorder do you cause in me replied felicia covering her face with her handkerchief i expected in telling you my secret you would have pitied and consold me alas do you upbraid me eugenia your severity will compel me hereafter to fear and fly you the unhappy prince at these words flung himself on his knees and taking her hand kissed and bathed it with tears his speech was suppressed with sighs which would have been sufficient to discover him were it not that felicia had a strong opinion of his being of her own sex and did not in the least take notice of his passionate expressions  inea entered the chamber whilst they were in this silent and melancholy condition what is the cause of this sorrow said she is this the way eugenia you entertain our dear sick lady you have without doubt said something to her which renews the remembrance of her past misfortunes i have said nothing to felicia interrupted the prince immediately but what was agreeable to her therefore do not accuse me i would undergo any pain my self rather than aggravate hers alas inea said felicia here cruel eugenia has been reproaching me with sentiments i have for a person whom she her self would love were she as well acquainted with him as i am no replied eugenia i am convinced of the contrary i even have an invincible aversion to this unknown who perfidiously robs me of your heart which is a crime not to be forgiven this is no subject to create a dispute between you and i said felicia the affection we have for a lover or a friend is of so different a nature that the one does no prejudice to the other give me leave to tell you cried the young prince that when a heart is touched with a powerful passion it is incapable of receiving any other impression then you dont believe i love you eugenia interrupted felicia i know not what to believe replied the prince but what i am assured of is no creature can be in greater despair as he ended these words olympia entered the chamber  it is given out in the palace said she that prince abelhamar having counterfeited a sickness is gone away secretly in order to assist ismael king of tunis who intends to declare war against the queen which news has so much alarmed her that she has given orders to search his apartment in spite of what his physician says to oppose his being seen and if it be possible to penetrate into the queens sentiments by her uneasiness she is in a great apprehension concerning the consequence of this sudden departure the queens thoughts and mine are as different as our interest replied felicia she is concerned at the princes being gone and i am overjoyed at it abelhamar who had not interrupted olympias discourse could not help looking earnestly at felicia that prince is very unfortunate said he that his absence should give you so much pleasure i perceive the love and respect he has for you meet with a very unkind return what is become of that complaisance you showed us at first my dear eugenia replied felicia you equally blame me for having an inclination and for not having one i think it would not be reasonable for me to have any other sentiments for abelhamar and i am even assured that if i liked him you your self would condemn me try madam continued eugenia strive to love the prince were it only to be revenged and to punish me for my capriciousness i promise you before it be long i will render his passion very disagreeable to you i shall not give you that trouble replied felicia my constancy might then be brought in question it is dangerous to make such trials these words sensibly affected abelhamar whose passionate looks expressed such emotions that is was surprising felicia inea and olympia suspected nothing extraordinary under the disguise  but what advantage did the young prince receive from this stratagem he saw felicia and daily discovered some transcendent charms which inflamed him the more and increased his despair when he reflected on the sentiments she had for him for his passion was not only violent but so nice that he would not have been satisfied with the possession of her person without that of her heart and as he knew he had no share in her affection it threw him sometimes into such a deep melancholy as could not be concealed besides the queen being informed of abelhamars counterfeit sickness his going off and part of his designs gave orders that those officers who served him and could give her further light into the affair might be taken up and examined she was also raising troops repairing the fortifications of the town and taking all measures necessary to secure her self against the insults of an enemy whom she thought already with the king of tunis though every day in her chamber and sometimes lying at her beds feet thus the amourous prince elected his felicity in a confinement where he was exposed to a danger he did not apprehend and good fortune was so favorable to him till then that his disguise did not give the least cause of suspicion  felicias illness though extremely violent did not continue long her youth and good constitution contributed very much to her speedy recovery and gave her strength enough to walk in the palace gardens the court at that time was so attentive on the preparations of war that the slaves were not so strictly watched as usual one day felicia olympia inea and our counterfeit eugenia taking the air had turned their steps toward a pleasant terracewalk which afforded a most agreeable prospect but the weather changing there suddenly rose a high wind succeeded by terrible thunder and hail which obliged them to run for shelter into a little summer house that had a view on the ocean  felicia and inea were looking out of a window and had been some time observing the sea which furiously came and broke against the rocks making a horrid noise when they perceived a ship in the greatest danger she had lost all her masts and thus tossed from wave to wave was waiting the fatal moment these young ladies were moved with compassion at such a sight and concerned for those who were on board they implored the assistance of heaven and whilst they were making vows for their safety the wind decided their destiny for the ship was driven ashore and there entirely wrecked it was a most dismal scene to see how these unfortunate wretches strove to save themselves but their efforts were fruitless they all perished excepting one who was happy enough to reach a little rock which lay at a small distance from the shore  the storm being allayed some fishermen who had seen the shipwreck took their boat and rowed toward the rock where they found the man i mentioned in a swoon and as cold as death they took him and brought him ashore where they immediately lighted a fire and gave him all the help they were capable of  these things happened so near the summer house where our young captives were retired that they could easily see the condition this stranger was in but how great was felicia and olympias disorder when they knew him to be the count of la vagne they would have expressed their satisfaction were it not for the fear they were in of his being dead it is he cried olympia in her first transports it is certainly himself felicia on the other side pressing inea and eugenias hands could no more be mistress of her moderation oh heavens said she to them my dearest companions there is the man whose absence has given me so much displeasure he appears now just as he did when i found him in the forest of carmona where he had been attacked by robbers the picture of death was painted on his face i was then in a condition to assist him but now alas i am forced to see him perish without being at liberty to give him any help  whilst she was thus speaking to inea and the disguised prince olympia left em and ran to a door adjacent to the seaside which she caused to be opened without any difficulty and in a small time reached the place where the count was lying as soon as felicia perceived the concern and care she expressed in assisting him she knew not what to think i am well persuaded said she they are both natives of genoa and perhaps relations but methinks her affection is very great since she weeps as well as i and embraces him in such a passionate manner  the mean while abelhamar enraged and jealous was acting the greatest violence on himself in not discovering to her who he was that he might resolve on the immediate sacrifice of this dangerous rival ineas thoughts were also confused and she was hardly able to speak a word the more she considered olympias tender concern for the count of la vagne and the secret consolation she seemed to derive from his presence the more she sighed and sent her wishes to her faithful don ramire in a word it is not to be conceived how tormented they all were by different causes of uneasiness but how was lovely felicias mind employed all this while and what were her inward motions when she saw the count recovered from his swoon who appeared in transports of inexpressible joy at the sight of olympia he kissed her hand and fixed his eyes on here is as if fortune had snatched him from the arms of death only to lead him into perfect felicity am i then betrayed cried felicia in a faint voice and can i believe what i see is the count of la vagne in love with olympia you ought not in the least to doubt it answered eugenia who was very willing to confirm her suspicions and if you flattered your self with being beloved you are mistaken in the heart of that traitor any one may see by his actions that he has a passion for olympia do not have so rash an opinion of him interrupted inea it is probable he has some particular reasons for acting as he does perhaps the count is informed of prince abelhamars passion for felicia and as he is come in order to ransom his mistress he thought it convenient to conceal his true sentiments the better to succeed in his designs what pleasure you take in being deceived cried eugenia who could not bear to hear her express her self in this manner have you already forgot that abelhamar is suspected to be with the king of tunis and consequently there are no measures to be observed with him but the count knows nothing of it interrupted felicia and i am inclined to believe inea has interpreted the sentiments of his heart how great is our weakness when we love said the prince we scarcely can credit our own eyes we are so inclined to embrace any thing which flatters our wishes indeed eugenia replied felicia you always represent things in the falsest colors what have i done to invite you to take such delight in tormenting me the prince who perceived she was displeased said no more to her but resolved in himself to make the force of his revenge fall on this happy rival  olympia sent to acquaint the queen that the count of la vagne was cast on the shore but had escaped death and begged leave to pay his respects to her majesty celima who was exceeding melancholy and apprehensive of the consequences of abelhamars revolt declined seeing this stranger not to let him be witness of her affliction but sent back to olympia to tell her she might bring him to the palace where she should have an apartment prepared for him in one of the remote pavilions having given orders that he should be received with a distinction equal to his birth to this she added how willing she should be to admit him were she not indispensibly obliged to attend some affairs of the highest moment she gave orders also that they should supply him with all necessaries and several slaves immediately brought him variety of rich garments that he might please his fancy whilst olympia went to return the queen thanks for her favors the count was conducted through the gardens to the palace  felicia inea and eugenia were walking in an alley which had a view on the seaside when the count of la vagne came up pretty near to them felicia perceiving him her heart fluttered and she grew so faint in an instant that had not inea supported her on one side and the disguised prince on the other she would not have been able to stand but the count who had no cause to remark her motions though in favor of himself passed by the ladies and only saluted them with much respect without taking any particular notice of felicia  as soon as he was gone far enough from her not to be heard oh heaven cried she is it possible he can be so much master of his temper as not to show some tenderness in his eyes he looks as if he had never seen me what means this indifference inea are these his transports oh what must i think of his passion madam replied inea is not his coming hither to fetch you away a sufficient motive to convince you of his fidelity inea only deceives you interrupted the prince for i have seen many persons in love and can assure you that although they were in a continual restraint and obliged to be on their guard in the presence of jealous observers yet their passion discovered it self in their eyes and actions why continued he addressing himself to inea do you really think the count of la vagne was overjoyed to see felicia he did not so much as change color nor even fix his eyes on hers no no his passion is not so violent as you imagine and if you continue speaking in his favor you only do it with an intent to sooth our friends pain dont torment me in this manner cruel creature cried felicia am i not unfortunate enough already why will you persist in saying such vexatious things to me have you resolved on my death i take heaven to witness replied the prince sighing that i have no such intention you would certainly judge more favorably of my sentiments were they well known to you  felicia fearing it would be taken notice of at the palace that she had been so long abroad returned speedily to her chamber which she no sooner entered but wrote to the count in the following terms  i have now some reason to flatter my self that heaven will soon put a period to my misfortunes since love and generosity have invited you here to your felicia s deliverance how shall i express my joy my affection and my gratitude and when shall i be at liberty to entertain you with my tender sentiments alas what violence did not i do my self in seeing you so near me without speaking to you but how was it possible you could pass by me with such an air of indifference i must confess it very much affected me and if i may tell you my thoughts i almost suspected your fidelity i began to fear you had devoted all your transports to olympia this extremely augmented my uneasiness being an effect of my delicacy which you must pardon let me know how i am to behave my self hereafter in this court and dont neglect any thing to procure us a speedy departure i hope fortune will influence the interest of our hearts and crown our sufferings with eternal felicity   this letter could not be conveyed to the count without some difficulty felicia bid inea read it and conjured her to find means to have it immediately delivered into his hands i cannot think on any way replied inea but to carry it my self your self cried felicia how will you venture to do it leave that to me madam answered inea i will run any risque to serve you this is very generous my dear companion said felicia then thanked her for so obliging an offer and desired her since she was willing to render her so considerable a service not to defer it  olympia was now in the queens apartment and the count in his but being extremely impatient to see his lovely mistress he stepped into the garden in expectation of meeting her it was a fine moonlight night and as he was walking with his thoughts wholly employed on the happiness he promised himself in the possession of a lady for whom he had so transcendent a passion young inea wraped in her white vail accosted him and said read this letter my lord it comes from a person who ought to be dear to you the count opened it and was surpised not to know the writing after having read it over and over without conceiving the meaning it came into his head that it was a jest olympia had imagined to divert her self so said to inea i desire you will tell the beauteous lady from whom i receive this favor that i intend my self to be bearer of the answer  as inea was going back she perceived a woman at a distance covered with her vail who was coming toward her and fearing she should be known by her she passed on the other side of the pallisadoes and went into the long walk where she found felicia who taking her under the arm said to her in a low voice you will think me very impatient to know what the count has said to you but that is not the only reason which brought me hither i was looking out of my chamberwindow waiting your return when i saw a woman cross the garden with great diligence and go as it were toward the counts pavilion i must confess my dear inea it gave me much uneasiness and i made all possible haste to follow her as far as i could distinguish she appeared to me to be olympia and i believe it is her oh inea how my heart aches and in what torment is my mind for fear of losing the object of my love judge more favorably of the count said inea interrupting her he read your letter with an extreme attention and addressing me in very obliging terms assured me he would answer it personally it is very well continued felicia but let us go on without making a noise we may perhaps discover where that person is going whom i mentioned to you in finishing these words they walked on hiding themselves behind the pallisadoes and hearing some body talk in an arbor which was at the end of the alley they drew near  the count of la vagne and olympia were conversing together in this place it is impossible madam said he to his mistress for me to express the despair i was in when i heard of your death and the circumstances which preceded it they so entirely affected me that even life began to be odious to me and never was mortal in a more desolate condition but how transported was i at the unexpected change of fortune when the jeweller who had seen you in the queens apartment informed me that the same beauteous olympia whose loss i was deploring was actually living and at sallee judge  i well conceive my dear count said she interrupting him what might employ your thoughts in two such different occasions as our affection is mutual we sympathize in all the pleasure and torment which derives from our good or bad fortune you may imagine after what i suffered for your supposed death how excessive was my joy when i heard of your safety i have told you already said the count that your illustrious father has given his consent to our happy union receiving my proposals with such extraordinary marks of friendship that i must confess i should have suspected so uncommon a favor were it not that my long sufferings give me a title to so great a reward yes continued he most divine olympia you are now to be mine and i for ever yours as they were speaking in this manner a doleful voice interrupted them which repeating these words i am dying gave em to understand that some person very near the arbor was taken ill this induced them to discontinue their conversation though ever so delightful in order to assist the lady who was complaining so dismally  they looked on every side without perceiving any one but hearing some noise behind the pallisadoes they approached and saw inea holding in her arms felicia in a swoon ah my lord dont come near cried inea weeping your presence would become fatal to felicia and you madam continued she speaking to olympia i beg as a favor she may not see you what aversion can she have to us replied they both at the same time we do not know her and it would be strange she should hate us without cause this is not a proper time to explain matters answered inea all the assistance i desire of you is to run to the palace and send us some help  olympia without making any reply though extremely astonished at what she heard went to give notice to eugenia and some other of the slaves of the condition felicia was in and the mean while the count staid by her no said he to inea i cannot go from you till you have unriddled this secret to me was it not you that just now gave me a letter which i do not understand the meaning of one would think by your air and words that i had disobliged this fair lady but alas how could i have done any thing either to deserve her anger or your reproaches it is impossible replied inea to dissemble better and conceal with more confidence the horridest perfidiousness that man could ever act against a lady of birth and merit dont expect my lord that i will explain things to you which you know better than i the count of la vagne could not have helped laughing at so odd and obscure an answer had not the condition felicia was in inspired him with great compassion and finding inea seemed displeased at his remaining there he resolved to retire  by this time several slaves were come to felicias help and among others eugenia or the disguised prince who seeing her in a swoon expressed his affliction in terms so passionate that his counterfeit was soon discovered unfortunate eugenia cried he in a doleful accent thou art going to be deprived of the only object of thy love felicia my dear felicia to what a sad state are you reduced divinest creature if i lose you my death shall succeed yours since i cannot live without you whilst he was talking in this manner inea and her companions were throwing water on felicias face but as their assistance could not recover her they carried her to her chamber the prince as you may imagine surpassed the rest in attending his sick mistress as soon as she was lain in bed he sat by her and forgetting himself his excessive grief forced from him such expressions as were not becoming his female disguise  the governess of the slaves who watchfully observed every thing took notice of his words and examining earnestly eugenias features discovered prince abelhamars resemblance she ran immediately and related what had passed to the queen who was not a little surpised at this unexpected adventure it was late at night therefore she would not call a council fearing it might alarm the people who were already under great apprehensions from the king of tuniss landing so deferred till next day taking any resolution against the prince  he little knew the danger which threatened him all his thoughts were then employed on the state felicia was in nor could he reflect on any thing more tormenting she scarcely recovered her speech but lamented being restored to a life which at that time all things rendered burdensome to her inea apprehending that the violence of her affliction would force her into such complaints as ought to be concealed told her companions who were present that it was convenient felicia should be left to take a little rest and that eugenia and she would stay by her the others hearing this immediately retired  felicia after they were gone gave an entire course to her excessive grief see inea cried she see what calamities i labor under i am remote from my country out of favor with my family become a slave and betrayed by a man who appeared to me deserving of every thing he is now in love with another it is olympia he is come to deliver this lover whom she impatiently expected and received with so much joy is the same on whom i bestowed my tender care when in a most dangerous condition and my solitude afforded him a refuge from the fury of his enemies he conceived a passion for me engaged me by a thousand promises to make a return and vowed his love should be eternal but heavens how perfidious has he proved i remember now as an evincement he sacrificed olympias picture to me which persuaded me i had seen her resemblance before oh what a sad object am i of fortunes capriciousness here she was silent a long time alas what have i done said she again to deserve at so tender an age such a series of misfortunes yesterday i was deploring the absence of the man i loved this day i lament the loss of his heart her sighs and tears interrupted her several times whilst she was speaking and at last she could say no more the prince flattering himself with some small hopes took this time to speak to her if you were in a a condition to taste the pleasure of revenge said he you would be soon satisfied my arm should second your resentment for it is no longer in my power charming felicia to conceal what my excessive passion for you has made me undertake see at your feet wretched abelhamar your slave here i remain in this palace for your sake although i know that were the queen informed of it my life would atone for my crime compare this proof of my love with that of my unworthy rivals whom you prefer and then you will own your self the most unjust person in the world  oh heavens cried felicia can i believe my eyes what new fatality does attend me you here my lord and an enemy to the queen have you been my confident and caressed me by so many days without my perceiving the deceit alas where shall i go for refuge what must the queen think of me will she not have sufficient reason to suspect my virtue can any one imagine that without my consent you would have made so rash an attempt ah nothing but death can relieve me from my misfortune abelhamars disorder was so great that he did not say much in his justification and as for inea who was present at this scene she could not deny them her compassion she endeavored to excuse him and said to felicia the true respect the prince has for you madam ought in some measure to appease you since no body knows of his being disguised your honor which is dearer to him than his life and the inevitable danger that threatens him if the queen should be informed of what has passed will engage him to keep secret an affair of this importance you are very little acquainted with mankind interrupted felicia who glory in relating their adventures and never love so sincerely as to make any thing a secret well my lord continued she addressing herself to the prince you have made your last efforts to augment my miseries i should have died esteemed by those who know me but at present shall deserve their contempt you may go now to the count of la vagne and tell him that since he has sacrificed me to olympia i have quitted him for you and contrived this criminal disguise to favor your admittance know me better madam replied abelhamar were not my passion for you transcendent i should never deviate from the rules of honor and what i owe you no my felicia you shall never find me guilty of acting any thing that may incur your displeasure yet i cannot help saying you ought no longer to deplore the loss of a man so unworthy your esteem who without dispute has deceived you for it is impossible if he once loved you he could ever love another divine felicia be convinced of the power of your charms and think that i who feel their effects can never change the present situation of affairs gives me hopes of a happy turn in my fortune i may ascend the throne on which my ancestors were seated but oh felicia what pleasure can it afford me to possess a crown without you i entreat you now to grant a request you cannot reasonably refuse me which is to forget your perfidious lover and receive the vows of the most passionate and most constant of mankind if you compare my sentiments with his you will do justice to my sincere passion you shall be delivered from your captivity and shall give laws to the queen whose chains you now wear ah my lord cried felicia in a dejected tone i desire nothing but death therefore give me leave to complain and do not interrupt my grief with proposals which i cannot accept i have not power to forget the traitor who thus neglects me i love him still spite of all the reasons i have to hate him and should i be doomed to sink under my grievous woes or even live to despise the author of my present pain do not think that a crown could invite me ever to believe perfidious man again  abelhamar heard her with an unconceivable anguish and had not strength to make a reply but looked at her with the greatest concern and his sighs interpreted the tormenting motions of his soul felicia was not in a condition to observe the despair this young prince was reduced to but renewed her complaints and nothing could restrain the course of her tears what are you doing madam said inea to her is it possible that a person so charming should regret the loss of a man who even disowns you and abandons you to go away with olympia is it thus he ungratefully repays the obliging sentiments you have for him call revenge to your aid madam forget a man who forsakes you and let your disdain be the reward of his falsity it is easy my dear replied felicia to give advice on such an occasion i would do the same to you were you in my case and i in yours but do you think it is in our power to act as we please when love has once rendered himself master of our inclinations ah cruel rival what torment do you give me and you perfidious count shall not i see you punished for your ingratitude employ my arm madam interrupted the prince and with your consent i will revenge you of your perjured lover i would sooner resolve to die said felicia than yield to so inhuman a proposal the only favor i desire of you my lord which i conjure you not to deny me is that you will leave me you are no longer eugenia you are a prince whom i dare not admit at this time of night into my chamber my peace and honor depend on your compliance think of the danger you expose your self to for a person who can make you no return that is the only misfortune i fear interrupted abelhamar every thing else might be easily surmounted retire my lord replied felicia i am extremely uneasy at your being here the prince perceiving it was in vain to resist withdrew but not without assuring her that although he were to suffer innumerable torments through her indifferency yet his passion should ever be the same  olympia doria all that evening had not found an opportunity to speak to the count of la vagne which made her pass the rest of that night in such an agitation of mind as troubled the joy she ought to have received at so agreeable a change in her fortune what means said she felicias swooning away and ineas anger could they have such motions for a stranger yet the count pretends not to know them and this dissimulation seems to me very criminal how can i tell whether in his travels he did not come acquainted with this young lady and who can assure me they do not love each other these melancholy thoughts tormented her cruelly and the count on his side was not less uneasy fearing olympia would let her self be deceived by appearances for though he could not penetrate into this mystery he saw enough to make him apprehend it might give his mistress some suspicion and as his passion for her invited him to prefer death to her displeasure he impatiently waited for morning to undeceive her  as they had an equal desire to entertain one another they rose early and met on the terracewalk olympia the better to know the counts sentiments endeavored to conceal her uneasiness but her melancholy soon discovered her secret thoughts the count also appeared so dejected that one might easily imagine what passed in his soul he broke silence first and asked her how she had reposed to which she answered with indifferency that she had rested very ill without knowing the cause here olympias sighs interrupted her discourse ah madam said the count prostrating himself at her feet do not let me be long uncertain of my destiny you are not the same you were yesterday what have i done to deserve from you so cold a reception i have not resolution enough to be silent replied olympia though it was my design it is unjust to harbor suspicions of the person one loves without coming to an eclaircisement tell me my lord do you still love felicia i say still because after what has passed i have no reason to doubt but you once had a passion for her the count would not let olympia persevere in an error which was to the prejudice of his honor he scon by his protestations persuaded her of the contrary then offered to go with her to justify himself before felicia and inea i believe you my lord said she without such a proof since i had much rather you should not see em any more the queen has consented to our leaving this place therefore let us go for the approach of the king of tunis terrifies me it would be very unfortunate should we find our selves besieged here at a time that my father is disposed to favor us let us depart replied the transported count there is nothing i wish so much i have a ship now ready to sail for italy and only waits for a favorable wind may heavens protect our voyage and bring me to my long wished for happiness come madam added he dispose all things for your departure every moment will seem to me an age till hymen has crowned my love with the union of our destinies  these endearing expressions highly pleased olympia who immediately went to the queen and obtained leave to embark celima at the same time restored to their liberty the young slaves that were taken with olympia then presented her with her picture set round with diamonds of great value and repeated to her what she had already said in behalf of the count of la vagne withal that at another time she should have been very glad to see him olympia having returned her acknowledgments in a most respectful manner went into the slaves apartment where she chose the ladies i mentioned and took her leave of the rest who by their tears and caresses showed the particular affection they had for her as she doubted whether it were proper to see felicia she desired the governess of the slaves to acquaint her with her departure but at the name of olympia and the news of her going away she fetched a shriek and made such complaints as would have inspired the hardest heart with pity olympia hearing this would not aggravate her pain by her presence and though she passionately wished to entertain felicia that she might know from her whether the count of la vagne was sincere in what he had told her yet she was no ways willing to satisfy her self at the expense of so amiable a person  the count was expecting olympia with impatience when she came to tell him the favors she had received from the queen who ordered some of her officers to accompany them to the ship the mean while felicia oppressed with sorrow continued lamenting with inea i have no hopes left said she to her my fate is decreed the ungrateful count of la vagne is now going off and i shall lose him for ever he flies me and carries with him the object of his love the barbarian could see me dying without being touched nay he even denied me his pity and the deplorable condition that perfidious man has reduced me to has not cost him a sigh ah leave me and let me die with grief and shame dont indulge your affliction madam interrupted inea think only that he who leaves you is unworthy of the tears you shed reflect on his ingratitude and it will be an effectual way to forget him you are deceived if you believe it said felicia sighing when one is inspired with a passion the loss of its object wholly employs our thoughts i protest to you with some confusion that all the good qualities i knew in that inconstant lover appear to me now with greater luster though i can no longer doubt of his infidelity or my misfortune and to let you see more of my weakness i have a pressing desire to write to him in hopes my reproaches might move him what madam interrupted inea could you receive his devoirs again after such an injurious proceeding alas replied felicia what are not we capable of acting to recall a heart whose possession is dear to us then dont add to my pain i too well comprehend what you think and blush to see my honor concerned but consider i am an unhappy distracted creature my dear i conjure you in the name of your faithful don ramire to find some person that will deliver a letter to the count of la vagne you cannot confer a greater obligation on me inea who was very willing to serve felicia left her immediately in order to make an attempt but soon after she returned and told her it was impossible to send any body to the port that the queen had either received news of ismaels approach or that something extraordinary was passing at court since she had commanded the guards of her palace to be doubled and the gates to be shut that none might be admitted without her order  then i must lose all hopes cried unfortunate felicia for i can neither stop him nor follow him just heaven revenge me on that perjured man punish his perfidiousness punish the cause of this last misfortune may the angry waves swallow them up and let me hear the news of their loss soon after that of their departure but alas am i capable of forming wishes so contrary to my inclination no i have loved the count too well ever to hate him then let him live and be happy all my fury ought to be turned against my self for i deserve the miseries i now linger in had i instead of leaving my fathers house submitted to his commands i should not at present have the cruel mortification of reproaching my self with an imprudent conduct which i never shall be able to justify to the world while felicia is thus deploring the cruelty of her fortune we must return to the prince of carency  casilda had maliciously persuaded him that benavidez was gone with leonida to jaen where he would be sure as she said of the governors protection a man must certainly have as much valor as love to attempt any thing against a person who was protected by the governor of so considerable a place but the violence of his passion and extremity of his despair together would not permit him to reflect even on the greatest of dangers  wherever he passed people observed something extraordinary in him and though his eyes expressed much grief his noble mein carried marks of the highest distinction he made the strictest enquiry after felicia of leon whom sometimes he called leonida of velasco but when he described her to those he applied to he was so lavish in her praise that they easily discovered he was her lover  notwithstanding all his care and diligence his pursuit was in vain for she had not passed that way nor could any one give him the least intelligence concerning her he began to be very uneasy and hurrying from one thought to another his mind was filled with his past misfortunes till he came to jaen where he arrived exceeding melancholy he looked on the citadel of that town as a place where his life and disasters were to be terminated here said he here i expect to see the ungrateful beauty i adore and before her eyes i will attack the ungenerous man who next her self had the first place in my heart what a strange destiny is this cried he my mistress and my friend equally betray me and to satisfy my resentment i must destroy the one to wound the other it is probable they are this fatal hour contriving my ruin and giving each other fresh assurances of eternal love but my death must confirm their felicity for whilst i am living they have a cruel enemy who will endeavor to defeat their projects and ever trouble the happiness they propose  at his arrival he had a mind to go directly to the citadel for as i told you before he had accepted of a letter from the governor of carmona to his son don gabriel d aguillar by whose interest he was sure of an easy entrance into the place but he thought it was better first to send to him and the mean time inform himself of what passed there as he was going through the town he met a french chevalier of the house of boucicault his name was alphonso a person of an obliging temper who came to seville with the count of la march what do i see is it you my lord cried he coming up to the prince with a great deal of joy and respect are you living whom we so much lamented with the prince your brother believing you were assassinated near carmona as it was reported in spain and for which we were meditating a proportionable revenge i should have been happy my dear alphonso said the prince had my enemys designs been effected but i am reserved for greater calamities yet i desire my name may be kept secret for important reasons which engage me to conceal it and you can be very serviceable to me i am in love and betrayed and must revenge my self on my rival and my mistress oh how i shall load felicia with my just reproaches she is now in the citadel with him what you say is true my lord interrupted alphonso i know it from don gabriel d aguillar who is one of my particular friends felicia is confined against her will in an apartment where she sees no body but by the means of the spanish captain i have already mentioned one night without being perceived i saw her sadly deploring her fate oh my lord how young and handsome she is i must confess i extremely pity her  do you pity her said the prince with a deep sigh have you any compassion for her ah you are little acquainted with her perfidiousness but tell me what means that manner of confinement did not you see her come here with don fernand benavidez the governors nephew no replied alphonso the person you name has not appeared here since my arrival for as i am every day at the citadel i should probably have seen him yet if he be there he certainly keeps himself concealed ah the traitor cried the prince he is only hid for felicias sake and without doubt has desired a guard to protect him from my resentment the villain has sufficient reason to fear me it is dangerous to insult a desperate man who does not value his life this thought made the prince fly into so violent a passion that alphonso begged of him to retire from the place where they were standing for fear they might be observed  the prince said to him if you will prevent my committing any extravagancies you must second the desire i have of seeing benavidez and felicia i have a letter for don gabriel daguillar who i am glad to hear is your friend you will oblige me extremely in sending instantly to him that we may take necessary measures for that purpose alphonso promised the prince every thing that depended on him even at the hazard of his life then left him to execute his orders  whatever enquiry alphonso and don gabriel made before they came to the prince they could learn nothing satisfactory those to whom they applied concerning don fernand benavidez told em they believed he was at villareal but that he was not nephew to don alonzo fajardo and that no body had seen him at jaen where hardly any one knew him when they brought this account to the prince he could not believe em since felicia is in the citadel interrupted he it is a certain consequence benavidez is not far do you only contrive that i enter her apartment it is likely he will come there when every body is retired don gabriel told him he should be obeyed then went to receive orders from the governor who named him for felicias guard at night he came back to the prince to conduct him and alphonso to the citadel  now can any mortal imagine the trouble this amorous prince was in when he thought he was sure to see the object he still adored he resolved his rival should perish though he himself were to fall with him which violent reflection made him sigh deeply especially when he considered that this same felicia was leonida of velasco to whom he was so strictly engaged that his honor would not suffer any other to carry her off  he was in this confusion of thought where love and revenge were equally concerned when don gabriel conducted him through several courts till at last he brought him to the tower where felicia was concealed in a low apartment the windows were barred with irongrates and the weather being excessive hot she had obtained leave to walk on the leads of the tower for the air the prince took that opportunity to enter a closet which was only shut with a glass door and there hid himself behind the window curtain from whence he could see all that passed he was not there long before the lights were taken away and he heard two persons creep into the closet they spoke very low and the night being dark he could not distinguish whether they were men or women soon after they went out of the closet where the prince thought himself alone but the lights being brought in again he saw several women who were preparing a bath they hung a canopy of rosecolourd satin embroidered with silver over a large black marble vessel which they filled with water and flowers mixed with the finest perfumes  every thing being ready a lady came in to whom the rest of the women showed much respect but he could not see her face her head being covered with a fine veil this was felicia who having undressed her self to a thin nightgown ordered all her women to retire excepting zaida then called for her lute saying music only can sooth my dear afflictions ah zaida zaida could he for whom i suffer hear these verses how pleased should i be soon after she sung the ensuing words with so sweet a voice that none could hear her without being enchanted  why should virtue thus torment me oh unkind and cruel law or why should fantastic duty strike my tender heart with awe   love take pity of my anguish to my soft distress be kind never let the fair one languish when to tenderness inclined she repeated the last stanza several times and fetched now and then deep sighs which showed her heart was possessed with a mighty passion as well as excessive grief the prince all this while perceived it was not the voice of his unconstant felicia or at least was surpised that the small distance which was between them should cause so great an alteration in her tone as not to know it again do not afflict your self madam said zaida great passions are ever influenced by fortune he whom you love is at present informed of what you suffer do you think he will attempt nothing to evince you of his affection felicia made no reply but ordered her to shut her chamber door and went into the bath how entirely do i love you cruel leonida said the amorous prince to himself but oh ungrateful woman ought not i to be ashamed of my weakness for let me look upon you as a person to whom i am contracted or as a mistress i love to distraction you have equally deceived me under the titles of carency and la vagne ah perfidious creature you are now proposing to surmount all difficulties in order to marry benavidez could there be a complaint more passionate than that which you just now uttered but continued he what must i believe are her designs traversed here i see her a prisoner in a place where she thought to find a sanctuary she even regrets the absence of her lover and every thing seems to disappoint their expectations  such were the princes reflections and in spite of his resentment love still triumphed in his heart but in what surprise was he when zaida opening the door of another closet he drew the curtain and saw a man going with precipitation to the bathing vessel where he put himself on his knees and spoke so low that his voice could not reach the prince who only heard felicia cry aloud is it you my dear lover then she swooned away  the prince of carency seeing this could no longer refrain but without thinking on the consequence of the scene he was going to open ran out of the closet like a madman and had he been capable of taking any base advantage it was in his power to run him he took for benavidez through the body before the other could even put himself in a posture of defense for felicias swoon had such an extraordinary effect upon him that he did not see the prince who was just at his back till hearing some body threatening him with a furious tone he rose and drew his sword but the prince seeing his face immediately dropped the point of his knowing him to be don alonzo eldest son to the infanta don fernand he had seen him at seville when he was there with his brother the count of la march and the fine qualities of this young prince had engaged the prince of carency to have a great esteem for him he cast his eyes on her whom he took for leonida and knew her to be dona felicia d ayala daughter to the great chancellor of castille who was highly distiguishd by his birth and renowned for the histories of don pedro and don henriquez kings of spain which he had written this grandee being dead felicia was brought up with the two princesses daughters to the infanta don fernand don alonzo who saw her often conceived so great a passion for her that every one suspected he would marry her privately and to prevent so unequal a match whilst don alonzo was one day a hunting the infanta his father had ordered that felicia should be secretly conveyed to jean where she was to be carefully guarded all the women who attended her were at the infantas devotion and by the death of the chancellor her father she was delivered up entirely to the persecutions of those who envied her as for zaida she was a slave whom felicia had made a christian and one they did not mistrust not reflecting she had been presented to her by don alonso this young prince at his return to seville was in a despairing condition when he heard his mistress was gone and though he learned but very confusedly the manner of her being carried off and confined in a strong place yet invited by his passion he day and night used his utmost endeavor to recover her having at last discovered his dear felicias concealment and found means to write to zaida who answered his letter the affair was so well managed that without felicias knowledge he got into her apartment  the prince of carency perceiving his error in order to repair it presented don alonso with his sword the point toward his own breast punish an unhappy man said he whom you will oblige in taking away his life by my words you may judge of the concern i am in for having disturbed this charming interview which to obtain it is probable my lord you have exposed your self to some danger but be assured i suffer more than you through this mistake i do not resent it in the least my lord replied don alonzo embracing him and if you will promise to keep this secret you shall ever find me a grateful friend the prince of carency gave him his word he would never take the least notice of what had happened and without staying till felicia was come to her self he left the chamber in so deep a despair that he could scarcely speak to gabriel d aguilar who was at the door of the first room with alphonso and this last attended him to don gabriels apartment who was obliged to remain in his post  the prince having an opportunity of yielding himself up to his just sorrow called to mind all his misfortunes from his first appearing in the world to that moment on whatever side he turned his eyes he saw so little hopes of an intermission that every thing became indifferent to him and he did not even wish himself a better fortune all his thoughts were fixed on being revenged of benavidez which he fancied was the only satisfaction he could receive but as it appeared almost impossible it extremely added to his grief oh alphonso said he can any disappointment be equal to this i was in hopes to punish a traitor and recover my mistress but that fatal name of felicia has again deceived me what unaccountable circumstances have attended my life fate has singled me amongst all mankind to be unfortunate where must i go to find the treasure i have lost alas my leonida is not here and i discover too late casildas wicked plot how could i believe that she would have told me where her brother was gone if i had made the least reflection i might have expected she would deceive me ah credulous wretch that i was i have lost an opportunity i shall never retrieve again just heaven my rival is now safe with leonida and he peaceably enjoys a blessing which belongs to me can i after this survive my shame and despair in short the princes condition was such that nothing could give him relief his complaints were moving and love appeared in all his actions  alphonso who knew by experience the torments that attend transcendent passions extremely pitied this unhappy prince oh love cried he will you never cease persecuting us you alone cause all our misfortunes and never grant a favor that is not preceded by a thousand disappointments ah why have we no fence against your power the prince whilst he was talking continued in a deep silence and alphonso finding he was not disposed to converse with him meditated some time then wrote these verses  love thou dear but cruel tyrant can nothing move thee to be kind hear my sighs and see my torment for only thou can ease my mind   since all are doomed to feel thy darts at least suspend our pains with tender pity bless those hearts that languish in thy chains the prince read these lines and said one could have no room to complain if in love there were an equal mixture of pleasure and pain but alas i have experienced that all its ills are reserved for me which makes me wish a period to my unhappy life ah my lord interrupted alphonso do not harbor a thought so offensive to your courage it is unworthy a soul so great as yours should yield to a passion which will divert you from the performance of great exploits the prince blushed at what alphonso said and looked on this discourse as a reproach made him for the time he had employed in entertaining his amorous sentiments you shall see by my conduct replied he that my soul is still my own i love it is true and cannot flatter myself with ever being disengaged from a passion which has so great an empire over me yet when honor calls me i am ready to attend and if i must give up my life it shall be in so glorious a way as will do honor to my name  here they where both silent some time till the prince urged by disagreeable thoughts broke out into his usual complaints oh alphonso said he which way shall i direct my course to find leonida i cannot hear where she is must i then turn knight errant and run through the world without knowing where to go no i have a nobler resolution i will return to seville and there follow my brothers fortune if we engage the moors i must conquer or bravely die  alphonso overjoyed to hear the prince speak in these terms applauded a design so worthy of him consider my lord said he that all you could do at present for leonida would meet with no return for since she flies you it is proable you are the object of her aversion at least her going off with benavidez is a proof she loves him and is perfidious to you what can you then expect from her rather strive to deface the impression she has made that in time you may even lose the remembrance of having ever known her i ought to take your advice indeed interrupted the prince but alas how is it possible fortune may be inconstant but my heart can never change thus irresolute not knowing what to determine he conjured alphonso not to discover who he was nor acquaint the count of la march with his being at jaen till he had fixed a resolution the chevalier promised him upon honor to keep the secret inviolably and begged he would not be uneasy on that subject  whilst these things passed in relation to the prince of carency the count of la march his brother neglected no opportunity of signalizing himself he had not been long at seville when the moors besieged baeca with seven thousand horse and a hundred thousand foot so formidable an army struck terror throughout andalusia but as the place was well fortified the moors despaired of its reduction when they received advice that the spaniards from all parts were assembled in order to relieve it therefore they suddenly retired loaded with the plunder of the neighboring villages they were not more fortunate at sea where they had considerable losses by the spanish fleet which had engaged theirs and gained a complete victory this advantage gave no small satisfaction to the spaniards who now thought of acting offensively the infanta called a general council of all the officers of the army where it was resolved to besiege zahara the besieged defended the town bravely till the want of necessaries made em capitulate soon after he took another of their strongest places which so exasparated mahomet king of granada that he immediately thought on revenge and in order to carry on his design put himself at the head of six thousand horse and eighty thousand foot dividing them into several bodies which took different routs for their march and all on a sudden besieged jaen whilst they thought him employed elsewhere  his approach surpised the governor who was not prepared for a siege and would have been under greater difficulties were he not assisted by the prince of carency who had not yet left the town and was rejoiced to have so fine an occasion of distinguishing himself he had been presented to alonzo fajardo under the title of count of la vagne and having offered his services to him the other readily accepted of em this young prince put himself at the head of a detachment and by his frequent sallies often broke the enemies measures and repulsed em where ever he appeared carrying death and terror along with him as his neglect of life made him expose himself to the greatest dangers he became dreadful to his enemies who knowing him by his arms chose rather to avoid his blows than resist him the governor of jaen admired his courage and thought heaven had sent him to defend that city against the infidels  the king of the moors enraged at his ill success and attributing the cause to the prince of carency whom they called the knight of the black arms ordered some of the bravest of his army either to kill or take him prisoner so immediately the generals and most of the noblemen made a league to be revenged of this terrible enemy or perish in the attempt a detachment was sent out the next day much superior to that under the princes command nevertherless he attacked them and his courage surpassed all that can be imagined the moors were beginning to repent their rash undertaking when unluckily the princes horse was wounded by an arrow and before he could disengage himself they rushed upon him with a shout and took him prisoner this news ran through the camp and soon found way into the town where it had a different effect mahomet thought now he had conquered and the governor believed himself overcome the barbarians were resolved to make a general assault and the christians were preparing to defend themselves though most of the soldiers were mightily disheartened saying to one another what can we pretend to we have lost the count of la vagne commanded by him we might have defeated our enemies but his misfortune is the presage of ours  at this time the infanta omitted nothing for the succor of jaen he assembled his troops with great diligence and marched toward the town with the count of la march where he surpised the moors who retired with more shame than glory satisfying themselves with burning and pillaging wherever they passed the spaniards pursued them as far as malaga which they besieged in their turn the infanta was informed by don alonso fajardo of the young count of la vagnes being taken prisoner by mahomet as for his friend alphonso he was killed in one of the engagements which was the cause that the count of la march heard nothing of the prince of carencys being there the mighty character of his bravery and the recital of the great actions he had performed gave the infanta a particular concern for his misfortune he sent an officer with proposals for the exchange of prisoners and offered a ransom for the count of la vagne being willing to purchase his liberty at any rate but all he could do to get him out of his enemies power was in vain the moors made answer that the count having bribed his guards had made his escape and that were he still in their hands they would readily send him back to show how desirous they were to oblige the infanta  the king of granada in the mean time was of opinion that he could not too strictly guard a person who had been very troublesome to him during the siege therefore policy and revenge having an equal share in this design he ordered that the prince though dangerously wounded should be conveyed to the castle of solobrena where his brother prince joseph with his two sons mahomet and osmin were kept prisoners so the prince of carency found himself a second time in the power of the infidels but his sentiments were quite different from those he had at nicopolis for that which at another time would have given him much chagrin had now very little effect on him all his thoughts being only employed on leonida and every thing else below his consideration yet it was an unhappy state for a man to love an object whom he thought guilty of the greatest perfidiousness  whilst this was the state of affairs in upper andalusia and murcia celima queen of fez was taking measures to be revenged of abelhamar felicia had but just obliged him to leave her chamber when the queen impatient to have her designs executed caused him to be seized by a captain of her guards who carried him immediately to a tower adjoining the palace and having posted a guard at every gate to hinder people from coming near the queen went to him soon after  abelhamar did not appear the least surpised at his confinement he said to this princess my sentiments madam are not unknown to you since you are informed of the love i have for felicia i have not acted any thing contrary to the allegiance and respect i owe you and though you find me disguised in your palace it would not consist with justice to draw an ill consequence from an action that is only the effect of my passion to which you can impute no other crime but that of indiscretion i know too well your intentions interrupted the queen in a fierce tone to let myself be deceived by your wit or metamorphosis no prince you were here conspiring against me the rebellious principles you were brought up in could never receive a grateful sentiment or teach you what you owe your sovereign have i not preserved your life without regard to the reasons of state which ought to have induced me to sacrifice you yet ungrateful as you are have you lived hitherto with the hopes of making me a victim cruel ismael also seconds your design and has promised you forces in order to dethrone me you prefer a stranger to a queen of your own blood to whom you owe every thing but heaven that protects me has put me in a condition to punish you and be revenged of my enemies satisfy yourself madam replied the prince with a haughty air and dont slight so fine an opportunity of taking away a life which is odious to you paint my innocence in the vilest colors or rather say the legal right i have to the crown you wear is my only crime and that as you have ever born an invincible hatred to the unhappy remainders of my family you have resolved to complete what your unjust father had begun rash man cried celima do you think of what you are saying dare you pronounce these words before the queen your mistress dont you know your death waits my command is it thus you endeavor to justify your self and appease me you dont consider the danger you are in abelhamar made no reply to her threats nor gave the least attention to her whilst she was speaking but rather acted like one who despising mercy did not regret the life he was going to be deprived of which unconcerned behavior surpised the queen who retired full of resentment  celima had already given orders that felicia and inea should be strictly guarded in their chambers and that none of their companions should be admitted to them this new misfortune did not add to felicias concern for every thing was now become so indifferent to her that she did not even enquire into the cause  the queen being returned to the palace called her council and appointed persons to examine the prince because she would show some form in an affair which might draw upon her the aversion of her relations and particularly that of the maliquez alabez who were also descended from the ancient kings of fez and at that time very potent in the kingdom of granada this induced her to give the blackest colors to the crime with which they were going to charge abelhamar and though she took the best measures to conceal the design she had against him yet his faithful mula who was just returned from tunis where he had carried credentials to ismael from the prince used his utmost application to serve him he had to good a correspondence in the palace not to be informed of every thing that passed there in relation to the unfortunate prince and as he perceived the occasion was pressing he would lose no time to give immediate assistance to his master who otherways would fall a sacrifice to celima he went to all abelhamars friends and slaves and prepared them to assemble in order to raise the city in his favor by which means he hoped to restore him to his liberty or put all to fire and sword that would oppose it these were his resolutions till he reflected that the queen had a great many creatures devoted to her service as well as a strong garrison and that the people being used to her government would strive to maintain it therefore he thought it more prudent to return to tunis and apply himself to ismael who would employ his utmost power in this important affair so he set out again from sallee and soon arrived at ismaels court  his grief and affection furnished him with expressions of so great a force that the king of tunis was extremely touched at abelhamars misfortunes and being already exasperated against celima he resolved immediately to assist that prince with this intent he ordered his troops to be drawn out of their garrisons and reviewed then sent an ambassador to the king of morocco to renew his treaty of alliance with him to prevent that prince in his absence from making any irruptions into his territories  after having disposed every thing with as much wisdom as diligence he opened the campaign and mula returned privately to sallee to perform what he had first resolved for the safety of his master  the young prince being examined refused at first to make a reply but when they told him unless he answered to the accusation he should receive sentence the sooner it obliged him to make a defense in expectation of being relieved by ismael and whatever mind the queen had to forward his trial she could not proceed to a condemnation without exposing herself to inevitable dangers the first officers of the crown and lords of the court represented to her that she could not take too much precaution in an affair of this importance and that it would be more to her glory to let clemency take place of justice we believe the prince is culpable said they since he was found disguised in the palace which is a sufficient proof yet without regard to his youth as he is presumptive heir to the crown and of your blood madam he ought to have some respect shown him therefore we beg that your majesty for your own interest will consider these reasons separately and by suspending your resentment show mercy to the prince  the queen was displeased at a request which showed that abelhamar had more friends than she imagined and fearing they should take measures to rescue her prisoner she would no longer consult reason but resolved to do every thing by her own authority without taking any advice of her council so having prevented those appointed to judge the prince she herself pronounced the sentence of his death and to deter seditious persons from caballing against her she ordered that he should be executed on the platform of the court wherein he was confined that every body might see him suffer  in this place they built a scaffold hung with mourning and set round with standards and scutcheons which with other dismal preparations drew numbers of spectators the prince was soon after informed of his fate this news at first very much surpised him his eyes expressed an extraordinary grief and he was some time without speaking at last lifting up his hands oh heaven he cried you know my disguise was not criminal and that this is only a pretext the unjust queen takes to destroy me but since you have decreed my doom i am ready to obey without repining and if celima grants me one favor i shall die with content then turning himself to the captain of the guards he said go tell the queen from me that i beg leave to bid an eternal adieu to charming felicia the minutes i shall pass with her will be too short to retard the inhuman designs of celima  the officer went directly to the queen who was very unwilling to grant the prince his request but her ministers having represented to her in respectful terms how cruel it would be to refuse so small a satisfaction to a person in his condition she at last consented that felicia should be brought to him she was till then a stranger to the princes misfortune being strictly confined with inea and as her confinement did not in the least disturb her she never enquired why they added this new rigor to her captivity her mind was entirely taken up with the count of la vagne and the tears she shed were only for his inconstancy and absence every thing else that happened had no effect on her and she was in this disposition when she was sent for by the queens orders she followed the governess of the slaves without asking any question inea supported her and being very weak after her illness it was with a vast deal of difficulty that she reached the tower  the first object that struck her sight was the scaffold and a number of guards which gave her room to believe that she was going to be a victim to celimas jealousy ineas thoughts were the same which extremely terrified her felicias sentiments were different from hers for though death appeared hard to her yet she had some sort of satisfaction in seeing the approaching end of her misfortunes take courage my dear inea said she embracing her with a great deal of tenderness the danger only regards me and i look upon it with indifferency it is a remedy my preservation commanded me not to seek but since it is my fate i receive it with pleasure i am going to die and shall no longer have a sense of my calamities no lovely felicia cried the prince who was near enough to hear what she said you are not to die this punishment is prepared for unfortune abelhamar who now takes his last leave of you i protest it less concerns me to lose my life in so shameful a manner than to want assurances of your favor ah madam added he with an air full of love and grief can you refuse me a look a sigh or a favorable word you see i perish and my misfortune proceeds from your transcendent charms the desire i had to see you reign made me endeavor to ascend the throne from which my father fell you inspired me with an ambition i should have managed better had i been less in love you are the innocent cause of the disguise i am reproached with which is thought my crime yet i have nothing to repent of since my passion invites me to bear the cruelty of my fate but at least give me leave divine felicia to believe that had my design succeeded my respect and perseverance would have made some impression on you only approve these thoughts and i shall not think much to purchase so dear a profession with the loss of my life  felicia at these words was so disordered that she looked some time at abelhamar without having power to speak she was touched with a sincere compassion and deplored the misfortune of this young prince who was going to be sacrificed so ignominiously she could have wished the queens resentment had fallen on her for the state of her affairs with the count of la vagne was such as had rendered life so insupportable to her that she seemed very willing to resign it at last perceiving abelhamar waited her answer she said is this scene prepared for you my lord alas why cannot i relieve you my tears are the only proofs i can give of my true concern yet be assured i shall never be so ungrateful as to forget your favors this days disaster will ever be before my eyes ah felicia replied the prince i thought your compassion would have inspired me with courage but i find it has a contrary influence oh that i could now live for you the hopes you have given me make me extremely regret leaving you since i must leave you for ever here his breast was oppressed with so deep a sorrow that he could only express it by his repeated sighs the queen who was impatient to have the prince executed had ordered that felicia should be called away from him when of a sudden she was alarmed hearing at the gates of the palace the shouts and cries of people in arms who were commanded by valiant mula and had already charged the soldiers of the guard they demanded the prince and threatened celima with a general revolt unanimously calling abelhamar their king and saying they had cause to fear a queen who was cruel enough to wash her hands in the blood of her nearest relation and that if she denied their request they would deliver her up to the punishment which she had designed for the prince  the queen would not have given much attention to the menaces of these seditious people had she not been informed that there were thick clouds of dust seen toward the road of tunis and that the sentinels who had already heard a confused noise of warlike instruments began to discover from the walls of the town a body of men marching with great precipitation soon after they came to acquaint her that there was a herald at the gate who desired admittance to her majesty in the name of ismael this news struck the queen with terror which she expressed by her emotions being divided between revenge and despair her ministers pressed her to give audience to the king of tituans herald and after being a little composed she consented to see him he brought her a letter which was in these terms  i am come to succor abelhamar who is a prince favored by heaven and our great prophet mahomet therefore you must deliver him up to me consider inhuman queen that you have neither arms nor subjects to support you i am informed of every thing that passes in the palace which i protest i will reduce to ashes unless you immediately restore the prince to his liberty but if you send him to me or hostages for his security i will favor your retreat you may leave the kingdom and take with you such attendance as you shall think necessary  ismael sultan   celimas fortune could hardly receive a greater change she now saw at the gates of her capital an enemy who treated her like a conqueror that was just going to dethrone her the soul of this imperious princess grew so furious at ismaels menaces that instead of thinking of the danger she was in her mind was only taken up with revenge come cried she barbarian come and be witness of my courage and resentment the man you intend to redeem shall be sacrificed before your eyes if heaven and earth should join and the elements return to their first chaos what is it to me i have but a life to lose which has been a burden to me these many years let us go and strike off this rebellious head which is so dear to ismael and send it to him from the height of the tower follow me said she to the herald who waited her answer come and see how i slight the threats of your master you shall witness the death of abelhamar and receive his last sighs ending these words she went hastily toward the place where her commands were only expected for his execution but the mufty the admiral and governor of the town with several of her faithful subjects flung themselves at her feet alas madam said they consider the misfortune which seems to point at you personally are you resolved to bury your self in the ruins of the palace that must certainly be your fate if you irritate a king who is before your walls with a potent army this is no time madam to revenge your self for in putting the prince to death it may raise a mutiny and should ismael take advantage of it you may lose your life or become captive to the conqueror is it not more glorious madam to fly and seek in another country some forces who encouraged by your presence may replace you on your throne  the queens women in tears prostrated themselves at her feet and said all that zeal and fear could inspire at last her imperious heart was touched rather at the danger she exposed so many persons to who depended on her than at what concerned her own person must the queen of fez submit cried she and seek her safety in a shameful flight which will cause her to blush the rest of her days oh heavens was ever destiny so wretched as mine i shall become a fugitive and banished my kingdom be forced to beg refuge of those whom i once could have protected i cannot think i deserve so cruel a fate here she continued her complaints and whilst she yielded to her excessive grief abelhamar was informed of the agreeable change in his fortune  he was entertaining felicia when they came to tell him that ismaels ships and forces were approaching think with what transports he received this news it is now madam said he to her that i can return the goodness you just now expressed your virtues have made a deep impression on me and since i am delivered from death you shall no longer feel the weight of your chains i rejoice my lord replied felicia to see that the danger is past and conjure you not to give your self any uneasiness about me i am born to be unhappy and the rigor of my captivity is nothing when compared to my inward pain farewell my lord you have now affairs of greater importance to employ your thoughts finishing these words she retired and abelhamar remained in the tower by order of the queen who sent hostages to ismael with assurances that the prince should be set at liberty as soon as she had left the city  unfortunate celima was now preparing a fleet and transports to carry away her most valuable goods she gave instructions to those persons whom she could not take along with her and having disposed every thing according to her intention she made all imaginable diligence to depart not depending on ismaels words and fearing the consequences of abelhamars resentment thus the fugitive queen went off by night with her women and slaves and was conducted to the vessel which attended her she ordered immediately to set sail with the rest of the fleet and the wind being fair they soon entered the mediterranean nothing could be equal to the concern celima was in for the loss of her kingdom she fetched deep sighs and in spite of all her pride could not restrain her tears fortune ungrateful fortune said she your capriciousness spares neither king nor subject who can flatter himself with being above your reach you declared your self my enemy from my infancy and pursued me in the remotest countries once taken by a pyrate i fell into the power of bajazet soon after you made use of cupids arrows to pierce my heart alas that wound i never can hope to cure at last to show your self more favorable you placed me on a throne which you now force me to abandon what must i expect from you next why dont you strike me at once with your most poisoned darts that i may not be exposed to new torments oh deplorable fate shall i thus be for ever persecuted and you felicia continued she casting her melancholy eyes on leonida who was near her you are the author of my last misfortune it is your fatal beauty that has been the occasion of this revolution ah how can you evince me that you are innocent alas madam replied felicia i had no hand in the princes criminal designs for if it be true that he had a passion for me it was contrary to my inclination i knew nothing of his disguise nor did i ever flatter him with any hopes on the contrary my aversion was the only return i made to his addresses and from the first hour he declared his sentiments for me i resolved never to change i was informed said celima that the count of la vagne who came to fetch away olympia had given you much uneasiness without doubt he is the person you love but you are convinced he has no longer a passion for you and since he has no regard to your affection you ought to disdain him these words put felicia into some confusion who blushing cast down her eyes without being able to utter one word and her beauteous cheeks moistened with tears sufficiently expressed the state of her anxious soul you make me no answer said celima fetching a sigh ah i am better able to answer for you i was willing to see whether your tongue could betray your heart or disown a distemper you cannot cure alas felicia i know too well by fatal experience the irresistible power of love which unhappily surpised me before i could suppress its first motions or even think how dangerous they might prove  if there are torments in love madam said felicia they ought not to affect a sovereign whom nature has graced with such transcendent perfections nothing but death or absence can deprive you of the object that is dear to you inconstancy which surpasses either in cruelty can never make you feel the tormenting effects of it ah felicia replied celima there is no pain like that which is occasioned by absence since it keeps us in continual fears both of death and infidelity at least madam said felicia there is one comfort in it which is that having but an uncertain knowledge of the truth we are generally inclined to believe what we most wish no continued celima it is not as you imagine uncertainty in love is a martyrdom which adds to all the pains we can endure alas madam replied felicia i should now look on that uncertain state as a happy one since i might derive from it the pleasing hopes which my present condition entirely destroys  the sovereign and her charming slave were entertaining each other with discourses of this quality and though celimas familiarity was very great yet felicia was ever mindful of the respect due to her night was far advanced before they took any rest but at last their eyes yielded to what nature required and celima had been asleep some hours when she was awaked by the noise of seamen and soldiers the former were preparing against a storm which threatened em and the latter for an engagement with abelhamar whose ships they had just discovered  you must know that as soon as the queen of fez had set out for the kingdom of granada the gates of sallee and the palace were opened to the king of tituan who immediately went to the tower where the young prince was prisoner but the latter being already set at liberty he came to meet the king with the greatest marks of joy and gratitude for his happy deliverance after abelhamar had employed some time in giving the king as obliging a reception as that juncture would permit he could not forbear going to the apartment which belonged to the queens slaves thinking to find felicia there for those who guarded him in his confinement had not informed him of her being embarked with celima  but you may imagine how great was his surprise not to meet any women there and to see every thing in disorder this giving him some suspicion he proceeded to the queens apartments which were open and quite empty so that he had no longer room to doubt of the loss of his felicia he ran up and down like a distracted man and expressed his excessive grief in such terms as extremely moved all that were with him have i then lost you felicia cried he my charming felicia have i lost you at a time that i was flattered with the hopes of a perfect felicity the compassion you showed for me when i was expecting immediate death was an evincement of the disposition you were in to do me justice and had you not been compelled to fly me i am inclined to believe you would no longer refuse me your affection but oh my felicia they have snatched you from me and my raging passion is the only thing i have left in your cruel absence go mula continued he go tell the king he has done nothing for me i am ready to give him up that life which he has preserved and i conjure him to take it from me or restore me my mistress but what do i say she is not in his power then let him give me his ships to pursue her  mula obeyed his commands and went to ismael whilst some persons who remained with the prince were giving him an account with how much precipitation the queen went off and that she had set sail for the kingdom of granada abelhamar whose impatience was great would not wait mulas return but ran to ismael who readily granted him all he desired so having chosen some of the kings best ships and swiftest sailers he pursued celima whose fleet he knew was neither considerable in strength or number though he did not reflect that his squadron was still inferior having put to sea he stood on the quarter deck endeavoring to discover some of the queens ships when he spied a vessel not very distant he gave orders they should make all sail which being executed and the wind fair it was not long before he came up with her  the first object that presented it self to him was the count of la vagne for his and olympias sailing had been prevented by stormy weather which forced em back so they chose to stay on shipboard and remain in the harbor where they waited a fair opportunity of going on their voyage as soon as abelhamar perceived it was the count whether he looked on him as a rival who was the occasion that his passion for felicia had not met with an obliging return or that he considered him as an enemy to that lovely captive having behaved himself toward her in an ungrateful and perfidious manner he could not help conceiving so immoderate an aversion for him that he instantly commanded mula to take the barge and go to the count of la vagne tell him said the prince that i look on him as a traitor who deserves death and if he has a mind to save those who are with him and have nothing to interpose in our quarrel he may come to me or give me his word of honor and i will go and decide the affair with him  mula went on board the count of la vagnes ship and though he was not acquainted with abelhamar whom he was sure had no reasonable motive to quarrel with him yet he was so offended to see himself suspected being a traitor that without entering into a detail which might have made up the difference he leaped into mulas boat i will go said he to him with an air full of pride and anger your master shall see that such a man as i is not to be insulted unrevenged thus without reflecting on the danger to which he exposed himself and even forgetting his dear mistress he ordered them to row him to abelhamars ship  the boat had already made some way when olympias woman awaked her and gave her an account of what was passing her surprise was so great that she just gave her self time to take her nightgown then ran upon deck from whence she perceived her lover at a great distance do you abandon me then my dear count cried she and are you going to expose a life which is mine what have you to say to cruel abelhamar oh dont leave me so but come back to your dear olympia or take me along with you that i may undergo the same fate whilst she was uttering these words the count had reached abelhamars ship olympia seeing this desired the captain of that she was in to let her take his barge which being granted she bad them pull up with all speed toward the princes ship but she unfortunately arrived there too late the count was already engaged with abelhamar and though he fought with all the courage and dexterity imaginable he was forced at length to yield having received a mortal wound  as he was making his last efforts to defend himself against abelhamars reiterated blows the unhappy olympia came up and perceiving at a small distance that her lover was covered with blood and hardly able to support himself she cried out in a loud voice hold barbarous prince hold what have i done to you that should provoke you to deprive me of my life dont you know that the count of la vagne is to be mine give some intermission to your rage cruel as you are or if nothing but a sacrifice will satisfy you i am here ready to receive the blow come and pierce my heart but spare oh spare the man i love  the accent of a voice so dear to the count reached him just as he fell at abelhamars feet he strove to raise his head and turning his eyes toward olympias barge he saw his divine mistress despairing who with much ado got on board the ship and was no sooner there but fell in a swoon near the count and remained speechless a long while after she was a little recovered all she could do was to lay her dying lovers head on her knees and bath his wounds with her tears thus oppressed with mortal grief she sat down without being able to complain  the count endeavored to speak to her and taking her by the hand said i die my dear olympia i die entirely yours and regret departing from life only for your sake with these words his soul took its flight and left his body in the arms of his deplorable mistress who said such moving things and acted so much despair that even abelhamar was inconsolable for being the author of her affliction he sent her half dead on board the ship she was in before and ordered the count of la vagnes corpse to be also transported olympia instead of going to genoa sailed for sardinia in order to retire to her aunts monastry where having erected a magnificent tomb for her lover she continued the rest of her days lamenting the irreparable loss she had made thus we are often deceived when in the greatest hopes of an approaching happiness which fortune changes into the cruelest torments  abelhamar would not have left olympia in this desolate condition had not his passion invited him elsewhere he impatiently desired to overtake the queen being resolved to force his felicia from her and he was not long in his pursuit before they came to tell him that they had discovered celimas ships one may judge how extremely overjoyed he was at this news he immediately gave orders to make all sail then employing his wishes for success and a fair wind prepared himself for an engagement with the queens squadron who were also doing the same  this unfortunate princess knowing the danger which threatened her encouraged her people and having sent to all the captains to come on board her ship she called a council then orders were given and each officer thought of nothing but doing his duty the trumpets began to sound and the cannons roared whilst on each side they were endeavoring to gain the advantage of the wind with a resolution not to show any favor thus ready for a fight celima said to her soldiers observe that dangerous serpent pointing at abelhamar who was in armor walking on his quarter deck see that ungrateful man whom i brought up with so much care he is now meditating my ruin did i not spare his life though it ever endangered mine yet he is not satisfied with my quitting my kingdom to expose myself on this dangerous element he even pursues me and so greedily thirsts after blood that nothing can please him but my death help me ye brave and loyal subjects to punish this rebel and let us by destroying him afford an example for other traitors in ages to come  the queen was thus animating her soldiers whilst felicia and inea were indulging their melancholy see my dear said felicia see these dreadful preparations what can be the fatal consequence of this engagement i fear we shall once more be the victims of fortune oh heaven cried she rather let me die than fall into the hands of abelhamar since no greater disaster can ever happen to me  inea endeavored to comfort and give her hopes saying why do you thus afflict your self since nothing is yet decided we are all preparing for a vigorous resistance and the weather begins to be so stormy that one would almost believe it impossible for the two fleets to approach she was still speaking when on a sudden there arose such a boisterous wind with thunder and lightning that on each side instead of continuing their preparation for a fight they were forced to employ all hands to save themselves from greater dangers  thus the fleets were dispersed without knowing which way to steer their course the raging wind rent the sails and split the masts and the artless pilot with death in his looks was torn from his helm the impetuous waves tossed the ships here and there till at last unable to withstand their resistless fury some were dashed against the rocks others wrecked on the shore and few escaped this terrible tempest  abelhamar having lost sight of the ship wherein he thought felicia and despairing of ever seeing her more looked on the danger he was in with some kind of satisfaction no said he to mula who made unsuccesful efforts to console his master no should i escape death which now threatens me you must not think that i can ever enjoy any pleasure or happiness without the possession of felicia my passion for her increases more and more by the many difficulties i meet with and though i see the fatal powers which oppose me yet nothing shall make me change the design i have of pursuing her  by this time the weather grew more calm and day being far advanced the prince was consulting mula which way he should steer his course to find his mistress he had already passed the streights of gibraltar in order to go to carthagena or porto real not doubting but the queen had reached one of those harbors to shelter herself from the storm he therefore resolved for the coast of andalusia but they who accompanied him disapproved his design consider my lord said they that this is the only ship left of several which ismael lent you and that your pursuing celima may prove of a fatal consequence her sex her beauty and misfortunes will plead for her and what will the king of granada think to see you come into his dominions in pursuit of an unhappy princess who has abandoned here is and left you master of them he may detain you as an hostage till he has made advantageous conditions in her favor with the king of tituan and it is not to be expected that this monarch will continue your friend whilst you act contrary to his interest for should his generous disposition happen to change he might take possession himself of what he has just acquired for you let us return to sallee my lord continued they if the kingdom of fez remains in your hands you may soon be in a condition to ask what you please of the king of granada who will deliver up felicia to you rather than have any difference with you about a christian slave  abelhamar was mortally displeased to see that the present conjuncture obliged him to return to fez and what added to his affliction in his way thither was to meet on every side the dismal fragments of shipwracks which covered the surface of the sea and made him but too sensible that he had lost the greatest part of his fleet  the queen on her side had not been exposed to lesser dangers for all her fleet was dispersed and as the wind drove her into the port of carthagena the stern of her ship struck so fiercely against another that they both had like to have sunk which accident shattered what the storm had spared but several boats and barges came immediately to the queens assistance and landed her safe with her women and equipage  she had hardly stepped out of her barge but was informed of the great alterations which had happened in the kingdom of granada by the death of mahomet who being poisoned by the means of a gown which was sent to him as a present had left the crown to his brother joseph whom he had detained prisoner many years in the castle of salobrena celima sent an officer of her guards to congratulate this prince on his happy and unexpected accession to the throne desiring him at the same time to take compassion on her she sent also to some of her near relations who held the lighest rank in that court  the governor of carthagena hearing that the queen of fez was landed went to meet her with all the marks of honor and respect that were due to her quality she had an apartment prepared for her in the castle where she remained two days to repose her self after the danger and fatigue she had undergone and from thence set out for granada where they were already informed of her landing and were prepared to receive her being willing to give a sanctuary to that unfortunate queen  joseph king of granada immediately ordered his two sons mahomet and osmin to go and meet celima with assurances of his concern for her misfortunes and how desirous he was to serve her in all that lay in his power these princes were perfectly accomplished and as the prince of carency had been confined by the late kings orders in the castle of salobrena whilst they were prisoners there they had conceived so entire a friendship for him that they resolved to set him at liberty if ever their condition should change but the king their father being desirous to make peace with the spaniards and knowing that the infanta don fernand had offered mahomet a considerable ranson for the count of la vagne for he continued calling himself by that title thought that in detaining him it might be a more effectual means to obtain what he so earnestly wished nevertheless as he had a particular esteem for the prince he asked him if he would give him his honor not to go away without his consent which the other having readily promised the king took him along with him to granada  the day he made his entry he sent the prince of carency a magnificent dress with a rich turbant and a scymiter embellished with jewels which showed it was the kings pleasure he should dress himself after the moorish manner in order to accompany him to all the solemnities of his coronation  but the king who had found in the prince a great resemblance of the brave assimir who was a grandee of the house of abanserages much considered in that kingdom and had been lately killed used often to give the prince that name out of a mark of favor who equally received it as such and as he was unwilling to be known he chose rather to be called by that name than any other  though time had not been able to diminish the princes passion or alleviate his grief yet in spite of his excessive melancholy every body distinguished him as one of the finest gentlemen that was ever known amongst all those who showed him the greatest marks of esteem the princes mahomet and osmin particularly expressed themselves his friends mahomet had eminent qualities but was so presumptuous that he would have sacrificed any thing to gratify his desires his younger brother osmin was as fine a prince and had nobler inclinations which made the king have a greater affection for him than for the rest of his children  as soon as news was brought of celimas being near granada these two princes by the king their fathers order at the head of the noblemen of that court went out of town to meet the queen the prince of carency was one of those who accompanied them in this cavalcade and each cavalier had a motto painted on his shield the prince caused an apollo pursuing daphne to be drawn on his with these words round it written in spanish quiero y busco quien me aborece y me fuyo that is i love and pursue one who hates and flies me this thought expressed in a gallant manner his disappointed passion the princes understood it immediately for whilst they were in confinement together he told em part of his adventures and made a secret only of his and his mistresss true name which he concealed for several political reasons especially on his brother and don john of velascos account who had both fought against the moors and defeated them in several engagements  so many historians have informed the world how highly the moors in those days distinguished themselves above other nations by their gallantry and magnificence that i shall decline extending that subject and only say that the unfortunate but beauteous queen of fez elected that court for her refuge where she appeared with such attractives as inspired love in all who beheld her  mahomet and his brother accompanied by the prince of carency in his moorish dress which admirably became him met the queen at a small distance from granada she sat alone in a fine open chariot and all her women followed her in chaises felicia and inea were together in one and had drawn the curtains to have an opportunity of entertaining each other more conveniently ought we to look on our being near spain said felicia to her friend as a favorable change toward our better fortune i think replied inea that the circumstances can no ways prove to our disadvantage alas as for my part interrupted felicia i have so little hopes of happiness in this life that i could now leave the world with pleasure inea did not omit any thing which could divert her from these melancholy reflections though she herself had cause enough to be uneasy not having heard from her dear don ramire whilst they were talking the princes alighted and saluted the queen with many assurances in the name of the king their father then took horse again and rode by the side of her chariot entertaining her majesty with what was most suitable to the occasion of her voyage but celima became of a sudden so pensive that she could hardly make em any answer her eyes were entirely fixed on the prince of carency and she had not power to turn them on any other object her joy and surprise were equally extraordinary and what added to both was seeing him in a moorish dress which gave her a curiosity to ask his name of one of the guards that was near her who not knowing that the prince was a prisoner of war but had only seen him with the king in his journey from salobrena to granada told the queen he was called assimir  she immediately conjectured he had some important reasons which obliged him to assume that name and disguise so did not ask any other questions relating to him yet what gave her some uneasiness was to find that he did not take any particular notice of her she was a good while in expectation he would have spoken to her at last seeing he continued silent she addressed her discourse to him and for a pretense asked him the signification of the motto which she had perceived on his shield he told her the meaning and added that he was the unhappiest man in the world the queen imagined that by the apollo he meant himself and daphne to be her which filled her mind with such ideas as were too pleasing to be expressed i have sometimes had a prophetic spirit said she to him smiling and have foretold things without knowing their true cause methinks i have a great disposition to do you the same favor assimir your daphne neither flies nor hates you and you shall soon have the satisfaction of seeing her ah madam cried the prince transported what do you tell me is it possible that the cruel fair one who is the object of my sufferings will at last vouchsafe to make me happy yes replied celima with a gracious air she is as willing as you to put a period to your torments and i promise you that as soon as i am a little at leisure i will tell you more of the matter alas madam replied he i do not deserve that so great a queen should be concerned in my fortune which hitherto has proved very fatal and i dare hardly hope a better one for the future celima said no more to him at that time fearing the particular distinction she had shown him might be taken notice of which undoubtedly would have disobliged mahomet who had already found so many charms in the queen that he could not sufficiently deplore her misfortunes and whilst he was thus offering her his pity a more powerful passion made way to his heart  the nearer celima approached granada the more she admired the beauty of that famous city which is situated in a plain at the extremity whereof is a snowy hill from whence spring two rivers the daro and genil the one often produces golddust mixed with the sand and the other pure silver the air of that climate is sweet and refined and there seldom appears any winter the spring and autumn united afford flowers and fruit without being at the trouble of cultivating the earth there are whole forests of orange myrtle and pomgranate trees and as nature had taken care to embellish the country so no art had been spared to beautify the city which was encompassed with a strong wall and twelve hundred towers the palace of alhambro which the kings had chosen for their court was so magnificent that nothing but the castle of abbaycin could be equal to it which on every side shined with gold and azure supported by marble and porphyry besides the moors observed an admirable order in architecture which highly recommended their buildings and as for their gardens walks and fountains they were so wonderfully well contrived that nothing could be added to their beauty and agreeableness  the queen arrived at the gates of the town where the people assembled in great multitudes but the prince of carency to avoid the crowd took another way which insensibly led him to the side of the river daro whence he continued till he came to a fountain whose water was as clear as crystal the deep silence which reigned in that place and the inclination he had to meditate on what the queen of fez had said to him invited him to alight he tied his horse to a tree and lay down on the grass then calling to mind what celima had told him by what chance thought he did this princess who never saw me before single me out to acquaint me that leonida still loves me and that i shall soon see her has any one informed her of my sentiments methinks it does not well become one of her rank to rally an unfortunate man who cannot even flatter himself with hopes much less with the real enjoyment of so unexpected a blessing  he was drowned in reflections of this nature when the voice of a man who spoke the arabic tongue interrupted him asking whether the queen of fez was yet arrived at granada the prince knew very well that the person who was coming up to him was a stranger and that he only spoke arabic to him because of his dress supposing him to be some grandee in alliance with the moors he fixed his eyes on this foreigner but heavens how great was their surprise when they knew each other benavidez for it was he could not help turning pale at the thoughts of his perfidiousness and the prince swelling with anger said to him from whence come you unworthy wretch that you are what doemon has conveyed you here to receive the punishment of of your treacheries finishing these words he drew his sword and used it with such fierceness that the spaniard notwithstanding his bravery was daunted and seized with terror till at last calling despair to his succor and seeing the inevitable danger he was in he fought rather like a desperate man than one who had a mind to save his life the prince resolving not to spare him reiterated his blows with such vigor that he soon gave benavidez a mortal wound which made him fall at his feet ah my lord said he to the prince with a feeble and incoherent accent it is but just i should die by your hand after all the injuries i have done you did i deserve such usage traitor replied the prince since you can deceive me no longer where have you left perfidious leonida now is the time to convince me that you are yet capable of repenting a base action i am willing to obey you answered benavidez stretching out his hand upon condition that you will forgive me speak and i will even forget all said the prince tell me what is become of my leonida i declare to you replied benavidez whose face showed the symptoms of an approaching death that leonida never ceased loving you she no ways consented to her flight but almost consumed with grief loaded me with the cruellest reproaches and her utmost aversion was the only return she made my passion yet in spite of her tears and resistance i took her with me on board a ship and was promising myself a happy voyage when we were met by some of the enemys ships who engaged and took ours i was so dangerously wounded that  farewell my lord i can say no more i am dying his eyes instantly closed and his soul made its exit whilst he was lying in the princes arms  benavidezs death touched the prince of carencys generous soul who forgetting all his ingratitude began to pity him saying that he would never have been guilty of the crimes he had committed could he have defended his heart from leonidas charms and looking on him as an unhappy rival and a reconciled enemy his compassion took place of his resentment he reflected on what benavidez had just told him relating to his dear leonida but he was perfectly inconsolable not knowing the enemies who had taken her fatal death cried he thou have snatched away the life of a man who was going to inform me of a circumstance which is of the greatest importance to me where must i fly to seek the object of my love and how can i tell into whose hands she is fallen oh heavens am i not more unfortunate than ever the thoughts of her being inconstant gave some intermission to my passion for which i was endeavoring to find a cure but now the case is changed i am concerned for a mistress to whom i am contracted she has ever been true to me and perhaps has found a lover and a master in the man who has her now in his possession oh unparalled fatality how tormenting will these apprehensions be to my afflicted soul which way shall i go to find her the prince was so deeply involved in these anxious reflections that he did not immediately perceive a wound he had received in his arm but finding himself grow weak by the great loss of blood he thought fit to retire  just as he entered the town he met zulema who was a moor of the family of abenserages to whose guard he had been committed by orders of the late king whilst he was prisoner in the castle of salobrena the prince having a confidence in this moor thought he could not choose any one more capable of ordering benavidezs burial therefore he desired zulema to oblige him in this occasion who without delay though the night was far spent took some slaves with him and went to the fountain in order to execute the princes commands  as he came near the place he heard a person lamenting grievously which at first surpised him not distinguishing what he said but having alighted from his horse he perceived a man who was embracing beavidezs body and bemoaning his misfortune in the spanish tongue ah my dear benavidez said he how unlucky it is that i was not here to defend you against the traitors who have murdered you alas my uneasiness and fears had already foretold your death here zulema interrupted this stranger and being compassionate told him benavidez had not been killed by any treacherous means and that he who fought him was so generous an enemy that he had even desired him to come and see the corpse interred the spaniard who was very young expressed his concern by his tears and said oh sir nothing can alleviate my affliction since i have lost all in losing my dear master zulema endeavored to comfort him then ordered his people to take the corpse and bury it in a little wood not far from the fountain  this being performed zulema who was naturally generous and then moved with pity at the repeated complaints of this servant of benavidez asked him if he would go along with him to granada you shall be safe in my house said he which is a favor your countrymen cannot well expect in this kingdom don sanche for that was the spaniards name hesitated some time before he made an answer but at last whether fear or prudence prevailed with him he told zulema that since he was pleased to offer him his house for a sanctuary he was very willing to wait on him zulema who was uneasy about the princes wound went directly to see him and the mean while sent the spaniard to his house to wait his return  the prince was in bed and the surgeon who had dressed his wound found it somewhat dangerous which soon occasioned a report in the town that he had had a rencounter though the particulars were not known and when zulema entered the princes chamber he found the kings two sons sitting by him who were much concerned at this accident mahomet thus continued the discourse he had already begun i must tell you it is unkind to make a mystery to us of your enemys name i owe you my lord replied the prince too much gratitude and affection ever to do that which might deserve a reproach from you i should be very willing to tell you who was my enemy if there were cause to apprehend any farther consequences but i am entirely easy on that score besides i am obliged to keep a secret which i was sworn to before i thought you would have asked me the detail of this affair so beg leave to be silent  osmin fearing this conversation might create some uneasiness in the prince obligingly waved the discourse and said to him you have lost very much by not attending the queen of fez for laying aside the honorable reception the king my father gave her and the extraordinary luster which the ladies of our court appeared in she commanded all her slaves to pull off their veils and i must confess we were both astonished and charmed to see so many beautiful creatures their praise was the chief entertainment of the court and i am persuaded they will cause many a lover to be guilty of infidelity that is already your case brother replied mahomet smiling and you cannot deny but the eyes of that felicia whose name you were so desirous to know have made such an impression as may endanger your liberty i own to you said osmin that i prefer her to all the rest her beauty is not to be paralleled and i am surpised brother that you escaped falling her captive no answered mahomet my heart is not so easily wounded alas my lord interrupted the prince of carency perhaps your time is not come but you will find your self as sensible as any of us when you meet with the object whom destiny has decreed to inspire you as for my part i dread that fatal moment as much as a pilot does a rock in a storm why dont you bestow your inclinations on a slave like felicia replied osmin at least you would be free from any cruel torments who can tell my lord said the prince whether that slave will like the man who has a passion for her love is capricious and ever guided by fancy therefore a slave may look with indifference on the greatest monarch in the world how can you thus oppose my satisfaction with your reflections cried osmin would you have me cease loving felicia out of groundless apprehensions indeed brother replied mahomet it is strange you should say you love a person whom you hardly know nay you may style it as you please said osmin but what i can affirm is that the perfections of this young captive have already engaged me nothing in nature can be more beautiful no nor even comparable to this lovely creature and i impatiently wish assimirs recovery that he may be able to make his court to the queen of fez he will then be judge of what i advance  it will not be so easy to see her as you imagine my lord interrupted zulema who had been silent all this while i have been at salee where i stayed a considerable time and the negotiations i was employed in by the late king gave me frequent opportunities of having both private and public audiences with the queen yet whenever i was admitted i found her surrounded with the oldest and ugliest women in the world she used to set a strict watch on all her pretty slaves and keep em so concealed that unless her humor be much altered i am sure you will find some difficulty in paying your courtship to felicia that sex is very unjust cried osmin i suppose celima will not let her slaves be seen for fear they should eclipse her charms it is you that are unjust replied mahomet why should you attribute to any other cause a custom which has been long established only for the safety of slaves every one must agree that celima is endowed with too many excellencies to apprehend any thing from other beauties ha brother said osmin you were boasting a while ago of your insensibility but i find by the passionate air with which you express yourself in the queens defense that you are not so very indifferent as you would make us believe mahomet who had no mind to satisfy his brother on that subject made no reply but rising up addressed himself to assimir meaning the prince of carency whom he embraced and after having desired him to take care of his health he and his brother took their leave of him zulema retired at the same time without acquainting him that he had met benavidezs servant the prince on the other hand was impatient to entertain him but there was no possibility of doing it till the next day  one may imagine the prince passed but a very ill night what the queen and benavidez had said to him strangely perplexed his mind which being added to the pain he suffered by his wound threw him before morning into a violent fever zulema who had a particular concern for the prince rose early and went to enquire after his health they told him he had not reposed all night and if he pleased might go into his chamber as soon as the prince perceived him ah my dear zulema said he i was wishing to see you all that passed yesterday has put me into such a disorder as i shall not be able to overcome without your assistance the queen of fez spoke to me as if she knew me and i remarked in her air and eyes something more obliging than is usually expressed for a person one has never seen besides she assures me that my mistress neither flies nor hates me and that i shall have the pleasure of seeing her soon who could have informed her of a thing so positive i should be inclined to think that chance was the only cause why she entertained me so agreeably were it not for the rencounter i had yesterday near the fountain he whom i fought was my rival the same benavidez who carried off my felicia he told me with his last breath she had ever loved me and that her sentiments for me were still the same it is not probable he would have uttered an untruth in so dismal a condition but just as he was going to tell me where he had left her he was deprived both of his speech and life you cannot imagine how this grieves my soul felicia loves me can any happiness be greater yet alas i have lost her and know not where to enquire after her what misfortune can be equal to mine here he was some time silent  zulema told him that a more favorable fortune would certainly disclose a secret on which depended his felicity and that he did not doubt but he might receive some information from a young man he found weeping near benavidezs body whom he had detained at his house for that purpose oh i conjure you send for him immediately cried the prince i remember his master in approaching me asked whether the queen of fez was yet arrived at granada perhaps she knew him and that in relating his adventures to her he mentioned something concerning mine i ought not to neglect any means in my present circumstances for if that young man was with benavidez when he ran away with my mistress and can tell me what is become of her i shall be blessed above mankind  i perceive so great an emotion in you my lord replied zulema that i am sorry for having acquainted you with a particular which may be prejudicial to your health no said the prince do not fear any thing but if you have either love or pity relieve me in this urgent occasion shall i tell you then what i was thinking answered zulema osmin spoke to you yesterday very much in praise of one felicia who is a slave of celimas it is probable she may be the person you love i began to suspect the same interrupted the prince but was not willing to harbor such a thought for there are many felicias in spain and after the adventure i had at jaen with don alonso by a mistake which that name occasioned i have room to fear the like disappointment i only beg you will send for the young man you spoke of  zulema commanded one of his slaves in whom he confided to give a moorish dress to the spaniard and bring him immediately along with him this was the precaution he used to prevent his being taken at granada for a sranger don sanche was a little unwilling at first to go out of zulemas house not knowing where they intended to carry him but the slave having told him they were going to an intimate friend of his masters whose name was assimir he readily followed him believing assimir was a moor and he continued in the same opinion even when he entered the prince of carencys chamber who was in bed and the windows closed come nearer don sanche said zulema to him and tell us sincerely what you know concerning felicia of leon  this unexpected question surpised the spaniard who was some time without making any answer what said the prince do you hesitate tell me immediately what is become of her were you not with your master when he carried her away heavens what new astonishment did this voice create don sanche or to explain myself in a clearer manner casilda sister to benavidez for it was she who was thus disguised was suddenly struck with such a violent trembling that had not the chamber been very dark it would have been impossible to conceal her disorder her eyes were endeavoring to see the person whom her heart already knew whilst the prince on his side was in the utmost impatience to be informed of his mistresss fate what said she to her self shall my rival for ever be adored and could her absence no ways extinguish the princes passion was ever misfortune equal to mine then resolving at once not to mention any thing which might discover leonidas being with the queen of fez it is true my lord said she i was with don fernand benavidez when he ran away with the fair lady you named and we should have had a prosperous voyage were it not for the fatal rencounter of two turkish ships who engaged ours and took it my master being the only man that resisted with undaunted courage the captains of these ships were so charmed with felicias beauty which had received no injury from her affliction that they resolved to carry her to constantinople in order to present her to the grand seignior therefore having given her a very rich dress they brought her to that emperor who was so mightily taken with her that he immediately placed her in his seraglio as for my master and i good fortune would have it that we were sold to the bashaw of morea who knew don fernand benavidez to whom he was indebted for some considerable service he had rendered him in spain this bashaw was a famous renegado which was his only crime for he was very generous and so grateful that he restored us to our liberty without requiring any ransom thus we returned to andalusia where we were just landed when my master heard that the queen of fez was coming to granada which determined him to come hither in order to pay his court to her  the prince during casildas relation was seized with an unspeakable affliction when he heard that felicia was among the grand seigniors women the anxiety of such a cruel thought overpowered his senses and his wound opening so great a quantity of blood gushed out that it flung him into a swoon  zulema surpised at the princes silence spoke to him but as he made no reply he took his hand which was in a cold sweat this startled him and calling for a light he saw the picture of despair painted on the face of this unfortunate prince who was without motion and his paleness would have persuaded one that his soul had already left his body but how shall i represent here the deplorable condition of casilda whose passion was raised to such a transcendency that having no regard to her honor she framed a false story to destroy the princes hopes of ever seeing his divine mistress at another time she would have sacrificed a thousand lives to have saved his but at this juncture had he died one might have accused her with being the cause of his death  had not zulemas concern been so great he would have easily discovered that of the counterfeit don sanche who without restraint shed a deluge of tears and expressed a more than ordinary care in assisting the prince who at last receiving a little strength from the cordials they gave him opened his weak eyes which he fixed languishingly on his friend and don sanche whose face he thought he knew yet did not take much notice of him then turning to zulema ah pity me cried he since my misfortunes can never be greater they are come to their last period i had lost my felicia and thought her false which in some measure suppressed my tormenting passion but now i am informed she is living and that her affection for me is still the same had that tyrant death shatchd her from me i should doubtless have been inconsolable for her loss yet methinks i should be free from those tumultuous fears which now rack my mind oh what dismal objects appear to my distracted imagination felicia in the seraglio and beloved by the grand seignior heavens what greater cruelty can ever be inflicted on a man so passionately in love i have lost her and shall never see her more i am even jealous and i fear her heart will at last yield to the barbarous laws which ill fortune has imposed on her here his disturbed thoughts interrupted his discourse whilst zulema was using all his endeavors to mitigate so violent a grief felicia had too sincere a passion for you said he ever to change in favor of a prince who is no ways agreeable and is too proud to give himself the least trouble toward obtaining the favors of a lady he thinks all must submit to his authority and i am persuaded that as she will neither relish his addresses nor make any return her resistance and coldness will soon render her indifferent to the emperor suppose i were free from these apprehensions interrupted the prince by what means shall i hear from her is she not in the grand seigniors seraglio and absolutely lost for me oh it is too true i cannot flatter myself no not even wish to see her more which misfortune compleats my despair  casilda was in no small confusion when she heard him speak in such passionate terms she was several times tempted to make herself known that she might address herself to him in the tenderest expressions love could inspire but calling to mind what passed between em when she acquainted him with leonidas flight it made her apprehend that if she spoke to him at this juncture it would be as ill timed therefore thought proper to wait another opportunity in the mean time she affected an extraordinary concern for the prince who remarked it and was not slow in showing his acknowledgments for he told her thinking he was speaking to a man that although his present fortune being then a prisoner did not permit him to bestow great favors on those who were in his service yet if he was willing to stay with him till he could be better provided for he would take care of him assimir little knew the effect this proposal created in our disguised lady who immediately accepted it with all imaginable marks of joy and respect assuring him that no body would serve him with more zeal and fidelity but before we see how strict she was to her promise let us be informed by what chance she came to granada  abelhamar and the admiral of fez having taken the ship leonida was in it was thought benavidez could not recover of the wounds he had received in his vigorous resistance so was left for dead but after leonida had been conducted on board the admiral they found in benavidez some symptoms of life which made em take care of him till they were landed at sallee where he continued a long time extremely ill leonida knew nothing of it being strictly guarded in the palace but as soon as he was recovered he resolved either pay her ransom or carry her off by stratagem with this design he wrote to casilda who having received his letter lost no time in preparing for that voyage and as her passion for the prince of carency had met with no return but disdain she was meditating on some desperate enterprise in order to act a vengeance proportionable to the injury she thought this might be a favorable opportunity therefore taking her jewels with a considerable sum of money she disguised herself in mans apparel to prevent her being known and embarked for sallee where she arrived soon after with the resolution of taking away leonidas life and to succeed in her wicked design she had brought with her a box of the subtilest poison  benavidez was not a little overjoyed at casildas arrival and after he had paid his ransom to the admiral he only thought of recovering leonida but the queen having an extraordinary friendship for her hardly suffered her to be out of her sight which made him fear his attempt would be in vain this was the state of his affairs when the king of tunis invaded the kingdom of fez which obliged celima to abandon sallee and at the same time that she embarked benavidez and his sister in disguise took their passage in one of the ships which were bound for granada during their voyage they often saw leonida aboard the queens ship whose sight only inflamed benavidezs heart with love and casildas with rage but the dreadful storm which arose dispersing the fleet their ship was driven some leagues beyond carthagena where they landed and set out immediately on horseback for granada casilda who was of a weak constitution and already very much fatigued with her voyage was left a great way behind which was the occasion of her not arriving till after her brothers rencounter with the prince of carency which was then too late  i have already told you with what marks of honor and distinction the queen of fez was received at her arrival at the court of granada but i did not mention the magnificent entertainment the king gave her at the palace of alhambro after which the princes and most part of the noblemen conducted her to the castle of the abbaicyn which was prepared for her and there took leave of her majesty  as soon as she was at liberty to give some time to reflection she went to take the air on a terrace walk adjoining her apartment which had a prospect over the river daro there a thousand hurrying thoughts started from her mind what course shall i take said she to herself and whom shall i trust with my secret must i once more to the shame of my sex and glory make my weakness known to this lovely stranger heaven has sent him to me again and i am inclined to believe he is thinking on me yes certainly the apollo pursuing daphne which was painted on his shield with his motto nay more than that his languishing looks and distractions in short every thing persuades me he is in love yet if it were with me ought not he to be inspired with some motions of sympathy which would have told him that his unknown of nicopolis and the queen of fez were the same why does he not discover as many charms in my person as he did in my wit and generosity alas he was then too young to feel the effects of love gratitude was the only thing that moved him to make a return and i now fear some softer care imploys his thoughts but continued she i cannot persuade myself that fortune has brought him once more in my way only to add fresh afflictions to those i have already undergone i am rather disposed to look on this as the beginning of a happiness which will end by the destruction of my enemies this prince is nearly related to the king of france i will make myself a christian and in giving him my hand present him with my crown he may head an army and invade the kingdom of fez which he soon will be master of the people by my example will submit to his laws and after being an unhappy fugitive destitute of all hopes i shall see myself crowned with unspeakable felicity celima thus indulged her imagination till it grew so late that she thought fit to retire to her apartment where she passed the night betwixt soft repose and a thousand agreeable ideas which made her appear the next day in all her charms  but before the queen would admit of any visit she sent for felicia to whom she spoke in these terms i am desirous to know whether your sentiments for the count of la vagne are still the same therefore felicia confess ingenuously the truth has not his perfidiousness been capable to extinguish the affection you had for him when you were persuaded of his constancy search well into your heart for i have some reason to enquire about it and whatever answer you make me i shall not love you the less these questions caused some surprise in felicia who at first had a mind to disguise her sentiments but having considered that she had not long before confessed her weakness to the queen she was of opinion it was better to speak her thoughts without any dissimulation madam replied she since they are your majestys commands i cannot refuse obeying i own with the utmost confusion that till now it has not been in my power to banish from my heart the fatal idea of the count of la vagne i daily entertain myself with the cause i have to hate him as the cruellest of my enemies yet alas it is past my skill and i dare not even hope that time it self will ever be able to effect my cure you do love him then interrupted the queen if love consists in often thinking of a person replied felicia i am convinced i still have an affection for him i may now confide in you replied the queen therefore hear me and be secret  i was hardly out of my infancy when my unlucky stars decreed i should fall into the hands bajazet whose passion for me only increased my aversion to him and i thought nothing could be more deplorable than my destiny  these were my sentiments when he went into missia and compelled me to go along with him where after a victory over the christians he was desirous to see the prisoners of distinction who had been taken and as out of a politic motive he endeavored to inspire me with cruelty and inure me to tragic scenes he ordered i should be placed at a window which was grated and looked over the court where the christians were to suffer death and several noblemen of france had already been executed when i saw a young prince appear whose beauty surpassed that which we attribute to the god of love he seemed to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age he was tall wellshapd and had fair hair which hung in fine curls on his shoulders and in spite of his careless air he had something so great and noble in his mien that the other princes were not to be compared to him oh felicia could you but imagine what i felt in that moment a quick emotion seized all my soul i was troubled without knowing the cause and in a word had like to have died for fear bajazet should have taken away a life which was already dearer to me than my own i began to think what i could do to deliver this lovely prince from the immediate danger which threatened him whether to fling myself at bajazets feet and beg his life or to offer myself a victim in his room for i could have done any thing to save him but whilst a thousand such thoughts were torturing my mind the emperor resolved on accepting his ransom which news so transported me that my joy was inexpressible  this young prince was prisoner in the tower of nicopolis and as my apartment had a prospect of it i used to pass whole days at my closet window in fruitless sighs and wishes but one evening as i was endeavoring with the help of a telescope to discover the object i so dearly loved i perceived him walking on the leads of the tower and he appeared to me so melancholy that it threw me into the deepest concern i immediately resolved on writing to him notwithstanding the danger to which i exposed myself if bajazet had known it but love is often more lucky than wise and chance on that occasion is a much better servant than reason when i had ended my letter i confided it to an eunuch who had attended me a long time and showed a particular affection for my service what did i not say to persuade him to be faithful which having promised me even at the hazard of his life he conveyed my letter to the top of the tower by means of an arrow and the prince having received it sent me an answer which entirely vanquished me i was informed that his ransom was not come and the more i considered how dear he daily grew to me the greater cause i had to fear equally for him and myself i was perfectly acquainted with bajazets inhuman temper and too sensible of my own weakness to believe that it would be in my power to fly a prince who so entirely possessed my thoughts these considerations obliged me to take measures for his immediate departure but alas what torments did not i endure through the necessity of so cruel a resolution  to this effect i was forced once more to confide in my eunuch who bribed one of the princes guards by whose means a strong box was conveyed into his chamber wherein i sent him a considerable sum to pay his ransom and a letter which was the last i wrote to him being bereft of the hopes of ever seeing him more imagine felicia how many anxious hours i have passed since that unlucky day  soon after bajazets fortune met with an unhappy change for tamerlane having engaged him gained a complete victory and took him prisoner it was with no small difficulty i made my escape and returned to my fathers dominions where i was no sooner arrived but several kings and princes made their addresses to me some out of ambition and others out of a sincere love for my person but i was so entirely prepossessed with the idea of him who had charmed me at nicopolis that nothing at sallee was capable of making an impression on me so in spite of myself i was in love without hopes of a return this was the state of my mind at my arrival here but how can i express the surprise and agitation i was in when amongst the noblemen who came to receive me out of the gates of the town i perceived the man i love this christian prince under the name and dress of a moor appeared to me as charming as ever no it is impossible for you to comprehend what i felt at so unexpected a rencounter my heart was seized with so many different motions that i was not able to speak and whilst i was endeavoring to recover myself assimir for that is the name he goes by at this court approached and gave me an occasion to see the motto that was painted on his shield which persuaded me the memory of his unknown of nicopolis was dear to him i must confess i was equally surpised and overjoyed for i could not flatter myself with being still in the thoughts of that young prince who had not the same motives to inspire him i had seen him and was informed of his name and birth but he had neither seen me nor knew who i was therefore what had touched him was either gratitude or the obliging expressions of my letters which i must say are no small attractives to a generous soul  in short felicia i have a mind that you should talk with him and endeavor to discover his sentiments the management of this affair which i entrust you with is of a nice quality but as you are very discreet i cannot employ any one who will give me less suspicion though i must own my weakness to you i am naturally of a jealous temper and a confidant so beautiful as you with assimirs merit might give me some apprehension were it not that you are entirely prepossessed in favor of the count of la vagne felicia threw her self at the queens feet and kissing her hand with great respect said to her i have so true a sense madam of the honor you do me when you are pleased to confide in me that i cannot easily express my acknowledgments for so high a favor but whatever ambition i have to serve your majesty i am strangely diffident of my capacity for i know that in so important an affair one cannot act too prudently which makes me fear i shall not answer the good opinion you have conceived of me what replied the queen would you yield to another the advantage of doing me a piece of service is not your affection for me great enough to prevent you from acting those faults you foresee felicia understood by what the queen said to her that her majesty would be highly disobliged should she neglect so fair an opportunity of serving her therefore considering the unhappy state of her captivity she made no other reply but that she was ready to obey her commands you must then write to assimir said the queen and desire him to meet you on the terrace adjoining my apartment where you shall entertain him with some particulars relating to me  felicia immediately retired in order to write to assimir and finding inea in her chamber she gave her an account what had passed between the queen and her then wrote her letter in these terms  though i am unknown to you my lord and you also a stranger to me i have a mighty desire to entertain you which perhaps you may think very extraordinary if you will be pleased to meet me this evening on the terrace walk next to the queen of fez s apartment i shall there explain my self more at large  felicia   this letter felicia showed to the queen who called for one of her pages and charged him to go and deliver it to assimir who as i told you before was extremely afflicted at what casilda under the disguise of don sanche had spitefully intimated concerning felicia the mean while zulema who had stayed by the prince was saying all he could to soften his distress and as he was talking to him they came to tell assimir that one of the queen of fezs pages had a letter to deliver to him this caused some emotion in the prince who looking at his friend can you conceive said he what may be the meaning of this letter if i may believe my thoughts replied zulema they persuade me some agreeable news is coming to you my lord whatever it be said the prince i desire you will speak to the page i am unwilling to see him for fear he should discover the disorder i am in  zulema readily satisfied the princes impatience he took the letter and brought it to him which he no sooner opened but knew the name and writing heavens how great was his surprise he could not conceal his transports but giving the letter back to zulema said am i in a dream or must i believe what i see is my felicia in granada whilst i am bemoaning her absence and bereft of all hopes of ever seeing her more zulema my dear zulema how can i outlive so unexpected a felicity indeed my lord replied his friend i am sensibly touched at your good fortune and heartily congratulate you but am afraid you will go to the palace of abbaicyn before your wound is healed which may prove very dangerous to you were i to hazard my life answered the prince i would not defer the pleasure of seeing her and as i am not able to write i desire you would do it for me i am assured said zulema that she does not know the condition you are in otherwise she would be very much concerned at the little care you take of a life which ought to be dear to her but i am ready to do any thing my lord to oblige you so the prince dictated these lines  you are not so great a stranger to me as you imagine adorable felicia i do not doubt but you will be convinced of it as soon as i have the pleasure of saluting you i have had the misfortune of receiving a wound which very much discomposes me yet nothing shall prevent me attending your commands   whilst the passionate prince was abandoning himself to a thousand transports of joy and impatience the page delivered his letter to the queen who having read it was seized with the deepest chagrin was any fatality like this cried she assimir is acquainted with felicia and says he will attend her though he is wounded what accident could have happened to him since yesterday sure there must needs be an intimate understanding between felicia and him though she has concealed it from me i thought her sentiments for the count of la vagne would have left me no room to apprehend any thing from her but alas how deceived have i been well i am resolved she shall neither see him nor speak to him as celima was thus reasoning with herself felicia entered her chamber assimir said the queen to her has received your letter and is very much indisposed therefore could not write to you felicia seemed concerned at his illness thinking by that means to pay her court to the queen but she could not have taken a more indirect step toward it for celima was so prepossessed with the opinion of felicias having a correspondence with the prince that the most innocent actions of this young slave in her eyes appeared criminal  the king of granada being now indisposed sent his two sons to visit celima whom they invited to take the air in the forest this queen accepted the invitation and as assimir illness had been confirmed to her by the princes mahomet and osmin she did not in the least imagine that he would venture to go abroad besides celima had observed that osmin was mightily taken with felicia which extremely pleased her for she would not have cared had all the monarchs of the universe adored that lovely captive so the prince of carency had but looked on her indifference  thus the court set out from the palace of abbaicyn followed by a great number of musical instruments all the ladies were seated in little open chariots each of them having a cavalier to drive them mahomet drove the queen of fezs chariot and osmin felicias as they were going by the palace of alhambro the queen desired she might stop a little to enquire after the kings health  zulema hearing that celima was coming to the palace told the prince she should pass under his windows and that if he was able to rise perhaps he might see felicia heavens cried the prince what would not i do for so dear a satisfaction with that he leaped out of bed and having put on some clothes went and sat in one of the balconies of his apartment where soon after he saw celima and felicia attending her osmin perceiving the prince desired this beauteous lady to take notice of him but how shall i express the motions which seized her soul when she knew him to be her lover the prince of carency on the other side was so transported that he was just going to speak to her had not zulema persuaded him to the contrary  felicia was in such a disorder that at first she knew not what to say but being extremely desirous to be informed by what chance her false lover happened to be in granada for she took him for the count of la vagne she recovered herself a little and told osmin that the person he had shown her appeared to be a stranger you judge right madam replied he for he is a genouese of the noble house of fiesques the late king having besieged jean took him prisoner and sent him to the castle of salobrena where my father my bother and i were confined there i contracted an intimate friendship with the count of la vagne that is his title and after mahomets death my father coming to the throne conceived so particular an esteem for this illustrious count that he gave him his liberty upon condition that he would not part from granada without his consent therefore he still remains with us and we are daily charmed with his noble and polite behavior  these encomiums which osmin gave to the count were very acceptable to felicia notwithstanding the reasons she had to be dissatisfied with his conduct she then asked him when the count had been taken prisoner but nothing could astonish her more than what osmin told her on that subject for either the scene which passed at sallee between olympia the count and her was a vision which she had no room to believe or what osmin was saying to her could not be sincere this made her impatient to be with inea to entertain her with this surprising adventure and she grew of a sudden so pensive that she could not make any reply to the obliging terms in which osmin addressed her what is it that troubles you divine felicia said he to her you seem very melancholy do but confide in me and i will use my best endeavors to deserve so great a favor alas my lord replied felicia with a dejected air what secret could i impart to you i am an unfortunate captive and perhaps i repine at the cruelty of that destiny from whence flows the sorrow which you perceive vouchsafe madam said osmin to accept of my service i may procure you your liberty and soon remove the cause of your uneasiness but you must at least give me leave to pay homage to your transcendent charms since they have inspired me with such sentiments as do not merit a disobliging return i conjure you amiable felicia to be favorable to me and let me feed my passion with the hopes of your affection i cannot answer your request my lord interrupted felicia i have too great a regard for you and as an evincement of it i declare that i am neither desirous to be beloved nor disposed to receive an impression it is a resolution i have made which nothing shall induce me to change therefore i entreat you my lord never to think on me more this confession extremely surpised osmin who would rather have met with more dissimulation and less cruelty but as love is always deluding he did not doubt but in time he should conquer an indifference which he thought unreasonable  the court being returned from the forest celima whose thoughts were entirely employed on her rendezvous with the prince of carency retired to her palace and felicia went to her chamber where she found inea whom she embraced tenderly and said how shall i express to you my dear the agitation of my mind the count of la vagne is here i have just seen him in the palace of alhambro it is no imagination for he saluted me so respectfully that i could not help returning the civility and i am even ashamed of having discovered my weakness to a man who has deserved my aversion but alas when love commands reason must obey i have something yet more surprising to tell you continued she i am informed he has been some months in andalusia and by the relation i have heard i find he was taken prisoner about the time that i had a dream at sallee which represented him to me engaged with the moors and vanquished osmin told me the count had been ever since in the castle of salobrena or at granada but i fancy he desired him to speak to me in that manner with a design to screen his offense for who knows whether he does not repent his unworthy behavior toward me moreover i am surpised not to see olympia here which makes me believe the moors took the count at sea and that he has not been long in these dominions it is very probable interrupted inea for what passed at sallee is not to be contradicted and perhaps he is now sorry for having disobliged you therefore you must resolve to pardon him no my dear inea replied felicia i shall never forget his ingratitude he is still dear to me i confess yet i hope in time to banish him from my heart oh heavens added she weeping what a series of misfortunes attend me i must tell you something more young osmin has declared himself my votary and you may judge how favorably i received his addresses  whilst felicia and inea were discoursing together the queen of fez sent for the governess of the slaves who as i told you before was an ugly old woman and commanded her to wrap herself in her veil and wait on the terrace for the prince of carencys arrival she charged her at the same time not to discover herself but to appear overjoyed at seeing him in case he took her for felicia it was a moonlight night and the amorous prince leaning on casilda whom he took for a young man was making as much haste toward the place appointed as his strength would permit him and perceiving at a distance a tall person walking on the terrace he did not doubt but it was his charming felicia therefore approaching her he said ah madam has fortune brought you to me again after having so long bemoaned your absence and spent days and nights endeavoring to find you i can hardly believe my eyes is it you yourself my divine mistress here transported with love and joy he went to throw off this womans veil who not being quick enough to take hold of it let it fall on the ground and discovered a face which was as ugly as felicias was beautiful  his astonishment was so great that he could not help crying out aloud and any one might have perceived by his emotion the strange disorder he was in the queen being in a closet that looked on the terrace walk easily saw the princes action and knew his voice which made her guess what had passed therefore approaching him with a majestic air i am come to your assistance prince said she taking his hand and smiling follow me i have something to tell you which is of too great a consequence to be concealed from you any longer  the queen went in first but casilda being obliged to wait without was mighty uneasy concerning what might pass between celima and the prince this inquisitive creature stayed till the governess of the slaves was retired then placed herself near the closet where she could easily hear their conversation the queen looking at the prince who was not well recovered from his surprise i have been employing my skill for you my lord said she and by the help of my books and the figures i have cast am already acquainted with some of your adventures moreover i can assure you that i interest myself very much in what concerns you and if you will be sincere with me i do not in the least doubt but i shall be able by the assistance of my powerful art to put you in a way of overcoming your ill fortune i am persuaded madam replied the prince that a sovereign who has so great an influence as your majesty may easily change my destiny without consulting the stars yet i cannot flatter myself with deserving so extraordinary a favor as an evincement of the progress i have already made said celima i know assimir is not your name and that by your birth you are nearly related to a great king  the prince of carency was amazed to hear the queen express herself in these terms and before he could make her any answer nay continued she you will own my knowledge is no fiction when i tell you that you was in misia and taken prisoner by bajazet besides whilst you were in the tower of nicopolis did not you receive very passionate letters and a considerable supply from a lady who to this hour is unknown to you the prince sighed and seeing celima waited an answer it is as your majesty says replied he and since you are so well informed of what has happened to me i beg madam you will tell me who was that charming unknown this request extremely pleased the queen who concealing her satisfaction said to him out of what motive do you desire to know this lady perhaps you may never see her that is a misfortune i fear madam interrupted the prince yet i often flatter myself that some lucky chance will convey me were she is but added the queen in an accent which discovered part of her sentiments is it possible that the memory of a person can be still dear to you who had no other attractive to engage you but her writing a few obliging letters and sending you a sum of money to pay your ransom ah madam replied he there are impressions which never can be effaced and could you conceive the torments i have endured for that unknown you would soon be convinced that one may feel the sharpest darts of love without seeing the influencing object is it then really true said the queen that you are impatient to see her and that she often imploys your thoughts i declare it is sincerely so madam answered the prince and there is nothing i wish more ardently than an opportunity of making my retributions to a lady who has conferred so high an obligation on me well prince said celima smiling i will consult with some favorable genius in order to complete your desire come to me to morrow at the same hour and you shall be farther informed of this subject the prince returned his acknowledgments to her in a most grateful manner and retired to the palace of alhambro with the disguised casilda who was waiting on the terrace  zulema impatient to know what had passed at the abbaicyn repaired soon after to the princes apartment and casilda who perceived they had some matter of importance to communicate to one another feigning to withdraw went and hid herself in a place where she could hear their conversation you think perhaps said the prince to zulema that i have seen felicia and am going to inform you of the particulars of an agreeable rendezvous but instead of that my dear friend i must tell you some demon appeared to me in the shape of an ugly old creature and that i was in the greatest astonishment when the queen of fez came upon the terrace and desired me to follow her into her closet where i no sooner entered but she endeavored to persuade me that she had acquired an extraordinary knowledge by corresponding with good and evil geniuss and in reality she told me every thing relating to my adventure at nicopolis which very much surpised me for she certainly must have been informed of it by the unknown herself whom i believe is now amongst her slaves and i cannot put it out of my head but felicia wrote to me by the queens orders  here the prince was some time silent and zulema spoke to him in these terms i begin to have a thought which appears to me very probable and you may judge of it your self my lord when i have informed you that celima herself was at nicopolis at the time that the christians were defeated by bajazet as you were of the number of the prisoners it is likely she saw you and received an impression besides if you consider the present which was sent you in the tower it could not come from a person of an inferior rank and  you give me such a light into the matter interrupted the prince as opens my eyes at once i cannot call to mind what the queen said to me the day of her arrival and the conversation we have just had together without being convinced that she is my unknown of nicopolis alas into what a labyrinth am i fallen felicia is with her and if she discovers my passion for that lovely creature i fear she will make her feel the effects of her revenge ah cruel destiny cried he am i born only to pass my days in a continual series of woes and have you decreed that i shall never be happy here the tormenting thoughts of his past disappointment came fresh to his mind and interrupting his discourse threw him into so deep a melancholy that even his friend zulema endeavored unsuccessfully to divert it therefore as it was late he took his leave of the prince though extremely concerned at not having it in his power to give him some relief  whilst the prince and zulema were entertaining each other casilda heard their whole conversation and finding she had no hopes left of ever touching the heart of a prince for whom she had already acted many extravagances she resolved on some desperate undertaking her revenge against her rival was more predominant than either the passion she had for the prince or her own honor so that nothing less than the death of the unhappy leonida could satisfy her raging spirit  the queen of fez extremely overjoyed at what the prince of carency had said to her was forming a thousand agreeable projects not doubting but his passion for his unknown of nicopolis was very sincere and that he would be equally transported to find she was the person yet as her jealousy of felicia gave her much uneasiness she thought it prudent first to clear her suspicions on that subject for said she if the prince has seen that beautiful captive he must needs love her therefore i will contrive they shall meet in a place where i may hear their discourse which will give me some insight into the matter  celima immediately sent for felicia and being alone with her i command you said she to be sincere with me consider you are my slave and that your destiny is in my power i can make you happy if you will confess the truth read this continued she showing her the letter which the prince of carency had desired zulema to write do you know the writing felicia read it and having examined it some time told the queen she sincerely could not tell whose hand it was which in some measure satisfied celima yet to be thoroughly convinced in an affair that so nearly concerned her tell me said she have you ever heard of the house of bourbon related to the kings of france felicia at this question did not doubt but the queen knew her and without being any ways out of countenance replied that the name of so illustrious a family was not unknown to her and are you acquainted with any one of that name said celima did not you see the count of la march or the prince of carency when you were in spain no madam answered she i never saw those princes they are entire strangers to me know then felicia interrupted the queen of fez that the person i spoke of and who appeared so charming to me is of the house of bourbon and is called the prince of carency i have a mind you should talk with him and endeavor to penetrate into his sentiments he came here last night when i ordered the governess of the slaves to entertain him but she managed the matter so very ill that i must wholly depend upon you had the queens thoughts been less prepossessed with her project she might have discovered felicias surprise when she heard the prince of carency was the person whom the queen loved and that he was actually in granada but her mind being otherways employed this young slave had time to recover from her disorder and said to celima your pleasure madam is so dear to me that i fear i shall not be able to effect your majestys commands with success for i have but very little experience and should i miscarry in an affair which requires so much prudence i could never forgive myself no replied the queen do not let that give you the least uneasiness i know you better than you know yourself and am persuaded you cannot do any thing amiss but as the moon shines very bright i do not think it proper you should meet the prince on the terrace because i saw many people walking there last night and it would not be convenient i should be seen with him therefore i will give orders that he may be conveyed to the grotto in the wood where you may entertain him till i come to you  felicia having received her instructions retired to her chamber very much troubled which inea peceiving lovely felicia said she do not conceal your thoughts but tell me the cause of your pain ah my dear inea cried felicia nothing but fresh afflictions attend me the prince of carency is in granada and goes by the name of assimir it is he whom the queen loves and by her command i am to have an interview with him this evening what interrupted inea can that give you any uneasiness do you consider that heaven has sent him here to put a period to your miseries he will procure you your liberty and carry you back to your native land where all your wishes will be crowned with felicity whilst unfortunate inea absent from her dear don ramire must pass the remainder of her life in tears and captivity you bewail your destiny replied felicia and you think that my being united to the prince of carency will make mine happier alas you are very much deceived for we have conceived a secret antipathy for each other and must never expect a perfect satisfaction in our alliance besides do you imagine that i can so easily banish the count of la vagne from my thoughts in spite of his infidelity he is still dear to me and it is probable he is now sorry for having offended me at least his eyes tell me so and his repentance may deserve pardon in short inea i believe he loves me but let it be as it will the prince shall not know who i am as he has seen my picture he may call to mind its resemblance therefore i will hid my face so well that he shall not see it inea finding felicia was fixed on that resolution would not any ways oppose it though she was of a contrary opinion  the prince of carency was now thinking on means to convey a letter to felicia in order to know how he might have an opportunity of entertaining her he told his design to zulema who advised him not to write for fear his letter should fall into the hands of the queen of fez but promised him he would contrive some way to speak to her by this time the hour of the princes appointment was near yet he made no great haste to go to the palace for he began to reflect that a second interview with celima would only puzzle him because he believed she was his unknown of nicopolis and that were she informed of his passion for felicia it might prove of a fatal consequence  zulema put him in mind to repair to his rendezvous at last taking the supposed don sanche with him he went with some reluctance to the abbaicyn where he found a mute waiting on the terrace who conveyed him to the grotto felicia came soon after so entirely hidden from head to foot in a large white veil that it was impossible to know her the prince did not doubt in seeing her but it was the same old woman he had met the night before which made him resolve not to have any discourse with her felicia on the other side who felt strange emotions finding her self at that instant with the prince of carency was some time without speaking but she had scarcely broke silence when the prince knowing the voice of his lovely mistress went and flung himself at her feet leonida charming leonida said he what a blessing is this have i found you at last and have you still the same obliging sentiments for me which you had when i was in the house of the traitor benavidez leonida calling to mind what had passed at sallee was grieved at this discourse go said she breaking out into a passion go ungrateful man have you forgot the cause you have given me to upbraid you the prince thinking she was angry that he had concealed his name from her i am guilty madam i confess replied he for not having confided in you i ought to have told you that i was the prince of carency and not have appeared under an other title but the cruel designs of leonora by whose orders i was pursued when i parted from villareal and wounded in the forest where you found me was the occasion i changed my name and took that of the count of la vagne whom i very much resembled this is my only crime divine leonida sure it is not so enormous as to be unpardonable whilst the prince was talking in this manner leonida whose surprise was great had a thousand different imaginations and could not tell what judgment to make at last the prince impatient to hear her speak ah madam said he how much do i dread that you are no more the same for me here you see me at your feet in transports of inexpressible joy whilst you my beauteous mistress are indifferent and melancholy what disobliging sentiments have you received for a man who adores you and whom destiny has decreed to be yours do you consider that i am going to offer up to you the remainder of my life and that from the fatal moment i lost you no torment could be equal to that i endured be assured madam that the prince of carency has a passion for you no ways inferior to that which you found in the count of la vagne i must own to you my lord replied leonida that i cannot believe what i hear for when you were at sallee you even treated me with disdain what greater offense could you give me than to abandon me as you did and go away with olympia doria whom you passionately loved do you think my senses could deceive me or that i am not capable of resenting the perfidy i cannot tell to this hour whether you are the prince of carency or the count of la vagne but what i am certain of is that you are the person who has highly injured me and it would be a shameful weakness in me to pardon you these words strangely confounded the prince who believed his dear leonidas mind was discomposed and what confirmed this opinion was his being persuaded that the count of la vagne perished at sea in his return from nicopolis and that olympia doria died in her fathers house at genoa these were circumstances he could no ways doubt of and as for his voyage to sallee he had never been there so that he looked on all her reproaches as visionary which threw him into a despairing condition yet he would not let her perceive the trouble he was in nor what occasioned it but continued speaking to her in a very obliging manner you do me a great deal of wrong charming leonida said he to her sighing and i should not find it a very hard task to justify myself though i fancy i have the most cause to complain what must i judge of the letter you writ to casilda when you and benavidez contrived your going off which was a thing i could never have believed you guilty of and what shall i conjecture from your being at constantinople and the grand seigniors passion for you leonida heard the prince with astonishment and thought likewise he knew not what he said she could not imagine how a man of so good sense could talk after such an extravagant manner and as her affection was more predominant than her resentment she was sensibly grieved at his misfortune who i my lord cried she did i write to casilda or give my consent to benavidezs insolent behavior and was i ever in turkey these things are so new to me and so far from being true that i cannot bear to hear em how long have you entertained these chimeras here she took the princes hand and could not restrain her tears which proof of her tenderness with the other circumstances so thoroughly touched him that he was soon convinced of her sincerity let us do justice to each other most amiable leonida said the prince printing an ardent kiss on her fair hand be assured i never was false to you i should be willing to satisfy you interrupted leonida could i forget the adventure which happened to me lately at sallee she then recited to him her whole story with so much wit and coherence that he perceived what he had taken for an effect of lunacy was supported by solid appearances therefore having explained matters they came to a right understanding which created unspeakable transports in these two lovers  one may easily imagine the consternation of casilda who had heard their whole discourse and was distracted to see so perfect a sympathy between leonida and the prince all her perifidiousness as well as her brothers was laid open and seeing herself frustrated of those hopes which had flattered her till then she had like in her excessive despair to have entered the grotto with a full design to stab leonida but as she considered that the prince would prevent the blow and disappoint her revengful attempt she deferred her wicked action till she found a fairer opportunity of executing it  after leonida and the prince of carency had given each other reciprocal assurances of their joy and affection they consulted how they should behave themselves toward the queen of fez till they could find an opportunity of going off while they were on this subject the queen came to the grotto but i must tell you what prevented her from repairing thither sooner  as celima was coming out of her apartment they told her that mahomet was in the palace and had something of the highest importance to communicate to her she had given orders that no body should be admitted that evening yet as that princes visit seemed to import some weighty matter she would not refuse seeing him mahomet addressing the queen told her that mula favorite to abelhamar was just arrived from fez with a letter to her from his master and that being a particular acquaintance of his he had applied to him for a private audience which if she was pleased to grant he would immediately send for him though celima was very impatient to be at her rendezvous with the prince of carency yet on this occasion she was forced to yield to her politics fearing that if she should defer this affair till the next day mahomet might suspect she was employed in some more agreeable occupation therefore having assented to mulas admittance he came and threw himself at the queens feet and presented her with a letter from the prince his master which was written in these terms  though i have an indisputable right to the kingdom of fez and am now in the possession of it yet i am willing madam to yield up one half of it to you upon condition that you will give me felicia before i had seen her nothing could be equal to my ambition but now her charms have made so deep an impression in my heart that all other passions have submitted to my transcendent love i can never be happy without her and if i am indebted to you for the possession of that lovely creature half my kingdom will be too small a return for so high an obligation therefore grant me but your slave and i will acknowledge you for my sovereign  abelhamar   celima having read this letter in the presence of mahomet they both admired abelhamars passion for felicia and as mahomets vows were already dedicated to the queen of fez he was overjoyed to find that this occasion afforded her sure means of recovering at least one part of her dominions he joined with mula in his proposals and offered to go himself with felicia to sallee in order to bring back with him such hostages from abelhamar as should warrant the performance of the treaty celima with a gracious air returned mahomet thanks and assured him she should never forget the generous manner in which he espoused her interest but as abelhamars proposals required some consideration she desired her answer might be suspended till the next day then mula withdrew and left the prince there who took so great a pleasure in entertaining the queen that he did not retire till it was late which gave time to the prince of carency and his mistress to take some measures relating to their particular affairs  mahomet having taken leave of the queen she immediately went to the grotto where being entered leonida out of respect retired and left her alone with the prince of carency this lovely captive was walking in the wood with her thoughts entirely employed on the happiness she proposed to herself through the means of her faithful lover but alas fate was preparing a new tragedy casilda still under a mans disguise distracted with jealousy at what she had just heard and seeing her rival walking alone thought she might easily pierce her heart before any one could come to her assistance so running up to her like a fury she drew out her poinard and plunged it into leonidas breast who fell with the blow crying out for help and calling the prince of carency at which name casilda was possessed with such inhuman rage that she repeated her blows the grotto not being distant the prince was struck at the mournful accents of his wounded mistress and leaving the queen suddenly he made haste toward the place where he heard leonidas voice he saw her lying on the ground bathed in blood and perceived don sanche running away which convinced him that he was the murderer he immediately pursued him and with his sword run him through after he had thus revenged unfortunate leonida he came up to her but oh what a lamentable condition did he find her in she expressed herself with painful sighs and had searce strength enough to take her lovers hand which made him fear her beauteous eyes were going to yield up all their charms to that universal conqueror death  how shall i here paint the disconsolate state of our unhappy prince he was resolved not to survive so great a misfortune and had already turned the point of his sword to his breast when the queen who had followed him out of the grotto interposed and prevented him from acting his own death she repeated her shrieks in so pressing a manner that the guards immediately came up to her and soon after most of her attendants with a great number of flambeaux which showed all the horror of this tragic scene it was not long before they were informed of it at the palace of alhambro the two princes mahomet and osmin came to the abbaicyn with mula and another gentleman who had accompanied him in his voyage from sallee in short the wood was full of people who were in a strange consternation leonida wounded lying in the arms of a despairing prince who was near losing his mistress moved all hearts with compassion  on the other hand casilda that wretched creature was tearing open her wounds to hasten her deserved death zulema approached her and still thinking she was a man ah barbarous villain that you are cried he to her what demon urged you to commit a crime so black tell me what had innocent felicia done to you and how came you to murder her in this cruel manner i am casilda replied she with a furious air and she was my rival go to your friend and he will tell you the rest these were the last and only words she pronounced with her expiring breath  though leonidas life was despaired of yet the surgeons were sent for who used all their skill to stop the bleeding of her wounds which they dressed and having assisted her with proper remedies her spirits began to revive she opened her weak eyes then fixed them on the prince who held her in his arms and appeared in as great want of relief as his dying mistress at last they took her from him and carried her by the queens order to her chamber where she was laid in bed and inea who had a tender affection for leonida staid by her almost inconsolable for the unlucky accident which had happened to her illustrious companion she was so sensibly touched at it that even the presence of don ramire could not mitigate her excessive grief he was just arrived from fez where he had been in expectation of finding his dear inea who had sent him a letter whilst he was at morocco to acquaint him with her captivity but before he could reach sallee the queen was embarked which obliged him to wait there for a favorable opportunity of coming over to granada and as about this time mula was setting out for that kingdom he took his passage in the same ship  osmin who had a real passion for leonida was thoroughly concerned at her misfortune and as for the queen of fez she could not help being moved at this dismal adventure though she prudently concealed her thoughts the prince of carencys mournful complaints too well confirmed her suspicions in relation to his sentiments for leonida and she saw him possessed with so violent a despair that she had no room left for any hopes no not even to come to an agreement with abelhamar for in the first place she was convinced that should leonida die of her wounds her death would render his proposals of no effect and on the other hand she foresaw that if she recovered the prince would claim her as one perhaps he had loved a long time and whom he intended to marry  as for mula he was so amazed that he could scarcely believe his own eyes for though he was present when his master fought the brave count of la vagne and killed him and that he saw him give up his last breath in olympias arms yet he could not be persuaded but the prince of carency was that same count so great was their resemblance  the prince all this while was like a man whose senses had abandoned him and in that condition the queen of fez gave orders that he should be carried into one of the apartments of the abbaicyn where being laid on a bed his wound opened afresh and there gushed from it a great quantity of blood which alarmed all his friends particularly osmin who looked on him as his rival and notwithstanding showed a sincere trouble for his misfortune as well as his generous friend zulema  no body could now tell who was in the greatest danger the prince of carency or leonida they both continued extremely ill his excessive grief for the condition of his beloved mistress retarded his recovery till they assured him there was hopes of her life which agreeable news caused so wonderful an effect in him that his wound was soon healed and in a few days he was able to visit her who was also in no small concern for the state of her lovers health the presence of this lovely prince had so great an influence on her that it contributed likewise to her speedy recovery his daily attendance and tender care gave her more relief than all the remedies which the surgeons applied to her wounds and it may be said that as love was the author of the pains and disasters of these constant lovers he was also their physician and comfort no satisfaction could be equal to theirs not is it possible to conceive the endearing expressions they mutually exchanged during their illness  by this time it was known through the means of inea that leonida was daughter to don john of velasco and zulema having mentioned casildas name she also informed the court of her being of the family of the benavidezs and related to them the whole story as she had heard it from leonida  as to the prince of carencys name it was not long kept a secret celima told the king of granada who he was which added so much to the esteem he had already acquired through his personal merit that he received all possible marks of honor from the king who went often to see him after this unhappy adventure and endeavoring to console the prince amongst other obliging expressions he told him he restored him to his liberty for which he desired no other ransom than his friendship and that had he known sooner of his being of the house of bourbon he would have shown him all the distinction that was due to so illustrious a family  the prince who now saw leonida out of danger was very willing to retrieve his liberty at any rate he readily accepted of the king of granadas generous offer and returned him thanks for that and the many other favors he had conferred on him since the time he was taken prisoner  celima notwithstanding leonida was her rival extremely pitied her and ordered that all the attendance imaginable should be given her she also visited the prince who laying aside the respect due to her rank received her with so much indifferency that she resolved never more to speak to him of his unknown of nicopolis  the mean while the king of granada who was desirous to complete the prince of carencys good fortune and had a design at the same time to oblige the spaniards thought on means to procure leonida her liberty he therefore addressed himself to the queen of fez offering her whatever sum she would please to demand for the ransom of that young lady but celima whose greatness of spirit was equal to her passion resolved no sovereign should surpass her in generosity the prince of carency being a christian and in love with her slave was enough to make her determine never to think of him more she told the king of granada that far from requiring any ransom for leonida she desired he would accept and dispose of her as he thought fit and that not only leonida but all the rest of her slaves were at his command if agreeable to him the king heard with pleasure celimas answer and in his turn gallantly presented leonida to the prince of carency who received her with inexpressible marks of joy and gratitude but could not find words to make a retribution suitable to the present  the chief and only care of these happy lovers consisted now in giving each other daily proofs of their tender affection their long and cruel disappointments made their felicity the greater and though they were not as yet perfectly recovered they were proposing means to leave granada in order to perform the promise which their parents had made for them in their infant years the prince wrote to don john of velasco at villareal acquainting him with the particulars of his and leonidas fortune and withal that he hoped soon to be the happiest of mankind  mula seeing his masters designs were rendered impracticable through this adventure between the prince of carency and leonida went back to sallee and gave abelhamar an account of what had passed which news so cruelly affected him that the loss of his mistress had like to have made him act his own death but as an evincement of the greatness of his passion he took a resolution proportionable to it for having renounced to the crown of fez he retired to a castle on the seaside where he consecrated the remainder of his life to the dear memory of his felicia celima soon received advice of this unexpected change and as mahomet was extremely sollicitous to serve her in so favorable a conjuncture he entreated the king of granada his father to give him a fleet and some forces in order to reinstate the queen of fez which being granted he took the command entirely upon himself and convoyed her to sallee where far from meeting with any opposition she found all things in a perfect tranquillity by this time her mind was more at ease for having considered that she could no longer hope to receive an obliging return to the passion she had for the prince of carency she thought nothing would sooner effect it is cure than approving mahomets vows therefore being of too haughty a temper to bear with the disdain of the one and gratitude pleading in behalf of the other she at once resolved to give her hand and all her affection to mahomet who by this alliance saw his love and ambition satisfied  celima before she parted from granada restored inea to her liberty and don ramire took her with him to toledo where these two lovers by a happy union received the reward of their constancy  what i have farther to add relating to the prince of carency and leonida is that as soon as they were in a condition to set out on their journey they took leave of the king of granada who made them considerable presents and ordered several noblemen with a strong detachment of his guards to conduct them as far as the frontiers of spain whence they proceeded to villa real where they were received with a satisfaction equal to the occasion their long sufferings entitled them to such blessings as hardly any who wore the chains of love could expect leonida in whom so many perfections were assembled was too great a prize for an indifferent hero and the prince of carency whose accomplishments rendered him one of the finest gentlemen of his time might justly claim a place in her affection in short where so much virtue and merit was united love must be triumphant then let us leave the prince and leonida to the bounteous care of hymen whose soft endearments could only recompense their past misfortunes and crown their days with true felicity  finis
