life or the adventures of william ramble esquire  by the author of modern times or the adventures of gabriel outcast  in three volumes vol ii  london printed for dr trusler and sold at the literary press no    wardourstreet soho        the adventures of will ramble esquire chap xv rattle called on his friend ramble and took him with him to the shakespeare the members had assembled some time they consisted of a motley group of all classes all complexions and all nations the chair was filled with old noisy a man of some consequence in the opinion of the society and more so in his own he was one who had long been the bellweather of the flock a man with a sullen countenance and hanging eyebrows that prevented his eyes declaring the mischief brooding in his heart he hated kings and kingsmen but it was only because he was not on the list himself this man had been haranguing the company for near an hour and an half and had not done yet he was when ramble entered on the subject of republicanism monarchy said he could only be the invention of tyrants who wished to enslave the people and make them subservient to their own purposes if kings had no such wish what were they idols puppets to whose office was annexed a troublesome and ridiculous  nay i may call it a blasphemous ceremony assuming that homage that should be paid only to the deity an office to which the good sense of the people is sacrificed and a million of their money yearly why are we gentlemen to work hard  why is the honest shoemaker the tailor the buttonmaker the turner and a thousand other respectable tradesmen to deprive their wives and children of comfort and necessaries to cloth amuse and pamper a gilded puppet it is true i have no wife nor child at least such as i would call so but nevertheless i feel for you all  god knows my heart  i speak not from private interest whether we have a king or no king it is all the same to me i have no money that i care a fig for what i win to day i lose tomorrow and what i may lose tomorrow i may win the day after to a single man lifes a lottery he is the child of fortune the world contributes to support me one feeds me another clothes me and if i cannot pay them in cash i will in breath no man shall stop may mouth words are the only things i have to give and i will never spare them if they choke my utterance above i will pour them forth below a f  t for them all i care not who leaves me or who keeps with me i can stand without support ask mother a  she will vouch for me i have no wife or children but you it is for you and you only that i have struggled through life and for you i will struggle whilst i have lungs and spirits  in short gentlemen you are always sure of me i am a republican all over will oppose depotism vi et armis and fight for your interest pedibusque manibusque  till i am in place mr president i shall nae think that administration consults its own interest they ought to ha their friends aboot them says saunders macpherson a brawny scotchman who sat impatiently waiting for an opportunity of venting his sarcasms it would be happy for his maajesty if au his friends were as muckle in his interest as saunders macpherson who has traveled in his kirtle far over the highlands in defense of prerogative an ye had any discernment you would ken the blessings of the present establishment before our good jamie sat on the throne of this country ye were aw a parcel of raggamuffins like the sans culottes at paris running your heeds against each other in search of a scurvey lassie ye call leeberty who has played you money a shrewd trick she showed you a bonny visage to mack you in loov wi her and then turned her ragged breech upon you it was oor jamie that taught you to be weese he took the dirk out of your hands that you might not cut your fingers and let you ken that happiness was in aw your reach has not he and his successors given sic encouragement to trade and commerce that you may if you please indulge your luxuries nay your very veeces ha they not put you in the way to get sic penty of pouns that you may throw them awa and be nae the poorer for what you lack in cash you find in credit there is yon bonny chield johnny latitat that will tell you the same he will tell you that he has mair pouns than he kens what to do wi where then in the name of st andrew is there cause of grumbling why winna you be content money appears of so little value in the present happy times that each man seems to ha mair of it than he wishes or he winna part wi it so reedily we are aw sensible of the condescension of oor government  are not the kings meenisters ready for a little of this stuff which is of nae value and which we seem to set nae store by to gee us permeession to use oor aine jades to employ our aine servants to breathe the fresh air and enjoy the leeght of the day and that we may nae want a quantity of money to pay for sic indulgencies what can be maer considerate than to leemit our amusements and keep us frae spending our time idly that gued hearted man jamie departed frae his aine fertile country to take up his residence in south britain where your finest prospects without a mountain are nae mair to be compared with the prospects of the north than a lassie with fine eyne and good complexion but without and nose in her face is to ane who has every striking feature you may tell us that he was glad to get into the south that he might taste your peaches and your nectarines and your other fine fruits but in gued troth where would ha been sic fruits but for the gardeners of north britain who are as far preferable to the fruits as the creator is to the created every country has its boast england may have a good cleemet for peaches and nectarines it may excel in arts as france does in wine arabia in horses and spain in wool but i declare by st andrew no country can produce better men and women than scotland they are oor staple commodity they are au men of learning and we export a great number to enrich other countries even london is the better for them and you ought to be thankful that our jamie led the way had he been weese and steed in his aine country you would now ha been as savage as your ancestors but he removed himsel here made london the capital of scotland and held his court at st jamess which is little better than an hospital when he might have figured away with more splendour and comfort in holyrood house in edinburgh so that do ye ken maester president jamie coming to london brought au our nobeelity and gentry here too and here they are spending their estates among an ungrateful rabble what would england ha been but for the union  she has grown wealthy she has acquired a million and a half of friends that would otherwise ha been her enemies she has acquired security there is no door open now by which the french can penetrate your country they dare as soon be d  nd as attempt to invade scotland so that if you can but defend your own coasts you may bid the deel kiss your weem yet ye are au grumbling ye are nae grateful nor contented but ye want to pull down your monarch and become as savage as your forefathers in guede troth mr president we are under great obligation to gevernment and ought to be very proud os our king  that dunderhead mr chairman that rails at all measures that do not accord with his inclinations says neddy turncoat a stout tall man who had once been of another way of thinking than when he rose up to speak and who then took the part of opposition because he thought opposition was on the eve of getting into place that dunderhead says he discovers very little sagacity and can have no retrospect to the excellence of the british constitution he is a mere creature of his own fancy and illumined only by the glare of a deceitful meteor the ignis fatuus of a shallow mind that leads him into bottomless bogs and over dreadful precipices the man who lifts his hand against the present government reminds me of the giant in mother gooses tales who in the intemperence of his wrath tore up a vast oak by the roots and brandished it in his hand crying fee fau fum i smell the blood of an englishman i am a plain man mr chairman and love to use plain word and when i speak of the constitution of this country i speak the language of a plain citizen not versed in oratory or bred in the school of rhetoric when i speak of the three estates of the realm the king the lords and the common i approach the commons with respect the lords with deference and the king with awe i consider each as a check upon the other and each incapable of doing any harm but collectively it is like the tria in uno where the whole combined is perfect and where one power cannot act but in union with the other two all must be wrong or each must be right whoever then shall gainsay this trinity is a blasphemer of the state an incendiary a seditious fellow running about with a torch in his hand to set fire to the constitution he is a second guy faux attempting to blow up both houses of parliament a wretch that covets only as do that desperate assembly on the other side the water to embrue his hands in his countrys blood and after all was the genius of this isle to withdraw its patronage and exclude it from the orb of its influence was a revolution to take place a subversion of things to ensue and the reverend bishops degraded and made to starve as do the french prelates in a foreign garret upon sixpence a day was the dignity of the peerage to be trampled on and their august house laid in ruins in short was our wise and keensighted monarch tumbled from his throne these miscreants that bellow forth equality these fireandfaggot men these incendiaries of the state these murderers of the peace and happiness of mankind might have their wish they might huzza and trample over the devastatation they occasion but what would it all tend to  order order order was vociferously called for by the opposition part of the room and patrick oconner an irishman was louder than the rest  i beg lave mr president said he to call the jontleman that spoke last to order and to tell him a little bit of a secret that those who contend for leeberty are neither torchcarriers incendiaries nor murderers that patrick oconner that is to say my own self is one of the leebertyboys in dublin but though i was born in that city i am nevertheless do you see an englishman it matters not at all where a man is born he is not a horse becase he was born in a stable our principles mr president are to overtrow arbitrary power tyranny and insolence and little patrick oconner will never be wanting in his part whilst he is able to wield a shilelah let me tell you that our constitution is no constitution at all at all that the law was given as tommy pain says by a rogue of a conqueror whose name i have forgot and it would be well for this country if the dukes and the lords of manors do you see forgot it too we should have no such squabbling about a silly hare or an insignificant partridge the feudal system mr president which by the bye is a system of oppression was introduced by this same conqueror and the government in that mans hands was a government of despotism when he parcelled out the lands which he took from their right owners among his banditti he gave the staff out of his own hands for in a short space of time instead of one tyrant in this country there were many  fait and you may say that too there were two or three hundred these men governed instead of the king and gave one of the henrys i am told the deel burn him leisure to play the same game in ireland and enslave our dear sweet country as well as his own the consequence of this mr president was that instead of kings ruling the barons the barons ruled the kings and were far greater tyrants than he who created them upon this do you see the kings of england took the alarm and called an assembly of the people that the nation might not be overrun with aristocrates but these overbearing fellows i understand did not part with all their power but said to the commons if you sit in one house to take care of yourselves we will sit in another to take care of ourselves and the king god bless him shall sit in a house alone be his own president and take care of himself so that you see mr president here are your tree estates of the empire as that jontleman says who spoke last and was called to order so that we are all now to take care of ourselves and by my fait and conscience patrick oconnor will be the first to do this in short it appears to me that these tree estates with the privilege of interrupting each other have the great power of doing noting at all what then is this mighty constitution we boast so much of a mere bubble the people it is true have in some measure acquired the asscendency have mollified and filed down do you see the knots and rugged points of the cudgel held over them but the cudgel like my shilalah is strong and tough enough to make them smart we have we have heard gentlemen a great deal  you may talk of your privileges till you are tired i see none equal to that of being at leeberty to stop a fools mouth by st patrick i wish i had the stopping of all your mouths you would then talk a little more to the purpose  if you are for levelling why do it by halves  if you level one ting and not another do you see it will be like hill and dale  there will be be no equality i am for overtrowing the whole together down with the lawyers let us trust to ourselves down with the churches we can pray in our closets down with the army we can fight our own battles down with the whigs and down with the tories and we shall be all of one party this will be something like an equality and then he who has the strongest arm will claim the biggest share  it has always been the study of administration mr chairman since i have known what administration is says jack latitat who was one of the company to do good to society and consult their ease their happiness and interest i defy any man within his own memory to deny the truth of this assertion politicians may differ in opinion and oppose but that opposition if they would speak their honest sentiments rises only from jealousy at their not being employed in the affairs of government and from envy of those who are employed look to all the acts of the state and tell me if they have not a good tendency and that if any measure has not answered the expectation of parliament it has not been immediately altered there is nothing i see to complain of but an injudicious expenditure sometimes of the public money and why may not this be the case as well under a republican government as in the present state of things i admit that the influence of the minister in the house of commons is an evil that requires to be remedied but the remedy lies with the people if the electors of this kingdom would be steady and firm lay down certain rules for their representatives to follow and determine to elect no man who should deviate from the instructions he receives one who has any apparent connection with the upper house or who holds any place under government the evil by such perseverance would in time cease but the electors are such blockheads as to sell themselves and then wonder at being sold this brings me mr chairman to the subject i was called on to explain by the scotch gentleman in the corner he says money seems to have little value and that i can tell you the same there is a kind paradox in this seldom do we meet with any thing of intrinsic value but it carries that value in its face or appearance not so in money that it is a thing of inestimable value is evident for to what lengths will not men go to get possession of it they will run into every excess into every absurdity and into every vice they will swear flatter vilify abuse cheat play the fool speak the truth lie squander scrape together plunder nay even murder to acquire it get money if you can honestly said a writer of antiquity but however get money and when they have with great pains got it what do they with it but throw it away on things of little or no value the origin of all this absurdity is that the age is vicious and unprincipled that men are looked up to not for their abilities their services or good works but for their property and wealth see a man passing by meanly clad tell your friend that man is worth  00000l and he stares at him again and again but tell him there goes a good man or there goes a man of great abilities and he passes unnoticed now as the eyes of all men are turned upon riches and that man is coeteris paribus most respected who has most money every man tries to outvie his neighbor and to make the best appearance he can  keep up appearances there lies the text the would will give thee credit for the rest churchill under this notion he lives beyond his income and thus lives a great deal upon the credit his tradesmen give him he spends that money for them which they have not the spirit to spend for themselves tradesmen in this case are not to be pitied it is only the biter bit what leads men in trade to give uncommon credit but to induce fools and spendthrifts to deal with them and to enable them to demand an inequitable and enormous profit all ending in the love of that pelf which when they have got they rather throw away than make a proper use of extortion thus robs itself and verifys the old proverb grasp all lose all i am one who is up to all this i study to punish the extortioner in doing this i enjoy many of the good things in life which would otherwise escape me there is an old law subsisting by prescription that puts a rod in the hand of the extortioner to punish those who attempt to punish him i mean the law of arrest this is doubtless a law of oppression and owing to the great chicanery of this law might overcomes right thousands of villains get their bread and one man can trample upon another but government profits by this villainy and suffers it to go on this like the venality of parliament is an evil that calls loudly for redress but it does not follow that a new system of government is necessary on this account or any other indeed the last evil i complain of i mean the law of attachment is no evil to me i make a virtue of necessity have the myrmidons out of the purses of those who employ them upon the whole mr chairman the government is no great eyesore to me the evils of life i reconcile to myself pass by the indifferent get out of the way of the worst and scramble through them as well as i can  latitat casting his eyes on his friend ramble pushed his way up to him said he presumed he had heard nonsense enought for one night and took him away  chap xvi the colonel had been in town some weeks and had heard nothing of miss raspe but still had little to apprehend having when he left scotland given her full directions how to find him and having ordered flint to make a rapid march to liverpool to reconnoitre the enemys camp watch their motions and when he could gain intelligence of mr raspe and his daughter leaving liverpool to make the best of his way to london and acquaint him with it flint had a deal of sly cunning about him and was very adequate to the task nor had the colonel reason to fear he would throw himself in mr raspes way so as to alarm his suspicions  bridget lady dashits waiting woman never lost sight of the scheme she had planned of imposing dangles valet on her mistress in the character of a gentleman in order to get at her fortune and divide it between them for this purpose she was frequently with him at dangles lodgings when his master was out i will therefore lay before my readers a further dialogue of this hero and heroine as taken down upon toms examination you must mind now says bridget when they next met how you act and take care not to betray yourself i have prepared my lady to receive you some morning of which i will let you know the day before mind now you must not be slobbering and kissing her all the time you are there as you do me she is a mighty woman for decency and decorum an occasional kiss welltimed is all that is necessary i shall contrive to be present at least some part of the time and watch your motions mind  you are to be sir thoma flam i have told her you have a great estate in yorkshire  000l a year be very generous as to settlements and all that and you may do what you please with her  tom suppose i should be known by any of your fellow servants  bridge i will take care that william shall be out and i dont believe you are known to any one else after the first interview you may appoint to meet her at any other place tom admiring himself you must not be admiring yourself but admire her say all the tender things you can  tom let tom alone for that i believe he has as much to say to the women and knows as well how to please them as any gentleman in town  bridge come let us see how you will begin practice a little upon me  tom we shall be interrupted  bridge dont be afraid of that  looking round i see no one in the way  tom well then i will begin thus with a distant bow bows affectedly and then i will advance with a respectful look  and with  happy my dear madam is sir thomas  what is my name  bridge flam  tom ay flam  happy my dear madam is sir thomas flam in the opportunity you have been pleased to indulge him with of throwing himself at your feet kneels and takes bridget by the hand and declaring how much he adores you  bridget and is that the way you mean to begin i thought a lover at the first meeting always saluted his mistress i would not give a pins point for any other introduction  tom still kneeling i am coming to that  and permit me in the warmth of my passion to approach your sweet lips and say kisses her warmly i could dwell on them the whole day  bridget breaking from him almost breathless this i think will do but dont imagine tom that when you are married i shall suffer you to be inattentive to me if you have any fondness for her afterward i shall be as jealous as the devil for my great failing is that i love you too well  tom my dear bridget  never doubt me  you shall have all my affections and  half her money  chap xvii to give my reader a farther insight into spatters character whose lying disposition often brought him into hot water i will lay before him a dialogue that passed between him rattle dangle and saunter one morning in a retired part of st james park as it was related to my friend will the next morning rattle dangle and saunter were first together walking rattle asked dangle among other things concerning the strange tale that was all the town over  yes adds saunter with his usual spleen yawning as if he had been up all night and scarce able to keep up with his company that you was turned out of some girls house for daring to make a proposal to her  no no says rattle that is not the story how was it dangle  you are pleased gentlemen returned he to be very merry at my expense  there was no turning out in he case nor any proposal thought of  that i will be sworn says rattle addressing himself to saunter for he never had resolution to propose to any woman  nor if he had returned saunter would any woman listen to him he has not address sufficient to draw attention this nettled dangle and he retorted upon saunter was i blessed with your vivacity yawning and dragging his legs after him in imitation of saunter and rhetoric i might perhaps stand a little chance i had rather be asleep all my life replied saunter than be treated with the contempt the girls treat you with dangle now grew warm said the whole was a trumped up affair and not a syllable of truth in any part of it  nay said rattle saunters my author  and saunter spatters mine spatter at this instant joined them did not you tell me spatter says saunter laughing that dangle was turned out of some girls house for daring to make a proposal of marriage to her spatter now was gravelled he first eyed dangle then saunter conscious of having said so and knowing it was false he knew not how well to bring himself off but as those who are continually telling lies are always on the look out for resources to excuse themselves spatter cries out starting and lifting up his eyes me  lord lord how stories are perverted by carrying  what i said was with a view of raising dangle in the opinion of his friends  he  you know is said to want resolution  and i sir replies dangle angrily and interrupting him spatter still at a loss how to proceed continued resolution i mean with respect to the women  how you take me up  that is to say you wait upon them for years and trifle with them now i wished to have it known that is by no mean the case  on saunters saying dangle will never get a wife for the women despise him  i beg your pardom says i  i beg your pardon many a girl would be glad to have him but he is a man of discernment and will not tie himself where he is not likely to be happy  did not you returned saunter staring in spatters face with a look of resentment did not you say that he was turned out of doors spatter who now began to wish himself any where but where he was replied you shall hear what i said if you have but patience rattle continuing saunters method of address ay and that they slapped the door in his face and saunter again without suffering spatter to reply and that he was forbidden to come there any more spatter now losing all temper cried no  no  no  uttering each no with a degree of increased vociferation it is impossible gentlemen to go on if i am to be so interrupted  then lowering his tone let me see  recollecting himself where was i  oh that dangle was a man of discernment and would not fix where there was not a prospect of happiness  where there was not a prospect of happiness so far says i from his trifling with the women to my certain knowledge he made a proposal of marriage the other day to a very respectable lady whom i could name if i thought proper but with whom he could not succeed from an unconquerable aversion she had to him here rattle laughed heartily at dangle and cried go on spatter  let us have it  all the women hate him saunter who was half asleep at this part of the story but who was roused by rattles noise starts and cries how how i lost that   where is the wonder says rattle to him  why was not you awake  dangle now addressed himself to spatter seriously asking him what he meant by representing things so falely told him he was a mongrel between ill nature and false art and might be well classed with these creatures whom god never made what aversion continued he could she have to me spatter now grew warm and declared he never said any such thing how can i go on said he with the relation if you break in upon me so often  i said unconquerable aversion to it  that is to matrimony winking at rattle and saunter i could never suppose any woman could have an aversion to you no that would be unnatural sneering and saying to himself i must get out of this d  md difficulty some way aversion to it were the words that is to marriage for unaccountable as it is some women are averse to it there is lady bab squeamish and many more i could mention of the same turn  and that this lady to whom you proposed requested time to consider of it  that was all upon my soul gentlemen if your ears are so treacherous as to mislead your understandings i must lock up my mouth in future saunter are you for the billiard table i am says he yawning agreeable to any thing  for continues rattle imitating saunter he has nothing to do saunter is a man of great business and is jaded to death every day with doing nothing eating drinking sleeping  every thing fatigues him he is too lazy even to put his own clothes on  dont call it laziness said spatter you do him wrong it is a philosophic indolence the work of a mind weaned from all the pursuits of life  no no returned rattle it is a constitutional idleness so idle is he that i believe if he was under the necessity of working for his living he would suffer himself to perish with hunger   you are a lazy fellow spatter but you love to talk but even talking tires saunter  i wish returned saunter to rattle talking tired you i will own to you that there is not any thing so tiresome to oneself as an idle life but the less a man says the less nonsense he broaches and the less tiresome he is to others verbum sapienti if the cap fits you rattle wear it  come gentlemensays dangle dont let us be sparring here let us adjourn to the table and try if we can get into better humor saunter dropping his hat begged of rattle to pick it up for him not i says rattle you have nothing to do you know and therefore may stoop for it yourself he then applied to dangle for the same purpose rot me if i do said dangle he asked spatter but spatter also refusing was obliged to stoop for it himself but did it with that difficulty attendant upon indolence and picking up his hat he dropped his stick which he thus addressed i will not be at the trouble of stooping again for you however you may lie there till the next person comes by and if he picks you up he will deserve you  chap xviii my friend will who in the goodness of his heart having been security for one of his acquaintances for the sum of  00l signed a bond in judgment for the same was now called on in a hostile manner for the money and not being master of that sum was arrested and his goods taken in execution with a degree of imprudence on a presumption that he should marry miss raspe and in order that he might have a place to bring her to he took a house in london and furnished it elegantly and thus stripped himself of the best part of his ready eash he had some securities as i have mentioned which his father left him and he meant to raise money on the same not only for himself but for his friend charles simple that young gentleman however having settled his matters with his wifes father stood not in need of it of course ramble having as he thought sufficient for his present exigencies deferred making any application for more and not being provided for this unexpected call was hurried away to the house of a sheriffs officer spatter soon heard of it hasted to lady dashits with the news and meeting with her ladyship and miss trevor together bless me ladies said he almost out of breath i have the most unfortunate piece of news to tell you  the most unlucky circumstance the ladies were alarmed and lady dashit interrupted him with not very bad i hope  bad returned he  poor colonel ramble  i am so distressed i hardly know how to ralate it miss trevor was ready to faint and saying in a low voice she hoped nothing had happened to the colonel lady dashit wishing to smother it said no not to colonel ramble and said to spatter for gods sake dont mention the colonel here  and winking at him you have nothing to tell us about colonel ramble but he not taking the hint went on it is all about ramable  had it happened to any other person it would not have affected me miss trevor rather recovered enquired if he had met with any accident any fall or wound no maam said spatter he has not fallen into a bog nor into a millpond that would be nothing there would be some hopes of getting him out from thence  but he has fallen at these words miss trevor had nearly fainted a second time and lady dashit could not help saying to spatter see what your foolish tongue does  i will lay my life after all it is nothing of any consequence adding angrily where has he fallen  into the hands of the lawyers  said spatter is that of no consequence rot me if i would not as soon have fallen from a housetop  that returned lady dashit i long expected you fee my dear emily addressing herself to miss trevor who was now in little better spirits how this mighty accident turns out at which you were so much alarmed i am answered miss trevor of mr spatters opinion that a man cannot have a worse thing happen to him than to fall into the hands of the lawyers so say i miss trevor returned spatter so say i be kind enough says miss trevor to tell us the particulars i am anxious to know them  i thought you would returned spatter  that made me hurry so fast here i have not stopped at any one place since i heard it but to drop a hint of it at lady babs and at another house or two in my way  that is to say observed lady dashit aside totrumpet it all the town over miss trevor with a well disposed heart remarked that if he was in any difficulty it must have been goodnature that brought him into it but spatter with that rancour that led him to misconstrue the best actions replied what you are pleased to call goodnature i call folly his good natured actions arise from ostentation i would take care of myself before i thought of others selfpreservation is the first law of nature and he that does not attend to it deserves no pity  if i have not been misinformed said miss trevor you mr spatter have experienced the good effects of his attention  aye added lady dashit and a grateful man will never forget past services  dont apprehend lady dashit retorted spatter snearingly that i am under any obligations to colonel ramble what he has done for me were mere acts of civility no madam i have always taken care to avoid being under obligations to a man of his stamp  well returns miss trevor we will not enter into that i wish only to know his present situation  unwilling as i am answered spatter to enter into this unhappy affair of rambles for with all his faults i have a regard for him and i hate gossiping mortally i cannot but obey your commands you must know then ladies that the colonel was imprudent enough to be security for sam careless to extricate him from a difficulty he entered into a bond of  00 l sam has left him in the lurch ramble is arrested on the bond and an execution is sent into his house  that is all miss trevor observed it was but a trifling sum to a man of his fortune  trifling as it is returns spatter it has lodged him in a spunginghouse lady dashit asked him if he meant to call on him there observing it would be humane in his friends to do it now spatter ter said he would not see him for the world he had to great a regard for him and it would affect him too much besides his time was too much taken up  i have more than twenty places to call at this day could ill spare the time to slip in here only i was eager to acquaint you with the news  and as lady dashit observed to emily aside lest any other should do it before him  miss trevor was quite unhappy at this account and was determined if she could contrive it so as that the colonel should not know from what quarter his release came to send the money for his discharge  when a man falls into the hands of the lawyers he cannot generally speaking surely fall into worse hands putting the attorneys out of the question i have often considered with myself and endeavored to reconcile with justice the professon of a barrister does he not plead the cause of equity and does he not help those out who cannot or could not plead for themselves some i will admit do but some do not if a barrister would act conscientiously take up no cause till he has well examined it and not argue in its defense unless there is legal honest ground for so doing he would be a praiseworthy character but when a barrister will take up any cause that is proposed to him right or wrong it reverses the case it is the misfortune that barristers never see their briefs till they are retained and when once retained if they do not exert themselves in defense of their clients whether this client be an honest man or a villain they are censured in their profession and are sure to lose the favor of the attorneys that employ them now he that has the most business at the bar is all things considered a worse man and a worse member of society than if he had less eminence for the more causes a barrister is engaged in the more injustice he does the man who has the happy facility of converting truth into falsehood of explaining away right and making the best stand against justice and equity is sure to have the most briefs if he knows how to browbeat an evidence perplex and puzzle him so as to make him seemingly contradict himself and is master of such fallacious arguments as will mislead an uninformed ignorant jury he is deemed clever and reckoned a good orator for such i am sorry to say it is too much the oratory of the bar and business will flow in upon him fast his distinguished abilities make the attorneys in a bad cause fly to him in preference and thus of twenty causes he is likely to have eighteen bad ones to defend now if he who fathers a lie and promulgates it as we have seen spatter do is equally criminal with the fabricator or inventor he surely who takes up a bad cause is equally criminal with the party who employs him there may be some plea in favor of a man who espouses such a cause from error of judgment from false conception or from ignorance but there can be none for him who takes pay to plead in behalf of the oppressor and to the injury of the distressed such a one is a mercenary hireling an assassin and robber of the unfortunate and so far from being commendable like the slanderer we have seen he deserves execration by all good men and the so in proportion to the abilities he has of perverting judgment and the power he possesses of doing it his eminence at the bar is a collateral proof of the baseness of his mind  it is under this idea that in sweden and some other countries a man is obliged to plead his own cause the profession of a barrister being there held in so odious and contemptible a light that no gentleman will take it up the executioner in sweden is a far more respectable character putting the immorality of the profession out of the question its civil turpitude is there held too great to be any way countenanced if a barrister though retained would dare to throw down his brief when he finds his cause a bad one it would render him an exalted character and should he by this mode of conduct be at the the receipt of less money he would have more reputation would deserve what he earns and enjoy it with credit and an unappalling conscience  chap xix though spatter thought proper to desert his friend in distress it was not so with rattle dangle and latitat rattle and dangle not knowing where to find ramble flew to his house then taken possession of by a sheriffs officer who when they entered was smoking a pipe with a tankard in his hand comforting himself with the good birth he had and saying there was plenty of stout in the cellar and he hoped the gentleman would not be able to make up his affairs while that lasted rattle and dangle came together and on enquiring if any of colonel rambles people were in the way was answered by this surly fellow no attempting to go into some of the inward rooms the officer stopped them with hey hey where are you going i am master of this house and there is no admittance for you i am placed here to see that nothings carried off and therefore shall not trust either of you out of my sight on their saying they wished to see the colonel and asking where he was this fellow replied at the lockuphouse in chancery lane where i believe you will find him any day this week after this if you want him you must look for him in the bench the kings bench you mean says rattle aye returned the officer the kings bench i suppose you know the place it will not be the first time you have been there i dare say cease your impertinence friend said dangle we say nothing to give you offense marry retorts the fellow there is no cause to be angry many an honest gentleman has lodged in that place and many a noe will again when they are overwhelmed with debts they go there to pay them you mean says rattle to retrench their expenses  i mean no such thing said the officer i have known a man live as well there as in any part of the kingdom keep as good a table and as genteel an equipage and in termtime at liberty to go as far any day as he pleases and what is the best of it all this at the expense of other people  true replied dangle there is some pleasure in that consideration and aside to rattle what a dry dog it is you say in chancery lane says rattle yes replied the fellow in chancery lane hard by the pump where the lawyers drink in nonterm dangle observing to rattle that things wore a strange face to what they did a few hours ago rattle cried pugh he will be out again tomorrow and nothing adds more to a mans credit in the police world than to have an execution or two in his house there is my lord squander has had eleven at one time he puts the fellows into livery they line the passage as his company pass and cut a very respectable figure a friend of his ofserving to him one day that the had an uncommon suite of servants his answer was that he was never without them it requires contrivance only to make disgrace fashionable you know how latitat glories in writs and arrests scarce had he said these words but latitat bolts into the room his coat frogged with writs and a bunch of them in his hat by way of a cockade he passed by rattle and dangle run up to the officer and shook him by the had with hah my friend sponge how goes it the officer here was all humility and respect enquired how his honor did asked him to drink and also to walk into any apartment he pleased and why all this because jack was in fee with all the sheriffs officers in london having paid his respects to this man he turned to his friends saying you seem to stare at all this that is because you are not up to it i have such a respect for sheriffs officers arrests and writs that you see i am clothed in them i make it a rule never to pay a bill till i am arrested so you see what a patriot i am and how much i study the good of my country show me the man among all your acquaintance except myself who will pay two guineas instead of one in order to increase the revenue of the stamps the easy creditgiving world dont like much trouble was i to pay a bill on being asked to do it it would not answer my plan i never discharge an account without being sued i endeavor to deal with those only who dread the law but when i am arrested i pay and then only and if upon such occasions i pay a little more than i otherwise should a second satisfaction hangs to it with all my smattering for trade you know i hate keeping accounts and filing receipts and when i pay the accommodationfee i consider myself safe from being obliged as many are to pay the same bill a second time for a writ and its discharge is a receipt in court  you are replied rattle my dear jack one of the happiest fellows of the age you extract virtue from necessity enjoy what would be the disaster of thousands and scramble on through life as you call it without a scratch or a pain  it would do your heart good rattle continued he to come and see my vestibule i am now fitting it up and though you will scarce believe it i buy the hangings of the lawyers  hanging it said dangle with old parchments i suppose  not quite so bas as that retorts he my hangings are suitable to the expenditure and figure of a man of  000 l a year there is not a square inch that costs me less than a guinea and by the time i have hung the whole room it will cost me some thousands i shall do it however at last my boy exulting and then i shall immortalize my name every writ i am served with i tack up against the wall leaving one end loose and it gives me rapture when the window is open to see them shivering and hear them rattling in the air the music is divine i swing myself round and enjoy the sight a descendant of the oldest british family could not be prouder in an ancient hall of audience of the trophies of his progenitors  haec sunt insignia mea  these are my banners  the glorious achievements of my ancestry it would delight you to see how i strut about in hoc vestibulo meo i call it my court of requests my audiencechamber where i receive embassys from the crown d  mn me if i believe there is such another room in the three kingdoms come gentlemen you seem to be idle suppose i go and show it you   you had better get into parliament said rattle it would be cheaper in the end though you paid a few thousands for your seat  psha man returns he that would frustrate my whole plan there is not a fool that would trust a member of parliament now with five pounds that times over  the house of commons is not what it was there are so many mercenary and povertystruck fellows now get themselves elected that this honorable house is losing credit daily  the reader will indulge me here with a few remarks on the law of arrests to what do they tend but to the injury of society the design of attachment was merely to prevent the defendant from escaping whilst the matter against him was under litigation if he can give security for his appearance it is all the law requires if not he is held in custody to wait the event so far it is political but the cause being ended an execution following if the defendant has no property to pay the debt why consine his person take him out of society throw his family upon the parish and deprive the state of his labors does it pay his debts  no  the execution might seize his property and if there be not sufficient to discharge the debt and costs he should be obliged to pay the remainder at some future time which by giving him his liberty he might be able to do as things are now the debtor is confined his credit ruined his famimily beggared he waits for an insolvent act and his creditor loses his money the manner in which the law can harrass a debtor may frighten some men from running into debt but it hardens others and puts them on their invention as it has done jack latitat but the greatest evil arising from arrests is the abuse of this law and the many villains it creates many a hundred pettifoggers there are who have no resource for a maintenance but this they retain a number of runners to whom they give half their fees to find out litigious men and rascals that have fraudulent and fictitious claims upon the property of others accompanied perhaps with a specious claim of forty shillings but which under fair discussion might be disproved whether these claimants have any substance or not provided the defendant has it is all they want they undertake to carry on the cause for them prevail on them to swear to debts not existing arrest the defendant not suffer the plaintiff to be met with run the cause to issue and the defendant either then proceeds to trial or not knowing what such villains may there swear to is induced to pay a certain part of it into court which is accepted and the cause ends but with the expense of  0 l or more to the defendant besides all the disgrace and trouble of the arrest nay there are men that will go farther such attorneys in hopes of having the matters compromised and getting their costs paid will serve writs and run the risk if the defendant is a man of spirit and determined to go on with it they will drop the cause at issue and should the attorney get nothing from the defendant he will if possible from his client and the defendant has his own attorney to pay perhaps    or  0 l this might be recovered of the plaintiff if he could be found or was worth powder and shot but he is a pauper and not to be met with both the attorneys however have profited and the defendant has been the chief suffere  to show how dangerous such men are in society take the following anecdote  an attorney seated himself in a countrytown where he thought there was a good opening no attorney having taken possession of the place he had a small independenoe of his own but the people there being of a peaceful disposition he had little or no business and his own money not being sufficient to support him he told a friend one day that he should be under the necessity of removing his situatiions for the inhabitants of that town were so d  m  d peaceable that he could not live amongst them being a pleasant fellow and his friend unwilling to lose him he gave him this advice bring some other attorney to settle in the town besides yourself and my life for it you will find your account int it he took the hint another of the fraternity was invited there to residence dissentions were thus raised among the people and the two attorneys go a very good living  was there a law enacted that every attorney should give some thousand pounds security to the public on his admission and if he was nonsuited in any cause be obliged to pay the costs himself he would take care never to engage but in a good cause or oblige his client to give him security for those costs in case he failed in the action this would prevent a a great number of vexatious and litigious suits and if there were fewer rascally attorneys there would be more peace and happiness in society  chap xx miss trevor found means to free ramble from his confinement she found out the officer and got a friend to carry him the  00 l and the expenses without saying where it came from and my friend was at full liberty without the satisfaction of knowing who was his liberator he was exceedingly desirous of finding it out and took uncommon pains so to do  no sooner was he at home than he received the congratulations of his friends and those of spatter in particular who flew to him with feeming rapture crying out my dear colonel i have been all the town over in search of a friend to extricate you from the difficulty your good heart threw you into and with that view i have told your story to all my acquaintance but i am happy to find the business is done without me it was d  md shabby of careless to draw you in to i dont see it in that light replied ramble poor fellow he would have paid the money if he could and as he could not it was and is my wish to do it for him  yes returned spatter but the disgrace of it  disgrace it cannot be said ramble a man ought never to be ashamed of suffering in a good cause he who fears to encounter a dissiculty for a friend ill deserves to have one  if i may be allowed to say any thing in addition to those of my friend will upon the occurrences he met with i will here take the liberty of laying before my reader a character i have met with too common in life but being mixed with the world at large is often lost in the crowd and not noticed this is that of a man who purchases a good name from the two lower classes of people which indeed is the mass of men able to stamp a character with respect or disrespect for they are the greater part of the people and it is too universally believed that what the world says must be true if a man but pays his debts when called on is free with his money and puts up with no indignity he is in the eye of the present age a man of honor and a gentleman his moral character is seldom enquired into he may get drunk keep as many whores as he will and be the greatest libertine uncensured such a man will have much longer credit than others and treadesmen will be more obedient to his call for it is selfinterest that leads mankind and even warps their way of thinking i knew a gentleman of small fortune but who had a fuffielent income to pay all his tradefmen he was an economist and not void of principle i heard this gentleman once chide his wife soon after marriage for paying a bill unasked it is time enough said he to pay when two or three bills have been sent in he did not act on the principle of latitat who by witholding a debt due made interest of the money but acted on the idea that it is right to do as the world does nothing continued he is so unfashionable as to call for a tradesmans account if you make it a rule to do this you may be called a good play master but you will be vulgar in the extreme this gentleman did not plead want of cash but was never at home to his tradesmen he kept a lying fellow at his door who after many years importuning gained them access to his master only by the presentment of a fee but yet this gentleman when he did pay never examined the particulars of a bill let it be of ever so long standing but referred only to the sum total and paid like a gentleman your honor will please to observe says the obsequious tradesman that i have charged every artiele at the lowest price and i hope your goods pleased  i am perfectly satisfied said the gentleman and think myself much obliged to you the money paid they part one with seeming gratitude the other with professions of future employ i was once with him when he paid his tailor a long bill of six years standing the amount of which was   0 l he looked only at the sum total and on my enquiring when the tailor was gone whether he never examined into the article of a bibl articles retorted he z  nds if i looked at them i should go mad for my tailor is as great a rascal as ever lived i would not deal with him but he gives me long credit this credit if he managed his little fortune well he would not want and if he paid his tailor yearly whilst the artickes were in remembrance he would save  0 per cent but to be thought fashionble he chose to have fashionable credit and be thought a man of honor he had lived long enought in the world to know that a good name is easily acquired by purchase and therefore he bought that good name he was liberal to the poor in his neightbourhood not from a principle of charity for he gave away indiscriminately i went with him once to a public house in his village to ask some questions of the landlord it was winter and three or four impudent country fellows were sitting round the sire with their hats on one of them said to the rest loud enough to be heard leering with his eye and putting out his tongue twig the squire this did not disconcert him he stopped any further disrespect by saying to the landlord it was cold weather pitied those who were obliged to work abroad for their living ordered him to make those lads at the fire a three shilling bowl of good warm punch and begged they would drink his health no sooner was the purchase made than the article respect was immediately delivered the fellows no sooner heard him give this direction to the landlord than they jumped from their seats with will not your honor please to come to the fire and on quitting the house he observed to me you see how readily a few shilling soften down roughness of manners and insolence of behavior into complaisance and respect passing a turnpike with me one day in his own parish he gave the tollgatherer a shilling with i dont recollect having given you any thing to drink a long time  this man said i is one of your tenants i presume  i scarce know his name replied my friend but i never forgot to fee him it is no bad thing to have a good name at a turnpike and especially when a loose shilling will get it a traveller who has heard of your and who perhaps has not exercised his tongue for some time on the road will take an opportuity of doing it where he can and sond of enquiries in strange places may on passing this gate ask if squire such a one does not live somewhere about here oh yes returns the man his honor lives not far off he is a worthy genetleman and this character is purchased  it is a pity things should be so but so they are and the old agage is too often verified no longer pipe no longer dance  chap xxi flint had been in town a fortnight night and had brought an account that mr raspe and his daughter had left liverpool the day before him but as the colonel had received no letter from miss he concluded they must either have stopped at the house of some friend in the road or that miss raspe had not found an opportunity of giving him notice of it he had been writing a note to miss trevor to introduce himself on dangles business and he dispatched flint with it  the letter was to this effect  colonel rambles best compliments to miss trevor and having something for her private ear solicits the indulgence of half an hours conversation if agreeable and she is disengaged he will do himself the honor of paying his respects to her tomorrow at two  flint though he had traveled twenty miles this morning was not fatigued or our of spirits but set off with his masters letter with alacrity and brought him word that he had delivered the letter but that miss trevor was not at home  i cannot pass unnoticed and accident that happened to flint to show the danger and villainy of a london mob i can scarce suppose it the same in any metropolis but in this every little unusual occurrence draws together a crowd of people to enquire into the cause and the pickpockets take the opportunity to rob the byestander of his purse his watch his handkerchief etc processions a fire a battle between two men or boys a woman fainting a drunken man an accident of any kind is sufficient to call the attention of a london mob and draw the people together and the vagabondthieves are so numerous and destitute as industriously to fight pretended battles and create incitements to a mob that they may have their wishedfor opportunities careful and cautious people are aware of this and take pains to avoid a crowd but the thoughtless and inconsiderate will rush eagerly into one and become the objects of plunder  flint in his way from lady dashits got into a hobble that had nearly ended with much worse consequences than it did though he had a good deal of foresight not being well acquainted with london he was not up to all the tricks of sharpers and pickpockets he loved a bustle and was fond of running into every crowd he met at charing cross a drunken fellow with a pipe and tabor had called together the idle and the vagabonds and a pretty smart mob was collected these are the times when thieves and pickpockets watch their opportunity to disburthen those who are encumbered with any little matters about them  flint was the foremost in this mob and a fictitious battle taking place he took some pains to inspirit the combatants  well done scarlet jacket  mind your eye bandylegs  throw your blows in straight and thick  hit him in the breadbasket  keep him at arms length such were the terms of the pugilistic art in which flint in intimating to the combatants was very vociferous whilst the corporal was thus engaged a bakers boy ran up against his coat flints attention being thus called off a rascal stepping forward industriously wiped off the flour from his coast and whispered in his car to take care of an illlooking fellow near him or he would lose his handkerchief endeavoring to save this the fellow picked his pocket of his tobacco box another behind him stole his cap whilst a third treading down the heel of his shoe kicked it off and thus robbed him of his filver buckle endeavoring to recover his shoe he lost his watch got his head broke and narrowly escaped being charged with being a pickpocked himself being dragged to a horse pond and ducke he scrambled and fought his way through the mob as well as he could and comforted himself when out of danger with having delivered his masters letter arrah by my conscience said he if these be your london tricks flint will be match for you another time he will carry nothing about him and then you may steal it and welcome there was seldom a circumstance that happened to him but he communicated it to his master but this story he was afraid to tell lest he should be laughed at and called a fool for his pains  chap xxii but we must not omit to relate what passed at lady dashits when flint delivered his masters letter  bridget had prepared her lady to receive toms first visit who had procured a suit of clothes that fitted him well but being unused to a sword it was frequently between his legs and nearly throwing him down tom was shown up by a servant who had received bridgets orders to admit no one into the room till sir thomas flam was gone this was a necessary precaution lest he should be accidentally discovered  tom was brought in a chair and being ushered up into a room bridget first gave him the meeting with who will say tom you do not look like a gentleman now turning him round and admiring him your are sir thomas flam all over  yes replies tom i think i know how to put clothes on when i have any to put on i have been practicing that theses seven years is the coast clear  miss trevor she said was just gone out in the chariot and her lady was ready to receive him tom said his heart failed him in the business but bridget eneouraged him with psha nonsense  you have impudence enough upon some occasions and when a good fortunes at stake it is worth an attempt she is tired of a single life and will be easily won indeed the women are all easily won i know the sex well the only want pressing  if that will do returned tom faith she shall have enough of it bridget then left him to acquaint her lady of his being there and tom in the mean while examining himself in the glass observed that the coat fitted him to a tee  lady dashit soon entered the room and affected to appear confused bridget was peeping behind and tom bowing affectedly lady dashit first broke the silence with your name sir i understand is sir thomas flam  sir thomas flam at your ladyships service replied tom lady dashit could not help noticing to herself that he was a very gentlemanlike man and begged him to be seated tom began though madam i may be a stranger to your ladyship you are not so to me i have admired you frequently and ardently wished for an opportunity of telling you so to which lady dashit replied with a good deal of confusion i scarce know how sir thomas to consider this otherwise than as a compliment when there must be no doubt a number of young ladies in the circle of your acquaintance that must be noticed by you  true madam said tom there are but i hate your young ladies boardingschool misses and novelreading girls when a man looks for a wife he wishes to meet with a woman of sense and discretion a lady like yourself who to elegance of person and a sufficient share of beauty is blessed with an understanding to make any man happy during this studied speech he threw his legs and arms about in an affected way as if in raptures with his own cloquence and bridget behind seemed not a little pleased with his words and manner wondering where he learnt them lady dashit was captivated and affecting a bashful confusion replied your compliments sir quite confuse me pray sir thomas are you acquainted with the vavasors of yorkshire i hear your estate lies in that county during all this time bridget industriously came backwards and forwards under a pretense of adjusting the room tom rather hesitating cried oh yes madam  has the old gentlemen said lady dashit got rid of his lameness tom not being prepared for this and at a loss could only say madam lady dashit went on his sciatica has been a troublesome companion to him tom not knowing the meaning of the word and supposing it be his wife replied i have not the honor of knowing the lady  what lady retorts lady dashit tom answered mrs sciatica  mrs sciatica explains lady dashit with surprise  sciatica sir is the hipgout with which sir walter has been long afflicted tom recovering himself with an affected smile replies i thoroughly understand what your ladyship means by sciatica it is i say an attendant which bless my stars i never had the honor of being acquainted with rejoicing that he had brought himself off so well lady dashit did not rightly enter into this and said with a kind of sarcastic sneer i dont apprehend sir thomas you are acquainted with any of the family tom said not i indeed  then why returned lady dashit did you say you was  pardon me madam answered tom i understood your ladyship asked me whether my estate lay in yorkshire it was to this i answered yes  i must entreat your excuse then sir thomas says lady dashit in what part of yorkshire does it lie tom no less confused and at a greater loss than before cries again maam  near what town continued lady dashit for i am well acquainted with all the ridings the devil ride her said tom to himself turning his head and whispering to bridget unobserved by her mistress where does this estate of mine lie  any where near thirsk continues lady dashit bridget at a loss whispers to tom say not a great way from york  a little off one side york says tom to lady dashit thirsk replied she is not many miles from the city tom still embarrassed stammers out true maam true maam but my lands are on the opposite side of the city where i shall be proud of conducting lady dashit and putting her in possession of them do my dear madam let me hope i may ere long have the happiness to call you mine bridget fidgeting about the room and not liking this dull conversation contrived to draw near and whisper him in his ear why dont you kneel at her feet and kiss her hand it may appear a little extraordinary that upon such an interview lady dashit should not be more particular with respect to her maids being present but when it is considered that her maid was her considante of course in the secret and had been the means of introducing sir thomas there and when we consider that lady dashit had a blind side and wore a glass eye and bridget kept on that side of her it is not to be wondered at lady dashit did not notice bridget being attentive only to her own interest i presume said she sir thomas you know what fortune i am possessed of  that i do said he to himself but addressing himself to her ladyship fortune madam is not the question he would ill deserve your ladyship who thought of your fortune i have a very ample one which i shall be proud to share with you your dear self is the object of my adoration suffer me to throw myself at your feet and say could i once have the honor of calling you lady flam i should be the happiest of men upon this he threw himself upon his knee seized her hand with ardour pressed it to his lips and kissed it with fervor lady dashit now affected a girlish confusion rose from her seat begged him to rise uttering with difficulty to say sir i am not flattered with your liberality of sentiment would be telling an untruth i am and shall be glad to see you again at your leisure at which time i may be more explicit give me leave said tom in raptures to kiss your hand and whilst so doing flint hurried into the room and discovering tom though in a new character was struck motionless with surprise let us dwell a little on the mortification of this scene in the very moment that bridget and tom were conceiving themselves in their coaches that this fellow should blunder in and break down all their chimeras he instantly saw through the scheme laid for lady dashit spoke not a word but with a look of honest indignation told tom  it was at an end  we must break off here to say how flint obtained admission  chap xxiii ramble had directed flint if possible to deliver his letter into miss trevors hands which he might do by asking for her maid for he was apprehensive from what he had heard of lady dashit if it fell in her way miss trevor might not receive it to this end flint having knocked at the door asked for mrs bridget what do you want with her said the porter who opened it what do i want with her returned flint to be sure i dont want her  i have a little bit of a letter here for here lady  some petition i suppose or begging letter said the porter for the ladies were very charitably disposed we have been pestered with too may of them today already  peteetion cries flint raising his voice what does the rascal take me for a pauper  look in my cap you teef pointing to his cockade and you will see i carry the badge of a jontleman jontleman returns the servant imitating flints brogue a pretty sort a gentlemanlike badge truly now the wars over we shall be overrun with such sorry kind of gentlemen every idle vagabond who has neither house nor habitation trade nor profession calls himself a gentleman go set off  you will get nothing here flints pride was now roused and he roared out hear me fellow  a cockade now is the highest badge of distenction what would my little country have been but for those who wore cockades i am a soldier and a soldier is a gentleman all the world over and what is more you poltroon i bear about me the honorable marks of war and am therefore not to be talked to by such a snaking insignificant ting as you i wish i had you at trincomalee and at his he shook his cudgel over the fellows head show me to your lady immadiately repeated flint or by st patrick i will with this little shillela give you such a bating as you will feel for these seven years though you were to die tomorrow this argumentum baculinum or fear of drubbing gained him a direction into what room up stairs to go which accounts for his abrupt introduction into lady dashits apartment  the instant bridget saw flint she ran up to him and took him out of the room and tom took that opportunity of taking his leave but with a further invitation to wait on lady dashit again bridget no sooner got him out of the room than she scolded him for coming up stairs and asked what he wanted what do i want maistress returned he why i want the young lady of the house i have a letter for her  then you should have sent it up said bridget sent it honey replied flint why i might have done that and saved myself the trouble of bringing it  i can carry it back again and send it now if that be all  no no fool says bridget now you have brought it you may give it to me miss trevor is not at home when she returns i will give it her so you may go taking him by the shoulder and putting him out well returns flint dont shove me i think i know that jontleman in the next room give me leave to speak to him though he is as fine as a jay and looks like a flagstaff on the kings birthday i have seen him in a coarser garb  hold your silly tongue replied bridget you know him how should you know him that is sir thomas flam a gentleman that is going to be married to my old lady  but this is a secret  sir thomas flam exclaims flint sneering and in going out but not so loud as to be heard a pretty flam upon my consience good luck go with you honey  well deliver theletter to miss trevor you may tell her its from my master colonel ramble and that little flint brought it  when tom had taken his leave and flint was gone lady dashit rung for her maid enquired who flint was and how he came to be admitted for which the porter got a good scolding not only from his lady but from bridget well my lady says the latter how does your ladyship like sir thomas is he not a very elegant sine spoken gentleman he told me on going out that he was all in raptures with your ladyship lady dashit observing to her that he was a good deal at a loss about the situation of his country seat i should have been surprised if he had not says bridget every lover is confused at the first interview with his mistress i could see my lady that you yourself was confused very much so indeed returned lady dashit it will not be improper however to make some further enquiries about him i think i will ask mr spatter he knows every body bridget convinced that spatter would say he knew him from a foolish pride he took in being acquainted with every titled man urged her lady to it much and lest she should apply to any other proposed sending to mr spatter and begging him to call the first time he came that way lady dashit enjoined her maid to secrecy but she was too much interested in the affair as she said to herself not to be as secret as possible  chap xxiii miss trevor having sent ramble an answer upon her return home that she should be happy to see him he waited on her the next morning and was no sooner announed than miss trevor told her maid that colonel ramble waited on her at his own request begging her private ear for half an hour on business of moment most assuredly miss said bridget will my words come to pass he is as much in love with you as you can be with him mr spatter told me so you are certainly born for each other miss trevor could not but confess that she was partial to him but feared he was too unsettled to think of a wife till he had nearly outrun his fortune then make yourself easy returned bridget pertly for that is pretty well the case elready at least the world says so this was too much miss trevor was nettled dont be impertinent said she you take more liberties than become you if i think proper to speak freely of him i will not have you do it go show the colonel up marry come up says bridget muttering to herself as she left the room there is more fuss about sweethearts in this house than in the whole parish besides  i beg your pardon miss trevor said the colonel on entering the room for this intrusion but i was desirous of seeing you on a matter of some importance chairs being brought and bridget having left the room ramble went on i hope what i have to communicate will attract your attention but should it not meet your approbation trust it will be goodnaturedly forgiven miss trevor with some confusion said she was persuaded he could offer nothing but what she should be happy to attend to though the colonel was far from wanting words and could have addressed any woman for himself yet he found himself embrrassed when pleading the cause of his friend fearing it might not be well received and be deemed impertinence you are very good said he and polite miss trevor and i am proud of the occasion the subject i am to introduce to you is of so serious a nature that i request you will not give a hasty opinion of it miss trevor was all confusion and could not help noticing the colonels embarrassment who now felt for the first time an awkwardness in a loveaffair that he never experienced before whether it was from having had an intimation of miss trevors partiality for him or whether it arose from his partiality for her which seemed to increase at this teteatete is immaterial but so it was he found it difficult yet went on your charms and good conduct my dear miss trevor as is natural to suppose have made an impression where i can take upon me say no time can erase the impression colonel you are pleased to talk of returned miss trevor must arise not from any feserts of mine but from a too partial opinion entertained of me every one ceplied ramble must entertain a partial opinion of miss trevor those who have seen her once must wish to see her again and those whom she is pleased to honor with her notice must stand in raptures at her virtues  miss trevor bowing to the compliment but with a smile that would have won the heart of an anchorite observed that she was at a loss to determine which was most inexcuseable unpalatable truths or agreeable insincerities ramble who was now more in love with her than ever but was tied up by honor and friendship to smother the passion found himself exceedingly awkward call me not insincere said he i am a plain dealer and you must excuse my frankness the amiable qualities you possess the goodness of your heart my dear miss trevor and the sweetness of your disposition entitle you to the admiration of every man and permit me to say they have made a conquest of a heart that i should hope you will have some compassion for you have a happy way colonel returned she of ingratiating yourself with the women and i have little doubt but that she who can attract your attention must be proud of the conquest by these words ramble perceived himself not understood and was therefore determined to cut the matter short lest he should lose his own heart for though he was attached to miss raspe and she was a girl whom any man might love yet she had not the understanding nor the independence of miss trevor his acquaintance with miss raspe was of short duration and it was now some time since he saw her but ramble was a man of strict honor and having made proposals of marriage to her would never think of flying from them these were his inward thoughts whilst addressing miss trevor determined therefore to bring the matter to an issue he told her he would not trespass longer upon her patience but take the liberty at once to solicit her hand and heart in favor of one who adored her and could not live without her my heart replied she is too poor an object to make much parade of it is a trifling silly thing that scarce knows its own interests and i fear of too little consequence to be worth any ones notice it is i am convinced answered ramble a heart that every sensible man would be ambitious of obtaining and i honestly declare to you that i never thought my friend dangle a man of understanding till now miss trevor till this instant was not undeceived in her hopes but that the colonel was addressing her for himself and of course testified her surprise at the name of dangle ramble proceeded my dear miss trevor dangle has long loved you and often wished to declare it but a cursed mauvaise honte which he cannot get the better of has prevented his saying what he has requested me to say for him will you give me leave to tell him that you will receive his addresses believe me you cannot countenance a more honest fellow nor one that will make a better husband miss trevor now betraying more surprise and some marks of displeasure said so sir it is mr dangles cause that you have been pleading all this time even so madam answered he the cause of friendship and of love then said she i must be under the necessity of telling you that you have been fruitlessly employed i am not insensible of the honor mr dangle does me but my heart has unfortunately been long engaged to another here she sighed mr dangle is a gentleman i shall ever respect as a friend but the last man in the world i could bring myself to think of as a husband but are you serious in this returned ramble  quite serious said she  ramble added he hoped he had not displeased her by the part he had taken i should have been much better pleased replied miss trevor had you taken up less of my time upon the occasion with this she got up and rung the bell ramble seeing he had given offense and unhappy at the circumstance said taking her by the hand come miss trevor it was an act of friendship  you must forgive me and if ever i undertake such another jobb the devil fetch me  it might said she be an act of friendship to him but it surely could be none to me however sir on condition that you never mention him again i shall think no more of it bridget now entered the room she asked if every thing was ready for her above and being answered in the affirmative looked at her watch apologized to the colonel for leaving him so abruptly feared she should not be dressed in time ordered her servant to wait on him down and left him with a heart wretched at the disappointment ramble felt himself much hurt at this  his goodnature and readiness to oblige his friend had caused him to offend a lady he really respected and various were the suggestions that immediately struck him he could not but dwell on the charms of miss trevor and lament that ill luck which engaged him to plead a cause in which he was become so entangled  chap xxiv ramble as i have observed found himself much embarrassed in the affair with miss trevor indeed his sentiments differed so widely from the generality of young men as to be susceptible of many inquietudes they never know he spent some hours one morning in his study contemplating this business and thus it was he reasoned with himself what is it said he that so disturbs me i undertook to plead for my friend in behalf of his affection for miss trevor  when i found my own heart interested did i betray my friend  no  but as warmly urged his suit as if it had been my own  would she hear me  no  but took offense and would only forgive it on condition that the subject never was renewed with a positive declaration that she never would admit dangles suit  was i not then at liberty to have pleaded for myself  yes and thousands would have done it had they felt like me the powerful influence of her charms  how unfortunate that he should have applied to me who am now perhaps much more her slave than ever he was  her manner i think was singular  she appeared sensibly touched with my discourse  what did she mean by unfortunately engaged  to whom could that be  but what am i about throwing himself upon his sofa do i already forget the promises i made miss raspe  unlucky cruel hour that linked me to this chain of trouble  in which am i most justifiable  is that man a man of honor who shall rob a parent of his child  will my faith to miss raspe compensate for the injury done to her father who builds all his hopes on marrying her to a nobleman  will not this injustice to him cast a shade upon my honor  miss raspe may have and may yet meet many a better offer avoid offending her parent and prevent my doing him an injustice  miss trevor is independent and with a good fortune enjoys the disposal not only of that but of her person  and was i to marry her i should have no feelings to wound  no remorse to sting me  what not the reproaches of a friend  have these no poignancy  they have  miss trevor will not hear him of course treachery it cannot be  but have i once dwelt on that which reflects dishonor more than all the rest  have i considered the pains i took to win a heart i now seem so willing to resign  was i happy till i had made miss raspe confess her attachment to me  what a monster an ingrate must i then be to forget myself and the vows i made her   at this instant spatter stole into the room with what asleep ramble in the middle of the day or musing  ramble too absorbed in thought to observe him rose from the sofa and went on  how these reflections wound me  what pity is due to those who feel as i do  many a man there is who would glory in such difficulties  such men may suffer less but such men i despise  shall i then act in such a manner as he was proceeding in this strain as spatter approached him but still lost in thought and turning as he uttered the last word unthinkingly round his face met spatters who crying no aloud as answering to his question startled him and put an end to his reveries where did you hide yourself said he to spatter i have been here this half hour replied he and have heard your whole soliloquy  i am sorry for it said ramble  you then can perhaps advise me not i believe me said he i have heard a great deal but could make little out know then continued ramble i have been pleading dangles cause with a fine girl and an fallen desperately in love with her myself though she has absolutely rejected his suit my refined notions of honor forbid me to make any advances for myself spatter asked who the girl was and on rambles saying he was not at liberty to name her added let her be who she will you may be very easy on that score for dangles too fashionable a lover to think of a wife had you obtained the girls consent he would have been much more embarrassed and chagrined than he will now on being made acquainted with her refusal this surprised ramble and he begged spatter would be more explicit his vanity he continued is insupportable in the course of his life he has not courted less than fifty women whom as soon as he discovered that he was likely to succeed with he has absolutely jilted was you to tell him that his application has been unattended to he would be eager to renew it but tell him he may have her and she may be mine or yours or any mans you certainly cannot be serious replied ramble only try the experiment said spatter ramble said it would be telling an untruth which he never could do  not to yourself replied spatter no not to serve a friend returned ramble whom i would serve before myself  tell me said spatter the girls name and i will undertake it for you  miss seabright lady bab squeamish miss gadabout miss trevor miss  it is in vain said ramble to persist was you to name the whole town it would not do  what will you say now adds spatter if i tell the untruth for you and bring dangle to relinquish her  say returns ramble laughing say you can gulp down a lie better than i can you dont deserve my good offices replied spatter but as i shall have laugh at dangles expense i will set about it no sooner were the words uttered than dangle entered the room spatter runs up to him with i was flying to you dangle with joyful tidings some girl ramble says to whom he has been speaking in your favor consents to make you happy you have only to buy a license and fix the day  i hope says dangle to ramble you have not betrayed me  not i upon my honor returned he spatter has tried all he could to learn her name but he is still in the dark  that is true enough cried spatter bantering him for i would give all the world to know that i might have the happiness of paying my respects to mrs dangle that is to be dangle already repented matters had gone so far and began considering how he should get off with ramble for after all he would be cursed he said if he could tune his mind to matrimony and asked ramble whether spatter was not jesting  you must have a bad opinion of my oratory replied he if you doubt its success  to be plain with you ramble returned dangle somewhat embarrassed i could not conceive you would have been so expeditious and the design of this visit was to request you to defer the matter till i had reconsidered it spatter with a kind of triumph whispered ramble am i right now or not ramble addressed himself to dangle with some warmth and exclaimed reconsidered it  hearkee dangle  when you wish to trifle with a lady again i beg you will not make me your instrument i hope i shall never meet you at that house any more  nay retorted dangle if you are so warm upon the occasion i must tell you that until you are master of that house or till the ladies refuse to see me i shall go there when i please  i see no reason colonel ramble for this anger  i dont wish to prevent your going there said ramble all i hope is that i may never meet you there as i should not only blush for myself but for you i am not unacquainted dangle with your ridiculous vanity and that this circumstance may not add to your trophies be assured sir that the lady peremptorily refused to listen to any thing i had to say respecting you you once upon a time told me you would not suffer her character to be trified with this is trifling with it with a vengeance dangle asked him warmly whether he meant to insinuate any thing to his disadvantage most certainly returned ramble i do and must acquaint you before your friend spatter that your behavior in this matter has been what i did not expect it was ungenerous in you to employ me before you knew your own mind nay gentlemen interrupted spatter addressing himself first to one and then to the other colonel ramble mr dangle  this is making a laughable matter too serious  it is no laughable matter resumed the colonel i mean to take it up very seriously  then if it offends you said dangle you know your remedy i shall be at home the whole of the day and wait your commands and upon this left them upon my soul ramble said spatter i am sorry for this you have carried this affair so far that i fear you cannot refrain from calling him out  he may than you for it returned he for had you not laid open his folly to me all would have been well i should have acquainted him with the result of my embassy and things would have rested there  nay said spatter i did it to put you at ease i hope however matters may yet be honorably adjusted without coming to extremities  your ideas of honor and mine spatter said he seem to be widely different i have had the satisfaction of telling him openly my sentiments of his conduct and if they anger him he may have recourse to whatever measure he pleases i shall not call further upon him if he calls upon me it will not meet my attention if he attacks me i trust i shall have spirit enough to defend myself i have done it in my life more than once but i am proud to say i should be afraid to seek the life of another nor would i but in a case of absolute necessity rush myself into the presence of my maker from the consequence of an act that admits of no repentance and leave my survivor only the bitterest remorse  well upon the whole said spatter i dont know but your philosophy may be right when he cools he will be ashamed of his behavior and i will take care to let his friends know that his proposal has been rejected dont i merit now your confidence for this come tell me her name it shall go no further upon my soul it shall not  no said ramble that would be so like taking revenge besides as i know you hate to be burdened with secrets i will not trouble you with this  chap xxv ramble finding a want of money and learning that he was indebted to miss trevor for his release thought it necessary to apply to some person capable of accommodating him with the loan of  000l he was recommended to grumble the attorney as a man in the habit of accommodating gentlement with money he went to this mans house and found him seated in an easy chair with his leg wrapped up and rested on a stool as having the gout ramble acquainted him with this business and produced a mortgagedeed of an estate of  00l a year on which his father had lent a neighbor  000l grumble looking on the parchment said he deemed it sufficient and was happy in an opportunity of letting him have the money immediately as a friend of his a merchant of liverpool whose business he did in the moneyway was just arrived with a parcel and had been with him to enquire whether he could dispose of any of it to advantage and on his telling him he could was gone to fetch it he is a man continued grumble that i do a great deal of business for and loving his money as his life would not employ me if he did not think himself safe in my hands i have in my time done many a score thousand for him he is one of the richest men in liverpool indeed i wonder he prospers so well considering the traffic he is engaged in that of bartering for human slesh  i think said ramble i know the man  not unlikely returned grumble his name is raspe  has not he an only child and daughter  he has and she is in town with him as i find you know something of him i can bring you together i expect his return every minute ramble begged to be excused from this saying though he knows my family i think it would be better not to mention my name lest he should start some objections for he is a very whin sical man  well well said grumble there is no occasion to mention names for he always rests satisfied with me scarce were these words uttered when grumbles clerk entered the room and said mr raspe was without and a young lady with him ramble begged leave to retire into the next room he no sooner had retired than mr raspe and his daughter entered nothing but gout here said raspe perhaps it is catching i am afraid to come in i suppose your clerks got the gout too he was so long delivering the message  he kept me half an hour waiting and was at last forced to come in without introduction  i cannot get up said grumble you must excuse me  old sins master grumble returned raspe old sins  gout follows close  i have brought the money dispatch me as soon as possible i have but little time to spare  i presume said grumble that young lady is your daughter  yes answered raspe she is my daughter i always take her with me good fortunes are soon run away with i therefore never lose sight of her grumble begged them to be seated but no chairs being in the room except the one he sat in nothing but two high deskstools raspe who was a short man said he could not reach the stool grumble requested miss to ring the bell saying his clerk should fetch one out of the next room  no no returned raspe he will be a long time about it and turning to his daughter bad her fetch one miss raspe going into the next room to fetch a chair discovered ramble she flew into his arms with joy and surprise and meeting him where she so little expected it almost overcome her she had not time then to speak to him but took a chair and faid she would contrive to return upon her entering the room where her father was she found him and his attorney engaged in business miss raspe interrupted them by observing to mr grumble what a fine collection of pictures he had and with his leave whilst they were adjusting their business she would go and look and them aye aye said raspe charlotte loves paintings her father hates them miss raspe went into the next room again fastening the door after her she now told the colonel that they had been in london more than a week that she had unfortunately lost the directions he had given her and was quite unhappy on the account of it and considered this accidental meeting as an act of providence she acquainted ramble that it would be still some weeks before they should set off for paris that they were at her uncles sir raby raspes and should there continue whilst in london got a direction where to convey a letter to the colonel and assured him she would contrive some method of seeing him in a day or two and would let him know it by a line and was sorry the time supposed for looking over a few pictures would not admit of her saying more to him at present her father in the next room upon grumbles assuring him his daughter was a fine girl and that he could not be too careful of her told him he had sent her to scotland to be out of the way of the men that he went a month since to fetch her and found a damned redcoated fellow under the same roof a man whom they called coloned ramble that he brought her away just in the nick of time that a day longer would have lost her that he left her fellow behind that thank heaven he had nothing to fear now as the was going to take her abroad and would not see her again in a hurry grumble who was convinced now that the redcoated fellow alluded to could only be colonel ramble in the next room seemed to enjoy the thought of the young couple meeting so opportunely he had in his days been of an intriguing disposition himself was mortified to find that age and infirmity put a stop to his career he therefore prolonged the conversation as much as he could to give the colonel more time to spend with miss raspe grumble observed that it was not a bad plan to take a pretty girl with a good fortune out of the way of danger well said raspe i must be gone and hallooed out for his daughter grumble would gladly have detained him a little longer by telling him he had an immediate opportunity for placing out a  000l of his money on very good security but raspe was impatient to be gone desiring him to acquaint him by letter with what he had done miss raspe now reentered the room smiling and told her papa he would have been delighted if he had seen what she had in the next room such figures says she such attitudes  grumble said there was one original worth half the best pictures of the age and i perceive miss raspe has made no difficulty of distinguishing it  original or no original returns raspe i would not cross the threshold to see thousands of them come charlotte let us be gone  i must papa take another peep and then on this she opened the door bid the colonel adieu with a speaking eye and then accompanied her father home the colonel now reentered to grumble got from him the cash and an account of what passed between him and raspe was not a little pleased with the accident that brought him and miss raspe so unexpectedly together and diverted at the idea that raspe with all his eyes should furnish him with money to elope with his own daughter  chap xxvi lady dashit having sent to request that spatter would call upon her the first time he came her way he lost no time upon the occasion but waited on her ladyship very soon after when together and in private after a little general conversation she begged leave to ask him whether he knew sir thomas flam  perfectly well madam replied he perfectly well not to know him would be to argue myself unknown there is scarce a titled man in the kingdom that i dont personally know the different clubs i belong to my connections all lead to this knowledge  he has i understand said lady dashit an estate of  000l a year in the neighborhood of york  oh yes returned he the flams of yorkshire every one knows  how much asks lady dashit do you suppose his estate amounts to  i dont know indeed returned spatter the exact rental but i apprehend it must considerably above the sum your ladyship mentions she asked again what may be the name of his estate spatter all confusion at these questions and not willing to be caught in a lie and yet not to be known to a baronet were things he could not digest feigning therefore forgetfulness name of his estate maam name of his estate  bless me i shall forget my own name presently  i dont think of it at this moment but i have spent many a cheerful day with him  then i presume said her ladyship you are personally acquainted with him  personally answered spatter lady dashit fearful they might not both mean the same person observed that sir thomas was a tall elegant well made man  yes yes madam returns spatter with a quick reply flams a fine fellow and dreading with this inquisitive woman he should soon get gravelled for till now he had never heard of one of the name determined to be off looking therefore at his watch he cries bless me it is near three oclock and i promised to be at lady swallows precisely as the clock struck and upon her lady dashits noticing that he was a very exact man he with his usual flow of spirits happy in having got rid of the disagreeable subject continued i was always reckoned so maam i pride myself upon it punctuality and truth ever go hand in hand with me miss blossom calls me an oracle lady bab a timepiece and mrs driveit a regulator i am very sorry to leave you but her ladyship will be all impatience and i would not lose my reputation with lady swallow upon any account gadso lady dashit i shall forget myself presently i must tell you a little anecdote however of miss sneak before i leave you  you know that she lives as an humble friend with lady di snapit her ladyship you know is very fond of books or at least pretends to be so but whether she is or not is of little moment it being no concern of mine i speak only as i hear and this affected penchant for literature leads her to notice those of her acquaintance most who seem to have a smattering for reading this being remarked by miss sneak who you know maam is of the wrong side of thirty and whose education had been neglected in the younger part of her life and being desirous of rising in the favor of lady di was determined to study hard in hopes of gaining lady dis affection she mentioned this to her ladyship requesting her at the same time that she would lend her a book to begin lady di who took a pride in mortifying those she had under her command and happy in laughing at the expense of her dependents applauded her design and promised to lend her one of the most useful books in her library it was a french and english dictionary some days after her ladyship asked miss sneak how she liked the book infinitely replied she it is the most delightful book i ever saw the sentences are all short and easily understood and the letters charmighly ranged in ranks like soldiers on the parade whereas in some other books which i have seen they are mighled together in a confused manner like a mere mob so that there is no pleasure in looking at them and very difficult to know what they mean indeed i am no longer surprised at the satisfaction your ladyship takes in study  but commend me to the divine miss trevor he was no sooner gone than lady dashit recollected having read this story in some book which spatter had been pleased to give to lady snapit but no matter her thoughts were upon sir thomas flam and as mr spatter knew his family her doubts respecting him were done away  chap xxvii flint having made his master acquainted with what he had seen at lady dashits and the scheme laid by mr dangles servant to marry her under a feigned character ramble not willing to stir in the business himself lest flint should be wrong in his story told him if he was not mistaken in the man to go to lady dashits see her ladyship and make der acquainted with it in the best way he could but on no account to mention his name in it  flint could not have been sent on a more agreeable errand he had a sneaking kindness for bridget and was happy in an opportunity of seeing her he posted therefore to the house  being admitced and meeting her in an antichamber cries hearkee mrs bridget  i think they call you the chambermaids always in the secrets of their mistresses  do you imagine i shall answer you that question replied bridget  why not honey returned flint i have a little matter do you see to communicate to lady dashit through you and that more nearly concerns her than she would wish to think well come said bridget what is it  what is it my jewel replied flint that is too home a question to be answered do you see without some little preface to it we soldiers never fire without a make ready  present you must first swear honey never to divulge it to any creature living  then how said bridget can you communicate what you have to say to my lady through me if i am not to tell it  why by my fait that is true returned flint  i did not tink of that well then child you must swear not to tell it to any body else bridget all impatience well i do swear i will not  come let us have it for a chambermaid you know is all curiosity  that answered flint is true again but for the oath  now do you see honey a military oath is always taken by kissing the sword and as we have no sword here why  you may  kiss me and took hold of her upon which she struggling to get from him said indeed mr monster i shall not  but indeed maistress baggage said flint you shall and kissing her by my soul said he to himself its as good as a dram in a cold frosty morning  it has warmed me all over why looking at bridget do you see my charming chambermaid oaths must be voluntary or they are not binding therefore kiss me of your own accord  dont be a fool flint said bridget if you have any thing to say say it if not i will stay no longer  well then said flint i will tell you you must know my dear mrs bridget when my late master and i were at the siege of trincomaleedamme it was warm work that day  and we fought it foot by foot i believe if it had not been for us the place would not have been carried here bridget again interrupted him with what have i to do with all this  what is the secret you have to tell me  why child the secret will come presently answered flint i must lay the train before i can spring the mine  at this same siege of trincomalee it was there i lost my eye i shall never forget it  well it was lost in a good cause and wiping the other as though crying i dont lamen it  come said bridget in a consoling accent dont be cast down flint  it gives you a soldierlike fierceness that you would not have without it  cast down no by my fait flint was never yet cast down returned he the eye that is left it is true dropped a tear at the remembrance of parting with an old friend  that is all no no flint will never regret the loss of an eye when his country calls for it it might have been my life what then nothing it is a call of service and i obey flints afraid of nothing but dishonor and disgrace  well but corporal said bridget youre not come to the secret yet still flint went on i told you i believe that my master and i fought it foot by foot and here flint brandished his stick with an affected air and when the walls gave way and we mounted the breach an officer in a privates uniform opposed our entrance i levelled my piece at him thus levelled his stick and would have laid him flat but my master checked me return your arms flint says he  he is an officer you may always know a jontleman by his manner i remember it as well as if it was but yesterday  you may always know a jontleman by his manner  and what said bridget is all this to me  dont be in a hurry honey now the secrets coming says flint but you must swear again and offered to kiss her i will swear no more whether you tell me or not returned bridget with some warmth here flint paused a little as if musing and then repeated you may always know a jontleman by his manner  do you suppose now my dear little curtain duster that this sir thomas flam as he calls himself is a jontleman  certainly i do says bridget with some emotion fearing they were discovered dont believe it dont believe it returned flint he is no more a jontleman than you are a prude  you may always know a jontleman by his manner  he has no more degnity than a baboon he goes off like a flash in the pan fitz imitating the sound with his voice all men flint said bridget are not alike some have more degnity as you call it than others witness yourself they gain it often by accident the loss of that eye has made you look twice the man you would otherwise have looked  none of your flings mrs bridget none of your flings at me returned flint have a care not to raise the lion i tell you sir thomas flam is an imposter i know him he is mr dangles servant and if a lady had not been present i would have kicked him out of the house here bridget was much disconcerted but thought she if i can but persuade him to hold his tongue till the marriage takes place he may then tell it as soon as he will and turning round to flint but are you sure youre right said she sure as a riflebarrel returned he an impudent scoundrel says bridget well mr flint i am much obliged to you for the discovery and shall acquaint my lady with it but as it will be best to punish him publicly i must beg you to keep it a secret till an opportunity offers to expose him when many are by  that replied he will be a good joke fait  you may rely upon flint  swear it said bridget  i do  by these sweet lips i do and here he found no difficulty to kiss mrs bridget who knew her only chance was to keep this fellow silent flint asked her when this same sir thomas flam would be here again  in a few days said bridget when we have laid the plan i will send you word and till then good bye to you flint took himself off with leave him but to little flint and he will bring him to a court martial and piquet him  chap xxviii ramble now received a letter from miss raspe saying that her father was determined to set out as the next day for paris that he had kept her in the dark till about two hours ago that she had tried various means to prevail on him to stay a few days longer but nothing would do till at last she could only gain one day in order to have her teeth set to rights by a dentist which she thought a very necessary step as they might not have so good an opportunity again between london and florence that this had effected the business that he had consented to her sending for a dentist the next morning and would stay a day longer on that account she wished the colonel would therefore disguise himself as a dentist personate an old frenchman speaking broken english introduce himself as dr snag and be with her at eleven in the morning and she flattered herself she should then have an opportunity of adjusting what was necessary before they left london  ramble did not very well like this scheme but the time being short he had no alternative he procured a scarlet roquelaure a bag of instruments and typewig painted his face and set off the next morning on this awkward piece of enterprise when he arrived at the house he was introduced into the room where mr raspe seemed engaged raspe hearing he was a frenchman and concluding he could enter into no conversation and indeed he was so disguised as to have all the appearance of a frenchman rang the bell for a servant sent him for his daughter made a motion with his hand as desiring him to be seated and then proceeded on what he was about which seemed to be reading letters and calculating respecting the slave trade for he was talking to himself and reckoning on his fingers all ramble could hear him say was west india markets overstocked  bad piece of business this  better throw the slaves overboard than sell them under price  keeep them long they will eat their heads off miss raspe now came into the room charlotte the dentist waits for you said he i shall leave you to yourselves my teeth want a little doctering when he has performed upon you he shall do the same with met he was no sooner gone than miss bolted the door and the colonel threw off his cloak and laid his instruments down gave her a thousand thank for this wellcontrived interview but feared there would be nomeans of getting her away till they reached paris miss raspe was of the same opinion particularly as their stay in london would would be so short ramble said it was of no great moment that a few more miles would make little difference not said miss raspe unless we lose sight of each other ramble answered that will be impossible unless he could travel in the clouds every thing seems in a fair way had an opportunity even offered i could not have embraced it a few days ago being in want cash but now i am provided nothing even in love is to be done without money the wheels will not turn the horses will not gallop nor will the driver start be assured i will watch your fathers motions for having my dear angel so great an object in view i will never lose sight of it during this interview they were allowed time enought to settle their plan of future proceedings she could not acquaint him with the house they should be at in paris as her father would not inform her but it was settled that she should let him know by a line sent to the english coffeehouse she said their stay there would be short that no one would travel with them but brutus the black and wished he would contrive to take her from thence he promised if possible to do it and seemed to make very little doubt of accomplishing it raspes foot being heard upon the stairs she unbolted the door and ramble put on his cloak raspe coming into the room and finding he had finished with his daughter sat down bad him look into his mouth and see what was wanting ramble put on a pair of spectacles and holding up his head by the chin said der is great deal of scurvy about dis head gums enflammees and vil be more vourse  dey should be lanced raspe bawls out will not you hurt me i cannot bear pain i am subject to the toothache miss raspe stood behind all this time and could not refrain from laughing at the oddity of the scence  vat i shall do to them said ramble vil be very bon and you vil scarce feel it but you must take care not to catch cold after it  be quick said raspe for i hate long jobs dear then said ramble cutting his gums all across with his lancet very deep and which bled very much raspe jumping up with seeming pain repeated his words with great vociferation dear then  damn the fellow  will not pay him a farthing  he is lanced me with a vengeance  out of my room sir or i will be the death of you  bless me says miss raspe how you bleed sir  i will fetch some water and took that opportunity to run out dr snag followed her observing that it would keep him some days longer in london and rafpe with his handkerhief to his mouth made the best of his way after them  scarce an hour had elapsed after the colonel had got home before he received another letter from miss raspe saying that her father had scolded her for sending for so ignorant a fellow had consulted his apothecary who advised him not to venture into the air till his gums were healed of course took it for granted they should stay a week longer and would contrive to see him again before they went he took an opportunity of returning miss trevor the five hundred pounds she had so generously advanced for him unwilling to take it himself least by another interview he should renew those sensations that were in some measure asleep he sent it by a friend with a letter of unfeigned gratitude  chap xxix we must now turn our eyes to lady dashit another interview with tom had been appointed wherein it was expected she would declare her determination respecting him she had seen him several times and liked his person and manner was satisfied from spatters account of him that his estate could not be so little as  000l a year se therefore made up her mind on the business and resolved to be explicit when next he came that time was now arrived she had been given to understand he meant to wait on her that morning and that she might not be interrupted contrived to get miss trevor from home within an hour of his coming she had been long in discourse with bridget on miss trevors conduct said she was an inconsiderate girl paid very little regard to money and that her sending  00l to release coloned ramble a person she was almost a stranger to was an evident proof of it she did not doubt but she should live to see the day when she would be a beggar possibly said her ladyship she may think to come in for some of mine but i will take care into what channel mine goes sir thomas flam shall have mine every shilling of it  ah that he should answered bridget if i were you my lady i wonder he has not been here he generally keeps his time scarce had she said the word but a great knocking was heard perhaps this is sir thomas shall i go and see my lady consent being given she went and lady dashit in the interim determined to close the business at once her words were i shall not stand shillyshally upon the occasion as girls do tom was ushered in by bridget and addressed lady dashit thus  my dear lady dashit i kiss your hand it seems and age since i saw you bridget was ordered by her lady to leave the room observing that wench would gladly have staid and heard what we had to say chambermaids the most curious and inquisitive animals alive they are like gentlemens valets cried tom whose masters too apt to put confidence in them make them forward and impertinent mine is too much so well now my dear madam permit me to ask you whether you have taken the matter we were talking about into consideration i am impatient for the happy day  perhaps too impatient sir thomas replied her ladyship he that weds in haste say the repents at leisure  no man returns tom can possibly rerepent giving his hand to one of lady dashits amiable qualifications andhe was going on when unfortunately for him spatter who had found his way into the house and almost into the room was stopped by bridget on the landingplace who was heard to say without indeed mr spatter you cannot see my lady now she is particularly engaged  spatter was also heard to say i must see her for i have news of the utmost importance to acquaint her with i shall not detain her ladyship a minute he was not to be put back and bridget thinking if she opened the door and he saw a gentleman with her that he would naturally retire opened it but on so doing so far from withdrawing he pushed right into the room tom seeing him drew back my dear lady dashit i beg your pardon for this intrusion but i have a matter for your private ear that i am persuaded you would wish to know  miss blossom ishe was going on at a fine rate but seeing tom stopped short saying i thought we had been alone pray who is that gentleman  a particular friend of yours said lady dashit who has done me the honor of a visit spatter going up to tom said sir i am your most obedient humble servant  then addressing himself to lady dashit i have not the honor to know the gentleman but not matter what i am going to relate is no secret it is only that lord random has returned miss blossom and will have nothing more to do with her how said lady dashit to herself not know him  there must be something treacherous in this piece of business or spatter must have told a lie then addressing herself to tom said mr spatter is an old acquaintance of yours sir thomas  i protest replied tom i never saw the gentleman before  mr spatter said lady dashit didnt you tell me that you was personally acquainted with sir thomas flam  that is sir thomas flam bridget who was all this time in the room drew up to tom and took an opportunity unnoticed to whisper in his ear brazen it out you may be sir thomas flam or lord flam for any thing he knows to the contrary spatter kept eying tom all this time and as unwilling as either of them to be found in a lie determined to persist in it let what would be the consequence or he never should be believed again yes madam said he to lady dashit i have the pleasure to be personally known to him but your ladyship is joking with me now this gentleman is no more sir thomas flam than i am sir thomas flam tom then drew up to spatter angrily saying how dare you presume to falsify my person you are discovered in a barefaced lie and now want to bully it out then addressing lady dashit this mans character is too wellknown he is not acquainted with one man of fashion in ten that he boasts of being known to  that i can take upon me to say whispers bridget to her lady it was but the other day he met with lord spangle with whom he professed an acquaintance for years and yet didnt know him then whispering to tom threaten him and you will soon get rid of him and went out  spatter then addressed himself to tom such language as you have used to me sir is not to be put up with had i a sword by my side as you have i would let you see the length of it  nothing replied tom loudly but this ladys presence prevents me from treating you as you deserve during these high words who should come in but toms master leading in miss trevor tom thunderstruck said my master here too now it is all over they are against the door or i would be off he draws back seeking for an opportunity to escape what is the matter maam said miss trevor i thought i heard high words or i would not have intruded  it is very unpolite gentlemen said dangle to be quarrelling in the company of a lady spatter observed it was no quarrel only a warm debate about a matter of little consequence it may be of little consequence to you gentlemen said lady dashit but to me it is of the greatest  flint having been sent by his master with rattle and saunter to saunters house in order to bring something back and passing by lady dashits where he saw the chair that had brought sir thomas flam before gave the gentlemen a short account of what he knew and wished them to step in they as desirous as he could be of enjoying the confusion that must arise on the discovery knocked and enquired if he was not there and being answered in the assirmative said they had business of consequence with lady dashit and must see her accordingly they were admitted and the door being open they entered the room during this scene tom finding himself furrounded by his enemies endeavored to slipaway but flint stopped him with hold fast there honey i must have a little bit of talk with you before i go tom walks about as angry hanging his head lest he should be known to his master you are come gentlemen at a fortunate moment said dangle mr spatter has contrived to get himself into a quarrel with a gentleman here upon a visit to lady dashit swords were talked of and laughing had it not been for our coming in as we did there might have been bloody work miss trevor and lady dashit now retired to the other part of the room conversi with each other and saunter who was of a satirical turn observed to dangle laughing that if blood had been shed it would have been slaying the enemy without quarter which in my opimon said he is murder for spatter i will be sworn would have made no resistance but with his tongue and as a coward cannot be an honest man there must have been some foul play in spatter dangle going up to tom addresses him with as a stranger sir  here he stopped for he did not discover him till this moment how is this cried he my varlet of a servant dressed up in the habit of a gentleman this was heard by the whole company flint answered him yes your honor he was retreating but little flint stopped him  detain him said dangle a little longer flint accordingly put him back takes his sword from him and mounts guard as it were over him mr dangles servant exclaims lady dashit then have i been duped indeed he passed himself on me said she to dangle for a yorkshire baronet  so i find retunred rattle we learned the greatest part of what passed before we came in for flint discovered him the last visit he made to your ladyship and came now with us to acquaint you with it spatters right for once said rattle in not knowing him to be sir thomas flam at this spatter began to triumph saying and yet i could not obtain credit  nay returns saunter dont boast of your veracity i will appeal to rattle did not you tell me this morning rattle of a conversation that passed between you and spatter respecting an embarrassment he was under here in inadvertently as he was pleased to term it asserting to lady dashit that he was personally acquainted with sir thomas flam when he was conscious there was conscious there was no such man existing  i did answered rattle and am happy in being here to confront him  persidious man exclaimed lady dashit but i deserve it  with what propriety said dangle to spatter can you expect to gain credit when your whole life is made up of lies and deceit my incautious disposition led me as it has done others to entertain a favorable opinion of you but you have always represented me as a man without resolution true enought i wanted resolution to drop you i have at last found you out and pronounce you to be a hypocritical gossiping liar a mischiefmaker in families the bane of society and of course ought to be shunned as a pestilence you labored to lower me in the opinion of my friends but your artisices have been seen through and we have totally done with you spatter now struck down with conscious guilt applied to saunter to make his peace with lady dashit and with dangle but could not succeed he then tried rattle but all to no purpose he applied first to one and then to another and finding them all against him and reproaching him he thought the best thing he could do was to decamp and accordingly left the room next said rattle to the satisfaction i receive in the prosperity of an honest man i am best pleased in the confusion of a rascal having now got rid said dangle of one rascal let us see what is to be done with the other flint bring forward your prisoner flint cries i will your honor and marches him up the rascals very looks betray him said dangle what villain was your view in all this  he wanted your honor answers flint for him to marry lady dashit under false colors  it is a pity returned dangle there is no law to punish such a miscreant as he deserves the war is over says rattle or we might send him for a soldier  no your honor replied flint that would be disgracing the profession youre right flint returned rattle i did not think of that  the best way said saunter is i believe to put him into flints charge and let him strip him and turn him into the street  no not strip him replies dangle to saunter the cloathers are not mine and then to tom let me never see your face again  take him away flint said rattle  i will your honor replied flint and when i quit him shall i give him a parting kick  do what you will with him said dangle there is nothing too bad for him at this flint collared tom and dragged him out with come along honey  come along sir thomas flam come along and the parties retired to talk the matter a little further over  the reader will pardon a refletion naturally occurring on this subject that it is the folly and weakness of some women that lays them open to such artifices and if they are entrapped it is in a snare of their own contriving and with respect to spatter however useful or entertaining a man may render himself to his aequaintance and have his faluts thus overlooked for a time there is no sensible man but sees throught the deceptions of a knave and will in the end set his face against him  end of the second volume
